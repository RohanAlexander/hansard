Question not answered. directed to the Minister for Territories. As rumours are current to the effect that the Minister bas forbidden natives in Papua and New Guinea to sell their land for the purposes of settlement by Australians, and as those rumours have caused some concern, can the Minister inform me of the actual position? wbich the honourable member has referred are quite incorrect. No prohibition of any kind has been placed on tbe selling, by the natives, of their land to the be see to it that letters written by the Administration. The policy in relation to the acquisition of land from the natives is, first, that the native himself must be willing to sell. We do not wish to compel natives to part with tbeir land. Secondly, tbe Administration itself makes a judgment as to whether the natives need the land for their future or prospective requirements. Tbe Administration must be careful to ensure that the natives are not left in the position of being landless people. If the native is willing to sell, and if, in our judgment, the land is not needed for the future or prospective needs of the native group, the acquisition of tbe land proceeds. In fact, the acquisition of land from natives under these circumstances is continuing, and it is being made available, through the Department of Lands in the Territory, to Australian settlers. pointed out to the Minister for Territories that accommodation provided for public servants and their families at Port Moresby was so unsuitable that their quarters were known as "" the stables"". As, on that occasion, he informed me that he would bave an investigation made with a view to ascertaining whether that description was justified, and, if it were, improving tbe accommodation, has he yet done anything in the matter? gentleman, I am sure, will have noticed in the Estimates which were recently before the Parliament the increased financial provision that was made for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.

Will bereaved relatives receive prompt attention and reply by the Administration of the Territory? Finally, will he consider the recommendation of awards for valour to be granted posthumously to the gallant patrol officers who were killed in sucb dire circumstances? of the three questions, the answer is, "" Yes "". I will give consideration to that matter and call for reports on it. On the second question, I shall be grateful if the honourable member will let me have details of any delay of particular correspondence, with the dates of the letters written, so that I can investigate them.

Does the Minister's statementmean that he now approves of alcohol being taken on military manceuvres ? Has he taken any disciplinary action against the persons who wilfully told him untruths about this matter? Will he say what inquiries were made to substantiate the information given to him that the vehicles were not overloaded, that they were properly serviced and that rockets were not fired by the officer-in-charge? Were those statements made on oath? If not, why bave the unsworn statements of persons been accepted against the sworn declaration of a national service trainee? Further, in view of the fact that a trainee was lost and his body has not been found, will the Minister say what action tbe Army bas taken to recover the vehicle in which the trainee was travelling, wbich could reveal whether the lost trainee was still aboard and whether the sworn 'statement of another trainee was correct or otherwise ? Or is the Ministhe notice-paper in relation to the depoter afraid that the recovery of the vehicle would lead to at least some of the truth being revealed? questions very briefly. I have issued emphatic instructions that no alcohol is to be taken on any military manceuvres. Tbe statement that I have made to the honourable gentleman is complete, and I have nothing to add to it. External Affairs aware that a recent Russian trade mission to Japan obtained a large order for Russian coal and also agreed to indemnify Japanese importers for losses on previous supplies of poorquality coal? Does this approach indicate an attempt to foster Soviet-Japanese goodwill through trade which could only be to the detriment of the western democracies ? have been made by both the Soviet Government and the Communist Chinese Government, by way of approach to the Japanese Government, to, as tbey are pleased to call it, normalize trade between Japan on the one hand and Russia and Communist China on tbe other band. I understand that Japanese firms have entered into contracts to buy a few tens of thousands of tons of Russian coal, and 1 believe tbere is an even wider proposal for some millions of dollars worth of barter trade between Russia and Japan. We bave not any detailed information on these points, but there is clearly a move on the part of international communism to regain Japanese trade. So far, 1 have the impression that the Japanese Government has been rather cool towards these advances by the Communists, but it is a matter that the Government certainly will watch. I appreciate the bonorable gentleman's concern with it. directed to the Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister acting for the Treasurer. In view of the fact that, at the present time, there are two questions on sits by the trading banks in the special account of the Commonwealth Bank, and in view of the fact that two very important articles have appeared in the daily press attacking the Commonwealth Bank for its actions in relation to this account, will the right honourable gentleman try to answer the two questions as soon as possible ? tion to tbe Minister for Defence Production.

Is the proposal supported? Eight honourable mernbers liaving risen in support of the proposal, of the reasons given by tbe present Government parties in 1949 and 1951 for their election to office was their promise to put value back into tbe £1 and to reduce the cost of living. The joint policy speech of those parties as printed in 1949, and reaffirmed in 1951, contained this statement on the important problems of prices and tbe cost of livingWe want to help the States, and much mure importantly, the people. While encouraging production to the full, we shall hold ourselves ready to pay price subrespect of items affecting the cost of living of basic wage earners. While there remains a case for artificial price control, that is while shortages continue, we shall, instead of standing back and hoping for their failure, co-operate with the States and do all in our power to make their price control effective. The contention of the Opposition is that since 1949, when this Government was returned to office, there has been no cooperation by the Commonwealth with the States to keep the prices down. This Government has reduced by millions of pounds the subsidies paid on basic comthe basic wage as an indicator, we see cent, since this Government came into power.

65,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [11.8],"On e1948-49, under the Chifley Labour Government, £23,000,000 was paid in subsidies on various commodities. At that time, £23,000,000 was worth considerably more than it is now, because under this Government tbe purchasing-power of the Australian £1 has declined considerably. According to the latest figures available, this year the Commonwealth will pay only a fraction over £21,000,000 in subsidies on basic commodities. Far from increasing the subsidies paid on items that effect the cost of living, the Government has reduced expenditure on subsidies by £2,000,000, compared witb the 1948-49 figure, but, as the purchasingpower of the £1 has fallen so much since then, the actual reduction is considerably greater than that figure indicates. It is common knowledge that to-day the Australian £1 is worth only 50 per cent, of the Chifley £1 of 1949. The Opposition contends that £21,000,000 is but a fraction of the expenditure on subidies that would be required to keep the cost of living in this country at a reasonable level. In 1949, the Chifley Government, by munity drink tea regularly. It is in every its policy of controlling prices, mainsense one of the most vital items in tained at a reasonable level the prices the family budget, and one of the most of basic commodities such as butter, tea, necessary commodities in every Aussugar and eggs. Let us compare tbe tralian home. Yet the Government has prices of those commodities while the refused to co-operate with the States Chifley Government was in power with to keep the price of tea down, and has the prices now. In 1949, butter sold for allowed it to go up to 7s. 6d. per lb. 2s. 2d. per lb., but under this AdministraI n 1948-49, under the Chifley Labour tion the price bas risen by about 100 Government, £4,667,000 was paid as a per cent.

In 1949, tea cost 2s. 9d. per lb., but at 2s. 9d. per lb., but in this year, to-day, under tbe administration of a despite the reduced purchasing power of government pledged to reduce the cost the £1, the subsidy will be only of basic commodities, it costs 7s. 6d. per £4,500,000.

The least 100 per cent, since this Government took that this Government could do would be oflice. If a man goes shopping to-day to increase the subsidy in order to keep for the ordinary basic needs of his the price of tea within the reach of family, all that he will get for £1 is 1 lb. ordinary citizens. I suggest that the of butter, 1 lb. of tea, a dozen eggs and, if he is lucky, 1 lb. of steak. TJnder this Government, wbich is pledged to reduce the cost of living, all that the people can buy for £1 are some butter, tea, steak and eggs, but in 1949 those things cost only a fraction of £1. The Government stated recently that the price of tea had risen because of the increased cost of bringing it to Australia. I agree that tea is an imported commodity, but I point out that, under the Chifley Labour Government, tea was subsidized and the price paid by Australian consumers was maintained at the level of 2s. 9d. per lb., whereas to-day, under a Government pledged to increase subsidies on basic commodities in order to keep the cost of living down, it has gone up to 7s. 6d. Let us not forget that the States bave asked the Commonwealth to increase tbe subsidy on this important item in the family budget. Tea is more bhan a drink; it is a national necessity. I suppose it is tbe most popular beverage in this nation. Both the poorest and the wealthiest sections of the Australian comGovernment's refusal to increase the subsidy represents a complete repudiation of the pledges on -which it was elected. In 1949, tbe present Government parties made precise promises on these matters to the people, and in 1951 they made no further promises but asked only for an opportunity to give effect to tbe pledges they had given in 1949. To-day, the Government stands condemned from one end of the country to the other as a government that has repudiated its pledges. Althoughi t has pegged wages and margins and generally clamped down on the workers, the cost of living is going up and the pegged wages are becoming worth less and less. At present, the Government is paying an annual subsidy of about £15,000,000 on dairy products. In 1948-49, the dairying industry received a subsidy of £4,500,000 from the Chifley Government, and butter cost 2s. 2d. per lb. This year, the subsidy is about £15,000,000, or approximately three times as great as that paid by the Chifley Government, yet the price of butter has increased by over 100 per cent. In those circumstances, is there any wonder that to-day people throughout Australia, especially the poorer sections of the community, have turned to margarine in. order to have something to put on their bread ? They cannot afford to buy butter, and they are using a cheaper substitute. A government elected on a policy of reducing tbe cost of living should give effect to a policy that would reduce the cost of essential commodities. I agree that probably the payment of subsidies is not the best method of prices control but, in view of the fact that tbere are approximately 600,000 pensioners in Australia, the Government has a responsibility at least to subsidize essential foodfor tea, and when the prices of brandy, stuffs, so that people in the lower wage groups can afford to buy them. Doubtless the Government will say it is letting prices find their own level and that competition will tend to reduce the cost of living, but the fact is that, despite competition, prices bave gone higher and higher. The Chifley Government, by controlling the economy, not only ensured that people engaged in primary industries and other industries received a fair return for tbeir labour, but also, by tbe payment of subsidies, mainitr. Daly. tained prices at a level that met with general approval. What justification can there be for the action of this Government in allowing the price of eggs, tea, sugar and other commodities to rise, when wages have been pegged ? Throughout the world, the financial and economic policy of the Government is suspect. It has been said that the man who owns the horse that won the last Melbourne Cup was considering a name for the horse when he came to Australia. He is a student of economics, so he called the horse Eising East, after the Australian economy. That is an indication of what the New Zealand people think about prices here. In his budget speech, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden) contrasted the effect of tbe Government's taxation proposals with that of the New Zealand proposals, and stated that taxes in Australia were lower than those of that country and other countries. In New Zealand, butter sells to-day at 2s. per lb. A Liberal government in that country is subsidizing the production of that commodity so that sections of the community that could not afford to pay a higher price shall be able to buy it. Why will t h i j Government not adopt a similar policy to reduce the cost of living, and to reduce the price of butter to a level that the . average family man could afford to pay? Pensions are pegged for approximately twelve months at least, to £3 10s. a week, yet pensioners have been required to meet an exorbitant increase of the price of tea since the present Government assumed office. Just imagine a pensioner havingto pay 7 s. 6d. for a pound of tea! Isi t any wonder that pensioners are astounded when they are asked to pay that price spirits and otber commodities, are reduced as a result of a reduction of excise charges ? Is it any wonder that the poorer sections of the community are at a loss to understand why huge tax remissions are given to companies, when that money might well be directed towards providingsubsidies on the basic commodities to> which I have referred so that pensioners, wage-earners and others may buy them at a reasonable price? The Governmentshould face up to its responsibilities. Not only is it imposing great hardship on those sections of the community that work for a living, and which are dependent upon social services benefits, but it is also it to be raised by the Deputy Leader of pursuing a policy that is pricing the primary producers out of their market. I invite honourable members to consider also the prices of suits, clothing, shoes and articles that are required for the bome. I defy any supporter of the Government to state that those prices have been reduced one iota as a result of the policy that bas been adopted by this Government. To the contrary, because of the failure of the Government to subsidize prices and to stabilize the economy as promised, they have been increased. Doubtless, other honourable members will deal with the matter at greater length. I conclude by stating that the Government's incapacity to deal with the question of prices has caused untold hardship in our time, and that its policy is in contrast with the just policy that was pursued by the Chifley Government. Since 1949, the Government has destroyed the stability that had been achieved. The policy to which it is giving effect is throwing to the wolves, as it were-to the profiteers and exploiters-thousand s upon thousands of Australians who are entitled to greater justice. I am pleased to have had the opportunity of speaking in sunoort of the matter that has been raised. The Government deserves to be condemned for its oolicy, and I join with other Opposition members in placing on record disgust at its failure to face up to this problem, and to continue the policy that was enunciated by Labour in days gone by, which meant justice and security for all sections of tbe Australian people. Vice-President of the Executive Council goes by the board. It is not substantiated and Minister for Defence Production) by facts. The honourable member referred [11.23] I am rising fast on this matter to the question of tea. I propose to deal to oppose the statements of the honourable with that matter, because it is important. member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), I sball leave it to my colleagues to deal because the master has not proven anywith other matters that come under tbeir thing on this occasion! Let me deal with control. If the facts associated with the one or two points to illustrate what I increase of the price of tea are examined, mean. The House is aware of the fact it will be observed that no genuine reason that the degree of urgency of a matter exists for an attack upon the Governraised for discussion in this way is ment. Those facts have been explained indicated by the status of the honourable to the House time after time. The cost member who raises it. If the matter is of tea to the Australian public is lower one of extreme urgency and importance,, than anywhere else in the world. Why? it is customary for it to be raised by It is because Australia is the only country the Leader of the Opposition. If it is oneof lesser importance, it is customary for the Opposition. If the matter is of still less importance, it is usually raised by a member of the Opposition executive,, but when it is a matter of no importance at all, it is usually raised by a backbencher, in this case by the whip of the party. That is the value that the Opposition ascribes to this matter. Why? It is for the very simple reason, as honourable members know, that this Government has no control over prices, that that control is vested in the States. The Opposition has raised this matter purely in a blatant political attempt to gain some kudos. The honourable member for Grayndler referred to the price of eggs. The Commonwealth has no say whatever in the fixation of the domestic price of eggs. Indeed, the State prices commissioners have stepped completely out of the field in relation to eggs, and they have left it to the State egg boards to determine the price. Therefore, it can be seen just how blatant has been the attempt of the Opposition to gain political capital out of this matter. I could quite understand it, because it was made by a group that could not be expected to bave any knowledge of these matters. I invite honourable members to examine the basis upon which the cost of living is determined. TheC series index is the basis upon wbich increases or decreases of the basic wage are determined. As between September, 1952, and now, the index, which covers all basic commodities, is 17 points lower. The claim that prices, or the standard of living have increased,",19,Prices Control
66,Sir Eric Harrison (Wentworth,"that is buying tea on a Government basis, and which is subsidizing it to keep the price down. TJnder tbe present system, the standard of quality is maintained. Australia is the only country in the world that maintains a standard quality for tea. In fact, the standard is much higher to-day tban it was in pre-war days, when there was no government buying of tea, and when there was a greater number of cheap brands of tea on the market. The Tea Importation Board buys at public auction in tea-producing countries, and the price is determined at the auction. realize that the Government has some knowledge of these matters as a result of experience gained at wool auctions. We would certainly object if an attempt were made to reduce the price of wool. Tbe Government has no control over the price, which is determined by competitive bidding. The board invoices tbe tea to the merchants at a price per lb. which is less than tbe landed cost, and the losses are recouped by the subsidy that is paid by the Government. When the budget was introduced, the proposed subsidy was £4,500,000. It has since been increased to £5,500,000, because the Government has sought to maintain a standard price for tea, the cost of which on the world markets bas increased rapidly. The Government pays a subsidy which, in effect, reduces the price to the consumer by approximately ls. 6d. per lb. Let me give the House some indication of the fluctuations that have occurred in the price of tea. At the 30th June, the average landed cost was 4s. 10-|d. per lb., but the landed cost of recent purchases was Ts. 7d. per lb. The honourable member for Grayndler made charges of exploitation, so let us consider tbe price of tea in this country during the last two years. Tea prices have risen throughout the world, and in tbe last six months they have increased until they are now at the highest point in the history of the world. In fact, they have increased so greatly that the capital outlay involved in purchasing tea would not permit tea-packers to hold large stocks. Therefore, we can see how unfounded is the suggestion of the OpposiStr Erio Harrison. tion that tea merchants are trying to hold up the market so that they may make greater profits. What has caused the present high price of tea? It appears that two major factors are involved. The first . is a considerable increase of the world tea consumption, notably in tbe United States of America; which is normally a coffee-drinking nation; the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada and Egypt. In the nine months of 1954 United States tea imports increased by more than 30 per cent. The second major factor in high tea prices is that floods in Assam, in Honourable members must India, prevented supplies of tea from that source from reaching auction centres. The demand on the small available stocks consequently brought the price of tea up to a record level. A world shortage of tea occurred, and bidding for tea at auction reached fantastic proportions. Indeed, the prices bid for tea reached heights that had never been known before in the history of the world. In the United States tea imports for tbe first nine months of 1954 increased by more than 30 per cent., and the United Kingdom consumption of tea has increased by 1 lb. a bead of tbe population during the last twelve months. When we realize that the United Kingdom consumes half the world's tea production, that is, 500,000,000 lb. a year, we have some indication of the reason why prices have rocketed. Tea is being consumed in greater quantities in most countries of the world, and so when a shortage occurs because of an "" aot of God "", prices automatically increase in the purchasing countries. Let us now consider the average price of tea in importing countries. People in the United Kingdom are paying 9s. 2d. Australian per lb. In South Africa they are paying l is . 6d. per lb., and in New Zealand 9s. 3d. per lb., which price is expected to increase shortly by another ls. per lb. In New Soutb Wales we are paying 7s. 5d. per lb. In Queensland the price is 7s. 4d. per lb. In other States prices are comparable with those I have stated. Tea is cheaper in Australia tban in any other part of the world. Australia has imported 60,000,000 lb. of tea a year in tbe past, and our consumption is about 6$ lb. a bead per annum. Tbe latest increase of the price of tea is Is. 7d. per lb., so that the increased cost to the tea-drinker in Australia is 10s. 3d. we have no control. He said that a year, or 2£d. a week. That will give honourable members some indication of the value of the observations that were made by the honourable member for Grayndler wbo has attempted to state a case on prices in this country. Tea is still the cheapest drink available in Australia, and its price has increased less than that of any other beverage. I have already dealt with the price indexes to show that instead of there being an increase of the cost of living since 1952, the index figures have declined Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), or any execuby seventeen points. Since September, 1953, the position has remained almost static. Therefore, tbe whole case set out by the honourable member must collapse. When we also remember that the Commonwealth has no control over prices, and that such control is purely a State function, we realize further that the honourable member has no case at all against this Government. The honourable member mentioned eggs, but I remind him that the State prices authorities have left the control of egg prices to the various boards that have been established in the States to deal with eggs. That further indicates how much value there is in the honourable member's argument. Opposition has conveniently overlooked the fact that the policies of the Menzies Government have brought about the stability that I bave already mentioned in my speech. Indeed, the Menzies Government has achieved the objective, that it set out to achieve when it first came to office, to arrest the upward trend of prices which was such a feature under the last Labour Administration. When we assumed office we found that made to tbe Australian people in 1949 the retail prices of goods in Australia had by the Government parties was to restore increased by more than 10 per cent., and value to the £A1. The Government were continuing rapidly to increase. One parties promised that they would do that of the reasons why we had to adopt such by bringing about a reduction of the cost stringent budgetary action in 1952 was to of living in this country. The Viceprevent inflation from becoming unconPresident of the Executive Council has trollable in this eountry. We achieved our now asked what the Government can do objective, and that has been clearly indiabout prices, because it has no power to cated by the quarterly figures that have control prices. I remind him that the been made available to the House. When Australian Government had no power to the honourable member spoke in general control prices in 1949, but that that did terms about prices, he sought to make some party political advantage out of certain conditions over which the Government had provided £2,000,000 less in this year's budget for subsidies, but he omitted to mention that we have increased our subsidies by £1,000,000 since tbe budget ""was introduced. Again, the charges of the honourable member cannot stand up to examination. The Opposition, realizing that on prices it has no case whatever against tbe Government, failed to give tbe conduct of this debate to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for tive members of the Opposition, and handed it over to one of its back-benchers, hoping that he might be able to get some party political capital out of it. I sball leave it to the representatives of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to deal with tbe other matter the honourable member bas raised, and I am perfectly certain that the case presented against the Government by tbe Opposition will collapse. Over a number of years, honourable members have heard some amazing speeches from the Vice-President of the Executive The Council( Sir Eric Harrison), but we have never heard anything more astounding than the speech that he has just delivered. He has said that the Government had achieved its objectives; but let us examine those declared objectives. I know that within the limited time at my disposal I cannot deal witb all the statements that have been made from time to time, by members of tbe Government, but it must be clear in the memory of every citizen in this country that the promise",22,Prices Control
67,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.39],"not prevent the Governnient parties from making the promise to the people that, if elected to office, they would bring about a reduction of tbe cost of living. Now let us examine whether there is any basis for the claim of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the Government has achieved its objectives. During the last general election campaign, the Leader of the Opposition stated that the f l of 1949 was then worth only Ss. That statement was immediately contradicted by Government speakers, and also by Mr W. J. Jackson, who is the financial editor of the Sydney Daily Telegraph. Mr Jackson saidThe £1 oi 1949 is not worth Ss. as claimed by the Leader of the Opposition. It is now actually worth lis. 8d. That statement was made by one of the defenders of the Government, yet honourable members opposite have tbe audacity to say that the Government has achieved its objective. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has claimed that the Government has no responsibility for the price of tea, which is entirely a matter for the States. I remind him that the telegram sent by the Commonwealth authorities to the tea wholesalers who obtained their supplies from the Tea Import Board contained the following words:Note that all tea leaving your possession on tively by the State authorities. The antiand after Tuesday 19th must be accounted for to board at increased price irrespective of trol. They wished to destroy prices conprices charged by you to customers. This Government, in effect, demanded that wholesalers, with supplies of tea on hand which they had purchased at the old price, were to dispose of the tea to the Australian people at the higher price. So the claim that the Government is protecting the Australian consumers of tea is so much eyewash. Let the Vice President of the Executive Council or any other Government supporter state if it is not a fact that the State Ministers in charge of prices control, including the anti-Labour Minister in Soutb Australia, have agreed unanimously that the price of tea should be kept at the old level. Tbe South Australian Premier, Mr Playford, who is not a member of the Labour party, asked tbe Prime MinisMr Ward. ter to raise the subsidy on tea to the level that obtained just before the last general election. It is important to remember that statement. Before the last general election, we heard nothing about the proposal of the Government to reduce subsidies. A reduction of subsidies would increase the prices of tea and other commodities, but that intention was not made known until after the election. As soon as the election was out of the way, the Government reduced subsidies and thereby forced up tbe prices of tea and other commodities. I suggest to the Government that it should take tlie advice of the anti-Labour Premier of South Australia, if it is not prepared to take any notice of the other State Premiers and Ministers in charge of prices control. The Prime Minister has stated that tea is still the cheapest beverage. That is not the point. The important question is whether tea is now beyond the reach of a very deserving section of this community. Of what use is it for Government members now to claim that tbe Commonwealth has no .power to control prices? In 1948, the anti-Labour parties opposed the referendum when the people were asked to clothe this Parliament with the power to control prices. The arguments which the anti-Labour parties used on that occasion were to the effect that such powers could be exercised more effecLabour parties did not want prices control. I well recollect a debate on prices control in this House on the 27th November, 1947, when the present Prime Minister made the following statement:As a result of judicial decision, the power to control prices will include the power tn control profits. The right honourable gentleman was afraid of that power. He knew that tbe proper exercise of prices control by a Labour government would affect the profits of those people who contributed to the campaign funds of the anti-Labour parties. That was all that the anti-Labour parties were concerned about. Let us examine the present position. Honourable gentlemen opposite claim that the Government has stabilized prices. Every housewife knows that statement to be completely untrue, and that the prices of various commodities are still rising. It is perfectly true that prices have not been rising so rapidly in recent times as formerly, and I shall examine the reason. This Government can claim no credit for it. The reason is that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, at the instance of this Governinent, has pegged the basic wage, and refuses to -give to the workers in industry the margins to which they are entitled. I shall examine the situation briefly, and, in doing so, I shall take Wesexercised unless it is centred in tbe Comtern Australia for purposes of illustration. monwealth authority. I am perfectly In tbe thirteen months since wages were pegged in that State, the cost of living has to reject the prices referendum in 1948 risen by 19s. l i d . a week. That position is admitted by the court itself, and, conseto-day. quently, the slowing down of. price increases for which the Government claims credit has actually been accomplished by sacrificing the workers of Australia and compelling them to accept a reduced living standard. I turn to one specific class of people to whom the honourable member for Grayndler has referred, namely, the pensioners. Will any reasonable member on the Government side tell me he believes that the price of tea is not now beyond the reach of the pensioners? When we speak of the pensioners, it is of no use to talk about tbeir right to have an income of up to £3 10s. a week in addition to the pension, because the official figures disclose that 73.7 per cent, of the age pensioners, 81.4 per cent, of the invalid pensensible approach to the problem. Why sioners and 81.4 per cent, of persons in receipt of widows pensions have no other income. We should never forget that this deserving section of tbe community consists of the pioneers and the workers who have built up our economy and made the country what it is to-day. Government members state that tea is the cheapest beverage in the world. Is it the cheapest beverage in the world to pensioners who have £3 10s. a week on which to exist? If a pensioner were to live rent free, and if he had no costs to meet for entertainment and clothing, and spent the entire £3 10s. a week upon the purchase of the necessaries of life, he would be able to allow 3s. 4d. only for each meal. he would have three meals a day like every other member of the Australian community. Who believes that 3s. 4d. is sufficient to provide an Australian citizen with a meal? Yet a pensioner could allow no more than that sum for each meal, assuming that he spent the entire £3 10s. a week on the purchase of the necessaries of life. Therefore, it must be obvious that the Government is apologizing for its failure to honour its pre-election promises to tbe Australian community. We have always believed that effective prices control cannot be satisfied that the people who were induced would willingly reverse that decision I shall now refer briefly to the high price of meat. If it were not for the fact that tbe organized workers of this country had more concern than the Government for those citizens in the lower income group in their struggle for existence, their difficulties would be much greater even than they are to-day. When meat prices sky-rocketted much beyond the cost of production, the people who threatened to take effective action were not tbe Australian Government, which one would expect to protect Australian consumers, but the much maligned waterside workers. They declared that they would discontinue the loading of meat for export until the requirements of the Australian consumers were met. I consider that was a reasonable and should the Australian people be exploited in the purchase of food produced in this country, and pay much higher prices than are absolutely necessary? able member's time has expired. Minister for Defence) The House has heard a typical speech by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward).

69,Sir Philip Mcbride (Wakefield,"look back into tbe dim past for any of the glories which are usually attributed to it. The Labour party continually harps on the dim, by-gone past and hates to be brought up to date or to realize the position in wbich it is placed to-day. Honourable members opposite cannot get past 1949. the year in which the people decided, very definitely, that they wanted no more of Labour rule in this country. And, on two occasions since, the people have fully endorsed the policies and administration of this Government. If honourable members opposite have any doubt about tbe opinion of the Australian people of their party, an election, if it were held at present, would prove all too clearly where they stand in the eyes of the community. We have heard a good deal not only in this House to-day but also over a period about the alleged poverty of the workers. But it is beyond dispute that the people of Australia have never enjoyed a period of prosperity equal to that which they have experienced since the Menzies Government has been in office. I do not ask the House merely to take my word in that respect. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) pointed out, the Statistician's figures months. Sir PHILIP MoBEIDE -The figures are worth repeating. that during tbe last two years the prices that have occurred have been Australian economy has been stabilized mainly for beef.

He got all the the wage-earners. The fact is that while propaganda he wanted by making tbe Menzies Government has been in that statement but he never intended to office conditions of employment bave take such action. In any event, no beef improved and wages have increased to a of a quality suitable for consumption in greater degree than they did during any New South Wales is being exported at the period in which Labour was in office. moment from that State. To those honourable members wbo are always crying wolf and poverty, I point load it. out that whereas in 1952, the basic wage was £10 16s., it is now £11 16s. a week planation of that fact is that as a result although, as the Statistician's figures show, during that period the cost of living index varied by only 17 points. That means that during that period real wages have increased to a greater degree than nominal wages would indicate. After all, at present, the basic wage earner is pracThat was tically a myth in this country, because there are very few adults whose wages do not exceed the basic wage. In 1952, when the basic wage was £10 16s. a week the average earnings of male workers was £13.65 a week, but, to-day, when tbe basic wage is £1116s. a week, the average earnings of male workers is £15.69 a week. Those figures show conclusively that despite the cries of poverty from honourable members opposite and tbeir forecast that unemployment would result from the Government's policy, full employment actually exists in this country at present and the workers are receiving rates of wages in excess of any that they have received previously. Much has been said about the prices of commodities, particularly the price of meat. It is true that, at present, the price of meat in New South Wales is higher than it has been for many years; but it is also true that until this month highquality meat was available in Sydney at prices comparable with those ruling at the corresponding period of last year. it?

Sir PHILIP MoBEIDE -Owing to drought conditions, the price of meat has increased in New South Wales; but, at the same time, the Statistician's figures show that tbe prices of a wide range of basic commodities remain stable and that, in relation to the real money that is now being received by tbe wage earners, they are actually cheaper than were the prices of similar commodities at the corresponding period last year. The Opposition is straining at the leash in order to divert public attention from the disputation and confusion that is occurring in its ranks. Honourable members opposite are continually going into one conference after another. Only a few days ago, we read in the press that after the executive of the Opposition came to a certain decision in relation to a matter before the House, the rank-and-file members of the party tersely told it where it got off. Having regard to the confusion that now exists in the ranks of honourable members opposite, it is only natural that they should want to divert public attention from their disunity, and, for that purpose, they have in a futile fashion raised this matter. However, none of them have shown that this Government has fallen down in even one particular in discharging its obligations to the community. Indeed, it has been shown that the difficulties that confront the Government are attributable entirely to actions on the part of State governments. ter's time has expired. pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this very important debate. I was astonished to bear some of the remarks that were made by the Minister, for Defence( Sir Philip McBride). However, one would not expect him to have much sympathy with the ordinary people. He is a director of Elder Smith and Company Limited, and is reputed to be a millionaire. Consequently, be would not this matter. Whilst Government supporters continually claim credit for the country's present prosperity, they support a proposal that will reduce tbe purchasing power of the community and, at the same time, they applaud the pegging of wages and also the pegging of pensions and other social services benefits. Eor over 30 years the trade unions have accepted and subscribed to the principle that the basic wage sbould rise and fall in accordance with the cost of living. They did not agree that the standard was fair and reasonable, but they had to accept it. They adopted the principle that the wage should fluctuate from quarter to quarter in accordance with cost of living variations because they wanted to know that the amount in the pay envelope of a worker on the minimum wage at any period would purchase the same quantity of goods as it had purchased in the previous quarter and would be sufficient for the same purpose in the succeeding quarter. As I have said, the trade unions did not accept the standard fixed for the basic wage, and, therefore, they made representations to successive governments with the object of having the regimen altered. They wanted to have the items varied and to have the Commonwealth Statistician's figures checked in order to determine whether the sources from which the information was obtained were reliable. Unfortunately, their representations were unsuccessful. The trade union movement believes, first, that there should be a "" needs"" basic wage which rises and falls in accordance with the cost of living, and, secondly, that there should be an addition to that wage which will allow the worker to enjoy a share of the increased prosperity and productivity of the country. But what is happening now? The cost of living adjustments of the basic wage were thrown overboard by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in September of last year. That simply means, as other members of the Opposition have pointed out, that, as the cost of living increases, the purchasing power of the minimum working wage is continually being reduced.",27,Prices Control

75,Mr Webb (Swan) [11.59],"I amThis Government stands condemned because it has allowed that situation to arise. It should not have allowed the basic wage to he pegged, particularly at this period of our economic history when huge profits are being made by private companies. Other honourable members have already referred to figures which show that General Motors-Holdens Limited made a profit last year of over £7,000,000. I have no doubt that much of that profit was made at the expense of the workers employed by the company. In fact, the newspapers reported that, if the company had wanted to make the economy of the country more stable, it could have done so by reducing the cost of each motor car that it sold during the year by £160 and it would still have made a substantial profit on its operations. the honourable member's home State of Western Australia has just pegged wages in that State. honourable gentleman later. He does not know very much about this subject, so I shall explain the situation to him. The decision by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court was applauded by the Government because the court, when it pegged the basic wage, actually put into effect the policy of the Government, which was indicated by the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) earlier this morning when he claimed that the Government's policy had brought about stability. Surely, that was an admission that this Government was in league with tbe court when it pegged the basic wage. The Vice-President of the Executive Council also said that prices had become stable during the last twelve months, and he cited the index figures for September, 1952, and September, 1954. I shall produce figures which indicate that tbe price situation is not nearly so stable prices just as effectively as the Commonor so sound as tbe right honourable gentlewealth, but their statements were clearly man would have us believe. These figures are publisbed in the World Economic Report 1952-53, produced by the United Nations Department Affairs. They were not released until June last, which indicates that the report is the latest available. The report includes, at page 30, a table wbich sbows the unit values of the cost of living and of the real wage rates in various countries. The table uses the figure 100 for 1950 as tbe base. Australia's cost-of-living index, with the 1950 base of 100, was 121 in 1951, 141 in 1952 and 14S in 1953. Real wage rates were represented by an index of 102 for 1951, 103 for 1952, and 103 for 1953. Those figures show that, while the cost of living in Australia rose by 48 points, real wage rates, which represent the true purchasing-power of the workers' incomes, rose by only 3' points. I bave compared those figures with the indexes for other countries. Eor instance, the table shows that the cost of living in Canada was represented by an index figure of 110 in 1951, 113 in 1952 and 112 in 1953, whereas real wage rates rose from 100 in 1951 to 107 in 1952 and 113 in 1953. In fact, the table proves that the cost of living rose more rapidly in Australia than in any other country mentioned. Australians can take cold comfort from the fact that, according to those statistics, their cost of living has risen by 48 points since shortly after this Government came into power, whereas the increase bas been only 12 points in Canada, 29 in France, 8 in West Germany, 17 in Italy and 11 in the United States of America. Those facts indicate that the economy of this country became completely out of hand after the present Government came to office. In fact, the Government parties were responsible in the first place for this unhappy development because, in 1948, when we had a stable economy, their representatives urged the people to vote "" No"" when the Chifley Government wanted to bave the Constitution altered so that the Commonwealth could continue to exercise control over prices. They said that the States could control proved to be fallacious shortly afterwards when the prices control system collapsed.

The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), for example, wholeheartedly supports the action by the Waterside Workers Eederation. He is not trying to persuade the federation to put its men back on tbe job again. The strike has begun because the Government proposes to deal with a situation on the waterfront which bas bad an unfavorable impact on our cost structure. The Government wants to stabilize the waterfront situation, but it has not received any assistance in the matter from the Opposition. All that we have heard on the subject from honourable members opposite has been direct criticism of tbe Government's policy by the honourable member for East Sydney and declared support of the stand taken by the Waterside Workers Federation.

The honourable member for Grayndler spoke at some length about the higb price of butter. It is interesting to recall that last year and the year before, the honourable member was one of the members of the Opposition who complained bitterly because the price of butter was not increased.

This year, the subsidy on dairy products will be about £15,600,000. So tlie story told to-day by the honourable member was entirely without foundation. He referred also to the price of eggs. I point out to him that egg prices are fixed by State authorities, not by the Commonwealth. Usually, the price of eggs is determined by tbe State egg boards. Despite that fact, the honourable member tried to cast upon this Government some blame for tbe price of eggs. The honourable member for East Sydney referred to tbe price of meat in New South Wales and to certain action proposed by the waterside workers of that State to prevent the export of meat. As the Minister for Defence has explained, there was virtually no locally consumable meat to export in any case. That condition of affairs was caused by drought conditions. volume of meat exports from New South Wales is very small, compared with the exports of other States. That brings me to a very important point. Through the press, a Minister in the New South Wales Government proposed an export ban on meat, but it appears that his courage failed him and that he did not refer the matter to the Commonwealth. If an export ban had been imposed, it would not bave affected New South Wales, but it would have had a very adverse effect on other meat exporting States. able gentleman's time has expired.

Minister) [12.27] I move That the bill be now read a second time. Tbe bill contains proposals for assisting tbe gold-mining industry of Australia and tbe Territories of Papua and New Guinea. They have been made, after careful investigation, more liberal than those announced in my policy speech. The importance of the gold-mining industry to Australia needs little emphasis. The annual value of gold output is in the region of £17,000,000. Not only does the industry make a significant contribution to the national income, but it produces a commodity which has a direct effect on the balance of payments. Except for a minor quantity of gold which is used for industrial purposes, all the gold produced in Australia and the territories represents an addition, in one form or another, to our international reserves. Moreover, there are large areas in Australia, particularly in Western Australia, which are almost entirely dependent on gold-mining. Any significant decline in gold-mining activity could lead to the depopulation of these areas and a widespread loss of housing and other utilities which have been developed over the years in the areas concerned. The Government believes that for a number of reasons it would not be in the national interest for these areas to languish. It is a peculiar feature of gold that, because its main use lies in the effecting of monetary settlements between nations, its price is not determined primarily by the market considerations that influence the price of other commodities in international, trade. The Australian Government has consistently supported moves for an increase in the official world price of gold, and will continue to do so. Unfortunately, however, these efforts have proved of no avail up to date, and the problems at present confronting the goldmining industry can be considered only on the basis of the world price now ruling. Except for a minor adjustment of 2s. 8d. an ounce last May, the Commonwealth Bank's buying price of gold, which must necessarily be related to tbe official world and price, has remained unchanged since September, 1949. Since then, of course, there has been a substantial increase of the general cost level in Australia as well as in other countries, and this increase in costs is pressing very hard on sections of the gold-mining industry. In fact, some of the largest mines are currently operating at a loss. In 1952 and 1953, the gold-mining industry obtained relief from the pressure of increased costs by being able to make sales on overseas premium markets at prices in excess of the official price. The additional return to the industry from premium sales in those years amounted to approximately £1,800,000. The price of gold on overseas premium markets slumped sharply in the latter part of 1953, and it has since been possible for the industry to make only odd sales at prices very little above the official price. The virtual disappearance of premium prices on overseas markets has had, therefore, an adverse effect on the financial position of the industry. I come now to an explanation of the nature of the assistance to the industry that is proposed in the bill. Except in the case of small producers, with whom I shall deal later, the proposal is to pay a subsidy which varies according to the particular mine's costs of producing gold. The formula for determining the amount of subsidy payable in a year on each ounce of fine gold produced is three-quarters of the excess of average cost of production an ounce over £13 10s. I point out to honourable members who are interested in this matter that the proposal that was outlined in my policy speech during the last general election campaign provided for three-quarters of the cost over £14 10s., so the present proposal is much more advantageous. The maximum rate of subsidy which may be paid is £2 an ounce; tbe election proposal was 30s. an ounce. I shall give one or two examples of the working of the formula. To begin with, a mine whose cost of production is less than £13 10s. an ounce will not qualify for subsidy. Since tbe official price of gold is £15 12s. 6d. an ounce,",32,Assistance Bill 1954
91,"Bill Presented By Mr Menzies,",,33,Second Reading
92,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Primesuch a mine would be making a profit of at least £2 2s. 6d. an ounce, and it could not reasonably be regarded as needing assistance. A mine with a cost of production of £15 an ounce will receive a subsidy of £1 2s. 6d. an ounce, that is three-quarters of £1 10s., which is the excess of cost of produetion over £13 10s. At a cost of production level of £16 an ounce, the subsidy will.be £1 17s. 6d. an ounce. The maximum subsidy of £2 an ounce will be payable if a mine's cost of production is £16 3s. 4d. an ounce or more. Tbe effect of the formula is that a mine can still operate at a profit unless its cost of production rises above £17 12s. 6d. an ounce. When a mine's cost of production reaches this figure, it makes a trading loss of £2 an ounce on the official price of £15 12s. 6d. This loss will be offset by the maximum rate of subsidy of £2 an ounce. The extent of assistance provided under the scheme is based on the assumption that a producer receives £15 12s. 6d. an ounce for his gold-the Oommonwealth Bank's official buying price. A provision has therefore been included in tbe bill that, if a producer's return rises above £15 12s. 6d. an ounce, whether as a result of premium sales or any other factor, the amount of subsidy payable to him shall be reduced accordingly. Since the purpose of the scheme is to assist the gold-mining industry, and not other mining industries which produce gold as an incidental part of their activities, there is a provision that a gold producer shall not be eligible for subsidy unless the value of his gold output is more than one-half of the value of his total mining output. If a producer operates more than one mining property, this test will be applied to each property separately. As is usual in legislation of this type, there is a provision that subsidy may not be paid so as to raise a producer's profits above a certain level. The proposal is that, if payment of subsidy in accordance witb the formula would result in a producer's profit from the production and sale of gold rising above 10 per cent, on capital employed by him in producing and selling gold, the amount of subsidy to wbich he is entitled shall be reduced so as to restrict his profits to 10 per cent. A large section of the bill is devoted to as from the beginning of this financial the manner in which, a producer's cost of production will be calculated for the purpose of applying tbe formula. The actual costs of a producer in his mining operations and in having his gold treated up to the stage of refined gold will be allowable, together with appropriate charges for depreciation of plant and equipment, and for administration. In addition, a producer will be allowed, within certain limits, to charge into his current operating costs his expenditure on development, namely, the finding, testing and preparation of ore bodies for future working. As I have mentioned, subsidy payments to small producers-define d as those whose annual output is less tban 500 ounces of fine gold-wil l not be based on the formula. These producers will receive a flat rate subsidy of £110s. an ounce. I emphasize that they are not subject to the conditions in relation to costs, or the keeping of records, that apply to the principal producers. As prospectors and small producers play a very useful part in this industry, it was thought proper to exclude them from all of those conditions, and to give them a flat rate subsidy of 30s. an ounce. The reason for treating small producers in this manner is mainly an administrative one. As small producers are not subject to income tax, few of them keep detailed books of account and other documents relating to the cost of their operations, and it would be a formidable task to try to ascertain their cost of production for the purpose"" of applying the formula. Por this reason, the Government concluded that the only practicable way of dealing witb small producers was, as I have stated, to pay them a flat rate subsidy without cost of production or profit limitation tests. The proposed rate of £1 10s. an ounce is felt to be reasonable in relation to the rates of subsidy proposed for large producers. I point out that, although the maximum subsidy will be £2 in the case of large producers, the average subsidy paid over tbe whole spread of producers will be considerably less than that. It might be of the order of 10s. or 15s. an ounce. Subsidy under the bill generally will be payable on gold produced in each of the financial years 1954-55 and 1955-56. Tbat is, it operates year and endures for two years. In cases where a producer's . accounting year differs from a financial year, however, the Treasurer is given the power of adopting the producer's accounting year if he considers that this is necessary for purposes of administration. I am sure that the bill is one which will meet with general support. There are several honourable members on both sides of the House who have been keenly interested in this matter for some time. There is no doubt that sections of tbe gold-mining industry are facing an acute financial problem, due in large measure to circumstances over which they have no control, and the provision of assistance under this biil should do much to enable the industry to meet its present difficulties. adjourned. BILL 1954. That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Stevedoring Industry Act 1049, and to provide for an inquiry into certain matters. for Supply) [12.41] I move That the hill be now read a second time. The amendments proposed by this bill are strictly of a legai character. They are made necessary by tbe recent decision of the Higb Court in the case of The Queen v. Davison, and are restricted to meeting the situation disclosed by that decision. In the Davison case, the High Court held to be invalid, for constitutional reasons, the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act relating to the'making of sequestration orders by registrars in bankruptcy. Tbe High Court was of the opinion that the act conferred on registrars judicial power which, under the Constitution, can be conferred only on courts constituted by judges appointed for life. The decision confronted the Government with two main tasks. In the first place, it became necessary to introduce legislation for the purpose of preventing the reopening of bankruptcies in which sequestration orders had been made by registrars. In tbe second place, the Government had to consider what provision should be made for the future to bring the Bankruptcy Act into operation on a debtor's petition. After the Bankruptcy Act was passed in 1928, and until the Davison case came before the High Court in 1953, that is, over a period of approximately 25 years, it bad been uniform practice for registrars to make sequestration orders on debtors' petitions. Approximately 10,000 or 11,000 sequestration orders have been so made. Clause 13 of the bill is designed to prevent these bankruptcies from being re-opened. It is an important clause, and I shall say a few words about it. The essential principle of the clause is to be found in the adoption of the presentation of the bankruptcy petition by the debtor, in lieu of the making of a sequestration order, as the basic step for bringing the machinery of the act into operation. Thus, in all cases where registrars have purported to make sequestration orders, the clause declares that tbe debtor became a bankrupt by virtue of his own act in presenting the petition. In basing tbe validation clause on this principle, the Government has had regard to views expressed by all of the majority justices of the High Court in the Davison case. With regard to the future, the Government has given serious thought to the arrangements wbich ought to be made for dealing with debtors' petitions. A number of courses was considered. Finally, it was decided that the procedure which has been followed for the past twelve months or so should be continued. Since the Davison case came before the High Court, in 1953, all debtors' petitions have gone to the appropriate court exercising jurisdiction in bankruptcy for decision whether a sequestration order should, or should not, be made. The system has worked satisfactorily so far as both the court and the public are concerned. It would have been possible to permit a debtor to become bankrupt by his own act in presenting tbe petition. This is indeed tbe basis adopted",33,Second Reading

95,Mr Beale (Parramatta,"Minister in the validating clause, as I have just explained. However, so far as the future is concerned, it was not thought desirable to allow bankruptcy to ensue in this autoCommonwealth, but by the registrar matic fashion. There may be some eases in which the debtor's petition should being a judge, was not exercising be carefully examined to prevent an abuse of the act being committed. The bill does not introduce, therefore, any entirely new scheme. However, it does eliminate the powers of the registrar found by the High Court to have been invalidly conferred. It also makes some necessary adjustments to put beyond doubt the power of the registrar to perform certain administrative, as distinct from judicial, functions. Clauses2 to 12 are concerned with this aspect. The bill does not go beyond making alterations rendered necessary by tbe High Court decision. The Government is mindful of the fact, which was mentioned by His Excellency the Governor General in opening the present Parliament, that the bankruptcy legislation is in need of a general overhaul. But the questions raised by the decision in the Davison case required immediate attention, and could not await tbe completion of a detailed review of the whole act. Opposition) [12.45] I do not wish to delay the House, and perhaps, after I have said a few words, the consideration of the bill may be completed. desire to complete the passage of the bill at present, because a further amendment is being considered. remarks after the luncheon recess. Sitting suspended from 12.^6 to 2.15 p.m. ports the view put forward by the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) in his second-reading speech on this measure. It is an extraordinary thing that all the many thousands of sequestration orders that have been made in the bankruptcy jurisdiction since the Commonwealth assumed control more than twenty years ago, are null and void because of what has been deemed to be a breach of a constitutional provision. The breach has occurred because sequestration orders have been made, not by a properly constituted court exercising the judicial power of the of the bankruptcy court who, not judicial power. The power used in making sequestration orders is discretionary, and consequently it could be exercised only by a judicial body; but the registrar was not a judicial body. If the matter were left in its present state, hundreds of thousands of titles to property could be questioned, and therefore it is essential that the position should be remedied. I understand that the procedure that the Government has adopted to remedy the trouble is to treat the act of making persons bankrupt as not a judicial act but a legislative act. In doing that we are following the Canadian procedure, where powers in divorce and matrimonial causes are sometimes exercised directly by tbe Parliament, as they used to be in England. I understand that the Government proposes to exercise direct legislative power in this matter. debtor's own act. that this is a matter of urgency, and the Opposition will agree at once to the second reading of the bill. If the Minister desires to introduce any amendments during the committee stages of the measure he will still be able to do so, even if tbe bill is immediately read a second time. adjourned.

104,Mr E. James Harbison (Blaxland),"surprised to hear the honourable member for Indi( Mr Bostock) attack tbe Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) for his attitude towards this measure. The Leader of the Opposition asked the Government why the preamble of this bill was in its present form, and why it should not be altered. I believe that when honourable members remember tbe position of Australia, as a nation very -close to Asia, they will not support the contentions of the honourable member for Indi. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition, and I also wonder why the preamble of this bill differs from the preamble of tbe North Atlantic Treaty. The latter treaty envisages the people of the world getting together and trying to live together within the North Atlantic Treaty provisions. Part of the preamble of that treaty readsThe parties to this treaty reaffirm their faith in the purpose and principles of the charter of the United Nations, and their desire to live in peace with all people and all governments. Honourable members of course know the vast area covered by the North Atlantic Treaty, and they also know that Great Britain is a party to the treaty. I ask the Government again why there should be a difference between the preamble of this bill and the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty? I agree with the Casey) that it is necessary to exercise firmness in dealing with communism, but if we believe that tbe problems confronting the world can be solved without a third world war, surely tbe language in the preamble should not be as provocative as it is, and sbould be more in keeping witb the preamble of tbe North Atlantic Treaty which indicates a desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments. Treaty embodies the desire of Great Britain to live at peace with Eussia, China and all other countries. said that it does not want peace? preamble of the bill before the HouseI f the Minister believes in that statement, at present reads, inter aliaAnd whereas those Communist policies amble of this bill is worded as it is. The represent a common danger to the security leaders of the great majority of Asians of Australia and of' the world generally and are not signatories to the treaty. I can are a violation of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations: Tlierefore, I put it to tbe honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) that by adopting such a preamble we are not doing justice to tbe wisdom of the great leaders of Great Britain who did not follow the lines of this preamble in drawing up the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty. If we are genuinely seeking peace, surely that clause in the preamble is not necessary. Tbe South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty reads, inter aliaDesiring to strengthen the fabric of peace and freedom and to uphold the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law, and to promote the economic well being and development of all peoples in the treaty area. If we are sincere about that sentiment, then we should not deliberately set out to inflame people who might finally join with us in our desire for world peace. Therefore, the honourable member for Indi should not have gone to great pains to prove that the Leader of the Opposition was defending the Communists in his speech on this measure. The Leader of the Opposition and his supporters are merely endeavouring to bring other nations into a belief that peace is best for them and for the world at large. I also suggest that if the framers of the Treaty believe in the sentiments expressed in the treaty, tben they must believe that tbe North Atlantic Treaty is a shallow mockery. Honourable members must keep firmly in mind the statements of the Minister in his second reading speech. He saidSeveral countries of Asia continue to be critical of the Manila treaty and have expressed the view that Asia should remain neutral and not get involved in power blocs. The North Atlantic Many Asian leaders believe that Asia needs a long period of peace in which to build up their newly independent countries and strengthen their economies. The Australian Government appreciates this desire for peace, but it considers that peace can be assured only if it is made clear to a potential aggressor that an act of violence on his part will be met with effective resistance. it is difficult to understand why the pre-",36,South East Asia Collective Defence Tbeaty Bill 1954 Second Beading

I rose to place on of a third world war, it is by the Government keeping the Parliament in session and ensuring that every one in responsible positions shall be in their places to make decisions quickly in the nation's interests should the oecason for such action arise. The honourable member for Indi asked, in effect, why the Opposition should distrust tbe Government in this matter. He pointed out that the Government took steps to call the Parliament together in order to take a decision with respect to Australia's participation in the conflict in Korea. I commend the action that the Government took on that occasion. It was guided by a sound principle, and all that I am submitting now is that it should be guided by jections are out of order; and, secondly, the same principle in its approach to the ratification of this treaty.

He spent halfthe time of his speech in castigating the Government about tbe preamble of the bill, which includes matters which we on this side would naturally think were commonly accepted by both sides of the House, and, indeed, by the overwhelming majority of tbe people of this country.

There is no other possible source of aggression to the free world than from either the Russians or their Chinese allies. I must say that when this debate opened last evening, I , in common with other honourable members on this side, and I hoped in common with some honourable members opposite, was. astonished, indeed almostflabbergasted,at tbe attitude of tbe Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt).

Und'er tbe agreement, five European and three Asian, nations have combined to achieve a common purpose, and it presages a long partnership between governments which share the same ideals, overriding past prejudices of race and colour. 1 .Although the treaty is a shining personal success for tbe Minister for External Affairs he, probably, would be the first problem is not military, but economic and to warn against over-emphasizing its significance. It is a beginning rather than unequivocally. I quote the articlea consummation. It will afford us security only if the signatories take the necessary steps to fulfil, its intentions; and', the immediate necessity, of course, is for some form of military im>plementation of this pact. Without a military commitment, provisions of the kind tliat we are now debating are merely a. series of unrequited declarations. have lived in Asia, know that Article V. of the) agreement, clearly recognizes this, and. the Minister himself, pressed high hopes of an early meeting at Bangkok of the council now to be set up. Nothing should be allowed to' prer vent that. The implications on our defence programme are stern. Article LT. of thu agreement enjoins on 'us and the co-signatories "" continuous and effective selfhelp and' mutual aid ""'. I shall not weary the House by quoting the whole of the article as honourable members have it before them. These, indeed, are weighty obligationsand. I emphasize the words "" effective "" and "" develop "" in the context in which they appear im that article. Despite the Government's commendable defence effort it is probably doubtful 1 whetheu Australia, to-day, is in a position' of instantaneous "" effective selfhelp"". There is still much to be done, i®, the short time available to us, to rectify our deficiencies. But; the burden doesi not stoptbere. The treaty demands that we go one stage further and develop our means of resisting, attack: I do not know exactly what the Government; has inmind in the. event of the Minister being able to arrive at a firm military commitment; but I imagine the consequences of this pledge indicatea of our regular army, the overtaking of the lag in equipment, the establishing"" of naval,, military and air formations capable of being sent anywhere in the: area at shout notice,, and, in general, a steady expansion of: Australia's' war potential.. Although most honourable members will agree withthesethings, I should imagine that they would also agree with tbe submission that the heart of theAsian social. Article III . recognizes this fact The parties undertake tostrengthen their free; institutions and' to co-operate witli one another iu the further development of economic measures, including technical assistance, designed both to promote economic progress and social well-being, amd to furtlier the individual and collective efforts of governments towards these ends.. Those whoj likea number of us, theordinary Asian is not interested in politics. The shrill cries of conflicting ideologies are above bis comprehension. He is, for the most part, uneducated, and simple-minded. The boundaries of his vision are soon reached. What he is really concerned about is an improvement in his living standards. Consequently, he will support those political forces which offer him tbe most, and which seem more likely to ameliorate his conditions. Accordingly, it seems clear that we must build rapidly on tbe foundations so presciently laid by this Government in the Colombo plan. This obligation, indeed, is inherent in Article III . , and I should like to put to the House four ways in which I think we can usefully contribute. First, I suggest that we think in terms of doubling -mayb e even quadrupling-ou r previous contributions of materials, machinery, advisers, Secondly, it is incumbent upon us to improve our public relations with Eastern countries by telling their multitudinous peoples what we are doing to help them. For example, a plaque on a piece of machinery made in Australia and sent over by us is not enough. It may be viewed during the course of a year only by a coterie of technicians, and by occasional coolies. All the resources of Eadio Australia and the vernacular press of each of those countries must be employed in telling those peoples what we are doing in a real measure to assist them. Thirdly, I suggest that the Government send many more goodwill missions to the countries of East and South-EastAsia. Educationists, merchants, members of Parliament and officials could all do valuable work, not only in enlightening themselves and us, but also in removing general misconceptions. vernment might well start by sending a joint parliamentary delegation to the treaty area and other parts of East Asia this summer. We are about to adjourn for a long recess, and nothing but mutual benefit to all concerned could possibly result from such an expedition. Fourthly, the Minister touched an important point in his speech when he referred briefly to the necessity for maintaining world prices of commodities produced in the treaty area. The right honourable gentleman probably had in mind such articles Mr Downer. as rubber, tin and oil. Obviously, this desirable state of affairs can be achieved only by international action. In this respect, the United States of America, the most powerful commercial as well as military nation in the world, should rightly give the lead; and I know that the Government will be instrumental in prompting America towards this end. All of these things are bound up with another phase of the Asian problem acknowledged in the treaty-measure s to combat subversion. Tbere is no easy answer to this problem. Neither we in Australia, nor any other western country for that matter, have solved it. satisfactorily. But I would say this to the House, that an alleviation of Asian economic standards alone will of itself not suffice. Oriental governments must have the scientists and doctors. resolution, and the means, to act swiftly, ruthlessly and effectively, when the occasion arises. However much honourable members may deplore it I certainly deplore it myself-'ther e is nothing the ordinary Asian respects so much as force. Both Buddha and Mohammed march on the side of the big battalions. The political allegiance of millions will change overnight if their government appears irresolute, vacillating, and unable tp maintain authority. Every Australian who has fought in Asia knows the truth of this. It is important that we keep it prominent in our thinking when discussing ways and means of dealing with the enemy within those countries. In this field, the security-knowledge, and experience of the Western treaty powers, including ourselves, should be placed promptly at the disposal of each of our Eastern partners. The GoMr Speaker, I wish to allude now to two very interesting articles in the treaty -Articles VII . and VU l . They endow this agreement with elasticity by providing for tbe admission of otber nations, together with an extension of the treaty area. I think all honourable members will applaud the wisdom of these provisions. The progenitors of the pact have not conceived it as something static. Quite tbe reverse! In the coming years, we should most certainly grasp every opportunity to widen it into a truly embracing association. Now, Mr Speaker, every one will regret the omission of Indonesia, and of the ancient and multifarious collection of peoples that inhabits the sub-continent of India. I should have thought it was reasonable to hope that India would at least attend the conference. After all, its Prime Minister, Mr Nehru, is one of the great figures of the contemporary world. His influence in Asia is considerable. His problems at home are certainly immense. Without doubt he is combating communism within his own country. We would be ignorant not to show our appreciation of his difficulties. It would be churlish not to respect his point of view. But, after making all of these allowances, perhaps one may be pardoned for saying that at times one's patience begins to wear thin. Mr Nehru's hostility to the Manila treaty is disappointing in tbe extreme. It is explicable, I suggest, partly on a basis of antiquated prejudice. Surely it is unreal of him to continue chewing the cud of satisfied grudges. An uneasy doubt is now arising amongst many Commonwealth countries as to his bona fides. His recent actions indicate more an obsession with national aggrandizement than a genuine desire for international freedom. For example, towards Pakistan he has shown nothing but intransigence over Kashmir. He has adopted a minatory attitude towards the Portuguese in Goa He has been quick to pounce on the French, writhing in their defeat and humiliation in Indo-China, with tbe sadistic opportunism of a Bombay vulture. Most cleverly, he has engineered their ejectment from Pondicherry. His representative here has twice recently demanded the admission of Indian migrants to Australia. All of us in this House hope that India's leader will tbink again on these vital questions examined by the treaty powers at Manila. Circumstances may persuade him, perhaps much sooner than any of us expect, of the falsity of his insinuations against our motives, and induce him to collaborate with those nations, such as ourselves, which are the true friends of India in a joint quest for freedom. A discussion of Articles VII . and VIII . might not renounce its obligations to would logically lead to some consideraAmerica and throw in its lot with China tion of the position of Japan. It is pertinent to ask, thinking ahead on this tremendous question, whether ultimately Australia might not be wise to seek Japan's inclusion in the treaty. Since 1945, my concern, along-1 suppose with that of every other member of the House, has been to prevent Japan from again menacing Australia. Some of us have disagreed over the methods. I still believe, as I said in this place nearly three years ago, that America's hurried ending of the occupation-, and its insistence upon Japanese re-armament, will prove in the long run to be a mistake, particularly for us. But, Mr Speaker, the decision has been taken. It cannot now be reversed. It is futile to try to put back the hands of the clock of history. We must make the best of the situation as it unfolds. I have also urged, if honourable members will bear witb me for a moment, that Japan, in our dealings with it should not be treated as a pariah; that we should bring ourselves, whatever our prejudices, to trade with it ; that we should attempt to acclimatize it to Western democratic thought; and that we should attract it by our actions into the general comity of nations. Sir, is not this an opportunity ""to canalize those factors making for a resurgent Japan into an anti-Communist Asian-European alliance ? Membership of this organization would undoubtedly strengthen it as an anti-Communist bulwark. The creation, on our part, of a working association witb that country would help to erase the bates of the immediate past. Equally important, its collaboration would enable us to exercise some kind of indirect supervision, perhaps, over its rearmament. At least it would enable us to acquire a more exact knowledge of Japan's motives, its real policy, and where its leaders were going. Japan's inclusion would unquestionably generate increased goodwill and stability in tbe Pacific. As a partner, we, along with our American and British friends, might ultimately prevent a recrudescence of that aggressive militarism that so many of us fear. But, sir, if , on the contrary, we leave Japan alone, a brooding solitary power beset by baffling economic perplexities, who knows that it <or Eussia, or, alternatively, sullenly -prepare a renewal of its plans for Asian -conquest ? Once again, I congratulate the Minister for External Affairs for his magnificent work at Manila on behalf of ourselves, our country, and all our partners in the free world. Now the task of this Parliament, of our nation, of all those with whom we have contracted this alliance, is to march forward, to put teeth into it, and to make it a really effective instrument of international peace. Mr O'CONNOB (Martin) [3.13] -The honourable member for Angas( Mr treaty in the following way:Downer), in his opening remarks, expressed his disappointment that the debate Zealand,Ihe Delegates of Australia, France, New had not proceeded until then on a more pines, tlie Kingdom of Tliailand, the United conciliatory tone. But, after he had exKingdom of Great Britain and Northern pressed a desire for conciliation, he Ireland, the United States of America; immediately set out to attack the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), and his mon action .to maintain peace and -security in criticisms were based merely on the fact South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific; that the right honourable gentleman had last night expressed hi3 disapproval of in order to be worthy and effective, must be tbe preamble of the bill. It must be iii-spired obvious to tbose who have read the bill that the preamble contains a number of .objectionable features, and the GoverntheFirst, ment has not yet made out a case for its principle of equal rights and sen-determinainclusion in the bill. In fact, the pretion of peoples and -tliey w ill earnestly strive amble is completely unnecessary. It has become fashionable for Ministers and tbeir supporters, both in this House and elsewhere, to attack in the extravagant language of the honourable member for Angas people who are merely critical of the Government, and to taccuse them of being 'Communists. Tbis appears to me to savour of Communist tactics in reverse. We have reached a stage at which anybody who criticizes the Government, or differs from it, is smeared as a Communist sympathizer. I am quite sure that the people of Australia resent such tactics and that, -at the approsubvert bheir freedom or to rVstroy their priate time, they will express their opinion of tbem, as the American people did a few days ago. Honourable members on this side of the House have criticized the measure only with the object of improving it. To that end, we have suggested certain amendments. there is considerable merit in the amendments and it is significant that the honourable membeT for Angas did not attempt to criticize them at all. If one -reads the preamble of tbe bill in. the light of otlier statements made about the treaty, one is prompted to ask why a preamble of that nature is necessary. The Minister for External Affairs .( Mr Casey) has not tried to answer that question. I bave a copy of a publication entitled Bulletin, issued by the American Department of State. It contains a report of a statement made by Mr Dulles at the opening session of the South-East Asia Conference at Manila on the 6th September. According to the report, Mr Dulles presented Ms opinion of the Pakistan, the Republic of the PhilipDesiring to establish a firm basis for .comConvinced that common action to this end, and liberty; by tlie highest principles of justice Do hereby proclaim: in accordance with tlie provisions of United Nations Charter, they uphold tlie by every peaceful means to promote self government and to secure the independence of all countries whose peoples desire it and are aJj'le '-to undertake i ts responsibilities; iSecond, they a>re each '-prepared to continue taking effective practical measures to .ensure conditions favorable to -the orderly achievement of the foregoing purposes in .accordance with their constitutional procedures; Third, they will continue to co-operate in the economic, social and cultural fields in order to promote higher living standards, economic progress .and social well-being in this region : Fourth, as declared in the Sonth-East Asia Collective Defense Treaty, they .are determined to prevent or counter by appropriate means any attempt in the treaty aTea to sovereignty or territorial integrity. I submit that a preamble of that kind would nave been more in keeping with the object of this bill than the present preamble. It is obvious that this Government cannot help introducing poliI think tics into any measure it brings before the Parliament. Irrespective of whether we are dealing with international affaire oi local affairs, there is always a background of communism introduced, by tbe Gov.ernr ment. in am attempt toi gain some contemptible political advantage. Tie Opposition, believes there is no. necessity for a tive, could be committed towaa without preamble, of the. type that. has. been inserted in, this; bill. The statement by Mr Dulles that I lave, j.ust read, to the House proves conclusively that, such a preamble is completely unjustified. I should have, thoughtthe amendments suggested by the leader of the 1 Opposition would commend themselves to> all lonorable members. Tbe: first amendment suggests' that the treaty shall not become brnding' on Australia until it has been ratified' by all the signatory nations. That is HO* am unreasonable sug gestion. Under the terms of the treaty, it becomes effective, when; five, of tie signatory nations, bave. ratified it. In such circumstances, we could find ourselves involved in at situation that, we could not cope with. Therefore, to safeguard! the interests of this country; tie Opposition suggests that the treaty shall not become bindingon Australia! umtil aB the eight nations concerned have ratified it. The second amendment suggested by 1 tiheLeader of the Oppositionis a very simple one, and I should have thought that it, too, would commend itself to all 1 members of tie Parliament, especially the members' of the Government parties', who never tire of asserting the sovereignty of the Parliament. We lave heard speeches delivered by lonorable members opposite time, amd again in which they have claimed that the will of the Pairliament has been, thwarted. Tie. Opposition proposes that,, before Australia is committed to> war,, the. Parliament should be consulted. To my mind, novalid argument can be. advanced against such a contention. In11941, this country was committed to war without the Parliament being consulted. I do not propose to argue now whether that action was right orwrong. I lave made a statement of fact. I remindt i e House, that tie New Zealand Government did not follow sucl a course. Before. New Zealand was committed to war, ti e New Zealand Government called tie New Zealand Parliament together. It did not declare waruntil Parliament had met to consider the matter. That procedure was followed also in Canada and Soutl Africa. If tbose countries ad'opt, that, procedure;, why does Australia follow adifferent, cou-rsej This, country,, by an. action of the. Exesur1 the* Parliament being consulted.. It, would be hajid to findany one who-would attempt to. justify a continuance of sucl. an unr satisfactory state of a f f a i r In. an attempt to put an end to it, the. Leader of the Opposition,, on bebalf of the Labour party, has suggested an appropriate amendment. In ai democracy, the. Parliament is supposed to represent the people. W l y should aot tbe Government of this country be: compelled' to consult the Parliament,, tie liglest instrument 1 of authority, and secureits authority to commit, the country to war % But, appaEejitly, this Government believes: that ti e Parliament should not, be consulted on sacl a. matter. I lav© already pointed out. lowpeculiar that attitude is, because the governments of other British Commonwealth countries agree that tie parliaments of tlose countries; should be consulted. I submit that the attitude of the Government cannot b® justified It is completely opposed toall democratic thoughtand is untenable in every resipect The Opposition believes tlait, if t i e amendments it. has suggested were adopted-, the. bill would be more in conformity witb the wishes of the people'. One does not have to be a member of tbe Parliament to appreciate the position that Australia is in as aresult of what has happened during the last four or five years-. It is indeed' heartening to know that the isolationist tendency that figured so prominently in our national makerup until 1940 hasdisappeared almost, completely,, largely as a result, of what happened from. 1940 onwards.. Because af tie dangers, that confront Australia and the. necessity to. d.oi something to meat tbem, the Opposition has. always tried tQ make a. constructive approach to measures relating to foreign affairs. Whilst, we have not. differed basically from t i e Government on foreign policy,, we, have: been, critical of some aspectsof its policy, but the criticism has been orffared, only witb the object of improving measures brought before the House for consideration. That is. an attitude which, certain members of the Government parties might well adopt.. I recall that during the. last three years of the Chifley Government's term of office, all matters relating to foreign policy and foreign affairs brought before the House were opposed relentlessly and in the most unbridled way, irrespective of their merits, by some members of the then Opposition. The people who figured prominently in those attacks were the present Australian Ambassador to the United States of America, the present Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, the present Postmaster General( Mr Anthony) and the present Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture formed the spearhead of the attacks made on the foreign policy of the Ohifley Government, but it is strange that, notwithstanding the extravagant language they used in their attempt to belittle that policy, this Government has adopted it in every respect. If honourable members opposite dispute that statement, I sbould like them to tell me the changes that have been made. I believe it is correct to say that the foundations of our present foreign policy were laid by the Chifley Government. I believe that, in dealing witb foreign affairs, members of the Parliament should not t r y to take advantage of the existing situation, but country. the Opposition has suggested two amendments of the bill. I submit that the amendments are worthy of consideration by the Government because, if they were accepted, they would improve the bill considerably. It is most fortunate that I should return to this Housef r o m a trip overseas in time to take part in this very important debate. I want to seize this opportunity to offer my congratulations to the Ministerf o r External Affairs( Mr Casey) for the valiant work that he has done to accomplish a great task. I want to offer my congratulations to the Government and the people of Australia, that a bill of this kind is before this House, but before I do so, I think it is my duty to make some reference to the criticisms levelled at the bill by the honourable member for M a r t in ( Mr O'Connor) it fourt h and last paragraph declaresappears to be the custom for me to follow h i m in debates of this kind-the honourable member for Blaxland( MrE . James Harrison) and the Leader of the Opposition ( D r . E v a t t ) . Each of them took the strongest exception to the preamble of the bill. The objection raised to it by the Leader of the Opposition was perhaps stronger than that raised by either of the other two speakers to whom I have referred. The right honourable gentleman said that the preamble of the bill was completely unacceptable to the Labour party. He said that he preferred tbe preamble of the No r t h Atlantic Treaty. He was followed f a it h f u l l y by Those four people the honourable member for Blaxland who, echoing his leader, said that he, too, preferred the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty. In fairness to the House, it is necessary that I , or some other honourable member, should direct attention to the terms of the preamble of the No r t h Atlantic Treaty. I remind the House that the three honourable members to whom I have referred, if no others, took the strongest exception to the preamble of the bill, and stated in specific terms that they preferred it to be similar to that of the North Atlantic Treaty measure. There are four simple paragraphs in the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty, and I ask the should do their best for this House to bear w it h me while I refer to W it h that idea in mind, them. The first paragraph reads as follows:The parties to this Treaty reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles of tlie Charter of the United Nations and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all Governments. Surely that is an expression of f a it h neither more nor less than that. The second paragraph is couched in the following terms:They are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. Surely that is an expression of hopeneither more nor less than that. The third paragraph contains the following statement:They seek to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic Area. That is another expression of hopeneither more nor less than that. The They are resolved to unite their efforts for collective defence and for the preservation of peace and security.",41,South East Asia Collective Defence Tbeaty Bill 1954 Second Beading

132,Mr Roberton (Riverina) [3.28],"AN wrong with that? wrong with it. No one could take any exception to it, except that it is just a pious platitude for the purpose of reassuring those people who are interested in the North Atlantic Treaty. Let us nieasure that preamble against tbe preamble of this bill. It is my duty, if for no other reason than to try to convince honourable members opposite of the merits of the measure before the House, to make specific reference to the four paragraphs of the preamble of the bill. The first is as follows:Whereas the independence and integrity ot that it could be a more effective preamble the countries and territories of South-East Asia to a document of its description. To and the South-West Pacific arc threatened hy measure one against the other is of no the aggressive policies of international Communism: Who could take any exception to that temporary history, and the appropriate paragraph? It is either true or false. action that ought to be taken to meet it. Either we believe it, or we do not believe it. Those honourable members who are privileged to sit on this side of the make that explanation, because honourable chamber believe it to be fact. Tbe members like the Leader of the Opposisecond paragraph contains the following tion, the honourable member for Blaxland, statement:And whereas those Communist policies have already shown themselves in Korea, Indoknow the relative value of preambles when China and elsewhere by armed aggression, by measured one against the other. I wish armed insurrection assisted from without and to congratulate the Minister for External otherwise: Is that not true? Is that not a simple ning back the respect of the free countries statement of fact in our own contemporwho are interested in that part of the ary history? Should it not be included world which is known as South-East Asia in a bill of this description, which is and the South-West Pacific area. No designed to safeguard the future of our man has worked harder, and no man country? The third paragraph of the has applied himself to the task with a preamble is as follows:And whereas those Communist policies Minister. The introduction of this bill represent a common danger to the security of represents a personal victory for a very Australia and of the world generally and are a valiant gentleman. The Government, too, violation of the principles and purposes of the is to be congratulated on bringing down Charter of the United Nations: If that paragraph is not true, and if it Australia of the .South-East Asia Collecshould be excluded from the bill, honortive Defence Treaty. The name of the able members opposite sbould say so. In treaty describes its purposes. my humble opinion, if that paragraph were excluded from fhe preamble, the bill would be reduced in stature to that treaty of the description of the treaty degree. The last and final paragraph of that we are considering, or to introthe preamble reads as follows:And whereas, in consequence of the forebefore the House. At that time, the going, countries in or concerned with the security of South-East Asia and the Southpeople, and the politics of our country, West Pacific have determined to join together were in complete confusion. Honourable danger and of promoting the security and well-being of the region of South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific. Is it suggested by members of the Opposition that no appropriate action should be taken by this Government, at this time, to protect the people in these territories, and in our own country? If that is their attitude, they should say so. To rise in their places and say, speciously, that they prefer the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty to the preamble of this bill is taking a mean advantage of tbose persons who have not read tbe preamble to the North Atlantic Treaty, and who might be pardoned for supposing importance.

133,Mr Eobeeton,"There is nothingmembers opposite must 'accept some responsibility for that unihappy state of affairs. In 1949, not a living soul .knew, with any degree of accuracy, where this country was going, or wiere its politics at that time were likely to lead us. 1 think it is right to describe this treaty, just as it was right so to describe the ANZUS pact, as a manifestation of the maturity that has come to our country within the last few .years, particularly in relation to international affairs. T think it is right to state also that, prior .to 1914, we were in our infancy in relation to international affairs^ and that most of 'OUT decisions were made for us by .the Mother Country and ""by the Empire, although, of course, ""we had our moments of revolt against maternal authority. It is interesting to note just now we emerged from that period of querulous infancy. There was no great need for us to malte any intensive study of international affairs. The friends of the Mother Country, and the friends of the British Empire, were our friends. Similarly, the enemies of the Mother Country, :and the enemies of the British Empire, were our enemies. Our problems in relation to international r-esponsrbilities were simplified to that degree. We belonged to .the British family of nations at that -time, absolutely and .completely, and, in our infancy, that was enough for ras. 'Then came the outbreak of World War I. in 1914. Although the .great and heroic part that Australia played at the landing at Gallipoli, in Erance and in various other theatres of war las frequently been described as representing the birth of the nation, it would be more appropriate, in my lumble opinion, to refer to it as representing tie adolescence of the nation, because by that time the Commonwealth of Australia was nearly fourteen yeaTS old -In our adolescence, we wanted to know where we were going. That was tie great question. As tlere were signs, even then, of a disintegration of tie ""British Empire, tie question became more urgent from day to day, and from year to year. 'Tbere were those wlo thought that we should follow tie Mother Country Mindly through -the labyrinth of international politics. There was a reason for tlat, or at least an excuse, because very few people in our Mr Rnherion. -Qouistry had any -understanding of international politics, or of international responsibilities, as they affected our .country,. There were those of .us, even at that time, wlo believed that it was our manif est duty to reach our -own international decisions in our own national -way, conscious, of course, all the time of our responsibilities to our kith and kin -abroad, to the Mother 'Country, and to the British .Empire .as a wlole. I believe tlat is tie policy t l a t slould lave been adopted by all of oui* people at that particular time. .But there were others who, when we were in our adolescence, lelieved tlat we lad readied maturity, and tlat tie time lad arrived wien Australia slould adopt an isolationist attitude towards international affairs 'and f l a t it slould stand on the touch line and trade with any country anywhere to achieve its own political ends. That, in my lumble opinion, was a shameful stale of affairs. Tet there are lonorable members opposite wlo still subscribe to tha* ignominious point of view. There was aio escape -from the turbulence of our adolescence. T'lene ""las never been any way of escape for any person, for any .nation, from tie turbulence of adolescence. History ne*ver moves slowly. It moves, whether we like it or not, in convulsions, and this country, together with .a great many other countries, was crashed to its maturitv at the outbreak of World War II . , in 1'939. Maturity was thrust upon us. ""We lad to arrive at our own decisions, and we did so-and I -say w it l ""regret-wit h confusion worse confounded. In 1943, we had reached such a state of confusion tlat fer t i e -first .time in our history we had two armies. One was required to fight to the last man and .the last shilling for our freedom, our .country iand our people. The other, for all sorts of dubious reasons, was to fight within' .strict geographical limits. That was the nature of our confusion then. Australia was a -single component of what used to be called the British ""Empire, and which, I still prefer to call .tie .British Empire, but which is now known .as the TJritish Commonwealth of ""Nations. We were an important component, but we l a d two armies, one to fight <to the last man and the last 'shilling, and one to figbt in certain places for certain reasons. Then came the confusion of the post-war yearSj when we did not know where we were going. Now, at last, under this legislation, Australia w ill declare itself as a component of the British Commonwealth of Nations and a part of the free world. It is our duty to stand up to our international responsibilities, because the thrust against us may come from certain directions. We must do whatever lies in our power to make our own position secure in this part of the world, and this measure w ill enable us to do that in precisely the same way as did the ANZUS treaty. Moreover, this treaty w ill help to make us secure in a way that is satisfactory to those of us wbo have any knowledge or understanding of the position that confronts our people to-day. During the difficult post-war period, when there was so much confusion, there was a change of government. No sooner was the government changed than it established a foreign affairs committee of this Parliament. That was done so that the members of the committee might be given an opportunity to in for m themselves from day to day on the international situation as it affects our country, and then be able to in for m this Parliament, and through tbe Parliament the people, of the true position of international affairs. When the Government suggested to the Leader of the Opposition that the Labour party should nominate some of its members to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Leader of the Opposition prohibited the members of the Labour party from joining the committee. Honourable members able member has not been speaking to the provisions of the bill. Affairs Committee bas no reference to the measure at all. that, but there are international sequences that lead up to a bil l .of this description, and I am trying to show the necessity for the measure and to explain away the ignorance of honourable members opposite wbo have spoken against it , no matter how mildly they may have expressed themselves. I support the bill , and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that this is not an exclusive treaty that is confined to our own country. Other powers have signed the treaty, and it is necessary for us to know just who tbey are. First, we have Australia, followed by France, which is another country vitally concerned in the South-East Asia area. Then there is New Zealand, which is seriously prejudiced by all the threats and dangers of aggression from the countries to the north. Pakistan. An honourable member opposite has said, "" Amazing"", and I know that he does not understand the dangers that confront us. Perhaps he would get some satisfaction if this country were for any reason driven to disaster because we bave not the intelligence to take proper action to defend ourselves w i th an instrument of this description. Pakistan is one of the great countries of Asia. It sent representatives to. the recent parliamentary conference in Kenya, and its delegates dominated that conference through tbeir knowledge of international affairs, their conceptions of international responsibility and their very friendly attitude towards this country and its people. I am glad that Pakistan is a signatory to the treaty, ancl that Australia and Pakistan have moved closer together. From 1945 to 1949 the Republic of the Philippines would not have signed a document of this description because, like other countries of South-East Asia, the Philippines did not know where Australia was going. It is now quite obvious where we are going. We belong to the free interjecting, world, and we have shown that, in order Order !

Because of The Foreign declarations such as Australia has made under this treaty, the Philippines and other countrise know exactly where we I am aware of stand.

137,Mr Roberton,"Then we haveWestern civilization to a greater degree than any other country. Although overloaded with commitments in other parts of the world, the United Kingdom has accepted a full share of responsibility under this treaty. Finally, there is the United States of America. In 1945 America would not bave considered an agreement of this description because the Labour Government here was entering into all sorts of spurious arrangements in other countries of tbe world. Never at any stage of those proceedings would the United States have consented to sign a document of this description. Now America is committed to tbe treaty just as we are, and the security of both the United States and Australia has been improved. I congratulate the Minister, the Government and honourable members themselves on their attitude to this treaty. We have less cause to fear the future than we have had in the last ten years. [3.55] I am glad to be able to let the people know what I think about this matter, and about international affairs in general. There are some honourable members who hold the opinion that Australia sbould enter into treaties., like tbe one with which we are dealing, with other countries, and there are other honourable members of the Opposition who wonder whether sucb a treaty is desirable, or whether it goes too far. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has intimated that he will move two amendments to the measure, but that the Opposition will in general support the bill. Opposition should not bear opprobrium cast upon it by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton). We may be ignorant, in his estimation, and we may not be quite up to his own educational standard, but I should like him to understand that all bonorable members on this side of the House are at least just as honest as those on the Government side, and are at least just as anxious to preserve the safety of Australia and to do the best that we can for the people of the nation. I make that statement because I take exception to the charges of the honourable member was to the effect that we are practically and opposed to this treaty, and are not prepared to do anything for the safety of Australia or to uphold the ideals of freedom for which we stand. I shall not argue whether the preamble of the bill is right or wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has expressed an opinion about that, and as he is an eminent constitutional and international lawyer, I believe that his views should be very carefully considered. I have no doubt that he made his statements about the preamble believing them to be bona fide, and I leave it to tbe Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) to accept or reject bis recommendations. However, I believe that the people are concerned about what the Government is really doing to protect this country, and to contribute to the strengthening of the free world. We may differ about one clause or another, but we are all very anxious that we should continue to live our lives as we want to live them, and that we should do everything possible to prevent anybody else from endangering our way of life. We must recognize at the outset that the world is divided into two groups under two ideologies. The first is an ideology of freedom and the second is an ideology of domination by a militant section of tbe community. The second group springs from Russia and its Communist system, and I believe that it is my duty to support any measures that may be taken to prevent that ideology from spreading in this country. Australia is a small nation, and I believe that Therefore, I believe that the at times we are swollen up with a false sense of our own importance. Many Australians know some of the little countries of the world only as names, and do not know their geographical situation. We forget that the population of any of those countries far out-numbers the population of this country. Australia, in that respect, is only a small country in comparison with any of tbem. That is the general outlook of many of our people, but we, as members of the National Parliament, must ensure that Australia takes its rightful place in world affairs. A few weeks ago, the House discussing international affairs, I stated on that occasion",50,Opposition Membeb Wha T Is For The Purposes Of Meeting This Common
138,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"that I did not believe that we in office when an emergency arises in should push ourselves into another the future. All that the Leader of the country merely because we thought that Opposition wishes to do is to make it its people were not getting a fair deal. I definite that before we act in accordance contended that we should not intervene with our commitments under the treaty, unless those people were trying to defend tbe approval of the Parliament will have themselves and their way of life. I do been given. The inference which I drew not consider that we should take action from the speech of a Government supwhich we think would be in their inporter was that we might require to take terests, whether they ask us for assistance immediate action and that it might take or not. I turn now to the preamble to the Parliament. I do not consider that such treaty, which states, in part, as follows:The Parties to this Treaty, Desiring to strengthen the fabric of peace and freedom and to uphold the principles of democracy, individual liberty and tlie rule of law, and to promote the economic well-being and development of all peoples in the treaty area. Therefore agree as follows: The eleven articles of the treaty then follow, and we agree with them. The Minister and other speakers have discussed them, and I do not propose to refer to all of them. However, Article IV . requires particular attention. It reads as follows:1. Each Party recognizes that aggression by 'means of armed attack in the treaty area against any of the Parties or against any State or territory which the Parties by unanimous agreement may hereafter designate, would endanger its own peace and safety, anil agrees that it will in that event act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes. . . . I am not sure whether the phrase "" in accordance with its constitutional processes "" refers to the individual States in tbe area, or to the organization itself. States. be so, and I am glad that the Minister has clarified tbe matter. I bave not tbe slightest doubt that this bill will be passed by the Parliament. The treaty, when it is ratified by the parliaments of the other countries that are signatories to it. will come into force. Thereafter, any action by Australia in tbe event of an emergency has to be taken in accordance with our constitutional processes. In those circumstances, the amendments shadowed by the Leader of the Opposition are safeguards that should be adopted. This Government may not be too long to secure the approval of the would be the position, because paragraph 3 of Article IV . states as follows:It is understood that no action on the territory of any State designated by unanimous agreement under paragraph 1 of this Article or on any territory so designated shall be taken except at the invitation or with the consent of the government concerned. If one of the countries in the area were attacked, it would not automatically follow that we should jump into tbe fray. Any action on our part would be taken at the invitation or with the consent of the government concerned. I also interpret Article V. of the treaty to mean that the council, which is to be established by the parties, will consider any action that may be desirable. If that is to be the position, I fail to see any reason for objection to the proposed amendments. The Leader of the Opposition, by his amendment, merely seeks to ensure thatBefore any armed forces are contributed or made available by Australia, under or in accordance with any of the provisions of the Treaty, the prior approval of the Parliament shall be obtained. I recall that the Parliament was summoned to consider our participation in Korea. If my memory serves me aright, honourable members agreed unanimously that we intervene to counteract the aggression in that country. The approval of the Parliament was obtained on that occasion, and I believe that the Parliament should be consulted on action to be taken under this treaty in the future. Reference bas been made in this debate to the need for immediate action to resist aggression. ""We live in the age of the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb, and the use of those weapons, witb little warnforeing, would mean sudden death for many people. I do not know whether that matter has been taken into consideration. The signatories to this treaty seem to be",51,Opposition Membeb Wha T Is For The Purposes Of Meeting This Common

142,Mr Thompson,"The honourable tralia, in those circumstances, would havefor aid in the past, is prepared to come into the treaty. If those countries are prepared toshoulder the obligations inherent in this treaty, I support Australia's participation in it. That is my outlook on this agreement. Of course, one may consider each provision of the treaty and interpret it according to one's own outlook. I recognize that fact. I am not saying that the treaty is perfect. I do not think that it is; but, in accepting it, I believe that I am accepting something that has been brought into being, not only for the protection of Australia, but also for the protection, throughout the free If we wish to preserve the democratic ideology we must fight in defence of it. I know that there are many critics who will immediately point, to the predominance of undesirable forces,, many of them in positions of control, in some of those democratic countries. I , myself, know of the conditions under which sections of those, communities are extremely wealthy whilst millions in. the. same countries are on the verge of starvation. I am aware of those facts, but,, at the same time, I canwhich to cavil or disagree. He made, it not, reject, this treaty simply on that account. I should like the Minister to giye more consideration to the question, of whether we are doing as much as we could to help economically peoples in undeveloped countries. EecentlyI . received a letter from an organization requesting that I press, in the. Parliament for the granting of increased aid by this country under the Colombo plan. That organization knows at first hand that much good work is-, being done under that plan in bringing about a better understanding of the democracies and im establishing goodwill on their part towards; Australia, as well as. in 1 promoting, eonfidence in those countries in the democratic way of life. I urge the Minister to recognize to a great degree the thoughts and aims of so many decent people in the community who want to do more ih a material and economic way to help those peoples. I understand from the Minister's speech that aid will be given to help them tostrengthen their defences and administrative agencies, including the police force. All of that aid, however, is associated with the arms side of their affairs and I fuUy appreciate the necessity for it. But, I doubt whether we are placing sufficient emphasis upon the necessity to do more for those peoples from the humanitarian; point of view in order to help tbem to realize that We do not look upon them merely as so many people whom we can teach to fight corny mimism and prevent it from spreading to Australia. We must help them; to realize that we are equally concerned about helping them to improve their economic conditions. Adermann) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) began his. remarks by objecting to implications that have been made against members of the Labour party by honourable members on this side of the chamber..

However, I disagree with bis statement that the amendments that the Leader of tbe Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has foreshadowed are reasonable. The first of those, proposed amendments ia unnecessary and, I think, would be harmful; and the second would be mischievous. This treaty, which the House is. being asked to ratify, is a part not only of the plan-, to secure the defence of Australia, but also of the pattern of defence of the free, world, against communism. Let us consider, briefly, the. postwar background against which thistreaty is being made. After two world, wars, wehad mo illusion that peacehad come to the world for ever. We placed our hopes, in the United Nations, but we found quickly that its great weakness lay in the veto. The effective operative strength of the United Nations was; vested in the Security Council, every member of which had the rigbt of veto; and the constantexercise by Eussia of",53,Opposition Membeb Wha T Is For The Purposes Of Meeting This Common

144,Mr Deputy Speakee ( Mr,"that right made it plain that the United Nations would not be effective in actively securing defence against aggression. In those circumstances, the free nations turned to regional pacts w it h in the framework of the United Nations. In Europe, where the threat from Russia was first made apparent, Nato was evolved. The great stimulus in making that arrangement effective was the success of the Berlin air-lift. Regional pacts have also been successful in the Balkans and the Middle East, although, now, we are apt to forget their importance. The Greeks reached agreement with the Turks, and tributed security of that area. Similar arrangements helped to l i m it civil war in Greece: whilst the resistance organized America to threatened Persian aggression has, for the time being, called a halt to aggression in that area. Then, we remember the intervention of tbe United Nations in Korea. It is true that that intervention was influenced largely by the United States of America, but it was only by the chance withdrawal of Russiaf r o m the Security Council at that time that the United Nations was able to intervene in Korea. But there was left in the defence of the free world a gap which extended to our own area and which has been filled, in part, by the ANZUS treaty, which is of great importance That gap bas been further plugged this year by tbe Manila pact. pact is not a final answer in sealing our defences completely, it has narrowed the gap considerably. There remain notable deficiencies, but this pact is a definite forward movement and, therefore, the full support of the House. It is only fair to point out that, up to date, the successful defence of the treaty area has depended very largely upon the vast and overwhelming States and the great generosity wisdom has been used throughout the world. That country only recently assumed tbe obligations of leadership of the free world. It has not a long history in diplomacy or in the exercise of great power. It is all very well for us and others to accuse it of making mistakes and of lacking foreMr Osborne. sight, but the plain fact is that if the United States had continued its traditional isolationist policy the free world, of which Australia is a part, would have gone under to communism. Australia has immense responsibility and interests in plugging this gap in South-East Asia. The assurance given in the statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in August that, henceforth, we were prepared to assume obligations for the mutual defence of thia area marked a very great change in our traditional external affairs policy. The that arrangement conneed for us to go furthe r afield was substantially towards the recognized f u l l y and accepted at that time. It is noticeable that that need was foreseen by the late Mr Chifleyi n by a speech which he made on his returu from the Prime Ministers conference in London, in June, 1946. The remarks that he made then have been quoted in this chamber on previous occasions, but I shall quote them again, because honourable members opposite rely to such a degree upon the wisdom of their former leader and also because the remarks themselves pointed the way to this treaty. Mr Chifley saidAs a principal power and member of the British Commonwealth in the Pacific, we must also be prepared to shoulder greater responsibilities for the defence of that area, including the upkeep of our bases, which are essential to the strategic plan. to Australia's safety. I referred earlier to the heavy burden of military commitments being borne by the people of the United Kingdom who poured Whilst this out blood and treasure without stint, to save the world Some members of the Opposition could well ponder carefully on those remarks to-day. The statement continueddeserves I therefore told the conference-and I am quite certain that I was expressing the sentiment of both sides of this House and the people of Australia-that it was recognized that Australia must, in future, make a larger contristrength of the United bution towards the defence of the British Commonwealth, that this could best be done and in the Pacific, and that the approach to a with which that strength common scheme of defence of this area should be by agreement between the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and thereafter with the United States, and later with other nations with possessions in this area. These views met with the f u l l endorsement of the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The course suggested by Mr Chifley reaches its fulfilment in the Manila pact. ""Wnat does this treaty seek to do ? It proanti-Communists. There are those who poses joint consultation and joint action against aggression and internal subversion in tbe treaty area, which is the area occupied by the nations which are parties to the treaty and the defined area of the Pacific Ocean. Tbe treaty can be applied also to designated areas. The meaning of that provision is indicated when we are told that in the protocol to the treaty the States of Indo-China were designated as areas to which the treaty could apply and arr AS in which the contracting parties could take joint action for defence against aggression or joint action to give assistance against subversion. In respect of joint action in tbe case of internal subversion, tbe safeguard is provided that such action can be taken only at the invitation of the country that is affected. That provision represents the first serious attempt to deal with the problem of Communist aggression by internal subversion against which we have, so far, found no effective answer. I derive great hope from that provision. In this respect, let us consider, for instance, the unhappy position of Indonesia, whose welfare means more to Australia than, perhaps, does that of any otber nation in the area, 'because Indonesia is so close to Australia. The real danger to Indonesia is not from an act of military aggression by a Communist country; it is from the possibility of rebellion inspired by communism inside Indonesia itself. This treaty provides a ready means whereby the Government of that country, if it were threatened by inindependence and integrity of the counternal subversion, could ask for assistance, tries and territories of South-East Asia and a ready means by which such assistance could be given. When we consider the importance of this treaty, and the great benefits which this country and the free world can derive from it if it is made to work effectively, it seems to me that the attitude of the Opposition is somewhat niggardly and carping. That is explained, I believe, by tbe obvious dilemma in which the two sections of the Opposition find themselves, because, as events which I shall not go into in detail have recently shown, there is a clear division in the Opposition, tion of this attitude? Why did he say not only on this matter, but also on other matters of the same sort. Thero are the pro-Communists, and there are the agree and those who do not agree, and their attitude on this treaty cuts right through the centre of that division. What have they decided to do? They have compromised. They have decided to accept the treaty, but to move amendments. At first, so we are told by the press, which seems to have the most accurate reports on these matters, the executive of the Labour party decided that tbe Opposition would oppose tbe treaty if the amendments were not accepted. But the majority of the party itself rejected that view and decided to accept the treaty with or without amendments. So we take it that the majority, at the moment, is adopting the anti-Communist view, and to that extent I think we should be grateful. There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition has failed completely to express an anti-Communist view in hia approach to the pact. He treated this House last night to a most astonishing speech in which, I agree completely with the honourable member for Angas, his proCommunist sympathies were never more clearly shown. In the part of his speech which attracted my attention most, he said that tbe statements contained in tbe preamble of the bill might be quite true but were irrelevant. Irrelevant! What are those statements? They have been read to tbe House before, and I do not want to go through them all again, but they begin with a declaration that the and the south-west Pacific are threatened by tbe aggressive policies of international communism. Is that fact irrelevant to the treaty and to the bill? Was tbe Korean war irrelevant to Australia's safety? Were the events in Indo-China irrelevant to the history of our time and to our chances of survival? Is the threat of subversion in Indonesia irrelevant to us? Is the Leader of the Opposition living in some strange dream world of his own, or is there another reason for his adopthat these things are irrelevant to the treaty? He went on to explain his view. He said that any one who knows the history of two world wars knows thai fascism and nationalism are equally as productive of .aggression as is communism. Now what significance is there in l is introduction of the word "" fascism"" in this debate? What danger is there of fascist aggression to Australia to-day, or of fascist movements in Asia? What is this treaty for ? It is for the .defence of this country, of the countries of South-East Asia, .and of 'the free world against the threat of Communist aggression. Let us turn, then, and examine the bitter denunciation by the Leader^of the Opposition of America's reservation. We know that America, in attaching its signature to tie treaty, put in the reservation that its obligations under the treaty extended only to Communist aggression. The Leader of the Opposition bas been subtly suggesting that America has 1 adopted only a limited obligation while we lave, been led into undertaking an unlimited obligation-in other words, that it has sold us a pup. That is the real purpose of his denunciation of America's reservation. In seeking an explanation of the rigbt honourable gentleman's attitude on these two points, I have turned to that Communist organ, the Tribune, to find the officially stated attitude of the Communist party in Australia to the Manila pact. I find that the treaty is denounced by the Communists as a part of the pattern of American pro-fascist aggression. The attack made iby the Tribune on tbe pact takes two lines-an attack on fascism, and an attack on America's activities in world affairs. So again we find that the Leader of the Opposition, in bis attack on the bill, has followed the Communist line. He attacks the preamble of tbe bill because of its clear and plain statement of the Coromunist threat to this country. But wht.t is the treaty for? The treaty is a treaty for mutual defence against Communist aggression and Communist subversion. And what could be more appropriate than that its purpose should be stated clearly to this Parliament, and to the people, in the preamble of the bill? America's reservation. But that is perfectly understandable from America's history, from its constitutional position, and from the fact that the treaty must Mr Osborne. be ratified by Congress before it can become 'effective under American Constitutional law. It is .perfectly understandable that an American .statesman signing that treaty woald make it clear that America's obligations extend only to communism. I believe that I have explained to the House the reason for the attitude taken by the Leader of the Opposition. With subtlety, ne has taken and expounded the 'Communist line in objection to the treaty, and, unfortunately, he appears to have taken with him some of his colleagues who have not discerned his true purpose. Let us now turn to the amendments which have been suggested by the Opposition. The first one seeks to provide that ratification of the treaty by Australia shall not be effective until the treaty has been ratified, or until we have firm assurances of intended ratification, by the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand. Well, what would be the use of such a provision? We are the leading party in this treaty. The Minister for External Affairs, far more than any other individual, is responsible for the formulation of the plan and for the fact that it has reached treaty form. Are we, therefore, to take the lead in attaching reservations to our ratification of it and in imposing delays on it? What would be the use if we did, because, in fact, if Great Britain or the United States did not ratify the treaty ,and come in behind it enthusiastically, it would be, in reality, a dead letter.. Wha.t would it matter what reservations we attached to it in that case ? That proposal is part and parcel of the legalistic attitude which the Leader of the Opposition always brings to matters of this sort. He does not want a really effective working treaty. What be wants is a nice document. But international treaties are not construed precisely and . nicely as are the legal documents of individuals. 'They depend upon goodwill and good intention. If those factors are not present, treaties will not work. If they He attacks are, treaties provide tihe means and the formulae whereby nations may solve their problems and gain common .action. I say that the first amendment proposed fey the Opposition is unnecessary, and would !>e harmful to the extent that it would sug! gest that Australia has flonbts about the ratification of the treaty and is not taking the lead in its ratification, as we have done in its formulation. Therefore, I say that the proposal should be rejected. The second amendment would be really harmful, though, as far as 1 ean see, no member of the Opposition who has yet spoken has observed that fact. The proposal suggests that, before any armed forces .are made available by Australia .under the provisions of the treaty, tbe prior approval of the Parliament should be obtained. It looks innocuous enough on the surface, but what would 'be the constitutional effect of such a provision 1 Tie treaty .in itself does not in any way enlarge the .constitutional powers or rigibts of the Government. It does not effect the constitutional status of the Government in relation to the armed forces of the country. Under the British system of parliamentary government, with a Cabinet responsible to the Parliament, defence is pre-eminently an executive function. It is a responsibility of the govornment of the day. The Government has the right, and in some cases the obligation, to declare war without delay. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that, under the .existing law, tbe Royal Australian Navy may 'be committed to action in any part of the world at any time by the government of the day. The Royal Australian Air Force is in the same position, and the Australian Regular Army, under the terms of its enlistment, can also be committed to action in any part of the world. It is true, of conrse, thatj under the provisions of the Defence Act, .the Citizen Military Forces or national servicemen in the Army cannot be sent to serve outside Australia, and the Parliament would have to approve of any intention so to commit them. But what would be the effect of the proposed amendment? Although the Government is now free to commit the Navy to action in any part of the world, if the .amendment were carried it would not be free to commit the Navy in any part of the treaty area. In other words, we would have tbe wholly ridiculous position that the Government wwuid be free to use the naval and air forces available for tbe defence of this country anywhere except in the area most vital to Australia's defence. The position would ibe .completely absurd, and I should 'be interested .to know whether the Leader of the Opposition would like the House to believe that he 'is not aware of that fact. The treaty should be welcomed and applauded as. a forward move in securing the safety and security of this country. It is not the final word. There are countries in-the area which have not joined but which we hope will join. If we think of the situation in which we live, we realize that this country benefits greatly by the signature of the treaty. We live in a strange dualism in this time. On the one hand, we must be ready at any moment with force of arms to defend ourselves against Communist aggression and insurrection. There is theneed to be ready at any moment to fight for our security. A t the same time, on fhe other hand, there is the need to work for and to find peace. Unless both tbose purposes are served, there is no hope for the world. We must, while keeping our powder dry, see that our forces are ready, and that we are alert to recognize the threat of aggression against us in any part of the world and we must promote peace at all times. That is the extraordinary dilemma and the great difiBculty that faces the free world to-day. This treaty recognizes both of those needs. It recognizes the need for common action against aggression. It recognizes the need of some of the signatory countries for the help of the other countries against subversion. It recognizes at the same time the need for common action to promote the economic welfare of tbe region and our obligations to each other if we are to live in peace. The treaty deserves unanimous ratification by the House, and the Minister deserves the thanks of the House and the country for his success in bringing it about. honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne) has attempted to use a most important occasion, that occasion being the debate on a bill to ratify the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty, as a vehicle for an all-out attack on the",54,Opposition Membeb Wha T Is For The Purposes Of Meeting This Common

It has become a habit for the young tories of the Government parties-unfor tunately, on this occasion I must include among them the honourable member for of every possible opportunity to launch personal attacks on the Leader of the Opposition. If the Government is looking for the co-operation of the Opposition, it is going the wrong way about it by putting up its juniors, who are half parsonical in their attitude, mostly dreary and completely misinformed, when it wants to tell us anything about Seato or other international arrangements. That is not the way to get co-operation from this side of the House. Let me put the position plainly and clearly. In the first place, we are not opposing this legislation. We have suggested two perfectly reasonable amendments, because we know the fears and anxieties of people outside the Parliament. The great majority of the Australian people do not go as fast as we do in regard to collective agreements and the employment and deployment of our servicemen overseas. We are only as strong as are our own people. I think the two amendments that have been suggested are reasonable and reflect some of the anxiety of the populace which sent us to this House. Yet they have been denounced as mere communism, and there has been talk of the Leader of the Opposition having put himself in the way of being almost an agent of the Communists. That kind of prattle by the under-developed geniuses on the other side of the House in regard to foreign affairs is becoming rather noisome. We are getting fed up with it. I suggest to the Minister for Territories ( Mr montade, that we get from them ad Hasluck), who is now in charge of the House, that our propositions are reasonable. The bonorable member for Evans is in some kind of mental torment. He is looking for red propaganda everywhere. He is like a political spinster who goes home at night and looks under the bed for a red. Apparently he found one, because he came into the House in great consternation. for Angas made quite a good speech when he got off the subject on which Governor. Haylen. ment members seem to be becoming quite paranoic and dealt with the subject under discussion. Tbe Opposition is interested in this matter just as deeply as tbe Government. We accept our responsibilities, and the Government knows that we accept them. Honourable members opposite talk about the framework of the United Nations. The man who has been traduced and maligned in this House was one of the most dogged architects for peaoe in our time in the United Nations, but junior members who have just come in the Parliament have made him the victim of the latest type of pinchpenny gossip. If we want to keep this debate on a proper level, we should discuss our obligations under this treaty, tbe perplexities that will assail us and the other things we have to consider. Miscalling the Leader of the Opposition is a cheap way to discuss an international treaty. If the other signatories to the treaty are listening to this debate, they will think the Government bas declared war on the Labour partya party which, by the test of the last general election, has a greater number of supporters in this country than the Government parties, although the arrangement of electoral boundaries enabled the Government parties to take oflice. I return to the' point that we should deal with this treaty in a more sober way. I feel that I am justified in reminding some of the honourable members opposite that the way to achieve amity and a unified approach to the problem is not to keep on miscalling the leader of this most powerful party, to treat this occasion as a cheap holiday and an opportunity to beat their breasts, tell us how patriotic they are and talk the nonsense, the rodonauseam about how noble they are on the other side of the House and what a lot of pikers we are on this side. That is not the question at all. Our problem is how to get a unified approach by the Australian people to new, dangerous and almost imponderable problems. Tbe Labour party held a meeting to discuss the matter. We talked about it for two hours before we came into the House. We went through every article of the The honourable member treaty. Was that a dereliction of duty? It was rather an honourable acceptance of guardianship and trusteeship. When",58,Opposition Membeb Wha T Is For The Purposes Of Meeting This Common
146,Angas ( Mr Downer),"to take advantagewe suggest two amendments, why should not they be considered? Why should they be picked up between the finger and thumb of the Minister and tossed away? They are worthy of consideration. In dealing with this treaty, there are many things that must be considered. Surely it is not wrong for the Leader of the Opposition to say that everything that could have been in the treaty is not in it. He does not say that he could do any better. .He bas said that, so far as the Asian peoples are concerned, something has happened that is good. Pakistan and the other countries that have been mentioned are the Islamic spine of resistance to communism. Will they be impressed with our sincerity when they hear one member of this House point the finger at another member and talk about his lack of bona fides in this matter? If honourable members opposite read the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition last night, they will find no smell of parties to those treaties say, "" We are communism there. They will see an analytical mind at worka mind for which this country should be grateful. They will see a deep and all-pervasive study of problems that are known to him from his long experience of the United Nations. When he makes suggestions about what should be done-hi s suggestions are sober enough-wh y should tbe answer from back-benchers opposite be, "" This is Communist stuff. This is the same old line"" ? Honourable members opposite should not be too smug about these things. They sbould look a little deeper than the surface. The Leader of the Opposition may be a. man who interprets the United Nations Charter much more humanely than tbey do. There is nothing warlike about the Charter. It talks of the amalgamation of peoples for peace. It talks of taking up the agonizing burden of achieving peace, if not in onr time, at any rate in the time of generations to come. I detest communism in all its forms and penetrations, but I think the Leader of the more pleasant and more dignified lanOpposition is justified in saying that the guage should be used in the preamble. preamble of this bill is a piece of naked bad taste. Of course it is. Many magnificent documents have emanated from thc United Nations. The charter of Unesco states that war begins in the minds of man. Would not it be better to use language of the kind used in tbose documents than to say, "" Since the Communists are about to attack us, we, the Australian people, will do so and so "". That reminds me of the two tailors of Tooley-street, wbo, being concerned about their taxes, addressed a note to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, which began, "" We, the people of England "". Let us be logical. We are a nation of only 9,000,000 people. An aggressive preamble in this bill is quite unnecessary. If we want beautiful language, if we want limpid language, if we want understanding, if we want something that in the long-run will bring peace rather than bloody conflict, let us look at the language used in the North Atlantic Treaty, tbe United Nations Charter, and the ANZUS pact. They all use moderate language. They do not plead the cause of war or aggression. They do not contain diatribes against the Communists. The dedicated to the pursuit of peace, but, reluctantly and with sadness, we organize ourselves into groups for our own security because of the circumstances that surround us "". I think the Leader of the Opposition has every right to criticize the way in which the preamble of the bill is framed. It states, in effect, that, as our independence is threatened, we have wangled a collective security bargain against tbe Communists that is to our advantage. Tbe persistent references, many of them snide, to the motives of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter are not good for either side of the House. It may be that, in the long-run, he is looking for something that we cannot see. The honourable member for Evans, who took parts of tbe right honourable gentleman's speech and tried to make something derogatory to the Opposition out of them, contributed nothing to the debate. There is every justification for suggesting that If eventually we come to the point of sacrifice and have to throw everything into the hazard with our allies, let us remember that we are only a very small nation which, fortunately, has powerful friends. God has been beneficent to us in that way, at least so far. But we must remember that w.e are Australasians and that we have to live in as Asian Goutraunity. There ia no. need for us to. go about rattling the sabre or dragging the swwd around. There is mo need for us to adopt this cock-sparrow attitudetowar in the Pacific, because it would bedreadshould not take theinitiative.. That, may ful if it ' ever occurred. In the circumnot appear to be important,, but it would stances, I think the Leader of the Opposition has every justification for drawing attention to the undiplomatic and' rugged language used' ih' the preamble. The next point, taken by the members of the Government parties is that these two amendments should not have been sug;srested.. Apparently, ini the view of the Government, there is something sacrilegious about having to look at the document. Some of the greatest United Nations documents have been flops. Some of the most frightful things have occurred as a result of agreements made with the best of intentions. Who would say that everything in the Yalta Agreement was good? The Potsdam Agreement, although made with the best intentions in tbe world, gave China over to the Eussians and the Communists. Agreement, when we look at it in its historical' perspective^ was a; tragedy, but difficulties involved. Nobody knows them the good and true men whoapproved of it did not see it in that light. Nobody wouid suggest -that Boosevel't, Churchill and any of their associates' were doing anything except what they thoughtto be best, hut. tha treaties' did) not work out as they anticipated. The Japanese knew they had! to capitulate^ hut we made a deal with Stalin that gave bim Manchuria, and a lead into Yenan and: the Communists huddling im. the caves in the. south-west of China.. AB those thingsments as. a precaution, and as, something happened because we were not aware of theimplications, of theagreements and did not appreciate the cunning of the. man who. alleged that he. was: our ally. Those experiences should warn us toperuse documents of this: kind most carefully. TheMinister forTerritories ( Mr Casey), whose main performance at Hasluck), as an officerof. the Department of External Affairs,. was> associated with the United Nations. trickery of the written word, and the treacherous role of the protocol which, being boiled down into good English, may mean precisely what it does; not, appear to. mean. Mr Haylen. The Opposition asks that, the amendment, dealing with the ratification of the treaty be accepted'. The amendment suggests, that,, if other nations decide to ratify the. treaty, we should sign either concurrently, with them or later,, but webe. a safeguard. Who can blame us for seeking toimpose, safeguards?' I think it. is a part of our duty not. to be toobrash, reckless, unconcerned and superpatriotie in these matters, because the prize is Australia itself.. The seeond! amendment relates to the question of war. Who in this. Parliament would' say sincerely that that is not the subject of deep anxiety by people outside the Parliament? As thegreat. Leader of the Labour party, the. late Mr John Curtin, brought the people slowly to accept a concept of military service further away from Australia, than had been envisaged until then, except under a voluntary system, so we have to bring the people slowly to a realization of what this treaty means. We do not have The. Potsdam to slap the community in. the. face with this idea.. We know the constitutional better than doesthe Leader' of the Opposition, the most eminent constitutional authority in thia country. Therefore,, the Opposition submits that the treaty should be analysed. We. know that it. has. been possible, in British countries, for the Prime Minister of the day to order forcesinto action, but, vesy soon afterwards the Government, has been obliged to face the Parliament and fhe people-. The Oppositionis: suggesting the amendr that should be discussed. Already it. cam be observed, from the. attitude, of. the, Government, that; it is going to toss these amendments out. It has taken hold of Seato as, though it were amagic talisman.. The. Minister for External Affairs( Mr Manila was to wear a barong tagalog and dance the gavotte with some very chaormr He knows the. ing ladies -that , iss all I read about; the matter in the presa-wa s prepared toaccept this thing holus bolus^ without consideration. If the Opposition takes it topieces-, if it is; a little bitter about it, if it. is. prepared to sift every word and to submit amendments, does that give any warrant for an attack on the Leader of the Opposition or for the .suggestion that he is trying to play the game of another -eountry'? That is a completely unworthy suggestion. Those people of Asia who are looking for amity, decency, and a certain diplomatic dignity, are not finding it in the attitude of the Government, which thinks that, because it has a treaty, something wbich can be brought home from tours abroad, the whole thing is finished. It is the solemn duty of the Australian Labour party to examine this measure. The Opposition is discharging that duty, and is pressing on with the amendments that have been foreshadowed. It hones that, in the committee stage, the Government will consider the real significance of them. There are points in the treaty to which one must give grave consideration. Article TV., about which the Leader of the Opposition had much to say, is the pivot upon which the whole treaty swings. It has been discussed in detail. I only wish to state, in passing, that the proposed amendments folow an extremely close consideration of the whole matter. The preamble of the bill is bad. It is rugged and offensive. Its language is brutal and unnecessary. Some one should approach .the Minister, or his draftsmen, and .ask that something be done about it. If the Minister is unable to Bupply the necessary words to improve it, let him borrow them from the other splendid documents that have been drawn up by the United Nations, and let him not parade naked aggression in this House as a reason for ratifying a document which has, for its final purpose, the preservation of peace, and not the prosecution of war. member to read the fourth paragraph. Government has made no reference whatever to the pacific intentions that lie behind the document. It was left to the honourable member for Batman( Mr knows that the white man is anathema Bird) to point out the manner in which we can win friends and influence people in the Pacific area. He referred to plans that could be used for the strengthening ! of the Asian nations which, of necessity, are not very happy about being associated with this 'treaty. The power drag is there, perhaps, and a lot of them are refraining from subscribing to it. In my view, the honorahle member for Batman made a splendid contribution to the debate when he referred to the manner in which good intentions may he displayed. Let us f ace up to the hard and bitter facts that we have a White Australia policy which is anathema to the Asians, that we have, or are alleged to have, empty land that is capable of great development, and that we are proceeding with that development very slowly. It is with those facts in mind that our enemies in Asia canvass against us. Before we express any intention of goodwill and mutual security along the lines that are envisaged in the treaty, we must convince the Asians that we are, to use a good old Australian term, fair dinkum. Tbe honourable member for Batman carried the matter to a rather useful conclusion when he stated that, in addition to these things, we must show charity. Is the Government showing charity when it states, in effect, in tbe preamble of the bill, "" We bave the strength with us. We have the United States of America, France, the British peoples and some segments of the Asian continent behind us, and therefore we are going to rattle the sabre "" ? Buried somewbere in the bill is another matter of greater significance, to wbich the honourable member for Batman directed attention. He pointed out-and I am sure the Minister will agree with him-that we must .develop the peaceful side of this matter by ascertaining tbe degree to which we, and other instrumentalities of the United Nations, can be useful in preserving peace in Asia by sharing some of the burden. bei read Article HI . porters of the Government were responsible for the troubles in 'China.

The Mr HAYLEN -Tories like suprattle the sabre too, and they are prepared Churchill during World War IL , just as to adopt the Chinese equivalent of the statements that are contained in the preamble of this bill. What does tbe Government hope to achieve as a result of this bill ? Peace or war ? Tbe Opposition appeals to the Minister to change the phraseology. It is of no use defending it because it follows parliamentary practice. the honourable member mean ? the bill which refers to communism. It may be a cheap invitation to a people who see Communists everywhere to remember that tbey will be watched, with Casey lowering the boom at any tick of tlie clock, wbich, of course, is not the that aspect of Seato, because I have excase. The Minister should re-examine the preamble. He should also answer the points raised by the honourable member for Batman in relation to the developsome of the younger supporters of the ment of channels of friendship to those countries that are already with us, and to those countries that may join us by subscribing to instruments similar to the treaty under consideration, and in relation, to the degree to wbich the spearmeet the maximum of resistance from this head of goodwill may be thrust into the Asian continent. The Standing Orders prevent a discussion of the Colombo plan, but tbere is inherent in Seato the samo Christian and anti-war approach. We must do mighty things. Although this country may have special plans for conserving its food and selling it at good prices, it must decide, sooner or later, how much it can share with Asia, because the tragedy that has befallen Asia is the result of the white man's work rather than the things that the Asian bas done of his own volition. The words "" peace"", "" sacrifice"", "" freedom "", and "" liberty "" are not in tbe to remember that there are people outside Asiatic language. The meaning of those words was displayed in India by our missionaries, whose warning we refused to heed. We were willing to listen to the soldiers, and to the civil servants who bilities of atomic warfare and all tbe were running the line for their bosses in Whitehall. It was only because England found itself in a miraculous position, in wbich it usually finds itself when it is confronted with a crisis, that trouble was avoided. England discovered Sir Winston it discovered Mr Attlee, wbo had sufficient courage to point out the way that the sub-continent of India was going. We left India witb good grace and, as the Minister for External Affairs knows only too well as a result of bis work in that country, we left them a civil service that was already established and theknow-how of running a democracy. Thesame statement applies to Pakistan. We should export to those countries, not only treaties which are prefaced by threats,. Colombo plans and otber things, but also goodwill and the know-how for the development of them. This debate should have been conducted with that in mind. I do not wish to say any more about pressed myself before. I am in complete and utter agreement with the treaty, but I disagree, first, witb the attitude of Government who seem to think in these terms: "" It is a nice day. Let us go out and shoot somebody "". The person they select is the leader of the Labour party. If they start that kind of thing, they will party. Secondly, I think the Government should not be so arrogant in relation to the phraseology of the bill. PerhapsI have reiterated some of these matters too often, but they are important, as honourable members on this side of the House have been trying to tell tbe Government since the commencement of the debate. Thirdly, and finally, two amendments have been foreshadowed which will be discussed at the committee stage and which, in themselves, are reasonable. If the Minister contends that one of tbem concerns a constitutional practice, which cannot be altered by this bill, I beg bim the Parliament who wish this treaty to be explained. Tbe people of this country are being conditioned for a future which is full of hazards. The possiother shocking imponderables that beset our dreams and haunt our waking hours should be translated into simple language for the people who send us here.

154,Mr Joske (Balaclava) [5.12],"This the world, if they really want peace andratified by us until it bas been ratified, 1 or there are fom assurances of intended ratification, by the United Kingdom, the United States of. America aaid. New Zealand. This, talk of waiting for the other man to do something reminds me of the Walcheren expedition im 1809. Honourable members may remember that the Earl of Chatham and Sir Eichard Strachan waited on one another and nothing waa done. In other words, if we were to wait until somebody else did something about this treaty, we might find that nothing would be done. This country bas proudly taken the lead in bringing about this treaty, and it should continue to take the lead. In relation to. that part of the proposed amendment which is concerned with firm assurances of ratification by other countries, I suggest that we have firm assurances already. The treaty has been signed. ""What more could we want than that? Are we now to say to these great Powers who have, joined us, "" You have signed the treaty, but we do not believe that you are going to carry out the provisions of the treaty "" ? What an extra ordinary point of view! Do honourable members opposite realize, when they put forward this, amendment that they make themselves' absurd in the eyes of the world, particularly in the eyes of the countries with which we are joining?. It is simply ludicrous. No doubt the amendments will be put forward on the basis that honourable members opposite have, as. they have said,, a great constitutional lawyer leading them. They may not quite understand what he is getting at, but because he is supposed to be a great constitutional lawyer, they will follow him. I believe that a man who is entitled to be called a great constitUr tional lawyer must show breadth of knowledge and greatness of intellect. The amendment bears no traces of those attributes. Let us. look at' the second proposed entitled to deal with hisremarks and amendment, which is to the effect that, point out the extraordinary character of before any armed forces are made availthem if they happen to be extraordinary. able by Australia under, or in accordance with, any of the provisions of. the treaty, the prior approval of the Parliament shall be obtained. that? Ur. Joske. the Parliament together,, a powerful attack like that on Pearl Harbour oi' something of the kind could happen, and we should be. annihilated before the Parliament had time to meet. That would not matter to the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin), because he never would be missed^ As the terms of the treaty show, it may be necessary for instant action to be taken, and, that being so, it is certain that Australia will definitely take that instant action. In those cirEumstances, one has no doubt that the Parliament would be called together, and indue course told all about it, and that the Parliament 1 would confirm what had beendone by the Government. Consequently, the provision suggested by the Leader of the Opposition is unnecessary. Erom the viewpoint of making the treaty adequate, according to the needs of this particular time, it is essential that, the Government should have the power, as it would have the duty, to. take instantly the necessary steps torepel invasion. The1 next point of criticism , but upon which no 1 amendment has been. m:o>ved, was isn connection with the preamble of the treaty. We have just listened to a speech by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) in which he objected toGovernment supporters criticizing the Leader of the Opposition. J do not: know whether to call his speech an apology or a lectureperhaps it wasboth. He seemed to be making a grand apology-in capitalsfor his leader, but at the. same time he was lecturing Government supporters, for daring to criticize his leader. It i's a strange thing that we should not be allowed to criticize the Leader of the Opposition, but that his own party should be permitted to so criticize him-if criticism is not"" much too mild a word-in their caucus. Surely .if the leader of a party speaks in this House, those in opposition to him, in this case the Government supporters-, are Now let us consider the criticism put forward 1 by the Leader of the Opposition. He objected to the preamble of the bill which readsWhereas theindependence and integrity of the countries and territories of South-East",64,Opposition Membeb Wha T Is For The Purposes Of Meeting This Common

Is. it what the treaty is dealing w i th or is it not? I am asking those questions, but I am not getting an answer from the Opposition. AgainAnd whereas those Communist policies have already shown themselves im Korea, Indo-China and elsewhere by armed aggression, andi by armed insurrection assisted from without and otherwise: Is that true or is not true? AgainI do not get an answer from the Opposition. Once again I ask whether that is what the treaty is to deal with or whether it is not. AndI hear no answer. The preamble continuesAnd whereas those Communist policies reprehonorable member get for bis advice ? sent a common danger to the security of Australia and of the world generally and are a violation of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations: Surely that also is true. Then againAnd whereas, in consequence of the foregoing, countries in or concerned with the security of South-East Asia and tlie South-West Pacific have determined to join together for the purposes of meeting this common danger and of promoting the security and well-being oi the region of South-East Asia, and the South-West Pacific. That is perfectly true, indeed it is what the treaty is concerned about. Therefore, why does the Leader of the Opposition object to those principles being set out? We are fighting against aggression, as indicated in the preamble, but, strangely enough, whenever this Government proceeds to fight communism the Leader of the Opposition immediately proceeds to fight the Government. He and his party are supporting this bill, but immediately the Government indicates that it is attacking communism, the Leader of the Opposition instantly objects, and his apologizer, the honourable member for Parkes, says that this preamble is offensive. To whom is it offensive ? Of course it is offensive to Eussia and Communist China, but to whom is it offensive in this House? It is offensive to the Leader of the Opposition, to one individual only, but I am not prepared to say that it is offensive to his party, and I am sure that there are plenty of members of the Labour party to wbom it is not offensive. It is only to this particular individual that it is offensive. The only way in which the Leader of the Opposition attempts to deal with this preamble is to say that it is irrelevant, and that these recitals do not appear in certain, other treaty documents and accordingly should not appear in this bill. Surely we must deal with each particular matter separately.. One has often seen lawyers argue in court, but they should never refer to documents that have no relevance to their cases. I cannot help wondering what would happen if the Leader of the Opposition had been arguing before a. court on lines similar to the lines upon which he argued against this measure. He would not have got what we call "" a good run "" from the judge. able member for Watson will get my advice free of charge if he does not remain silent. the relevance of tbe preamble of the biU. It is very relevant, indeed, for two reasons. One is that we aire not entering into this treaty to be made a party toa possible war between Pakistan and India, for example. Consequently, in order to guard ourselves against such a situation and point out our real purposes, the preamble has been included. The second reason is to bring ourselves into line with the United States of America, and to show that our obligations under this treaty are exactly the same as those that have been undertaken by America. Both America and Australia are entering this treaty with one purpose only; that is, to fight Communist aggression. honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) to appreciate relevance, because we very rarely hear anything relevant from him in this House. The Leader of the Opposition stated that the preamble was not relevant. On the contrary, it is highly relevant. It puts the United States of America and .Australia in exactly the same position in relation to the treaty.

It resembles the form of propaganda that the Communists use so often in trying to drive a wedge between the British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States. The Communists try to destroy that good relationship by contending that there is a difference between the obligations of the allied nations. That is entirely inaccurate. We are in exactly the same position in relation to this treaty and both parties intend to stand together to preserve the peace of the world. I wish now to deal further with the form of the treaty. It provides that there shall be co-operation and consultation between the various signatories of the treaty. That provision has been designed with a view to planning ahead, to reach conclusions by agreement, and to prevent rash or provocative action that a single nation might possibly take. Anything that is done will be the result of joint consultation. The only exception will be in circumstances where instant action is called for and then, of course, instant action has to be taken. Otherwise, the whole object of the treaty is to ensure that the powers shall consult together and shall decide in unison what shall be done. The purpose is not only to meet actual aggression on the part of the Communists, but also to deal with subversive methods that are so commonly used. I do not propose to discuss that matter in detail, because the Minister has covered it to some extent. What will occur as the outcome of this treaty? A permanent organization for the defence of South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific will be set up, and there will be a unity of defensive purpose in that area. However, that is only one side of the picture. It is quite clear that under this treaty, Australia will be definitely pledged, should fhe occasion arise, to send men and equipment overseas. The reason is that it is far better to defend ourselves outside Australia than to have an enemy invade Australia first. In approving the treaty, the Parliament will give the Government authority to act, and there will be no occasion for the authority to be given by the Parliament at a later date. The authority should be Mr Joske. given now, so that the nations with which we have entered into a treaty will know where we stand and what we will do. They must know that we intend to carry out our duties and obligations under tbe treaty. Provision is also made under the treaty for economic aid for the underdeveloped countries of South-East Asia. That is an exceedingly important provision. For a long time, those countries have suffered from what is called colonialism. We want those countries to understand that, so far as we and the other parties to the treaty are concerned, there is nothing but the utmost goodwill towards them. There is no intention of bringing back colonialism or any otber form of imperialism whether it be Communist or something else. The intention is that they should grow in political stature and retain the independence that they have recently won, and that they should be helped economically. The intention is that they should have the food, the housing and the health services which, in their underdeveloped state, they have not had. Much has already been done for those countries through the United Nations organization and under the Colombo plan. It is necessary that there should be still more development along those lines and I bave no doubt that that will be done. Broadly speaking, this treaty should achieve much. It should achieve what it is designed to bring about-the freedom, security and peace of South-East Asia and the maintenance of the peace of tbe world. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) followed to some degree, but not in such extreme language, the line that has characterized the supporters of the Government ever since they were returned to power. Whetheri t be an international treaty or a domestic situation, they have to seek some paltry political propaganda out of the troubles of the nation or the travail of the world. So it was with the honourable member for Balaclava. He has sought to claim that any honourable member of this Parliament who adopts a certain stand must needs be acting in defence of or adherence to",66,Opposition Membeb Wha T Is For The Purposes Of Meeting This Common
162,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [5.36],"the Communist party or Communist opinions. The broad reference, of course, is to members of the Australian Labouv party in Opposition. The history of tbe Australian Labour party speaks for itself. Whenever the menace of communism has raised its head in industry or followed undemocratic lines abroad, members of the Labour party at home and representatives of the Labour party abroad have always endeavoured to stand up against the Communist challenge. We do not mouth the mealy sentiments to which honourable members opposite so often give tongue, but we stand on firm principles. We need no phsychological defences. We stand, as a political party, for democratic instinations which have appended their sigtutions. We oppose all undemocratic institutions. In the forums of the world, mainly through the voice of the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), we have consistently taken a stand against all undemocratic forces in favour of international machinery that seeks to solve the problems of tbe world by arbitration and not by recourse to arms. We have taken a similar stand on great national issues at home. Notwithstanding the sneers and slurs of members of the^ Government, we shall maintain our attitude. It has characterized the Labour party since its birth, and characterizes it Affairs has stated in his second-reading to-day. The honourable member for Balaclava said that there was no need for the amendments that the Opposition has foreshadowed. The first is that we should not other members have ratified it. Our amendment refers not to all parties, but to the principal parties to the present agreement. Two things might be said. The first is that this is a common course in international agreements. It is commonly provided that until a certain number or a certain group of powers have ratified an international agreement, it shall have no force in law at all. Tbat is what we seek to do now. We seek to have applied, in this case, a provision treaty by the House of Bepresentatives that has been common to many international agreements on defence, monetary and trade organizations that have been ratified by this Parliament. Some havo been approved during my membership of the Parliament. Not only is it usual; it is also common sense. At a solemn meeting of both branches of the legislature, we will approve this measure. Then, if the treaty is not ratified by the United Kingdom and the United States of America, our solemn procedures in this Parliament in passing this bill will have been a sorry farce, because unless those major nations become parties to the agreement, the treaty will not operate. So the Opposition says, that we should follow on this occasion, the normal practice in connection with agreements of this type, and that ratification by Australia sbould not take place until the agreement has been ratified by the major natures to it. The honourable member for Balaclava has also suggested that one of the amendments foreshadowed by the Labour party is an insult to the great United States of America, because it seeks firm assurances from that country. As I followed the course of the discussions at the Manila conference, I gained the impression that the American Secretary of State, Mr Dulles, was not absolutely certain that Congress would accept the proposed treaty. The Minister for External speech that America has no territorial interests in the area concerned, and has little cause to give guarantees, in certain circumstances, of military support. Acceptance of a commitment of this kind is contrary to the ratify this convention until practice of American governments for many years. It is opposed, too, to a large body of isolationist thought, although that attitude is not so strong to-day as it was in the past, which objects to American entanglement in European wars, and, indeed, to American commitments of man-power, munitions and materials in any wars. So, Mr John Poster Dulles had to impose certain conditions in order to give himself the best chance of securing the ratification of this and, primarily, the .Senate. Accordingly, he had to get this assurance, and even then, because of the separation of the powers of the executive and the legislature in the United States of America, he has no guarantee that the treaty will be ratified by Congress. The Minister has directed attention to that matter in his second-reading speech. I emphasize that we are not insulting the United States, and that we are not making .any effort to insult that country. We are simply having .regard to the practical situation in America, to which the Minister has made pointed reference in bis second-reading speech. The honourable gentleman has also suggested that Opposition members either do not understand the Leader of the Opposition and his approach to this measure, or are following him willy-nilly, regardless of their own personal views. I make it clear that the views put by the Leader of the Opposition in this House are the views that have been expressed in the party room. The concurrence of members of the party to the two proposed amendments has been obtained. The amendments are reasonable, and they should appear in a bill of this kind. So the efforts of the honourable member are as cheap as was his effort to score off my colleague, the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) in the course of his remarks. The honourable gentleman has said that we do not dare to criticize the Leader of the Opposition. All we suggest to him, and, indeed, to Government supporters generally, is that their cheap sneers and unnecessary gibes serve no useful purpose for this country, and gain no credit for it abroad. Why do honourable members opposite seek to score a petty party political advantage on a matter of this kind ? The Leader of the Australian Labour party in this Parliament said that the statements in the preamble of the bill had no legal force and achieved no purpose. As a matter of fact, that aspect was not discussed at any length by the party. The Minister, in the course of his second-reading speech, pointed out that the American representative suggested at one stage that the text of tbe treaty itself should refer specifically to 'Communist aggression. The Minister proceeded to point out that the American suggestion was opposed hy the Australian representative, and by .the representatives of the other nations at Manila. So, at the request, perhaps on the insistence of our Minister and a majority of the other deleMr Tom. Burke. gates at the conference, the words to which fhe Leader of the Opposition objects were excluded from the treaty. The reason for their attitude concerns me not one whit, but I note (the keenness of the Minister to place them in this bill. The inclusion of the words would not have any legal force, and Australia would not derive any benefit from the organization. The purpose of the Minister is to trick some one, or to have some one object to the inclusion of the words, so that honorahle members opposite may again be able to point the finger of -scorn and say, "" You come out in defence of communism, or 'show your partiality for the Communist philosophy, ideology OT what-youw ill "" . I have often noticed this willingness on the part of Government supporters to sacrifice a national advantage, or diminish the importance of a solemn occasion so as to gain a miserable and temporary propaganda advantage. This is an important and valuable treaty. It is a pattern of regional agreements by which we can secure peace in our time, and in the time of our children and their children. Therefore, members of the Goverenment and members of the Parliament as a whole should give this matter the consideration it deserves, devoid of any .attempt to secure party political advantage, and devoid of cheap criticism, of which we have heard so much in this debate. The agreement is within the framework of the United Nations itself. We, as a Labour party, and as a Labour government, had a large part in the formation of that organization. We embarked upon it with high hopes, though with some doubts, because of the framework which was established at San Erancisco, and at later meetings which culminated in the inauguration of the General Assembly. I recall that members of the Australian delegation came back to Canberra and told of their fight against the adoption of the veto. The explanation was given that there was a ready agreement on enforcement action, and that when actual positive military moves were required, the veto was conceded to the Big Eive. However, the Australian delegation vigorously opposed the exercise of the veto on discussions of matters to be placed on an agenda for ordinary consultative procedure. It is possible, and I tbink it is probable, that the Minister for Territories ( Mr States of America would resist aggression Hasluck) was a member of that delegation. Members of tbe delegation, on their return to Australia, were criticized, by members of the present Government Who at that time sat in Opposition in this House. They were in Opposition then, but are in government now. They claimed, after the San Francisco conference, that our action as a government, through our representatives in America, created the danger of ruining the framework of the new United Nations Organization, and nullifying its efforts. The attitude which we took on that occasion through our spokesmen has been demonstrated to be correct by events since that to stop that aggressive move, the world time. We look upon Seato as another agreement made for collective security for certain peoples within a specified area heartedly to the treaty that this bill seeks and within the framework of the United Nations. I believe that the treaty is a very useful step forward. While I pay no glowing tribute to the Minister for External Affairs, anybody who can bring about regional pacts for tbe twin purposes that this treaty seeks to achieve ought to be congratulated by the Australian nation. This treaty seeks to do two things. right by warfare. The first is to show that aggression will not pay. If action along these lines had been taken long ago, we might have been spared the calamities tliat have from time to time befallen the world. However, we have learnt lessons from history. The treaty makes known to would be aggressors that, should they move their frontiers by force of arms, the collective force of specified nations will be brought into play against them. Tbat seems to be the only way to deter certain, nations. A movement of frontiers does not happen suddenly, but gradually over a period of years. Perhaps, as a result of injustice, ultimately some nations' consider that they might gain a benefit by having recourse to arms. I think it is evident to everybody that the two great world conflicts through which we have passed might have been averted had the nations, which became allies made their views known' earlier. Had it been made known to GerJJ -[99 ] many in 1914 that the combined force of Great Britain, France and the United by that country, World WarL might have been averted. It was a tardy recognition of the situation by the allies: that made possible that great conflict. The same is true of World Wai' II . Had the allies announced in 1939 that they would combine to resist aggression, that waiinight have been averted. So it is that, when international tension increases fri a stage at which war could easily eventuate, if a group of nations makes it abundantly clear that in tbe event of any nation-whethe r great or small:-movin g to alter its frontier by force of arms, the combined weight of the group will be applied might be spared the horrors of war. For that reason I give my support wholeto ratify. We know that, of itself, the treaty will not be sufficient. Trade, social and cultural needs must be satisfied before a real peace can exist. But the fundamental element, which the Parliament wholeheartedly supports, is the insistence that frontiers shall not be moved, differences overcome, or injustice be put In common with our great allies in World War II . , and otber powers, both great and small, wbo subscribe to our idteals of freedom, justice, and equity between' tbe peoples of the world, we make it clear by tbe treaty that we shall do our utmost to ensure that aggression by any nation will not pay, but that arbitration should prevail. But that is not suflicient without the implementation of the twin aims of the treaty. Before dealing with that, I want to refer to the Opposition's second proposed amendment. It provides that a force sball not be supplied, in pursuance of the treaty, without the approval of the Parliament. I regard that provision as a fundamental, democratic and necessary adjunct of any activity such as is contemplated by tbe treaty. First, that is a correct usage of democratic machinery. Secondly, the wholehearted support of the people of Australia would back a decision, of tbe Parliament. Both of those steps are Parliament, which is composed of the necessary if the people are to understand representatives of people of various polithe possible magnitude of our committical persuasion, ought to make the ments. Ordinary democratic procedure decision, and take responsibility, on their makes it necessary for the Parliament behalf, for the consequences, whether itself to make a decision before we great or small, short or long. commit forces to a war, because a small war can develop into a major conflict. In order to relieve the Executive Government of responsibility, it is necessary to continue my remarks later. for the Parliament to be consulted. member agree that time would be a factor? that aspect in a moment. The Executive Government in a democracy tends to take to itself great power. In a case like this, the determination of the limit of Australia's contribution should not rest upon the Executive. Both the honourable member for Evans ber for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) by interjection-state d that the making of a decision might involve a lapse of time, and so delay the prosecution of the effort that we would be forced to make. I do not accept that contention. ""When a certain situation developed not long ago, the Parliament was assembled within 24 hours, and passed the necessary measure in about two hours. It could have done so in less time than that. The decision was taken, not by the Executive, but by the Parliament assembled. The Government bas not disproved tbe wisdom of our proposal. The honourable member for Evans said that the Navy and the Air Force might have to go through a certain area, and that the amendment would put a limitation on their operations. The honourable member completely misjudged tbe situation. Wherever our forces may go today, they will be able to go if the amendI t authorizes me to appoint a committee ment is accepted. applies to action in pursuance of the Seato obligations. The amendment would not alter that position. Before warlike measures are taken, whether defensive or offensive, pursuant to the treaty obligations, the Parliament ought to be called together and the situation explained to the representatives of the people.

I do not put it forward on behalf of. the Governnient as a bill to make comprehensive amendments of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1949. It seeks to amend that act, but it does not attempt at this stage to make a comprehensive review of it. Nor should the fact that some provisions of the 1949 act will remain unchanged following the amendments to be made by this bill, be taken as implying that the Government has endorsed in principle, either in part or in the whole, some of those untouched portions of the principal act. It will be seen from what I shall say later that we have some other changes in mind and that we may, at a. later stage, ask the House to make the comprehensive review of the legislation that the Government considers to be necessary. As I have stated, tbe bill sets out to-do two things. This amendment of inquiry to examine the organization and operation of the waterfront industry and the other matters that honourable members will see set out in clause 11 of the bill. The second thing that the measure seeks to do is to vary the present procedure by which men enter the stevedoring industry for employment on the waterfront.",67,Opposition Membeb Wha T Is For The Purposes Of Meeting This Common

168,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister forThe reasons for the appointment of a committee of inquiry will, I believe, be obvious enough to most honourable members. The waterfront industry, throughout its history, has presented a complex set of problems. The industry is undoubtedly a difficult one, and the reasons for this trouble are not difficult to find. Stevedoring is one of the few remaining casual industries, and such efforts as have waterfront. The Government shares the been made from time to time to work out a system of permanent engagement for tbose in the industry have proved fruitless. What distinguishes it from most other industries is the fact that the nornecessary stoppages of work have imposed mal direct relationship between employer and employee does not exist. Subject to minor qualifications, only one union comes into the picture to represent the employees-the Federation of Australia, which is a powerful union of about 27,000 members. The registered employers of those waterside workers number about 450 bodies and persons. They include the shipowners and the stevedoring companies concerned. Some of the stevedoring companies are linked with the shipowners. Others are independent. Then there are the harbour trust authorities, and prominently in tbe picture in recent years has been the statutory authority appointed by the Australian Parliament in accordance with legislation introduced by the Labour Government. That body is known as tbe Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. I believe it to be a matter of notoriety tion is tbe government instrumentalitythat performance on the Australian waterfront over the years has caused widespread dissatisfaction. Performance on the waterfront is of importance to each and every Australian. It is certainly imwhich every one will agree is that the portant to every employer and every trade unionist. It is most emphatically important to every housewife in Australia, because the entire question of the cost of goods to Australian consumers is directly affected by what happens on Australia's waterfront. times I have to speak in elementary terms to the honourable member in order to convey my meaning. The belief is general throughout the community that the conduct of waterfront operations either by design-and malicious design at thator as a result of sheer incompetence, is very much less efficient than the community has a right to expect. I shall give the House later a few figures to demonstrate how much deterioration has occurred in what was at best, in recent years, a very modest performance on the view of most members of the general public that unwarranted delays, unnecessarily slow loading rates, a slow turnround of shipping, and frequent and unon the consuming public cost burdens that they should not have to bear. Freight rates have increased out of all proportion to the general rise of costs in Waterside Workers the post-war years. I am aware that there is room for controversy about these matters. There will be some who would place the blame for this unsatisfactory state of affairs entirely on the members of the Waterside Workers Federation. They will point to its Communist leadership as a principal factor in causing disruption and inefficiency. Others would blame the shipowners and will say that shipping freight increases are attributable to their rapacity and that inefficiency on the waterfront is the result of their incompetence. There will be others, who will include some from both the groups that I have just mentioned, who will declare that the prime cause of the unsatisfactory situathe Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. In fact, in relation to an industry in which there is so much room for disagreement, I think the only thing upon present state of the waterfront is, as it has been for many years, entirely unsatisfactory to the people of Australia. There will be others who will assert that there can be neither peace nor good management on the waterfront until management and labour are put in a position to deal directly with each other without having to overcome the impediment caused by an unwanted third party-the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board.

169,Mr Wakd,That fact is elementary.,72,Second Reading
170,Mr Holt,"It is elementary, and atresponsibility to learn the views of various interests, I have had to work my way through a mass of contradictory claims, denunciations, and conflicting allegations from various spokesmen of all the interests involved. It has been diffifashion as they are conducted to-day. cult enough for someone as close to those interests as I am to sift thc facts under -these circumstances, and it must he almost impossible for most people to obtain anything but a very distorted picture. Consequently, the Government considers that an impartial and objective fact-finding inquiry will be useful in this industry. It takes the view that comprehensive changes in the stevedoring industry legislation and in the organization of the waterfront are desirable. We hoped that we should have been in a position to make those changes during the current sessional period. Indeed, I have discussed with representatives of the unions concerned, of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, of the shipowners and of the other interests directly affected, some of the changes that I believed might usefully be considered. However, it soon became very obvious, as a result of those discussions, that there was considerable disagreement not only about the course that the Government should follow, but also even about the facts on which judgments should be made. We believe, therefore, that there is value in setting up a committee of inquiry to ascertain the facts. It is true that this will not be the first inquiry into the industry in recent years. There was an earlier inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Foster of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and, in more recent years, Mr Basten, a highly qualified expert in these matters, in the course of the review that he made also examined various aspects. Honourable gentlemen will have had the benefit of perusing Mr shipowners earned, he would hardly be Basten's report. Much, however, has happened since then, and if, as we believe, were true, that the shipowners would it will be necessary later to proceed with other changes in this legislation, then it is important that there should be an impartially found body of facts on which our own conclusions and the judgments of other persons can be based. impartial ? view can be expected to be impartial. honourable members opposite 1 The only comment I make, at this stage, with respect to the inquiry made by Mr Justice Foster is that it was made many years ago when operations on the waterfront were not conducted in the same At the committee stage, I shall explain in detail how it is proposed the committee shall be constituted and what its functions shall be; but, in passing, in order to give a general idea of what is proposed, I inform fhe House that we have in mind a committee of three members-the chairman to be, preferably, a person with legal qualifications, although not necessarily a judge, and of the two other members, one, I should hope, to be representative not of management in the maritime industries, but of management generally, and the other to be representative of labour, but not to be drawn from the union concerned. The committee, as the bill reveals, will be given adequate powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and the securing of information. I was rather interested to hear tbe interjections that were made eariier by honourable members opposite because those interjections implied that we are putting this proposal before the House at the behest of the shipowners. I have had many requests from the shipowners as I have had requests from the union, and all I can say at this point with regard to those matters is that the comprehensive review we shall arrange to have made later will be greatly assisted by the committee. But as to the matters which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) raised when he asked a question yester-day and spoke of the profits that the alleging now, if what he then implied request the Government to hold an inquiry of such a comprehensive nature by a committee, such as we are setting up, which will be equipped with power to go into all aspects of freights in this industry.

I say to honourable members opposite that trade unionists and their families to-day comprise just on two-thirds of the total voting strength at general elections. They put this Government in office in 1949. They kept it in office in 1951, and they reendorsed it in 1954; and we should not be in office at this moment had we not attracted to ourselves hundreds of thousands of votes of trade unionists and their dependants. We have done that because they believe, with good cause, that we are seeking to do fairly by them, as we seek to do by all other sections, of industry, munist-controlled and is a turbulent union in the policies we are putting before the Parliament.

I emphasize that point. And such persons will be allocated as they are now, with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board exercising the role that it exercises at present. What will be decided in the future is for the Parliament to determine. I am explaining the proposals contained in this legislation and what their effect will be.

As I have become a little sceptical about some of the propositions that are put forward by the leaders of this union to its members, I have taken the trouble to dig out the relevant document which the union says was presented to the Curtin Government and adopted by the late Mr Curtin when he was Prime Minister. I shall be happy to make this document available to the Leader of the Opposition and I shall supply a copy to any other honourable member who cares to examine it. There is not a single suggestion in this document that the federation sbould have the monopoly of engaging labour which has since been conferred on it as a fundamental right. I was intrigued to find that the report contained some very interesting provisions, considering that the union has always expressed its abhorrence of any arrangement involving the use of non-union labour. It provided for the organization of a volunteer reserve of persons ready to undertake waterside work on occasions when the supply of regular labour proved insufficient. That was a very sensible arrangement. I have yet to learn that it was accepted by the union. Mi-. WARD -The Minister is quoting a sentence out of its context. able the whole text.

Leader of the Opposition and hope that it will be in safe hands. Tbe document is signed by Owen Dixon and T. S. Gordon and sandwiched in between tbose signatures is that of J. Healy. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that I need no handwriting expert to tell me that it is the signature of the said J. Healy because I have had frequent occasion to study that particular signature. At the end of this document are the initals of the then Prime Minister, John Curtin, wbich I think will enable any reasonable person to regard it as authentic. The late John Curtin commentedThe foregoing report ia approved for consequential action and referred to Ministers accordingly. It is quite clear, although there was no reference in that report to any such legislation, the ""consequential action"" that was taken by a Labour Minister in those days was to set up the extraordinary arrangement under which, for the first time in the history of this country and, I believe, in the history of any country, a union was given the monopoly right of engaging the labour that was to work for the employers on the waterfront. That had never happened before in this country. It has never happened since and I do not know of any country in the world in which it has happened. The Waterside Workers Eederation was given its present statutory monopoly, not by the document to which I have referred, but by the legislation which was introduced in 1947 by honourable gentlemen opposite following conferences between the present Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for The Labour, Mr Holloway, Senator Ashley, and representatives of the Waterside Workers Federation. The justification that was then given for this extraordinary performance was that, to all intents and purposes, only one union was concerned with waterfront employment. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Board was being established to deal with the union and the employers. That board would determine the quotas for the various ports, and the federation would provide",74,Second Reading

But despite our opposition and criticism, the legislation was passed. nothing for five years. of the Opposition was opposed to this legislation, yet be has chided me with having done nothing for five years. If anybody in this chamber wishes to criticize me for having delayed too long in introducing this legislation, I accept that as a valid criticism. But, by way of justification, I say that I have done everything that a human being could do to develop a better relationship between management and labour. I have called conferences of all those interested in the industry. I have tried to deal in good faith with every person concerned in it, whether Communist or non-Communist. If a person was in a position to speak with some authority for his interests, I have talked to him in order to ascertain whether we could hammer out a plan wbich would benefit not only those who were directly concerned, but also what was more important, the nation.

The Leader of the Opposition should give to the Minister for Labour and National Service as fair a bearing as be hopes to receive himself. arrangement to which I have referred was not heard of until the present Leader of the Opposition mentioned it in 1947. He acknowledged at the time that it was an experiment. Either he or the then Minister for War Organization of Industry, Mr Dedman, described it as a bold experiment. In concluding the debate on the measure, the right honourable gentleman saidThe Government admits frankly that this is an experiment in a most important province of our economic and industrial life which may not be wholly successful, and may even f a i l . carried to the almost incredible length of Should tlie experiment not be a success, this Parliament or some succeeding Parliament w ill have to review the legislation. That is what we are doing now. Are we reviewing this legislation because, in our view, it has failed? I say emphatically, yes. I propose to establish reasons for claiming that this aspect of the legislation has certainly failed. I shall show how the assurances that were given by the Waterside Workers Federation have been broken. I should have stressed earlier that, in order to justify what was accepted by the then Government as a complete experiment, some consideration had to flow from the union itself. The consideration which flowed from the union in return for this remarkable arrangement was the undertaking that it would at all times ensure that the quotas in the ports were maintained at tbe strength prescribed by the statutory board that was then being set up. Before the war, many applications had been made by this union for preference ""m employment to be accorded to memoers of the union -by the employers. Honourable gentlemen opposite will know the significance of thai in an industrial sense: not a monopoly of engagement, but preference, so that, if employers had a choice between men offering from the union and non-unionists or members of some other union, the federation would be given preference under tbe award and its members would be picked up first. Indeed, the federation gave assurances to the court when it made these applications that, if preference were granted, it would raise no objection to its members working alongside non-union employees wbo had been picked up by the employers. So highly did the union prize this scheme that no fewer than sixteen sucb applications were made to the court in the years preceding the war. However, because of the course of conduct pursued by members of the federation, and for other reasons, on every occasion the court, which was able to look at this business objectively and fairly, rejected the application for preference. But what the court in its wisdom and fairness had failed to do, the present Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues not merely hastened to do, but",75,Second Reading

183,Mr Holt,"I repeat that the curiousgranting a complete monopoly of engagement to the union. Very well! How has it worked out? I have some figures, which I hope will not bore the House, but which at least indicate what has happened. I shall refer to the loss of woi king days over the last two years because, if I am to be told that there is no sed for this legislation at this time, I say the added cost to the community of a -hat such patience as I might have had in 1953, when some improvement over the very modest achievements of 1951 and 1952 was evident, has been exhausted by the serious deterioration in relation to both average loading rates and the incidence of industrial disputes which we have experienced in 1954. Industrial disputes caused the loss of 133,000 working days by members of the Waterside Workers Eederation in the year ended the 30th June, 1953. In 1954, that total increased to 209,000 working days lost. In other words, between 4 and 5 per cent, of the total working time in this industry was lost as a result of disputes. That represents about fifteen to twenty times the rate of loss over the whole field of industry generally. always in the wrong in those disputes ? T am saying that this was the trend that point of honourable gentlemen opposite. came to the notice of the Government. If There has not been one period that I can I thought the men were always in the recall since the present system has been wrong, we should not be having an operating when the federation's port inquiry into the important matters that quotas have been rapidly filled and mainare mentioned in the bill. Nevertheless, tained at the prescribed levels. Over a major share of the responsibility fbr the whole period, we have been plagued this deterioration must, in view of the with repeated refusals and frustrating record, be sheeted home to the members delays by the federation in relation to of the federation. The average daily the admission of new members to fill tonnage loaded at Sydney declined from quotas or to make up deficiencies which 393 tons at the end of 1953 to 303 in have occurred in them. So bad did the August last. In Melbourne, it declined situation become that two years ago I prefrom 459 to 329. I do not think I need pared a bill to cope with this very add much to those figures in order to problem, and again, perhaps over-optiindicate that a serious deterioration bas mistically, after subsequent discussions occurred. Tbis, of course, has had an important and' tlie Australian Council of Trades impact upon every sector of the economy. Unions, I deferred the. introduction of the Honourable gentlemen may be interested legislation in order to give the union a to know just how much it costs each day chance to honour its obligations. What to maintain a ship in port, whether it be was the unhappy and tragic result ? Just idle or not. If it is idle through indus^ a series of frustrations, obstructions and trial causes, of course, the loss is an delays, which have persisted, to. this very unnecessary additional burden on our time!' economy. The figures I shall cite apply to the average ship in each class mentioned. An interstate cargo ship of 3,000 or 4,000 tons burden costs £500 a day to keep in port. An overseas cargo ship of 7,000 or 8,000 tons costs £S00 a day. A large passenger ship costs £3,000 a day. Honourable members can readily calculate hold-up in a. big port-and there have been scores of such stoppages throughout the year. When there is not merely a hold-up in one port but a stoppage in all the ports of the Commonwealth, such as is in progress now, the cost to the community becomes heavy indeed. The total costs involved, of course, are not only those of maintaining a ship while it is in port. If the unloading rate is slow, the turn-round is delayed, which means that the vessel spends far less time at sea than would otherwise be possible. Tbis brings other costs into the picture as well. Therefore, the Government maintains that, on the ground of the performance in the industry, there is an overwhelming case, both for action and for the kind of inquiry which will assist this Parliament to decide what further I shall, refer now to recruitment, which, with representatives of the federation",76,Second Reading

185,Mr Holt,"I am not alleging that. after all, is a. vital issue from the viewHonorable members from Victoria will be aware that, in recent months at the port of Melbourne, there have been refusals to fill tbe quota. Others from South Australia have even more cause for complaint. They know of tbe delays which led to the appointment of a cominittee of inquiry in that State and the presentation of the Bishop report. Honourable members from Western Australia know of the experience at the important overseas port of Fremantle. At Port ICembia, one of the vital steel ports of the a monopoly right to this union to engage Commonwealth, there are serious deficiencies. Only a week ago there was 75,000 tons of steel awaiting shipment there, notwithstanding that the wliole of Australia is short of steel products. The lag bad risen from 44,000 tons in March to the figure I have mentioned. Over a period of three months, from the 20th July, at that port there were only four days when appreciable numbers of waterside workers received attendance money, but there were 50 days when there were considerable shortages, with the deficiency frequently exceeding 200 workers. The port quota is seriously deficient to this clay. The numbers at Newcastle, the other important steel port, are also well below the quota. There was 50,000 tons of steel awaiting shipment from that port at the end of September. The principal ports at which the federation has failed to fill its quotas are Newcastle, Port Kembla, Fremantle, Adelaide, Hobart and Melbourne. I have only to recite tbe names of those ports in order to give honourable members an idea of tbe effect upon our economy of the lack of adequate ancl efficient labour forces there to keep the ships moving. Now let me return to a point I made earlier so that we shall be in no doubt on that matter. What variation of the method of recruitment is contemplated in the bill? The only change proposed, although it is an important one, relates to the procedure whereby men are brought into the industry. Instead of tbe Australian Stevedoring Industry Board asking the union to fill the quotas, as it has gentleman says that my assumption is not done through tbe years with the sort of resnlts I have indicated, it will now ask the employers to fill the number of vacancies which it will indicate to them. The board is still in the picture. given to the union first? whole case that I have been -trying to make is that, having given the union the opportunity to fill these quotas, we have met with frustrations and delays. I shall be very interested to hear how the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson), who has had considerable industrial experience, views tbe giving of labour and then band it over to the board and the employer when that does not occur in any other section of industry. The board will ask that a number of new vacancies be filled. It will then-and this quite unusual concession has been put in deliberately-as k the union whether it has any objection to the persons nominated because normally those persons would then enter the union as members. If the federation raises no objection to a nominee the board will register that individual as a member of the waterfront work force provided he satisfies other requirements as to age, physical fitness and character. If the union does raise some objection, the board will examine it and if it is found to be of substance, the board will not recruit that man. If the objection has no substance, tbe board will proceed with his engagement. I gather from what has been said by honourable members opposite-and indeed it has apparently been bruited through the press-that the Opposition will oppose this legislation. Is that correct? Br.

That is something of the background of this matter.

The Minister referred to a report made by Mr Justice Dixon, the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission during the war, suggesting a scheme very much like the one that was put into operation. I think that report was prepared in 1942, tbe time of the great threat to Australia. In 1947, the legislation was introduced and passed. In 1949, under the Chifley Government, the legislation was made permanent. All the things that the Minister criticizes in 1954 were present in the legislation of 1949. I have never heard Government spokesmen-and there are many of them -criticiz e the legislation in policy speeches.

Minister and the Minister for Labour and National Service must maintain silence. tion to the absolute and inexplicable contradiction between tbe two principal parts of the bill. It is proposed that there shall be a judicial inquiry into discipline, into tbe handling of employment, including the present state of affairs, bnt, at tbe same time and without hearing evidence, and without waiting for the report, the Government proposes an amendment of the act as a solution of the problem. I have never heard of such a thing before. It is the result of extreme pressure from the shipping combine, which tried to obtain possession of the Commonwealth line of ships-whic h the Opposition resistedand which has given great financial support to the Government. The power of. that combine in this country is too great. It has a monopoly of both interstate and overseas shipping. I tell the House, and I tell the people of Australia, as far as I am able to do so through the House, that this measure represents an attempt by monopoly groups to protect their own interests, to alter a system which, despite its defects, is capable of amendment, and to. change the metbod of employment in this in<kistiry. It is bound to.provoke disputes, not only in the stevedoring industry, but also in all of the workers' unions of Australia.. The Minister for Labour and National Service talks about the support that he obtained from trade unions at the last general election. He probably did obtain some support, because he promised not to do things like this. He promised not to interfere by imposing such conditions on the industry. He may not have sadd it in so many words, but that is the statement that he made to the people of Australia to ensure that a fair deal, would be maintained. It is perfectly true,, as the Minister stated, that the stevedoring industry has been a diflicult industry to control, but reference to that fact has been made in reports that go back, for 20 or 30 years. Of course, it is a turbulent industry. But the Minister's voice did not sound very convincing. It did not have that ring of fanaticism that one associates with Government baGk-benchers., When the right honourable gentleman, refers to communism I was directing attenwithin the Waterside Workers Federation, he refers to the fact that some of its officials are Communists, and that is perfectly true. But it is quite lawful to be a Communist. The Government has played this game for a long time.

Will the people of Australia stand it much longer ? gentleman will never attack a Communist. hypocritical in its denunciations of communism. By introducing legislation of this kind, by disregarding vested rights, and by setting aside the established practices of many years by a stroke of the pen, it has united in one body the industrial and political Labour groups of Australia. The Australian Labour party says, in effect, ""Have your inquiry into discipline. Put your judicial committee to work to ascertain what should be done, but consider suggestions such as that which was made by one of the Opposition members when he stated that the organization should be given the opportunity, in any specified emergency, of nominating additional recruits for the industry"". The Government proposes to do exactly the opposite. It proposes to give that right to the employers. number of waterside workers at any port becomes less than the quota, what is to be the procedure? The proposed procedure is set out in clause 6. It is proposed that an application by a person who wishes to obtain a job in the stevedoring industry sball be lodged with the hoard. By whom? Not by himself, but by an employer who is registered at the port. The clause provides that there shall be endorsed on the application a recommendation by the employer that the application be accepted. The applicant will be a very good little boy! He will do exactly what the employer wants! A nice little employee will be recommended by the employer, and everything in the garden will be lovely! Just imagine that situation superimposed upon a system that has been described by the Minister! The applicant must also satisfy other conditions as to age and physical fitness. If the Waterside Workers Eederation objects, it must show cause against the applicant, but the grounds are not specified. The proposal is absurd. The Government is returning to the bad old spirit of tyranny existing with that system of waterfront employment when a shipping bureau was established as a screen between tbe employers and the award conditions. In effect, the Government proposes to establish a union within a uniona union of employer nominees in addition to the existing union of employees. I have no doubt that that is the state of affairs that some persons behind the Minister are anxious to have introduced. I referred a moment ago to some of the facts relating to the industry. I invite honourable members to consider the report of Judge Foster which was presented in 1946, before the passing of tbe act of 1947. He pointed out, at page 33 of the report, that there should be only one recognized union in this industry, and statedI have recommended that there tie only one union in this industry. He further observedI t needs no argument to suggest that the practical administration of industrial relations can most conveniently be served by the recognition of one and not several unions. This view has so often been expressed by the Court and its registrars as to need no reference. When the Then he referred to the history of an organization called the Permanent and Casual Union, which was born of industrial strife. That organization obtained registration, but it gradually ceased to exist, because, ultimately, its members were absorbed by the Waterside Workers Federation in the eastern States. . It was an organization that was promoted by the employers in a state of emergency. Its history bas been set out in judgments of the court. In 1924, Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Rich, of the High Court of Australia, in a judgment dealing with this difficult industry, referred to the Shipping Bureau organization. The employers avoided the obligations of the award by establishing The Shipping Bureau. In theii: judginent, their honours made the following statement:The evidence leads . . . to the conclusion tliat "" The Shipping Bureau""",82,Government Supporters Hean

It is proposed that a register shall be kept and that, if the quota is reduced by half a dozen or a dozen, the employers shall submit the names of their nominees. The judgment further statedAll macliinery and part of the method for doing indirectly and iu association what each could do directly and singly. The judgment amounts to a strong denunciation of that system, because it was intended to get around the obligations of the award. A great industrial judge, Mr Justice Piddington, referred to the same problem later, when he was dealing with the waterfront industry in New South Wales. He referred to the Permanent and Casual Union, which was formed by employer nomination. The union was separate, of course. The members who w ill come into the union under this legislation w ill be all nominated by the employers and w ill be apart from the recognized members of the union. On them w ill be stamped the fact that they are employer-nominated, instead of coming, in the normal way, to the union for nomination. Mr Justice Piddington said:The objecting union was formed at a time, and in a spirit, of sharp antagonism to the applicant branch. It co-operated . . . with the Shipping Labour Bureau, the recognized citadel of those shipowners And that applies just as much to-daywho sought the destruction of the Waterside Federation's influence. This citadel turned out, on the first ""whiff of grape-shot"" from the artillery of justice, to be a thing of mere cardboard walls and painted battlements. It fell to pieces after the decision of the High Court. . . . In the case to which I have just referred referred to the employers' or bogus union as now only a memory, or possibly also a warning, in the records of industrial law. What is the good of a warning to people such as honourable members opposite ? As I said before, and I repeat, I do not believe that the Minister wants the legislation. I believe he would settle this matter in another way. The obvious way to settle it is to go on witb the inquiry, and examine tbe facts and two reports to wbicb I shall refer in a moment, namely the Foster report and the report of Mr Basten, who was brought out specially to study this problem and wbo made certain recommendations wbich cut right across this legislation. That report has been comthe complications . . . are pletely ignored by tbe Government for three years. I have already referred to the fact that the basis of the recommendation made by Judge Foster was that there should be one union. That does not mean that the employers should nominate members of that union. It means that the men should apply to the union in order to become members. What sort of a business is it if tbe employer is going to control tbe membership of a trade union? I suggest that that w ill lead to the very type of union wbich tbe late Mr Chifley denounced as a tame cat or employercontrolled, or bogus union. W it b in the union there w ill bc two groups-tbos e nominated by the employers and those who voluntarily applied for membership of the union. The Foster report really warns us against this course of action, and it is a complete answer to the views put forward by the Minister for Labour and National Service to-night. The Minister referred to turbulent conditions as though they were peculiar to the present time, but Judge Foster said in his reportI do not feel it necessary to write of the history of this industry-it has a long record of turbulence and struggle stretching back into pre-Arbitration Court days, a story of evil conditions, low wages, of unsatisfactory relations, of bitterness and unrest. It is all very well for honourable members here in Canberra to talk about the conditions on the waterfront, without any actual knowledge of them. Judge Mr Justice Piddington Foster referred to evil conditions, unsatisfactory relationships, bitterness and unrest. He cited judgments from the time of Mr Justice Higgins in 1914, in orxier to support his statements about those conditions. He pointed out that until the war, the stevedoring operations were conducted by the interstate steamshipowners, by certain companies, and by stevedoring companies more or less closely connected with the shipowners who nominally conducted an independent business. It was nominal only, because the Basten report shows Uiat the stevedoring companies, although '-iey are the employers, have no real control as employers. They know the industry of stevedoring, but they receive their directions from a committee of shipowners. When the next ship is to be laden by wharf labour, the nomination is in the hands of a committee which does not include stevedoring people who have knowledge of the industry. That is a very important part of the constructive report of Mr Basten. Of course, the very valuable report of Judge Foster goes further than that. Sir right honourable gentleman disagreed with all reports by judges. the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) is such a brilliant interjector that I can hardly resist answering him. Judge Foster said, with regard to the war-time experienceI t hns been urged that it would be a tragedy a whole and did not seize on only one to abandon this experiment at the outset and to sacrifice the experience it has gained since 1042. Much has been learned from its many failures no loss than from its successes. My concurrence in this view is strongly fortified by the support it has of the Overseas Shipping Representatives Association. At page 15 of his report, he deals with the question of delays, which was also referred to by the Minister. It is of no use saying that delays do not occur. However, I shall not here discuss the figures, because that is a matter for an expert inquiry. Why does not the Minister have the expert inquiry first and introduce the legislation afterwards? Foster saidNotwithstanding nil this impressive list of cases, my investigation does' convince me that the commission achieved a substantial measure of discipline; that it won and had a measure of co-operation to this end from the workers' organization, greater than had been achieved in tliis industry before; tlmt it achieved its main war-time purpose; that its actions and policies were dictated by the considerations of war, and that the alleged disciplinary failure was conditioned by those special war considerations. Then, in a passage at page 19, which J shall not read in full, there is a very impressive reference to a medical report, made in November, 1944, from which Judge Foster quoted the following portions:I was forced into a real and surprised admiration for a body of men earning a more or less arduous living, handicapped by gross and serious physical abnormalities. Most of the individuals examined were over the age of 40 and under 60. I can only surmise with the most profound gloom the conditions of those over GO years of age. My chief impression of these men was that all of tliem wero prematurely aged. It was rare to find any man who did not look at least ten years older than his stated age. Tlieir outward appearance was more than confirmed by physical examination. The majority of them showed the usual stigmata of abnormally early and vapidly progressive senility. ERIC HARRISON I thought the Tbe report went on to describe physical conditions from .which any person with the slightest human sympathy would deduce that this is a very special industry and must be dealt with in a special way. In January, 1952, Mr Basten was appointed by this Government to deal with matters affecting the stevedoring industry. He dealt with the problems as little aspect of it, such as the conditions of employment of a few men, or even the shortage of quotas which, in fact, does not exist generally in Australia. Mr Basten examined the matter as an economic problem. He dealt, first, witb the question of port facilities, and he made recommendations for their improvement. He pointed out that the facilities for quick handling of cargo at Australian ports are probably amongst the worse in the world. Yet, hardly anything bas been done to improve those facilities since he made his report. Those poor facilities, of course, Mr Justice add to the cost of the turn-round of ships. Why should all of that cost be reckoned against the workers? Mr Basten also recommended the promotion of quicker delivery from the wharf, and he .suggested",83,Government Supporters Hean
212,Dr. Evatt,"The Vice-President of that, cargo clearance committees should have special functions. He dealt also with delays in customs. Much of this overhead cost, which it is the fashion to debit against tbe union, is, in fact, due to other causes. He stated that the effect, of the recommendations to bring pressure to bear on importers would be to cause them to take active measures to remedy each of the potential causes of delay for wbich they, or their agents, are responsible. He referred to the lack of co-ordination between working hours in the warehouses and in the ports, and, finally, the practice of leaving goods in the transit sheds unti l they may be sold. Is not that the proper approach which that when those shipowners were domishould be made to this matter? Mr ciled overseas the stevedoring companies Basten's recommendations are set out in were solely controlled by shipping agents. f u l l at page 9 of his report. He states In those circumstances the real decision that interstate shipping is affected by the about stevedoring matters does not lie same difficulties as is overseas shipping. with the stevedore, who knows the Then he approaches the question of the industry and actually employs waterside poor turn-round of ships.

The standard of amenities provided has been active in promoting the provision of amenities and some amenities, which have recently come into being, are admirable. There remain, however, instances of a deplorable standard or absence of amenities, the consequences of which are noticed subsequently. The industry would undoubtedly benefit from a swifter rate of progress in this direction. Then he dealt with the problem of management. He said, when referring to the stevedoring companies, that they were seldom free to apply their experience and technical knowledge to the waterside industry. He said that though nominally independent stevedoring companies were frequently owned and controlled by shipowners and the agents of shipowners, and Then Mr Basten dealt with the Tor that problems of the waterside workers.

Furtheri n his'report he statedEecruitment, however, is also affected by the introduce w ill be worse tban tbe pick-up, policy of the Waterside Workers' Federation. Only workers registered by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board may normally be engaged for employment and only members of the Federation may be registered . . . The first step to take towards the removal of would be the worse possible recommendaundesirable practices and policies of the Waterside Workers' Federation is to remove the fear that certain customs associated with casual employment in a time of too little employment will one day re-appear. He said that the first step was to remove that fear, and yet the Minister has introduced a bill to bring that fear into existence again, and make the nomination of new employees in the industry a matter for the employers. That is a very important matter. gentleman believe in permanent engagetbat system is not the same in its ment on the waterfront? there should be decasualization because I and as the honourable member for Port desire to see tbe status of tbe workers Adelaide pointed out, if the number of further improved; and I believe that the Minister would also like to see that happen. However, the Minister has brought this legislation down without any proper inquiry having been made into its effects. There have been otber inquiries given a chance to make up the number, into this industry, and I remind honornominations for new positions w ill come able members that the Basten inquiry fro m the various members of the resulted in a very constructive report. If employers. The union w ill bave a rigbt of further inquiries into the industry are appeal against the decision of the board, needed, tben tbere is no reason why they but the grounds for such an appeal are should not be conducted. But one of the not stated in the measure. This bill is a very subject-matters of tbe inquiry convery hurried piece of legislation, and that ducted by Mr Basten was the discipline is shown by the fact that there is no of waterside workers, wbich would definition of the jurisdiction of the Ausobviously include any system of recruittralian Stevedoring Industry Board to ment into the industry. However, instead reverse a decision on appeal. of waiting for a report-and that is all that we ask the Minister to do-h e has brought forward this very provocative matter. I believe that the Government's legislation. I asked the Minister yesteraction in bringing forward this bill has day to wait for a report about tbe indusbeen most provocative, and, indeed, it try but he would not indicate that he would do so. Why should there not be an inquiry fluences outside of this House, or even by into tbe industry first, instead of forcing influences inside it . I do not suggest this legislation on to not only tbe emtbat there have not been just grievances ployees' organization, wbich regards it as against waterside workers in a number an attempt to return to the bad old days, of cases, but when we examine them in but' also on the employees themselves. Of course, the legislation w ill not bring about a return to the old pick-up system, but in some ways the system that it w ill because the employers may send in a written recommendation that certain men sbould be employed in the industry. I should say that such a recommendation tion that one could have for membership of a union. I do not say that because I believe that the recommendation may not be honest and made in perfect good faith . I say it because that is not the way that persons should be recruited into unions. The membership of trade unions should be a voluntary matter, but here membership, in effect, w ill be taken out of the hands of industrial organizations and given into the hands of employers. precise legal operation, it is analogous to the shipping bureau system because My own feeling is that there w ill have to be a register, wharf labourers in any port decreases, instead of the number being made up by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, or instead of that union being I ask the Minister to postpone this should not have been attempted. I ask the Minister not to be affected by in-",86,Government Supporters Hean
215,Mr Holt,Does the right honourable I suggest to the Minister that although,87,Government Supporters Hean
216,Dr. Evatt,"the light of sworn evidence we discover that only a few ports have been affected. Moreover, only a few ports have been referred to by the Minister, and consequently there appears to be no shortage of waterside workers in our great ports. there are too many waterside workers available ? that will need careful consideration, and that, together with other important matters, must be worked out on a common-sense basis. I have often criticized the Minister for bringing down legislation, but I believe that on the whole he has tried to exercise his functions in a proper fashion. I suggest to him that he will get no applause for this action from back-benchers on the Government side, who are very anxious to replace him. I am sure that the honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne) thinks that he can do much better than the Minister. Tbe honourable member for Evans is the legal adviser of the shipping combine, and he thinks that the shipowners can do nothing wrong. Perhaps it is our opinion that they can do very little that is right. In any event they bave done very little for Australia, and I believe that they are behind this legislation. I ask the Minister to reconsider the bill because I believe it and, in the light of the inquiry, let the that the views that I am expressing are those of organized trade unionism in Australia, of the Australian Council of Trades Unions and of the Australian Workers Union. They are also the unanimous views of the Parliamentary Labour party. We do not want to see the ports of Australia idle because of the pride of a Minister and the pressure of a few back-benchers. It would be no disgrace for the Minister to say, "" I shall look at the matter again"". The Minister has taken an entirely inconsistent attitude. At one stage he said, in eifect, "" I think it is a question of discipline and employment and I shall have an inquiry along those lines"". Almost with the next breath he said, "" I have made up my mind. Here is a complex matter"". The bill bas been drafted hurriedly. I studied it to-day, and I could not see the grounds for appeal in the bill or bow nominations for new positions on the waterfront could be questioned by tbe federation. I ask the Minister to look at the bill afresh. I believe that would be the view of the majority of honourable members, including those who, in general, support the Minister. We do not want turbulence in the waterfront industry, but conditions in that industry over the years have been utterly disgraceful. A new status was given to the waterside workers by the legislation that was introduced during World War II . under the National Security Act and by the 1947-49 legislation. In effect, the waterside workers were told, "" We shall regard you as partners in an enterprise. We shall expect you to_ co-operate"". The Minister is wrong in denying that there is power in the present act to provide that when there is a shortage of quotas in the stevedoring industry, the quotas can be filled up. That is provided by clause 27 (2.) The Minister does not want a struggle between the Government and organized labour. None of us wants it. We want to see work resumed and operations continued. I do not want anything I have said to-night to be misunderstood. The Government has an inquiry on foot. It should go on with House consider the problem calmly and judicially. But it should not let this wretched shipping combine control conditions of work in Australia when virtually the combine is controlled, not in Australia, but overseas. adjourned.

219,Debate (On Motion By Mr Gullett),"Debate resumed (vide page 2666). I have dealt at somelength with one of the aims under tbe South-East Asia Treaty Organization. I now propose in the limited time left to me, to deal with two equally, if not more important aspects of Seato. They are the consultative machinery and the mutual aid provisions as they apply between the various members of tbe organization. Consultation is vital, of course. If tbere is should train doctors and pay them consultation in the early stages, many of the problems that are encountered can be solved before they assume such proportions thut they break into open conflagration. Aid is even of more vital importance. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) dealt with this matter extensively last night. I sball do no more than discuss a number of the points that he made and some others that have occurred to me. In the first place, I do not believe that we can earn and maintain, the friendship of about 1,000,000,000 human beings to the north of Australia while we carry on as we are doing, at present. ""We have warehouses and storehouses full to overflowing with, foodstuffs in Australia. In the countries to the north of us, a low standard of living exists. We should take all the food we can get and the maximum that we can produce and make it available to the countries where human beings urgently need all that we have and can grow. In concert with other great foodproducing powers, we have to be willing even to purchase the products of farm3 and factories and give it away or supply it on credit to the peoples of the nations who need that food. one way in wbich we can earn the friendship of those people and end the growing menace of the Communist grip on the peoples of Asia. That is by feeding them and treating them as human beings, and making available to them the foodstuffs that they need. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) bas asked who will pay for the products? If , by an immediate gift, or the provision on credit of food, we could prevent a conflagration spreading through Asia and the world, would the honourable gentleman pause to count, the cost? There is no doubt which way a. decision would go if it were necessary to decide between the immediate and comparatively small cost of taking surplus food products off the markets of the world to supply 'the needy of Asia, and the untold' cost in human life, suffering and despair of some non-constructive project that will surely bring disaster in our life-time or the life-time of our children. We to help to improve the health of the people in the countries north of Australia. We should provide engineers and artisans of every kind. By that means we could retain the friendship of the great mass of human beings who live to the north of Australia, and avert the menaceof communism that runs through that area to-day, and will grow to a flood unless some statesmanlike approach is made to the problem. I conclude, as my time is expiring, with a review of the amendments that the Opposition has foreshadowed. We support tbe treaty unhesitatingly, but suggest, first,, a provision with regard to the ratification of the treaty that is common to all international treaties. Secondly, we suggest that the Government should consult the Parliament before undertaking military obligations in connection with the treaty that we have entered into. That provision is amply justified by democratic procedure, and is designed to place the responsibility where it should lie-o n the shoulders of the elected members of the Parliament of Australia.

Otherwise, ratification would not be required as the effective point from which the treaty became binding in respect of the particular nation. Its ratification is essential. The treaty says as much. WhatI wish to be assured of is that ratification by Australia shall not be unaccompanied by ratification by the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand. It is quite possible that, in certain circumstances, the actual ratification may not occur. Can the Minister for External Affairs tell me whether the other nations have formally ratified as yet? nations that we wish to be assured are participants in the treaty, before final ratification is made by Australia.

255,Mr War D (East Sydney) [10.4],"from that taken by the Republican Administration. It would be wise for Australia, before it becomes heavily committed under the terms of the treaty, to ascertain the attitude of the new controllers of the destiny of the United States of America to the treaty. I should have preferred the amendment to go a little further than it does. Negotiations should proceed in an effort to make the treaty effective in the area to which it relates by bringing in as signatories to it the important nations that up to the present have remained aloof. Honourable gentlemen opposite cannot argue on sound grounds that those nations have remained aloof because they are inclined to favour communism. The fact is rather the reverse. India, Burma, Ceylon and Indonesia at present all remain outside the treaty. If those nations not read Australian history. If the Godo not become signatories to the pact, how can it ever effectively serve Australia's interests ? We will be committed by ratification of the treaty without, in most cases, realizing all its implications. The first step is almost always the most difficult to retrace. Often one finds it difficult to turn back. The Minister tried lightly to brush aside the question of commitments. He stated that they have not yet been discussed in detail and therefore cannot be announced to the Parliament so that it may express approval or disapproval of them. The Prime Minister and the Minister, if they wish to do so, could tell the Parliament that Australia is being pledged to the limit of its man-power and resources. If this Government remains in office and is unable to meet Australia's obligations under the treaty by using volunteer troops, it will not hesitate to conscript men for service overseas. The Minister tried to reassure the AusAustralia's commitments in this respect tralian people very cunningly by stating that the treaty does not alter the constitumitments? If this treaty had been in tional position and neither extends nor restricts a citizen's. obligations to render tralian troops would have been sacriservice in the armed forces. The Constitution does not enter into the matter. The Minister knows full well, and it is as wellthat the Australian people also should know it, that an amendment of the Constitution is not required for the extension of the field of con:scripted military service. The areawithin which conscripted troops may be used can bc extended, and it has been extended, by a majority vote of the Parliament in support, of an amendment of the Defence Act. honourable member must confine his remarks to the question before the Chair. thing that is contained in the amendment.

Sii' PHILIP McBRIBE -The Parliament will have to be consulted in any event. for Defence( Sir Philip McBride) has vernment wishes to extend the area of service of Australian forces it must first secure an amendment to the Defence Act for that purpose. The Minister knows full well that such approval can be given by a majority in the Parliament and that it does not involve an amendment of the Constitution. The Minister read a part but not all that the Prime Minister said on this aspect. The right honourable gentleman statedWhat effect any specific commitments will have upon the present shape of our defence programme, or the methods which we now employ, is a matter which I will not presume to judge in advance. AU I want to say is that we will not hesitate to make any changes which are necessary for the full performance of our commitments. The Prime Minister did not say what our commitments are. It is ridiculous to expect any responsible Opposition to agree to such a proposition unless details of are first indicated. What are those comexistence a little over a year ago, Ausficed in Indo China in a futile effort to J destroya nationalist movement that was designed to effect reforms in that country.

258,Mr Ward,"Evidently , the Ministerproves, that some men associated with that movement in Viet Nam were formerly in the underground movement and helped the allied cause by opposing the Japanese occupation forces. Therefore, it becomes most important for tbe Parliament to know whether it will be consulted in this matter. What will be the situation in Malaya, for instance? Do honourable members opposite believe that Australian troops should be sacrificed in suppressing a nationalist movement in Malaya, that is a movement that may be designed to improve the wage paid to coolie labour which, at present, is equivalent to 1 lb. of rice a day? Should Australian lives be sacrificed because unfortunate people, no matter what one may call their movement, are striving for a better existence in tbeir own country and for tbe right to live as human beings? As a matter of fact, one of the principles enunciated in this measure is that people of various lands should have the right of self-determination. Why not give to tbe Malayan people the opportunity to declare whether they desire to exercise independence? But under this treaty, if any movement, or insurrection occurred in a particular country, which it was alleged was inspired by outside influence, perhaps Communist influence, the Government of that country could immediately call upon the signatories to this treaty to provide armed forces to put down the insurrection although the object of it might be solely to improve the living standards of native peoples. Therefore, this provision presents many dangers. With respect to India's failure to become a party to this agreement, the Minister went to great pains to say that compliance with its provisions could not event of a conflict occurring between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, Australian forces would be used against India. If that is Australia's understanding of this provision, why was its viewpoint not conveyed to the representatives of the other signatories at the Manila conference? The CHAIEMAN -Order! honourable member's time has expired. External Affairs) [10.14] I should like, immediately, to correct palpable errors in the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). Taking his last statement first, he said that we would be obliged to go with force of arms into a country if some movement, which might possibly be a liberal movement, expressed itself against the government of that country. No more foolish statement could be made. Presumably, the honourable member, if he has read the treaty, is aware that under paragraph 2' of Article IV . we are obliged only to consult with other parties in the event of certain things happening, not armed aggression, to determine what we are to do. In those circumstances, of course, we, as I imagine each of the otber signatories would do, would assure ourselves that the movement was a movement that would attract the attention of other countries to protect the government of that country. We would not automatically provide assistance merely because the government of that country said that such and such a movement existed and it wanted the other signatories to the treaty to suppress it. The other signatories would naturally assure themselves that the movement was Communist-inspired before they would take any action whatever. The honourable member palpably has attempted to present this treaty in the wrong light to the public. -Secondly, the honourable member for East SydneyI cannot believe it was pure mischance-accuse d me of saying that the constitutional position in relation to the sending of troops overseas was not altered by this measure. WhatI did say -and the honourable member must have possibly mean that in the heard me-wa s that "" the constitutional position and the legal position "" was not altered-that is that the Defence Act, or any other act that bears upon our ability to send forces overseas, was not altered. Nothing is gained by misrepresentation, but this seems to be a deliberate attempt on the part of the honourable member to misrepresent the position. The CHAIEMAN -Order!

It is no coincidence that both of them follow the Communist line. Tbe CHAIRMAN -Order! I should like to know what the honourable member's remarks have to do with the question before the Chair. out that the honourable member for East Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition in the speeches that they have made on this bill were, in fact, taking the Communist line. I shall substantiate that statement as I go along. The first point to which I direct the attention of the committee is the condemnation of this treatv that is contained in the Cominform's organ of the 17th September. If one takes the trouble to read that newswrong they were and they see with some paper one will find that the speeches to which we have just heard from honourable members opposite are a pale reflection of those undoubtedly communistic views. There is no doubt that either the thinking, or the actions of the Leader of the Oppossition, or both, are controlled by the dark Communist forces behind him. Some of tbem are sitting behind him to-night. bonorable gentleman will cease interjecting. were sitting behind him to-night. I noticed that his friend, Mr Healy, and . Mr Idris Williams were there. honourable member for Mackellar will deal with the clause. deavouring to invite attention to the motives of certain members of the Opposition in relation to these amendments. Both the amendments are designed to give aid and comfort to the Communists. The first amendment makes a trivial proposal. (Mackellar) The second strikes at the root of the whole treaty. The first is designed to arouse distrust among our allies. The second is designed to arouse in their minds the suspicion that Australia will not carry out any commitments that it might enter into and to make them less inclined to carry out any commitments that they might have for our protection. Either the second amendment indicated by the Leader of the Opposition is Communistinspired or he does not realize the changes that bave taken place in the world in the last few years. It is no longer possible to defend a country wholly from within that country's boundary. If we are to have security we must have forward outposts. It is no longer possible to rely upon being given time, after a declaration of war, before one meets the brunt of an attack. We must make preparations in advance and anybody who fails to acknowledge that fact is betraying the real interests of the Australian people.

If that is so, I ask the honourable member to withdraw it. withdraw all of it? Remainder of bill-by leave-take n as a whole. External Affairs) [10.50] certain things that should be said by me, on behalf of the Government, and I propose to say them. We are dealing now with the treaty itself and also, I assume, with the preamble to tbe bill. It may occur to honourable gentlemen to question wby the preamble to the bill is phrased in the way it is and to ask why stress is laid on the fact that, very largely, kind, because the view is held by the it is Communist aggression that is attracting the interest of this Government to this treaty. I dealt with that matter at some length in my second-reading speech. I do not attempt to disguise the fact that the Australian Government considers that, with the world as it is to-day and with the situation that confronts us in this region, the primary purpose of the treaty is to combat communism. Resistance to communism is the immediate objective of the treaty. It is for that principal purpose-no t the sole purpose, but the principal -purpose-tba t the Australian Government is prepared to commit itself to the treaty. In fact, we cannot see at the present time any other circumstances in which we would be obliged to intervene. It is possible that, as time goes by, other circumstances will make themselves known, but so far as we can see at the moment, the immediate objective of the treaty is tbe combating of communism. For that very simple and proper reason, we have stressed the Communist menace than two syllables-in fact, almost in in the preamble to the bill, apart from Basic English. I do not know how often the preamble to tbe treaty. That seems one has to repeat these things. I have to us to be very reasonable and tried to explain in the simplest possible proper, but I understand there are terms why the United States Government some honourable members who query had to make that reservation. the preamble to the bill. know that the preamble bas no legal one? significance, and we have never suggested that it has. The preamble is the background to, or the explanation of, the main reasons for the treaty. In treaties of this kind, it is usual to have a preamble to the ratifying measure that sets out the background of the treaty. That has been done in simple terms, with which I think nobody could quarrel. Some honourable members have queried I withdraw it. the action of the United States Government in putting a reservation before its signature to the treaty. I have already explained, but I shall repeat the explanation in the most economical terms, that -There are the United States Government did that for a very simple, proper and understandable reason. It did it because the United States has no territorial possessions on the mainland of Asia. It is only Communist aggression-no t general aggression, but Communist aggressionthat would attract the interest of the United States to a treaty of this United States Congress that Communist aggression, particularly successful Communist aggression, in any part of the world would be an accretion to the strength of international communism, and so, in the long run, could be regarded as an added menace to the security of the United States. If the United States Congress could not be assured that the United States Government is participating in this treaty only to combat Communist aggression, the treaty might very well not be accepted by Congress. a similar reservation? plained that matter three times, but I shall explain it a fourth time so as to make it crystal clear. and simple terms, in words of not more",99,Pairs

First, we -did not have the same need to make it as did the United States. the United Nations Charter, we are obliged, as are other member nations, to combat aggression-no t any particular form of fascist aggression, which is such .a popular term on the south side of the House, but just aggression. Secondly, it is probable that some of the Asian nations would not have ratified the treaty if it had been directed pointedly at comwhole, let me say one or two other munism only. the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) would observe the normal manners of a civilized person.

If this treaty had been directed specifically and solely against communism, it is probable that some of the Asian, signatories would not have ratified it. AsL stated in my secondpower in the world to-day and a power reading speech, certainly the treaty would have attracted the animosity of some of the Asian countries that are not signatories to it if it had been directed pointedly against communism. There is a certain touchiness among some Asian nations by reason of ideas, current on the Asian mainland, about not attracting the animosity of Peking. Therefore, in order to have the best atmosphere for this treaty, it was signed by the participating nations other than the United States of America without a reservation. It is quite clear that, quantitatively, we owe to America for its help in the those are not very important reasons', because we hold the view, and I am quite sure that the United Kingdom Government holds it also, that 99 per cent, of the risk is in respect to Communist aggression or Communist subversion. So we are not, in. f act, accepting any greater I have been asked why obligation than is tbe United States of America. But words have a certain meaning and significance. They have a certain significance in the American ConUnder gress and they have a certain significance on the mainland of Asia in the minds of the peoples of many of the free Asian countries. I assure honourable members that we are not, in fact, assuming a greater obligation than is the United States. As I am speaking on the treaty as a things about tbe United States. I am not conscious of having heard from the lips of members of the Opposition any appreciation of the part played in-this matter by America. Expressions of appreciation have come from the mouths of many honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber, but that could be described as general appreciation by the chamber of the part' that the United States has played in this treaty. The Americans Order! The cannot be. said to have been the originators of. the treaty, but the stimulus came from them. Many other countries came in during the early stages and did all that they could to encourage the meeting at Manila and to bring the treaty into existence. This Government adopts a certain attitude towards the United States of America, as the. strongest individual which, particularly in the Pacific, means a great deal to Australia. I know that the Leader of the Opposition holds contrary views. On more than one occasion he has criticized me personally for the attitude I have adopted, on behalf of the Government, to the United StatesI admit quite frankly, indeed I affirm, that unfortunately there is a fundamental difference between the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition and myself, on behalf of the Government, towards the United States.

I am not saying that the ANZUS pact or the Manila treaty represents tbe last word, and that we may sit back and take it easy. There is no magic cure-all in treaties that would establish the security of this country for the future, but let me state, on behalf of the Government, that, so far as it has been able to do so, it has achieved what it set out to achieve. It has done its best to ensure that, if active trouble comes to our part of the world, we shall enter that trouble with the strongest friends possible. I refer now to the scope of the treaty, and to whom we shall defend or shall not defend in an extremity. The Leader of tbe Opposition has suggested that the treaty is deficient, because we are not obliged to go to the aid of Communist North Viet Nam in the event of its being attacked by South Viet Nam. Does the right honourable gentleman suggest that the treaty should provide that we should go to the aid of a Communist state if it were attacked by a democratic state? Minister signed it, provides exactly for the past. I commend the treaty to the that. gentleman stated what he had to state before, and it was perfectly Opposition) [11.4] I do not wish to simple. He stated that there was occupy much time in replying to the no provision in tbe treaty which Minister for External Affairs( Mr placed upon Australia the obligation Casey). The right honourable gentleman of going to the aid of a Communist really has not dealt with the problem state in the unlikely event of its being associated with the preamble. When he attacked by a democratic state. Tbe Gowent to Manila, he knew that the vemment is asked whether the treaty obligation of the United States of guards us against fascist aggression. It America was to be limited to what was guards us against aggression of any kind, called communist aggression, but he but, if any one can tell me from which entered into an agreement under which direction fascist aggression is likely to Australia bound itself to contribute milicome on the Asian mainland, I should tary forces in the event of aggression, like to be told.

The right honourable opinion that the council should be estabgentleman is quite correct in stating that lished as quickly as possible to deal with that is the broad obligation imposed by the following three principal matters: the United Nations Charter.

He tt -[100 ] the giving of economic and technical aid to countries in the treaty area which need it most. A council meeting proper cannot be held until the treaty has been ratified by a number of countries, including the United States of America, and until it comes into operation. The Government hopes that there will be an early, and perhaps tentative, council meeting, even before the treaty comes into operation. I have had discussions with the United States of America which point to the possibility of a tentative meeting being held in the South-East Asia area within the next couple of months, or, at least, before the treaty finally comes into operation. The Government believes that the momentum that existed before, and at tbe time of, the Manila conference must be maintained, and that can be done only by tbe holding of a council meeting as early as possible. The Government welcomes the treaty. It has worked extremely hard to bring the treaty into existence and, as I stated at the conclusion of the proceedings at Manila, I believe that, when the treaty comes into operation, all of the signatory countries in this part of the world will be safer the and more secure than they have been in committee with every confidence.",101,Pairs

Those are obligations against subversion, which are undertaken in common witb the othernations who signed the treaty. It might be said witb 'some justice "" physician heal thyself"", because we know, and have seen recently exposed, the fact that there is considerable subversioninside the Australian community. It may be that this treaty will extend the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to deal witb subversion. Most honourable members will be familiar with the Goya Henry case, and they will recall that a dictum was advanced at tbe time of that case that the Commonwealth.could extend its powers into new fields by entering into treaties which so required it to do. I know that there is some doubt about this matter, but bonorable members will recall the essay upon it that was written by Professor Bailey, the present Solicitor-General. In that essay, Professor Bailey advanced arguments, pro and con, as to the extent that Australia's powers would be amplified by its entering into a treaty which necessitated the exercise of those powers. I do not know if the High Court would to-day maintain its former attitude on this matter. But I think that it is at least possible, and if it is possible I am glad that this article wbich we are putting into the treaty may make a very timely addition to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth to deal with subversion, particularly Communist subversion. I now come back to the preamble of all the political parties in the United the bill. Althoughi t has been held in States. courts from, time to time that the precized that policy. Merely to bold an amble of an act does not itself establish the opposite view does not demonstrate, in my facts that it lays down, nevertheless; in opinion, any unfriendliness to the United the interpretation of an act the preamble States at all. will be evidence of the intention of words used otherwhere in the act. It is probable that the inclusion of that preplainly and expressly, their profound amble may strengthen the constitutional gratitude for the great assistance given by hand of the Commonwealth ih dealing the American nation and the American with Communist subversion. If that is people in the defence of this country so, the right honourable gentleman, who is during World War II . That opinion is well versed in law and is probably fly to shared by every honourable member of the all these points, has therefore been proOpposition. However, to hold that vided with a reason, OT has provided a 1 reason himself, fbr the extraordinary vehemence of his attack on the preamble When previously addressing myself to this matter, I directed the attention of honourable members to one or two of the dangers in the proposed treaty as I saw them from Australia's viewpoint.

I say that what the Minister expresses is usually what Mr dissatisfied with military dictatorship, Poster Dulles has expressed a fortnight earlier. The Minister has no opinion of his own, nor has the Government a policy of its own on matters of this kind. Let me show honourable members where the Minister is completely astray, and how he misled the conference that drew up this treaty. I shall go on to consider the possibility of trouble, which I was previously developing as an argument, between India and Pakistan. I suggest that that is a real danger. is aware that there has been some difficulty between those two countries for a considerable period of time. Assuming that the worse did happen, and India attacked Pakistan or Pakistan attacked India. According to the Minister, Australia would not be involved in that affair, stability of the country was endangered but the treaty says quite plainly that we shall be involved because if India attacks Pakistan, Pakistan being a signatory to this treaty, Australia would be committed to intervene in the trouble. It is of no use for the Minister to say that he assured the representatives of Pakistan that we would not intervene in the case of trouble between other members of tbe British Commonwealth, because that is exactly what the treaty commits Australia to do. The Minister was fully aware that this was a possible criticism of the agreement, because in his second-reading speech he admitted that such a misunderstanding might arise, and he said that he had reassured the Pakistan representatives on that point. I ask why he did not assure the conference, and other representatives at the conference, that he was qualifying his acceptance of the treaty. If it was rigbt for America to put a qualification into the agreement, then I contend that the Minister, on behalf of Australia, should have put in a qualification that the treaty should not Mr Ward. require us to take up arms against another member of the British Commonwealth. The same thing applies in regard to countries. Let the Minister consider the form of government in Pakistan at present. Military forces have taken charge of Pakistan by force of arms. Assume that the people of Pakistan were and decided that, because they could not change their government by democratic means, they would take up arms in order to do so. This treaty refers to the maintenance of political stability. That applies to the political stability of a dictatorship, just as much as it applies to the political stability of a democratic government. Therefore, this Government is committing Australia to intervention in Pakistani f tha Pakistan Government invites it to interEverybody vene. The Minister has said that that will be done after consultation. an army facist revolt. Government determined that the political as a result of some popular movement, the Minister would commit Australia to intervene. The Minister has committed Australia to intervention in the domestic affairs of other nations, and that will be distinctly disadvantageous to Australia. A council will work out in detail the military commitments of each nation. Australia will be in the minority on that council. If more Asiatic nations decide to join in the treaty later, we sball be more definitely in the minority than ever. Our views will be minority views. What will the Minister do if some discussion arises over the present immigration policy of the Australian Government which is very unpopular in Asiatic countries? I ask the Minister that question, because although the Government only talks about Communist aggression, I believe that Australia has to be prepared to defend itself from aggression no matter from what quarter it comes, and whether it is Communist or fascist aggression.

362,Mr Waed,"If the Pakistan fascistto believe that tbe only threat to the security of Australia stems from possible Communist aggression. I suggest that they should look a little further towards the rearmed and resurgent Japanese nation to which the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) drew attention a few months ago. He oould see the danger. Supporters of the Government have argued that Japan now has a democratic government, and that it is no longer a threat to the security of Australia. I firmly believe that there are few Australians who would share this viewpoint, and who would not be willing to admit, if they spoke frankly, that they believe the threat to the security of Australia from Japan to be greater tban from any other quarter. It is true that under the ANZUS pact the United States is committed, to some degree, to give Australia aid, although there is some serious doubt whether the United States is, in fact, what the Americans have actually committed without the consent of Congress. Assuming the Japanese were moving south to invade Australia, we might expect some assistance from the United States under the ANZUS pact. Under the Seato arrangement, the United States would not be obliged to come to our aid in such circumstances because it could argue that the aggression was not Communist aggression. The Minister has let Australia down badly with regard to the verbiage used, both in the preamble and the terms and conditions of the treaty. This is not the first occasion that the Minister has let Australia down. He has attacked the Leader of the Opposition's attitude to the United States. the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition towards that nation was different from his own and that of the Government. We had to wait for some years after World War II . to discover liis attitude because, when the Labour Government took office in 1941, the present Minister for External Affairs was overseas. When Australia was in danger, he did not return to this country where he might have been able to be of assistance. He ran away in the nation's hour of danger. He should be the last to criticize the Leader of the Opposition. honourable member's time has expired. [11.35] -It does not take long to dispose of the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and the fanciful dangers that he has conjured up. The treaty under discussion does not commit Australia or the other signatories to anything of the kind that he has suggested. It provides for consultation and agreement between all parties. The dangers that the honourable member has been discussing are fanciful and do not exist for any member of the proposed alliance. I want to say only a few things about the fear of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) that Australia might be more deeply committed by this treaty than tbe United States of America is. I invite the committee first to examine stated. It is important to read the treaty because the Leader of the Opposition does not appear to have done so. I shall read to the committee the declaration of the United StatesThe United States of America, in executing the present treaty, does so with the understanding that its recognition of the effect of aggression and armed attack, and its agreement with reference thereto in Article IV., paragraph 1, apply only to Communist aggression. This is the important partBut aflirms tliat in the event of otlier aggression or armed attack, it will consult under the provisions of Article IV., paragraph 2. In other words, except in the case of a simple, open invasion of one country by Communist forces, the United States is He said that committed, with the other signatories to the treaty, to consult with them, and leaves itself free to take such measures as it considers necessary. Even if Australia were more closely committed than the United States, let me give the committee three reasons why it should be. In the first place, we are much more closely involved. We are not a great, distant, powerful nation like the United States. Secondly, we have extensive interests and responsibilities in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in the treaty area close to Asia. Thirdly, we are bound by the closest ties",107,Pairs

I -say to the committee, and the Leader of -the Opposition, that if Australia is more -deeply committed, we are proud to he so. Finally, let me say this about the preamble to which the right honourable gentleman and his followers have objected so strenuously. To whom does this preamble give offence? It offends oiic quarter only. It is realistic to have this preamble to the treaty bill, because this is a treaty to provide against a specific set of circumstances, and every signatory to it knows that. We know it in Australia. It is all very well to talk about other treaties, United Nations agreements and matters of that sort,' and to say that a preamble of this nature does not appear before them. They are not meant to deal with circumstances of this character. This is a specific treaty for a specific purpose, nnd the preamble to the bill of ratification is not only fully justified but most appropriate. me say this about the suggestion that Australia might become a satellite of the United States. There is no question of that at all. The United States has never, in its dealing with this Government, suggested that or attempted to put us in such a position. The fact is that we collaborate and co-operate with the United States as partners, although we are a much smaller nation, and it is due to the efforts of this Government and the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) that 'our prestige with America stands so high at present. That is a very different state of affairs from that which prevailed under the previous Labour Government. Mr Chairman' T h a t the question be now p u t . The committee divided. ( THE CHAIBMAN-MR .

Section 25 of the Electoral Act reads as follows:(1) A redistribution of any State into Divisions sliall be made in the manner hereinbefore directed by the Governor General by proclamation. (2) Such proclamation may be made(a) whenever an alteration is made in the number of members of the House of Representatives to be elected for the State; and (fc) whenever in one-fourth of the Divisions of the State the number of electors differs from a quota ascertained in the manner provided in this part to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less; and (c) at such.times as the Governor General thinks f it . Under 25 (2.) (a) of the Electoral Act, a redistribution of the electoral boundaries of New South Wales, South Australia and. Western Australia will be necessary. The Chief Electoral Officer has also recommended that a redistribution of boundaries in Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania is highly desirable, owing to the variations in the enrolment of several divisions in these States. The Government will take the matter into consideration.

I hope it means that the Government proposes to have a redistribution.. Because of the development of our industries, large-scale immigration, big housing undertakings, and various other factors which are having an important bearing on our community life, the position has changed considerably. For instance, in the division of La Trobe, which is represented in this House by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), there were about 38,000 persons enrolled in 1948, compared witb about 62,000 to-day. This is indicative of a the provisions of section phenomenon that is common to all Australia. In the inner metropolitan areas, population is decreasing, and in the outer areas it is increasing.. Another factor is the great number of unnaturalized aliens in our midst, many of whom might be naturalized by tbe time of the next general election, and therefore entitled to vote. I think the Government ought, at an early date, to announce its intention to authorize a redistribution, and appoint commissioners so that tbe work can proceed.",109,Adjournment Electoral
