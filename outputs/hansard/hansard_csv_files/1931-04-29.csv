Ister Make A Statement In Reference To The Report That The Commissioner Of Taxation Is Seeking To Collect Sales Tax On Meals Served In Restaurants, Hotels, And Cafes ? To Levy Sales Tax On Meals Served In Restaurants, Hotels, And Cafes. The Tax Is Imposed On Manufactured Goods, In","cluding cakes, scones, buns, sandwiches, &c. Meats are specifically exempted. Many manufacturers of buns, cakes and scones have been paying sales tax on the whole of their output, whether' disposed of to other retailers or through their own restaurants. Other manufacturers have been paying the tax only on that portion of their output sold to others in the trade or over the. counter; they have not been paying on the goods sold for consumption in their restaurants. The Commissioner of Taxation has good reason to believe that some persons are not even making correct returns; they are representing that the bulk of their output is consumed in their restaurants. It is impossible to discriminate justly between a dozen buns sold over the counter for consumption in the park and a dozen buns sold for consumption in restaurants. is collected, however, not on meals but on manufactured articles. of the Prime Minister been called to a paragraph in the Canberra Times of this morning's date to the effect that the sales tax is to be collected on meal3 supplied by restaurants and eating houses, which will be compelled to charge extra to cover the tax? In view of the fact that there is no penalty clause in any of the acts pertaining to the sales tax, will the Prime Minister consider bringing in a bill imposing severe penalties upon any one who chargos 100 per cent, extra for meals when the sales tax is only 2$ per cent.? that there are no penalty clauses in the Sales Tax Act. Such clauses aro to be found in those aets as in all taxation measures, but there is no power conferred by the Sales Tax Act to regulate the Norman Makin) price of meals. ter inform me whether it is intended to collect this' taxation from the smallest restaurants, or whether a provision will be made that it shall not be collected in respect of restaurants with a turnover below a certain specified amount?

Mr Scullin, at the time, was negotiating with the British financiers for a loan, and he explained to Mr Theodore that he thought it might be dangerous to the chances of the loan not to re-appoint Sir Robert. Mr Theodore expressed the opinion that Sir Robert should not be re-appointed for longer than a year, but Mr Scullin pointed out that the act precluded this. When an interjector shouted that Sir Robert was "" too old "", Mr Theodore replied, "" And too conservative "". I ask the Prime Minister whether there is any truth in that statement ? able member not to accept as absolutely accurate telegraphed condensations of speeches. The statement reported to have been made by Mr Theodore is substantially correct; the inference that probably would be drawn from it would be substantially incorrect. ""When the matter of re-appointing Sir Robert Gibson came up for consideration I consulted not only the members of the then Cabinet, who, unanimously endorsed the action taken, but also the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) who was temporarily out of the Cabinet. All agreed that Sir Robert Gibson should be re-appointed. Whether the re-appointment should be for seven years or a shorter period was also considered, but the act provides that a director must be appointed for seven years, and, accordingly, Sir Robert Gibson was re-appointed for that period. personal explanation. member been misrepresented? ber last Sir Robert Gibson was re-appointed Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board. On the day the decision was taken I objected to his appointment, and in order that there might be no mistake as to my attitude, I wrote at the time these words: "" I protest against this appointment,"" and passed the paper on to Mr Forde for his perusal, the M e l b o u r n e and for the information of other honordid not hand the paper to me. for Customs asked what the paper was for, and I replied that it was to ensure that there would be no mistake as to where I stood. If at any time. I agreed to the re-appointment of Sir Robert Gibson, I must at that time have been unconscious from over-eating. I particularly desired that there should he no misunderstanding about the matter, and for that reason I wrote the note I have mentioned, and threw it on the Cabinet table. misrepresented by the Prime Minister. In his answer to the question regarding the appointment of Sir Robert Gibson, he said that the appointment was agreed to unanimously by the Cabinet. It was not. The statement made by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) in regard to putting his objection in writing is correct. I was present at the time, and witnessed the action. Not only did I object to the re-appointment on the occasion upon which the decision was taken, but I objected to it at a previous meeting. I do not want to go more fully into tbe matter now; the time is not fitting; but I do not wish it to be said in this House that I was a party to the re-appointment of Sir Robert Gibson. sonal explanations made by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), and the honourable member for ""West Sydney",10,Government Savings Ba Nk

I point out that these happenings are occurring in a department which enjoys the luxury of a secretary receiving £S0 a week. Yesterday we heard honourable members of the Opposition talking about extravagance. That is one of the extravagances that they and 'heir colleagues imposed upon our country. That gentleman is enjoying that salary whilst, unfortunate returned men with families, and twelve or thirteen years of satisfactory service, are being turned adrift to sink or swim. Last week I directed certain questions to the Postmaster-General( Mr A.. Green) concerning picturegrams. The Director of Posts and Telegraphs is very expert in lofty plausibility. He introduced into the Country, picturegrams which nobody asked for, with the result that his fantod has cost the country nearly £12,000.

The second citation deals with a case of equal, if not greater, gravity than the first. I shall enumerate the war disabilities of these six returned limbless soldiers, and I hope that they will not mind my mentioning their the honourable names. The first is Mr Albert Hallam, who is suffering from a gun-shot wound on the right thigh, considered to be equal in severity to an amputation. This man was also working as a cleaner at the General Post Office, but is not in the group that. I previously mentioned. The next case is that of MrH . W. Thornwaite, a returned soldier suffering from an amputation of the right leg: He is a member of the Storemen and Packers Union, which he joined in 1920, ancl his references and character are very good.

Squire was employed in this branch as assistant specification writer from the 18th August, 1924, to the 29th November, 1930, inclusive, ancl ceased duty in consequence of the slacking off of work in the branch. During thc period Mr Squire was witli the department he proved himself to be conscientious, industrious, and gave of his best in respect of all work entrusted to him. Personally, I regret that circumstances have been such as to cause the termination of his employment in the branch. The sixth case is that of Mr C. L . Tindall, a particularly painful case, as the details will demonstrate. This man is a returned soldier whose left leg has been amputated above the knee. addition he has a compound fracture of the right ankle and a gunshot wound above the right knee. All these men have been turned out of their positions in the Government Service. They are, in the main, married men with children depending upon them. Apparently, these are the only cases of their kind involved throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, and in spite of the fact that the meu concerned are in receipt of war pensions, the position of the Government will be quite indefensible if it refuses to reinstate so small a number-onl y six -limbles s soldiers, and thereby declares to the world that the Commonwealth is so barren of resources that it cannot honour its solemn obligations to these unfortunate men. With Mr Martin Farrow, the President of the Limbless Returned Soldiers Association, I headed a deputation which waited on the Prime Minister. He was most sympathetic) and promised to do what he could for tliese men. I had previously expressed my assurance of the Prime Minister's personal sympathies with these men and those depending upon them, and because of that I approached him confident that these cases would be properly attended to. I assured the Prime Minister that any action taken by him to assist these men would not only be gratefully appreciated by them and their dependants, but would also receive the endorsement of the people of Australia. As a returned soldier, it is with a sense of deep SOITOW, and yet privilege, that I have country to inform honourable members of the facts, and to explain the circumstances of these unfortunate comrades of mine, so that -honourable members may come to some decision which may induce the Government to reconsider its previous unfavorable replies aud to direct that these men be re-employed. support the motion for the adjournment of the House on the principle that if the Government does anything that is not in thc interests of the returned soldiers I must oppose it. I was in doubt at one stage of the honourable member's speech whether he was not using this motion as a means to attack the DirectorIn General of Postal Services, to whom the honourable member has a distinct antipathy, and about whom he has from time to time asked questions in this House with a view to doing him an injury. The policy of the Postmaster-General's Department is a matter for the Minister, and it is to the Minister that the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) should direct his complaints. The action of the Government in dismissing returned soldiers from various Government departments is acting harshly upon these men. A great number of them were put into those departments on their return from the war by the Repatriation Department. They were partially disabled, but held their positions right up to the time when this Government came into power. In reply to a question that I asked in September or October last of the thou Postmaster-General( Mr Lyons), I was informed that no fewer than 1,492 returned soldiers had been dismissed from government departments since the 30th June.

I pointed out to him that they could be reinstated by amending thc Public Service Act to allow of the rationing of permanent employees. The honourable member who moved this motion pointed out that the six men he mentioned were all unionists. That does not concern me. . The only preference that I recognize is the sentimental preference to returned soldiers, which was promised to them and has been adhered to by every government in the past. ployers ! has stated that the Government will shortly consider the introduction of a five-day week throughout the Public Service, If that were to be introduced to permit of the rationing of permanent members of the Public Service, and the re-employment of dismissed returned soldiers, I should support it, but apparently the Government merely proposes to have the work of the Public Service performed in a fewer number of days per week at the existing rates of pay. A returned soldier was recently dismissed from the mail room of the General Post Offiee for failing to pass a medical examination. He was rejected on the ground of slight deafness: despite the fact that his disability did not interfere with his duties as a mail sorter. I admit that the Government has a difficult task to perform in financing the Public Service. able member say that when the Government is paying one man £80 a week? of Postal Services is in charge of an enormous undertaking and has to be well paid. The honourable member should not allow his bias against one man to affect his attitude in this matter. The Director General of Postal Services is under the control of the Postmaster-General, and the Postmaster-General need only bring down au amendment of the Public Service Act to permit of the rationing of permanent officers and the reinstatment of dismissed returned soldiers. I support the motion because harsh and unjust treatment has been meted out to returned soldiers in the Public Service, particularly those who were only temporarily employed. I am entirely in sympathy with the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) because one of the cases that he has mentioned concerns a constituent of mine. I also assisted the honourable member in presenting his case to the Postmaster-General, who at that time was the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons). I distinctly remember thathonorable gentleman coming to the table and telling us the whole story. He said by private emthat the Government had no money, and consequently some 1,400 or 1,500 returned soldiers-accordin g to the figures supplied to the honourable member for Balacharged. The Government coffers were empty, and it was of no use to employ men if they could not be paid. Someone had to go, and therefore the temporary employees in the Government Service had to be dismissed. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons) made it clear at the time where his sympathies lay; but, at a later stage, I again pointed out that the limbless men, who are deserving of special consideration, should be reinstated at all costs. I think that Mr Squires was employed in the department for years after his return from the war. Some of these men had been engaged for so long a period that they began to consider themselves permanent officers. I know some who had been in the department for ten years, but are now tramping the streets looking for work. Perhaps, by an amendment of the Public Service Regulations, this Parliament could make possible the re-employment of the limbless men. They are few in number, and we should give them some hope in life. would be sufficient. the regulations issued under the Public Service Act. There should be some way out of the difficulty; but, if funds are not available to pay these men, I do not know what can be done.

77,Mr Marks,"O r an amendment of the matter is attributable to the honourable inember for Wilmot. His sympathies are entirely with these men, and the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) knows it. thing of the sort. I have shown that he was responsible for thousands of pounds being squandered at the very time when he was sacking these men. Government was faced with probably as difficult a situation in certain directions as that now confronting the present Government. Since the number of the crippled and limbless returned soldiers is so small, I hope that the Prime Minister will do everything possible to restore them to their former employment. If the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons) were still Postmaster General, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) apparently would have nothing to say about this matter now, since the honourable member for Wilmot is his new leader. remains that the dismissals occurred when that honourable member was Postmaster-General, and he is now going about the country telling the people of his ideas for solving the problem of unemployment. He is talking, perhaps more than anybody else, against repudiation; but, when he was Postmaster-' General, he repudiated the sacred promise given to the men who fought for their country that they would be looked after upon their return. balance the budget he did not care a jot for that promise to the returned soldiers. Niemeyer. for Martin has spoilt a good ease. honourable member for Martin brought this matter under the notice of the honourable member for Wilmot. men his sympathy. all they received. I suppose that, in the final analysis, the Treasurer ( Mr vernment, and that the dismissed men Theodore) should take more blame than any other Minister for what has been done. Honourable members have become intoxicated with the idea of balancing the budget, and they are willing to let the returned soldiers, and many other deserving members of the community, go to the devil, so long as the overseas financiers are paid. Irrespective of whatever government happens to be in power, the interests of the overseas bondholders are to be safeguarded, at the dictation of the big financiers, even to the extent of sacking returned soldiers. As the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) has pointed out, the dismissed men were engaged in probably the only class of work that they were capable of doing; yet they were sacked in cold blood, and loft to shift for themselves. I would not have said anything about the way in which the blame for this action should be apportioned, if the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) had not attempted to throw a cloak of innocence over the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons). On broad principles, the disThe fact missed men should be reinstated. A direction should be given by the Government that the services of a certain official receiving £4,000 a year arc not required. The post office ran well for a long time without him. I believe that he received only about £700 a year in Great Britain. This oflicer is not worth anything like £4,000 a year, and I hope that the Prime Minister( Mr .Scullin) will take a couple of thousand pounds off his In his efforts to salary so that the discharged men may be re-employed. In times like thess, nobody in this country is worth a salary of £4,000 a year. In any reduction of expenditure in the Public Service, we should begin at the top of the ladder, and leave men such as limbless soldiers alone. This is the least we can do for those w'.o served their country from 1914 to 1918. Every person in the community who is in need to-day is entitled to food and shelter, irrespective of war servioe. Many of those in want to-day could not have enlisted, because they were below the age for military service. I hope that the appeal made by the honourable member for Martin will be acted upon by the Gowill at least be reinstated under the same conditions as they previously enjoyed.",18,Dismissal Of Returned Soldiers Formal Motion For Adjournment

Some men are cheap at £4,000 a year, others are dear at £4 a week. As a member of the Government that appointed Mr Brown, I know that by one of his first administrative acts he saved to the Commonwealth £25,000 on one contract. That saving was sufficient to pay his salary for six years ahead. During the last general election the Labour campaign director in New South ""Wales made certain specific promises to the returned soldiers. It was cruel of him to make such promises if they could not be fulfilled. I join with those honourable metmbers who claim that the disahled soldier should have sympathetic consideration. He has a much harder row to hoe than have other soldiers, and certainly than non-soldier members of the community. Therefore, he should receive particular care. I have had brought to my notice the circumstances of a man who wa3 employed a3 a temporary officer in the Postal Department prior to the war. In 1914 he applied for, and was granted, permission to enlist in the expeditionary force sent to New Guinea. Upon his return he resumed duty in the Postal Department, but subsequently was given P ermission to enlist in the Australian mperial Force. He was badly knocked about on service, and spent many months in the Caulfield Military Hospital. After his discharge he was given work in the Postal Department, being sent to New South ""Wales because there was no position for him in Victoria. Until recently he has been a lift attendant at the General Post Office in Sydney. Now, after seventeen years of service to his country, either as a soldier or a public servant, lie is thrown money was available for new works. Oil out into a cold world. His original full pension was reduced to half because he preferred a job. He is so disabled that he has to live in a straight jacket, and is unfitted for any ordinary employment. It is true that as he receives a half penmy sympathy that I could not sion he is not wholly destitute, but what honourable member would sacrifice a limb for the sake of a pension? We have responsibilities to the limbless men, and we should see that they get a fair deal. If it is possible to .restore them to the permanent officers who did not go to the front, preference should be given to them. ter) [3.34] -The honourable member for Parkes (M.r. Marr) referred to an election pamphlet. It is a pity to introduce extraneous considerations into the discussion of the distressing subject which rhe honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) has brought before the House. I regret that he did not give to me earlier notice of his intention to submit this motion. He communicated with me at 12.30 to-day, and as the House met at 2.30. and the luncheon hour intervened, such notification was not sufficient to enable me to acquaint myself with the facts. I have obtained the file from the department, but have had no chance to do more than peruse it hurriedly. It is clear, however, that this matter is not new; even the honourable member's activity in respect of it dates back to September last. When the Government took office in October, 1929, 1,700 of these men had received notice of dismissal; 95 per cent, of them were returned soldiers. The Government retained these men in the Service for six months longer than was intended by the previous administration. I well remember the appeal which the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons), when Postmaster-General, made to the Treasurer for extra money. His appeal was granted, and the men were kept on. until the end of the financial year. Admittedly since then more than 1,700 men have heen dismissed. I do not like having to defend the dismissal of any men, particularly those who are disabled, but the revenue had fallen, works in hand had been completed, and no more one day the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) introduced several deputations to me in Sydney, but the briefest was that consisting of half a dozen limbless men who had been dismissed. Their appearance so aroused continue to listen to the details of their circumstances. I . consulted immediately",19,Dismissal Of Returned Soldiers Formal Motion For Adjournment

87,Mr Scullin (Yarra,"Prime Miniswitli tbe Public Service Board regarding the possibility of their reinstatement. The members of the board received most sympathetically my suggestion that a thorough search of all departments should be instituted with a view to finding positions for the displaced men. Officers of the board were deputed to do that. The honourable member for Martin received Postmaster-General( Mr Lyons), dated the loth September last, together with a minute setting forth all the particulars regarding these dismissals. The simple fact is that the department engaged a number of lads as junior mechanics, and trained them until they were fit to take up positions. They are permanent members of the Service, and unless they displace the temporary men, there is no work for thc.ni to do. The department had to choose between efficiently-trained mechanics, who were too young to go to the war, and less efficient temporary employees. mechanics are sons of men who died at the front. Honourable members will realize that the principle of preference to returned soldiers does not work out altogether as we would like. I have in mind a young man whose father was killed in France, and who was dismissed from the Postal Department to make room for a returned soldier. I wns very touched by the appeal made on behalf of the six limbless soldiers, and in normal circumstances I would say that we should go out of our way to make provision for them in public departments. Eut in the parade before this building on ANZAC DayI saw able-bodied returned soldiers who must have been ashamed of the clothes they wore. They were not limbless or halfblind pensioners, but men who were physically fit, able and willing to work. Honourable members should not forget that the disabled men are at least receiving in pensions money which the able bodied returned soldiers would be glad to receive as wages for work. able gentleman lose a leg for thirty shillings a week? remind the honourable member that in August last, when replying to a barrage of criticism from the press that supports his party, and that advocates the reduction of soldiers' pensions, I pointed out that soldier pensioners are occupying good positions in the Public Service and elsewhere; but I said that no able-bodied man would change places with a disabled soldier for the sake of his pension. We have occasionally to choose between returned soldiers who are in rea letter from the then ceipt of a pension, and returned soldiers who are starving. My sympathy is extended to the disabled men, and if it were possible to do so I would create positions for them. But all of them are receiving pensions ranging from a maximum of £3 6s. to a minimum of £1 Ss. a week. I ask the House to take into consideration all the facts. The letter sent to the honourable member for Martin, although couched in official language, was not cold-blooded. In one paragraph of the letter the board pointed out that Messrs. Thornwaite and Many of these junior McLennan were not employed under the Public Service Act, but under the Defence Act, and were not registered with tbe board for temporary employment. The chairman of the board suggested that they should so register. That letter showed the desire of the board to find positions for the displaced men. My instruction was that every avenue should be explored with a view to placing the six men who had been specifically mentioned, because of tbe nature of their injuries. But other returned soldiers are out of work. The widespread unemployment is a tragedy, and if the Government could get some sympathetic support for its financial proposals it could do something to alleviate suffering. Unfortunately that support is not being given to us. These dismissals from public departments commenced long before the present Government assumed office. For many mouths we saved hundreds of men who were under notice of dismissal, and in so doing strained the financial resources of the department, as the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons) pointed out. The Government does not lack sympathy for the returned soldiers, and there is no need to make a special I appeal in their behalf.

The Government has suggested a means of raising money for unemployment relief. Its proposals have been rejected. If other honourable members can devise a solution of the unemployment problem or a means of alleviating the distress it causes, I earnestly appeal to them to make their suggestions, which the Government will sympathetically consider. Having regard to the Prime Minister's statement that the six limbless men who waited upon him at a deputation in Sydney were such a distressing spectacle that he could not continue to listen to them, the reply he has just made is most unsatisfactory. It clearly indicated that men who have served their country in the Great War and have been seriously disabled for life have had to give way to young men in the employ of the Postmaster-General at the General Post Office in Sydney. That policy cannot be justified. After the war, when employment was being sought for returned soldiers, particularly disabled men, the Postal Department and other branches of the Public Service were found to be the only avenues in which abled returned men could be placed. We have spent many millions of pounds on the repatriation of returned soldiers, and some of that money has been devoted to training limbless and disabled men for positions in the Public Service. It is a tragic thing that, so soon as this country finds itself passing through a time of hardship, so soon as we are, in effect, up against it, the men who served their country at the war should, in effect, the otlier disabled men who have be thrown on the scrap-heap. They are compelled to go. in search for work at a time when it is almost impossible for them to find it. It has been disclosed in the statement of the honourable member for Martin services of returned soldiers have been dispensed with because there was a shortage of employment. Handicapped as they are in many cases as a result of their war service, they have had to go the honourable member supported sacked out and look for work elsewhere. The six cases which have been quoted, are merely typical of During the last election campaign the Treasurer issued a statement over his own signature giving an assurance which, no doubt, was accepted by many of the returned men now concerned, that employment would be provided in the Public Service for all disabled returned soldiers. This is what he saidThe placing in employment of partially disabled returned soldiers is a very bard problem. But for the sympathetic treatment of them by employers, it would indeed be almost impossible to solve. These men could all be found positions in the Public Service, doing useful work and, thereby, distributing responsibility over the whole of the taxpayers; not, as now, leaving it to a very few to carry. This could be done without in any way impairing the efficiency of the Service. That is a very definite and precise promise, ancl should be honored as far as practicable by the Government, certainly to the extent of keeping in employment men with long service. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Martin, all the men affected have had long service, and all have excellent records. We cannot escape from the fact that they have not received proper consideration. All sorts of promises were made to them before they seriously diswent to the war, after they returned, and during the last election. In spite of those promises they have been callously turned out by the Government. Although the Prime Minister said that he was impressed by the case put forward ou behalf of the six men specifically referred to, the fact remains that they have received no satisfaction. I ask the Prime Minister to look into their cases again, and also into the cases of been dismissed in other States. It was found necessary, in order to avoid, dismissals in the Defence Department, to ration the work. If need be, something similar should be done in thc other departments so as to furnish employment for disabled returned men. The Govern( Mr Eldridge) that the ment has fallen down on its job.

91,Mr Chifley,"The Government whichinformation regarding the dismissal of returned men by this Government, was given to the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr ""White) in reply to a question. It was stated that.during the period from June to October of 1930, this Government dismissed 2,292 employees. under notice of dismissal when this Government took office. tioned, 1,429 were returned soldiers, of whom 1,144 had had two years' service, while many of them had had twelve years' service. soldiers discharged prior to the advent of this Government? concerned with 36 very seriously disabled returned soldiers whose situation has been explained by the honourable member for Martin. The Prime Minister himself admitted that he was impressed by the serious nature of their disabilities. six, not 36. altogether, and the Prime Minister considered the cases of six of them. disabled men. by the honourable member for Balaclava was 36. These 36 disabled men were employed in the Department in Melbourne and there were also 36 returned men in the General Post Office iu Sydney, six of whom were seriously disabled-the six the Prime Minister saw in New South Wales. All the Governments of Australia have an obligation to the returned soldiers, and surely the position of the country is not so utterly hopeless that provision cannot be made for our seriously disabled men. There must be room in a huge organization such as our Public Service, which costs £11,000,000 a year, for such of the returned soldiers as have been referred, to in this debate. I ask the Prime Minister to re-consider this matter carefully, aud to ensure, if possible, that the matters relating to the rights of returned dismissed men are restored to the positions they have held for so many years. I sympathize with the efforts of those who have interested themselves on behalf of returned soldiers, but one might be excused, after listening to this debate, for believing that all the returned soldiers in the country are, or have been, in the employ of the Commonwealth Government. It is true that, during the regime, not only of this Government, but of the previous Government, returned soldiers have had to be dismissed along with others; but it is also true that, in many cases, injustices have been perpetrated in order to provide returned soldiers with employment. I remember that, even during the war, a post office employee whose five sons had gone to the war, two of them having been killed, was dismissed in order to make room for a returned man. We should look at this matter from all points of view, and it would be instructive, I think, to inquire what private employers in Australia have done for returned soldiers. as anybody else. I have known returned soldiers who have wandered about the country for months in search of work, and have finally taken off their badges and stood in the queue for jobs, because in. no other way did they have any chance of obtaining work. Bad as may have been the treatment meted out to some of the soldiers in government Postmaster-General's employ, they have been treated ten times worse by private employers. able member see that the Commonwealth Government is setting private employers a very bad example? I merely wish to point out that we should not do injustice to other sections of the community in our laudable desire to help returned soldiers. Many young men of the present day were too young to go to the war. Probably their brothers fought, or even their fathers, and surely they should not be denied the right to work, even to benefit returned soldiers. I admit that there is room for inquiry into many soldiers. Besides employment, there is the matter of pensions which would bear scrutiny.

They were promised inuch by State and CommonAvealth Governments, particularly by the Commonwealth Government, and it is our duty to see, if possible, that they receive fair treatment. Only the Prime Minister has yet seen fit to speak to this motion on behalf of the Government. I have been waiting to hear the reply of the Minister concerned, but so far he has been silent. I listened carefully to the statement of the Prime Minister, and I must confess that his arguments left me cold. His was a most unsatisfactory reply. In the first place, he introduced party politics by saying that if certain legislative proposals of the sing the value of his services to the comGovernment, presumably those relating to the printing of notes, had been allowed to pass through Parliament, money would be available for the employment of returned soldiers. He also referred to 1,700 employees who, he alleged, were to be dismissed, but who were kept on for six months by this Government, which acted in the role of the Good Samaritan. pointed out on more than one occasion by the honourable member for ""Wilmot( Mr Lyons). merit in it, the honourable member for Wilmot is entitled to all the credit he can get for his action.. I do not propose to throw any stone at him for having kept these men on. is not game. The honourable member for Wilmot is now his leader. member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Cusack) is misinformed. Information has been supplied in this House to the effect that, during the period of eight months, this Government dismissed 2,189 returned soldier employees from the PostmasterGcneral's Department. referred to by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) are only a few ^ f the number concerned. The mover of the motion also referred to six disabled men. I cannot understand tlio attitude adopted by the Prime Minister in this connection. The right honourable gentleman said that on ANZAC Day he saw a number of unemployed returned men standing about in full possession of their health and strength. He left the inference to be drawn that those men were much worse off than the disabled returned men. who wore unemployed, because the latter received a pension. I am the oldest member of the Council of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and one of the three who founded the Limbless Soldiers Association. I wish to make it quite plain that that association, and the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, have always adopted it as a cardinal principle that the fact that a man is in receipt of a pension should not be taken into consideration in assesmunity. If a soldier pensioner is able to do the job for which he is paid, he ought to receive the full wage for it, irrespective of the fact that he is in receipt of a pension. Yet the Prime Minister this afternoon used the argument that because a returned soldier was receiving a pension from the Government, be was being well paid the kind. inference that could be drawn from his remarks. sympathy for these men gets us nowhere. I was amazed to hear the Prime Minister draw the distinction between able-bodied soldiers and limbless returnedmen. particularly in view of the fact that the Treasurer, as campaign director for the Labour party in the last federal election, promised that positions would be found in the Commonwealth Public Service for every disabled soldier. That promise was like many others that were made. It did not havo behind it the slightest intention of fulfilment. Neither in the original Cabinet formed from honourable The 36 men members opposite nor in the reconstructed Cabinet was room found for even one returned soldier. I am not likely to be influenced, therefore, by the cheap claptrap of honourable members opposite. The Prime Minister said that his heart bled when he saw returned men out of employment.

A small amendment could have been made to the Commonwealth Public Service Act to provide for the admission of all returned soldier employees into the service as' permanent officers. The present Postmaster-General (Mi. A. Green), the Minister for Trade ancl Customs( Mr Forde) and the ex-Minister for Health( Mr Anstey) were all members of the Public Accounts Committee which recommended such an amendment of the act, and while they were Cabinet colleagues they could have caused a bill to be introduced to make that amendment. Had it been made, the axe would have fallen evenly on all redundant officers. presented ? before the last Government was defeated. honourable member for Richmond cause the Government, which he supported, to make the amendment? occasion on which I have objected in this House to the dismissal of returned soldiers from the Public Service. This Government cannot escape condemnation for its failure to protect the interests of returned men. It is probably too late now to amend the act in the direction I have indicated, but in view of the fact that a bill for this purpose could be put through the House in ten minutes, it might still be worthwhile to do it. Had that amendment been made we should have been saved a great deal of heart-burning ancl trouble, and also all the histrionics and verbal acrobatics of the Prime Minister this afternoon. -The honourable member's time has expired. For the information of honourable members. I intimate that the new Standing Order provides that this debate may continue for two hours from the time of its commencement. That period will not expire until 4.55 p.m. -It is of no use for honourable members opposite to try to place on fhe shoulders of this Government the blame for the non-fulfilment of the promises made to returned soldiers. It must be remembered that these promises were first made in the earliest days of the recruiting campaign for war service overseas. The men who were urged to enlist were told that if they served their country Australia would be made a land fit for heroes to live in. They were promised that notonly would they be cared for, but that their dependants also would lack for nothing. When this Government assumed office, many men were under notice of dismissal from the Postmaster-General's Department; but many hundreds of returned soldiers had been dismissed previous to that time. It is therefore useless for honourable members opposite to try to shoulder the responsibility for what has happened on to other people. Tho honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) has said that more than 2,000 men have been dismissed from the Postmaster-General's Department in the last few months and a large number in the New South. Wales is now depending upon such assistance in the way of food as the Lang Government can give them. Let me also remind the honourable member that the men to whom the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) has referred arc among the number. In the course of his remarks the Prime Minister stated that he participated on Saturday last in the celebration of ANZAC Day. Let me ask him how he thinks the unemployed returned soldiers who were in attendance are being fed ancl clothed while they are walking the streets out of work? Hundreds of these men in Sydney and other parts of New South Wale3 are utterly dependent upon the dole and whatever assistance the Now South Wales Government can give them. That Government, like every other government, has had to decide between providing these men and others with food, clothing, and shelter, and sending money overseas to meet the interest charges on war loans. Many of the people who invested in those loans took no part whatever in the war and are making no sacrifices at all to-day.

121,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [4.8j.,"of men whose health has been impaired by war service, is deplorable. Many men lost their limbs in the war, and have now been thrown on the industrial scrap heap. To-day they are at the tender mercy of governments and benevolent institutions. Por my part, I have made it quite clear in the present crisis that I support a policy which provides for the granting of sustenance to these and other men in preference to a policy which provides merely for the payment of interest on war loans. A great deal has been said about repudiation. You are the repudiationists-yo u are repudiating these men every day. order. I submit, first, that the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) is not in order in using threatening language, and, secondly, that he is not in order in addressing honourable members as "" you "" in any manner whatever. ( Mr Keane) -The line of argument being followed by the honourable member for West Sydney is in order; but I must ask him to address honourable members as the representatives of constituencies and not personally. wound the tender susceptibilities of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham). I shall be most careful to give him the fullest title that is due to him. I have no desire to take anything whatever from you. of order. The honourable member is addressing other honourable members as "" you "" almost immediately after he has been directed to do otherwise. I ask the honourable member for West Sydney to obey the ruling of the Chair. do so. Honourable members opposite have repudiated returned soldiers over and over again. Eor my part, I intend, in this crisis, as at other times, to recognize Dear Sir, my responsibility to assist, not only limbless soldiers, but other returned men and the workers generally I make no apology to the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), who is interjecting, or to any other honourable member, for the attitude that I adopted during the war. I am quite satisfied that if the returned men who assembled in many places .on Saturday to celebrate ANZAC Day were given the opportunity to do so they would endorse the sentiments which I am expressing this afternoon. I have the greatest sympathy with all who are in need in this country, and intend to do my best to see that they are given relief. The people who are the real repudiationists are those who have failed to redeem the promises made from the earliest days of the war to the men who enlisted-the men whose case is under consideration in the discussion of this motion. These men were told that if they went to the war, both they and their dependants would be cared for; but their circumstances to-day show how far this promise has been honored. I stated recently that any criticism directed purely to embarrass a government in its administration is improper and unjustifiable in times such as the present. We must recognize that the work of all governments is difficult and becoming increasingly so. I have no desire to be in any way unreasonable in my criticism of the Government's action iu discussing the motion that was moved by the honorable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge). It deals with the dismissal of members of the Returned Limbless Sailors and Soldiers Association, and of some other returned soldiers who were engaged in cleaning work in the. New South Wales branch of the Postal Department, numbering in all 36. I entirely agree with the representations that have been made, particularly with regard to the members of the Returned Limbless Sailors and Soldiers Association. There have been other cases besides those quoted by the honourable member. In regard to one of these I made representations direct to the Prime Minister. In a letter dated the 9th April last, the Acting Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department replied to my communication as follows:With further reference to your letter of the l l t h March, relative to the case of Mr J. E. Rice, a returned' limbless soldier, on wnose behalf representations were made to you by the Returned Limbless Sailors and Soldiers Association, Room 21, Courier Building, Queen-street, Brisbane, I desire to inform you that it has been the practice of the Com-",25,Dismissal Of Returned Soldiers Formal Motion For Adjournment

128,Mr D. Cameron (Brisbane) [4.15].,"monwoalth Public Service Board and Commonwealth Departments to give special consideration in the matter of employment to maimed and limbless soldiers, and it is only in extreme circumstances that their services are dispensed with. When Mr Rice was last engaged there was a reasonable expectation of his services being required foisome considerable time, as he was being utilized in place of a permanent oflicer who had taken up duty temporarily in the Territory of New Guinea, but no definite term of employment was assured Mr Rice. In the present time of general depression, there has been a falling oil' in the activities of Government Departments, particularly in the Customs and Postmaster-General's Departments, and this has resulted in permanent officers becoming in excess of requirements in their normal positions. These ofiicers cannot, under the Public Service Act, be declared as ""excess"" while there are temporary employees occupying positions which the permanent officers could (ill, and the board, therefore, has no option but to replace the temporary employees if a permanent oflicer becomes available. The Commonwealth Public Service Board very much regrets that a permanent oflicer of the Customs Department became in excess of requirements in his normal position, and the only position in which he could be placed was that occupied by Mr Rice, leaving no alternative to termination of employment. I believe that Mr Rice is one of the few temporary members of the Postal Department whose services were retained in Queensland. The letter continuedI am to add that the case of Mr Rice will be accorded every consideration permissible under the Public Service Regulations in the event of temporary assistance being required. Honourable members must all agree that it is most regrettable that the services of these unfortunate men should be dispensed with at this stage. The position in Queensland has been somewhat different from that in other States. For some time past there has been a gradual elimination of temporary employees from the Postal Department of that State, so that to-day practically not one is left. The services of these men were dispensed with at a time when there was some possibility of securing other employment. MrA . GHEES -""When were the men to whom the honourable member refers put out ? MrD . CAMERON -During the time that Mr Christie was Deputy Postmaster General in Queensland. That gentleman, probably foreseeing what the future had in store, set out gradually to eliminate temporary employees from his department. I urge that the Government should give consideration to the adoption of a rationing scheme, such as the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has suggested more than once, and also that it should further explore the possibility of employing limbless men to operate government lifts, to collect railway tickets in the Commonwealth Railway Department, and to do similar work for which they are qualified. I believe that the honourable member for Martin was justified in bringing this matter before the House. I am not concerned at this juncture with the conduct of the Postal Department or with the Government's financial policy. Those issues are not included in the motion which I am supporting. In the past I have made appeals to governments on behalf of my ex-soldier comrades, without heat or political prejudice, and again I ask the Government to give sympathetic consideration to the case of these men. I realize that they do not stand alone, but there are thousands of their comrades in the tragic position of being unemployed. These unfortunate individuals have proved themselves worthy employees of the Commonwealth, so there is an added and special obligation on the Government to make a definite effort to re-employ them, either on work that is rationed, or in capacities for which limbless soldiers are peculiarly fitted. I have never allowed the subject of unemployment to pass without striving my utmost to have something done to alleviate the evil. I hope to see the day when governments w ill say definitely that it is their primal duty to find work for the people. I hate and loathe the term "" casual workers "". A f t e r a man has been employed for some twelve months and has proved himself capable of doing the work, his job should be made permanent. Many of the men to whom the honourable member for M a r t in ( Mr Eldridge) referred had been employed in the Postal Department for years. Many are labouring under disabilities with which everyone must sympathize. It is my experience in life that one ounce of help is worth a ton of sympathy. I recollect helping a hero of the Balaclava Charge",26,Dismissal Of Returned Soldiers Formal Motion For Adjournment
129,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4.23],"who came into the hospital in which I was engaged when a student, many years ago. The great British Government gave that man a pension of 6d. a day. He was recovering from his eighteenth amputation; both his legs were offI went round among my fellow students and collected enough to purchase for him a vehicle in which he could propel himself. How many of the Balaclava heroes died in the workhouse, until one great man who conducted a London newspaper instituted a campaign and made the nation realize its responsibilities in the matter. Then came the South African War. Promises were made that our men would be looked after. The then ActingGovernor, Sir John Madden, later stated publicly-and I have his letter if any one doubts what I am saying-that he regretted that promises were put into his lips which were not carried out by subsequent governments. Next came the awful holocaust of 1914-1918. Certainly those who participated in it were cared for much better than were those in preceding wars, but still not enough has been done. I do hope to see the time when we shall reach a stage described by the wonderful writer who referred to the three races of intelligent beings which our heroes and their fellows might at least inhabit this earth, the human, the ant, and the bee. Never in the nest of the ant or in the hive of a bee do the young or the workers suffer from a lack of the necessaries of life. Can we say the same of the human who, Ave are told, is fashioned in God's likeness, who possesses brains that enable him to create almost anything. He can send a wireless message from pole to pole, and direct the greatest ship across the Atlantic during the night without a mishap Yet he has failed to use those splendid brains to eradicate unemployment and misery. Tbat is why I hate find loathe the term "" casual workers "". I recognize that it might be difficult his hand, like Belisarius at the gates of in times of stress to accomplish Constantinople.

Accordingly these returned solthey render valuable service to the comdiers, of whose distressful condition the Pr. Mnlnneii. munity. I impress upon the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and the Government that it is not sufficient to extend sympathy to the workless. I do not believe that any religion that is preached from Christian or other pulpits would fail to acknowledge that if God be God He never intended that this earth should be as it is at present. I base my knowledge of unemployment on a close experience with it of over 42 years, aud I want to see something definite done by this Parliament to remove it from our midst. Rather than go on in the present miserable way I should prefer that the whole of the people of Australia be rationed, as was the case in Great Britain and other countries'during the war. If neeessary let all incomes above what is needed to pay for the necessaries of life be placed in a common fund, so that this Australia of ours may be rescued from its slough of despair. I am proud of my Australian brothers, of the young and strong men and women. This country teems with potentialities and food as does no other country in. the world, yet we have in our midst human beings who want for food and clothing. If necessary, I desire to see a state of emergency proclaimed, so that have a subsistence. I invite honourable members to scan the pictorial record which is in my very hand. Here is a photograph of one returned soldier who has lost three limbs, aud who receives a paltry pittance of a pension. Here is another of one who has lost two limbs. I hope that we shall not witness what was pictured in the Bulletin by my old friend, Mr C. Raven Hill. Under the caption "" Will it come to this?"" he delineated an old soldier with a wooden leg, and a walking stick to assist his progress, clad in a ragged military coat and trousers baggy at the knees, standing with his hat in Prime Minister and otlier honourable members have spoken, must be helped. I hope that tlie Government will do something for them; I care not whether any action which it might take has, or has not, the approval of the Public Service Board. of the facts as stated this afternoon, there is good ground for urging that practical consideration be extended to the returned soldiers in question. I know of a considerable number who have been iu the employ of the department for some years, but who unfortunately have been retrenched merely because they were classed as temporary employees. All honourable members will agree that, other things being equal, the man who, during the war, responded to the call of his country, is entitled to some measure of preference. Apparently the Public Service Board would recommend preference in employment if the act permitted that body to do so. In tbe circumstances, it appears to me that the situation would be met by a short amendment of the act, which might contain a provision to the elTect that any returned soldier who had been regularly employed in a department for a fixed term-it might be one or five years-shoul d be treated as a permanent, employee, and whenever any scheme for retrenchment was under consideration, have the same protection as other employees. It is of no use to talk heroics. What is needed is au amendment of the regulations so that due consideration may be given to these men. master-General) [4.34] I am sure that all honourable members have the fullest sympathy for returned soldiers or, for that matter, any persons who lose employment because of circumstances over which they have no control. admit, in common with all other honourable members who have addressed themselves to this motion this afternoon, that our returned soldiers have a special claim upon the Government. I would, however, remind the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge), that the retrenchment of some of those men took place, prior to my appointment as Postmaster-General. But I do not wish to disclaim responsibility in this matter, and I arn not unaware of the desire of honourable members opposite to make political capital out of the retrenchment of a number of ex-service men. We have been told that 36 disabled cleaners were dismissed by the Postal Department. The honourable member for Martin was, I feel sure, misinformed. The total number of cleaners retrenched was 32. Not one of them was a disabled returned soldier. These men were classed as temporary employees, and when the retrenchment scheme was put into operation, tiiey were replaced by twelve returned soldiers, who were classed as permanent employees. The other 20 were men who had been classed as junior mechanics. They were permanent employees, but because of the exigencies of the situation, it was impossible to find further employment for them. Mr R, GREEN -The Minister might agree to an amendment of the act. I regret that the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), who outside the House is companionable and likeable, is, within this chamber, a bitter partisan. He charges the Prime Minister and, in fact, all members of the Cabinet with lack of sympathy for returned soldiers. Statements of that kind are not calculated to further the cause which he espouses, because they are extravagant and quite wide of the truth, and, if persisted in. would prevent us from getting to grips with the question at issue, namely, to see what can be done in the interests of ex-service men. The honourable inember for Balaclava ( Mr White) put a number of questions concerning employment to my predecessor, and was informed that 2,292 men had been dismissed from the department. I believe the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons) mentioned that when he became PostmasterI General he found that 1,700 men had been marked down for dismissal because of the difficult financial position which was then developing. To illustrate how difficult it is to maintain the volume of employment in my department, I may state that in prosperous years expenditure on public works amounts to approximately £4,000,000 a year, but at the present time, unfortunately, our works programme has been cut down to the absolute minimum. It is impossible for",27,Dismissal Of Returned Soldiers Formal Motion For Adjournment

MrA . GREEK I am advised by the Postal Director, who, whatever some honourable members may think of h i m is, I am sure, one of the ablest officials in the that it cannot be clone if the department is to function efficiently. But I am prepared to make further inquiries, and, indeed, w ill consider any proposal that is likely to benefit our returned soldiers. When I was a young man I was an employee in the Postal Department for some years, and I have no doubt that I worked with men who, to-day, are in the ranks of returned soldiers. Consequently, I am prepared to examine caref u l l y any proposal that may be made on their behalf. Under the act it is obligatory, whenever any scheme for retrenchment is being considered, to dispense first with the services of temporary employees so as to ensure, if possible, the continued employment of permanent men, among whom, of course, there must be a number of ex-service men. amended, that policy must be continued. It is true that the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), the present Ministerf or Trade and Customs( Mr Forde), and the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) were w it h mo members of the Public Accounts Committee which some time ago, made an exhaustive inquiry into the position of temporary employees in the Public Service. Those who have no knowledge of the nature of the work in the Postal Department might quite reasonably argue that the employment of such a large number of temporary employees is uneconomic, but I joi n issue with the honourable member for Richmond when he declares that the committee approved of a proposal to classify all temporavy officials. must remember the recommendations made. Mr 1. GREEN -Administrativ e experience has convinced mo that the department must have a reasonable margin of temporary employees. The Postal Department, and, indeed, any government department, should be regarded as a business to be conducted in the not adopt the interests of the people. I admit, of course, that unlike private corporations, of which it has been said that they have neithor a body to be kicked nor a soul to be damned, the administrative head of a government department should be Commonwealth Public Service, actuated by humane instincts and be prepared, during a time of financial stress, to give every consideration to the welfare of employees, whether permanent or temporary. But I am afraid that, unless existing circumstances improve, there is not the slightest hope of the re-employment of the temporary cleaners whose services have been dispensed with . W it h regard to the position of the limbless soldiers, I shall consider carefully what can be done for them, and, to this end, w ill confer with the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. notice of the Minister a number of deserving cases.

In the United States of America, particularly, the resources of capital are almost illimitable. to mass production, and they dump large quantities of their surplus goods in Australia. For those reasons I am strongly in favour of a policy of protection. In Australia, we have set up a high standard of living for our workers, higher than that in most countries of Europe, and certainly higher than in Asia. We have arbitration courts and wages boards which fix wages. How then, is it possible for us to keep our manufacturing industries alive, and pay the high wages that our workmen receive, if our home market is to be free to outside manufacturers, many of whom pay wages 50 per cent, lower than those received in Australia? If Australian labour is to be protected, we must protect also the product of that labour. A scientific tariff does not exclude all imports; f a r from. it . There should be a large free list, subject to the demands of revenue. Australia is a debtor country, having to pay Great Britain in kind, and the interest on our loans amounts to considerably over £40,000,000 a year. We have endeavoured to develop the manufacture of goods which could be produced more profitably elsewhere, and, therefore, the cost of their manufacture in Australia is too high. This has a boomerang effect on other industries. A protective tariff should develop the industries necessary to a country's safety, wealth, and progress. Protection creates a population with great purchasing power, a people who, besides supporting the industries of their own country, are able to buy extensively abroad of the valuable commodities that are either unobtainable, or cannot be profitably produced, in Australia. free trade, the products of foreign cheap labour are admitted in competition with the domestic products which represent higher ancl better paid labour. results in giving our money, our manufactures, and our markets to other nations, to the in j u r y of our labour, our tradespeople, ancl our farmers. Therefore, I cannot support the free trade policy, and I am pleased to find that the remnants of the free trade party are almost unheard in this chamber. When the late Avar began there Avas an enormous demand for blankets, boots, tents, and a Avide variety of other equipment for our troops. Under a Manufacturers there resort free trade policy, it would have heen impossible to have met our requirements in these commodities within a reasonable time, and our contribution towards the defence of the Empire Avould have been seriously minimized. That Avould have placed an additional burden upon Great Britain, Avhose responsibility it Avould have been to supply us Avith goods, Avhich, under a free trade policy, Ave Avere unable to manufacture. In such circumstances the cost would have fallen not upon all industries, but largely upon the primary producers of this country. Tariff schedules should be discussed immediately they are tabled, and even when adopted by Parliament should be revieAvedf r o m time to time. Duties first imposed should be sufficiently high to enable neAv industries to become established, and to develop, but further investigation should be conducted after these industries had been in operation for some time, AA'hen it would be found that in many instances they should be able to carry on under lower duties. Many of the prohibitive duties imposed by this Government during the past eighteen months have been the means of creating dangerous trade monopolies. In many instances high duties are as detrimental to trade and commerce as are IOAV duties: A protective policy should be carefully planned, discriminating and scientific. Many of the duties in operation to-day are excessive, and should be reduced, not only to protect consumers, but in the interests of manufacturers Under themselA es, Avho, in thc absence of comr petition, take advantage of the fortunate position they occupy and, generally, do not > carry on their undertakings on the most This satisfactory basis. If the present protective policy is continued, it w ill not be long before a good deal of the time of this Parliament Avill be occupied in discussing legislation framed Avith the object of ridding this country of monopolies, trnsts, and combines AA-bich have become established as the result of the imposition of prohibitive duties. In every country in which prohibitive duties have been imposed competition has been destroyed, trusts and combines have become established, and notwithstanding the efforts of price-fixing, consumers have been unable to obtain the necessaries of life at reasonable prices. I recall the time when members of the Labour party devoted a good deal of their time to fightboth parties on this side of the chaming trusts and combines which they said were acting detrimentally to the interests of the people; but to-day the members of thc Labour party who support a high protective policy are indirectly assisting the creation of such monopolies, which will always be a menace to the people. The present protective policy, under which unnecessarily high duties are imposed, and in some cases the importation of goods absolutely prohibited, is so extreme that it will eventually collapse uuder its own weight. From time to time tariff schedules have been thrown on the table of this chamber before they have been properly considered or examined; but that is this Government's way of doing business. The duties imposed by this Government have had a staggering effect upon the community, and from all quarters complaints are being received concerning the instability and uncertainty of trade. There should be a complete review of our tariff schedule, which should be of such a nature that it would meet the requirements of trade and commerce for some time. There ought to be a reasonable period in which business could be carried on without any interruption caused by amendments to the tariff. Under the present system of introducing amending schedules at short periods, it is impossible were seriously affected. In consequence for those engaged in trade and commerce to forecast what is likely to happen, and to carry on their businesses with any degree of certainty. There is a w,elldefined and long-established principle in compliance with which increased duties should be imposed, that is, their probable effect should be carefully considered before they are made operative. by the previous Government, and I trust that the present administration will agree to a reduction in many of the duties before further serious injury is done. Mr Francis. In this connection, I refer to the damage caused to an important exporting industry. Immediately prior to an adjournment for several months, the Government tabled a schedule providing for the imposition of an export duty on sheepskins, regardless altogether of the protests made by honourable members of ber. Notwithstanding the objections then raised, the Government proceeded with its ill-advised scheme, which remained operative until the opposition became so strong that it was compelled to reverse its policy. Communications in opposition to the Government's scheme were received from other countries, which immediately adopted a policy of retaliation. from the exporters. the party to which the honourable member belongs were also opposed to the scheme. Federated Storemen and Packers Union strongly opposed the duty. organization were divided on the matter. that almost all the members of the organization employed in skin packing establishments in Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria had been thrown out of employment. I refer the honourable member to a speech I made on this subject recently on a motion of want of confidence in which I quoted letters from the representatives of industrial unions, which show that about 1,000 employees of the persistent attacks of the Opposition and others, the Government removed the duty immediately Parliament reassembled. That shows clearly that its hasty action was detrimental to trade and industry generally. The tariff schedules, which have now been consolidated, were prepared so That was the policy adopted hastily and in such a clumsy fashion that many of the items are to correct mistakes made in preceding schedules.

It has been contended by some that the Chambers of Manufactures have only to ask the Government for in creased duties when they are immediately granted, and that when requests are not coming in with sufficient rapidity, the Government has asked if there are not other items on which higher duties could be imposed. emphatic denial. President of the Sydney Chanrber of Commerce, said, "" The uncertainty that has been created ""-h e was referring to the manner in which schedules are introduced"" has tended to paralyse trade, industry and commerce."" It cannot be denied that many persons engaged in commerce have been ruined by being forced out of business, unemployment has increased, and chaos has prevailed Government's fiscal policy. It is interesting to note that in November, 1929, a month after the Government came into office, items, hibitive that later-anothe r schedule, comprising 80 items and comprising principally prohibitions and corrections, was tabled. In the following A p r i l another schedule consisting of 51 items, on which there was a 50 per cent, surcharge, and 7S items on Avhich total prohibition was i m posed, was also tabled. The schedule tabled in June, 1930, consisted of 140 items on which increased duties were imposed, and the March, 1931, schedule comprised 91 items, in which there was an alteration of duties. schedules many corrections were made which could have been avoided if the proposed duties had received proper consideration. satisfactorily conducted in such circumstances? adjust prices and ensure business stability whew duties are being amended almost monthly. The real effect of the Government's policy results in stagnation in industry, increased unemployment, higher costs of commodities to the primary producers aud a reduction in the purchasing power of the people. Under the present fiscal system Australian manufacturers do not benefit, ae there is insufficient money in circulation to purchase the goods which they are manufacturing. The Australian manufacturers would have derived real benefit had the Government brought down carefully prepared schedules which would not have the effect of in j u r in g or dislocating trade. Mr Marks, the MrP h ill ip Snowden, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the present British Labour Government, saidNearly all Australia's financial troubles are , Jue not to the late Government, but to the excessive protective policy of the present Government. The effect of our present fiscal policy has been not only general trade disorganization and unemployment in Australia, but in consequence of the general irritation, resulting in acts of retaliation by our best overseas customers. The Tariff Board, in its annual report for the year ended 30th June, 1930. a schedule covering 240 statesconsisting largely of proI t is gratifying to note that, following the duties, was tabled, and successful establishment of certaiu industries in December-onl y a month under a protective tariff, the selling prices of the products of those industries compare favourably with those charged in other countries for comparable goods. Operating under a duty of 35 per cent. British Preferential Tariff aud 45 per cent. General Tariff the boot and shoe industry has gained 95 per cent, of the Australian trade in that commodity. This is an example of an industry that cannot only compete in Australia against importations, but can make its product available at prices which bear favorable comparison with those charged on the home market by overseas manufacturers. The blanket and rug manufacturing inI n these dustry has secured 87 per cent, of the Australian market in these goods.

Honourable members will see that those exports were almost entirely primary products, and show a balance, in these five countries only, of over £39,000,000 in favour of Australia. The Government, by its ill-considered and extravagant tariff policy, is destroying the goodwill of the countries that purchase our exportable goods, and assisting to turn the balance of trade against us, and thereby accentuating unemployment. The more we do to cultivate the goodwill of those with whom we trade the greater will be the market for our primary produce. The fiscal policy of the present Government has done substantial damage to Australia and particularly to the primary producers. The tariff policy of members of the Opposition has been clearly stated by our leader. ""We stand to-day, as we have always stood, for effective protectionfirst, for industries essential to national security, and, secondly, for industries for which opportunities for success at a reasonable cost, direct and indirect. I can, perhaps, best express our protectionist principles Mr Francis. by two or three negative statements. Nationalism does not stand for indiscriminate prohibitive tariffs, or for the wholesale creation of manufacturing monopolies.

We differ .. 39,144,000 from our friends opposite in that we believe in competition in all things. We believe that all industries that are artificially protected must be assured of some measure of competition from within or without. We are proud to believe,and it is remarkable, to my mind, that honourable members supporting the Government apparently no longer believe it -that the Australian people, who provide protection for secondary industries, must, in their turn, be absolutely guaranteed protection against possible exploitation by The exports to France, Belthose industries. We are uncompromisingly opposed to the creation of industrial and trade monopolies through the agency of the tariff. We stand resolutely for the fullest obtainable measure of Empire trade, and especially for preferential trade between Australia and the Mother Country. We believe that anything that aims to reduce the measure of preferential trade that has been in operation in recent years is an influence calculated definitely to weaken the ties of Empire. Further, we believe in the cultivation of the maximum attainable trade with all foreign countries, consistent with the progress and preservation of Australian industries. We are opposed to tariff measures of a selfish and provocative kind that are calculated to excite retaliation by foreign countries against Australian primary production. It is obvious that our economic troubles have been accentuated, by the Government's tariff policy. The greatest industrial development and prosperity that Australia has ever enjoyed followed the introduction of the Massy Greene and Australian conditions offer Pratten tariffs. In support of that statement one could quote the returns relating to many of the secondary industries, but I have selected the woollen, cotton, and tweed mills in regard to which the monwealth following table, prepared by the Coming:Particulars.

The prosperity of Great Britain and her dominions can best be achieved by inter-imperial trade. sliould aim at developing trade within the Empire-the dominions supplying the raw material and the Mother Country those goods which she can manufacture most efficiently, Australian secondary production being confined to those industries which can be economically established here or are essential to national security, subject to the reservations I that system the Empire will make the greatest progress. At the present time it is experiencing some of the difficulties that are incidental to the world-wide depression, and the Mother Country 'is being subjected to extraordinary competition through the operation of fhe Russian five-years plan.

194,Mr Francis,"If the members of a repetition of the tariff muddle and coufusion we have experienced during the last eighteen months. -The statement of the honourable member for Moreton in regard to Imperial preference cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged. He endeavoured to lay on the Labour party in Australia and the United Kingdom the blame for the nonextension of the system of preferential trade within the Empire. If I were a member of the House of CommonsI would strenuously oppose taxation of the foodstuffs of the people. tralia, the United Kingdom is largely dependent for its foodstuffs on supplies imported from other countries. may be the fault of its people; possibly by a more enlightened policy, the Old Country could be self-supporting. Upon that matter, however, we are not called to pass judgment. We have to recognize the fact that the people of the United Kingdom .are fed principally on foodstuffs imported from abroad. government would hesitate before adopting a policy which, by increasing the cost of food, would place huge burdens upon its people. So far as I am aware, every government that has held office in Great Britain has adopted that stand; and probably some of the greatest poli tical battles effects of any tariff. But I am also of that have been fought in that countryhave had as their issue what has been termed the ""free breakfast table"". When we look around us to-day, it is apparent that those who for years have regarded protection as a policy that would effect the economic salvation of our people have been woefully disappointed and misled. It appears to me that neither free trade nor protection can ensure the economic salvation of any people. Protection, of course, is necessary in countries which, like Australia, are endeavouring to build up as high a standard as possible for their workers, because under it an effective check can be fjlaced upon importations from countries in which labour is cheap and sweated, the competition of whose products with ours would result in the standard of our people being degraded. We cannot allow any of the products of Japan, India, and some continental countries to compete with ours. Such a policy is not advocated by any person in Australia. I have never worked myself up to a white heat of enthusiasm for the efficacy of a protectionist policy as a means of solving the economic problems of our people. Speaking in a broad sense, Great Britain is a free trade country, while America is highly protected; yet it is a question which is the greater sufferer from the present economic depression and unemployment. Australia also is highly protected. We were told that the schedules introduced by this Government would provide employment on a large scale; but we know that the opposite is Unlike Austhe case. Whether or not they have imposed a certain amount of restraint on the upward tendency of the unemployThat ment figures, one cannot say; possibly they have. But there is not much room for argument, because we have very little data upon which to base our calculations. The fact is inescapable that from the time when this policy was given effect, unemployment has rapidly increased. The history of the United States of AmericaA wise furnishes one of the best examples that we have of the effect of what may be termed prohibitive protection. In the early stages of its development, the operation of that policy caused a considerable amount of unemployment to take place. I believe that that is one of the immediate the opinion that a tariff .is a means of building up the industries of a country, and will ultimately provide a greater amount of employment. During the last few; years, I have revised my opinions considerably, and have come to the conclusion that fiscal policy of a country has very little effect upon the economic position of the mass of its workers. The mechanization of industry and the application of scientific appliances to production, coupled with the attitude of mind of the captains, ancl the controllers of industry, are very considerable factors. Protection and any other policy must fail if it does not take into consideration the mechanization of industry, and the unemployment which results from it. I say, candidly, that I approach this question only from that angle.

202,Mr Lazzarini,"The iron and steelemployed, the manufacturers are, particularly at the present time when there is a surplus of labour available, taking on men for a couple of weeks only, and then replacing them by others. The reason is obvious. With a constant change of labour it is impossible to foster any sense interesting and informative. When an of unity among the employees, and effective industrial organization is impractichas to take it to an industrial capitalist able. America for many years, and is now being introduced here wherever possible. I have on previous occasions referred to the manner in which machinery is replacing man power. Unless we face this issue, and deal with it, all our efforts to solve the problem of unemployment will be rendered nugatory. One instance I have in mind has to do with the manufacture of porcelain enamelled baths. Not very long ago two tradesmen-fully qualified men in receipt of the full margin for skill under the Arbitration Court award-were considered to be doing quite well if they finished three baths a day after they had heen turned out from the mould in the crude state. Recently the manufacturers installed a new machine for doing this work, and now one man operating a machine turns out 40 baths in a day. Far from this conferring any benefit on the community, the retail price of baths is now 13s. each higher than it was before. One does not need a very lively mechanized is industry becoming, that we cannot be very far off the conditions described by Jack London in his book Iron Heel, in which he visualized a world populated by only a few people operating machinery. Eventually this system must defeat its own ends, because, if too many workers are displaced, the consumption power of the community will be reduced, there will bo fewer to buy the products of industry, and industry itself will languish and die. The Labour party must be careful that it does not allow itself to develop into a purely protectionist party, devoting itself to protecting the interests of the manufacturers and captains of industry through the country's tariff policy; while the party opposite is fighting to the death for another phase of the capitalists' interests, and the workers are being crushed between the two forces with no one to represent and protect them. Mr Lazzarini. The matter is deserving of the attention of Labour organizations of all sorts, industrial and political, both here and abroad. The attitudeof mind displayed by manufacturers towards new inventions is inventor makes a new machine, he usually The system has operated in to have the invention exploited, and he must demonstrate its effectiveness to the person whose interest he wishes to secure. Ever since the mechanization of industry began, the inventor has been called upon to demonstrate only one thing. He has not been asked whether his invention will make a better article, whether it will contribute to the general well-being, or whether it will ease the burden of mankind, or contribute to the happiness of humanity. One question, and one only, has been asked. How much human labour will it throw on to the scrap-heap? That policy has been followed for generations, and has culminated in the situation which confronts the world to-day. The world is inundated with goods, while men and women are starving, and are housed worse than the beasts of the field, which are, at least, provided by nature with the covering they require. When the ex-Premier of New South imagination to realize, so Wales, Mr Bavin, embarked on his wage-cutting programme two years ago he received the unanimous support of the members of the Chamber of Manufactures. Full page advertisements were inserted in the newspapers of New South a wide complexity of Wales, carrying the names of all the manufacturers who declared their intention to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mr Bavin. Again, when Mr Bruce sought to pass through this Parliament legislation to destroy the Federal Arbitration Court as a prelude to a wage-smashing campaign, the manufacturers once more publicly advertised themselves as his supporters. So long as the manufacturers adopt that attitude they cannot expect, and should not receive, any consideration from a Labour government same thing in New South Wales to-day. is grave danger that the Labour party will degenerate into a purely protectionist",43,Woollen Cotton And Tweed Mills Australia

In my electorate there is a firm whose premises I visited in company with a union representative. This firm has been operating a bonus system. It pays a rate of wages somewhat below the Arbitration Oourt wage, but it also pays a bonus, which brings the total wage up to something a little above the Arbitration Court rate. The bonus system is really only a variation of the piece-work system, under which the boss does not have to be the speeder-up; the worker speeds himself up. member know anything of the sweating hells of Europe? If he did, and if he knew anything of the conditions which used to prevail there, and which led directly to the inauguration of the Labour movement, he would not make such asinine interjections. The firm to which I refer introduced a housing scheme under which employees were assisted to build houses for themselves. I asked the manager whether the benefits of the scheme would he extended to one of the employees whom I named, a man who enjoyed the reputation of being somewhat of a radical, and I was informed that it would not. Bonus systems, housing schemes and other things of that sort are on a par with the practice of inducing the workers to buy £10 government bonds, so that there will always be a few stool pigeons among them to cry "" repudiation!"" when any action is proposed which threatens the interests of the capitalist. There is no philanthropy in such methods. They are merely insurance schemes for which the employers pay a very low premium to protect their own interests. If the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr earners are mere automatons. White) wishes to know something of the conditions which led to the formation of the Labour party in Great Britain, let him read Disraeli's book, Sybil, if he has not already done so. Perhaps he will accept what Disraeli said, when he would not be prepared to believe the writings of a more radical person. He might then learn something of the conditions under a.bout piecewhicli the workers carried on in England in 1S40, when the piece-work sysfsm operated. more modern; this is 1931. member would like to get back to the conditions of 1S40 if he could. The Labour party in this country set its face against the introduction of such conditions in this country, and believed that it was helping the workers when it adopted a protectionist policy. It appears evident now, however, that the manufacturers are using our fiscal policy as a weapon against the worker. If the manufacturers insist upon applying to the Arbitration Court for a 10 per cent, cut in wages so. Government should make it quite clear to the manufacturers that unless they behave decently to their workers the protective tariffs will be lifted altogether. Something of the kind was promised by the Prime Minister early in the session, when he was asked what action the Government would take if the manufacturers abused the protection afforded by the increased tariff. Protection has failed to protect the only persons with whom I am concerned, namely, the workers in industry. I say, frankly, that the workers are my only concern. The manufacturers and capitalists are able to protect themselves, because they are able to draw upon the accumulated brains of the centuries. I do not suppose that one recent invention of any importance has been the work of the controllers of machinery. These persons are in a position 4o buy the brains of a dozen generations. But the workers have only their labour to sell. The mechanization of industry has made the position of the workers more hopeless than ever it was.

He went on to say that in most cases the profiteer was the retailer, and not the manufacturer. One can hardly believe that a gentleman holding the high position of Prime Minister of Australia knows so little about industry as to say that the retailer is a greater profiteer than the wholesaler. The retailer, as a rule, has to meet a considerable amount of competition. He has the shops of his competitors all around him. It is practically impossible for the retailers of cities like.Sydney and"" Melbourne, or even those of the larger country towns, to make an effective watertight agreement for the regulation of prices. But this is not the case with the manufacturers. 1 have been buying goods at wholesale prices for half a life time, and my experience is that there is not a difference of even 5 per cent, in the prices charged by different warehouses for goods of about the same quality. member admits that prices are rigged? The wholesalers have in operation, through their organization, one of the most effective watertight agreements for price regulation that has ever been drafted. Under its terms the association can impose fines up to £1,000 in cases where agreement is proved. That agreement has been in operation for many years. The ex-Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) was a member of one of the importing firms which was doubtless a party to some such agreement as that. When our manufacturers became thoroughly established, they, with two or three exceptions, made similar agreements among themselves. I challenge any honourable inember to prove that he can buy at different warehouses boots, hats, ties, hosiery, or any soft goods of a comparable quality, at prices which [48] show a greater variation than 5 per cent.

We were told when the new duties now under consideration were first tabled that they would be the means of instituting an era of magnificent prosperity. This schedule was laid upon the table in eight different sections, although we are now considering it as one schedule. Minister for Trade and Customs has a few more schedules up his sleeve.

He has told us on different occasions that the schedules which he has tabled would result in the"" employment of 50,000 additional persons, but we were never informed whether each schedule was to give work to 50,000 extra men or whether that was the aggregate additional number that would be provided with work.

I believe that the honourable member would be one of the last in this chamber to seek to save one farthing to one half-penny on the price of sugar when he knew that, by doing so, he would de-populate the north of Queensland. However, there will be an opportunity to discuss that subject on a later occasion, when I hope that those who are opposed to the establishment of the sugar industry in Queensland will plainly state their position. honourable members will take the trouble to peruse the excellent report submitted by the royal commission into the industry, they will find a complete answer to any of their arguments. Australia is fortunate in having several products which sell themselves against world-wide competition. These include wool, wheat, butter and meat. All honourable members regret that the price of wheat has fallen, and hope that there will be an improvement in the near future. We have many other industries which are of great importance to the welfare of the people in providing employment, but which require the assistance of ample protective duties, even to the point of prohibition against the products of low-wage countries. It cannot be expected that honourable members of this Parliament will have full knowledge of the wide variety of items in the schedule, and therefore great reliance will be placed upon the reports of the Tariff Board. Its members are able to devote all their time and ability to the investigation of industries, and I believe that the work of the board is faithbut to the late Government. fully and efficiently carried out. When we reach the discussion of the items it may be necessary for the Minister to explain his departure from some of the recommendations of this competent authority. When I consider the great amount of work which the Tariff Board has been called upon to perform during the year, I do not sympathize with the adverse criticism that is levelled against it. We must admire the energy and enthusiasm of its members. In my opinion the reports of the board should be adopted by the Minister in every instance. The gentlemen comprising the board have an opportunity to see the various industries in operation, to examine the representatives, and so should become remarkably well informed and efficient. When the Minister for Trade and Customs departs from the recommendations made, there is always room for the suspicion that political influence has been used. The annual report of the board, in dealing with this matter, statedTlie method adopted by interested parties to influence departure from the Tariff Board's If recommendation is worthy of study and deserving of strong comment. It has happened, after the Tariff Board has held an inquiry, at which over a hundred witnesses were publicly examined on oath, has carefully studied the whole of the public and confidential evidence, and has presented a recommendation to the Minister, that a few men, parties to the application, have made representations to members of Parliament and to the Government which have resulted in the setting aside of the weight of public evidence and the studied recommendation of the board. That very strong criticism should be a warning to any Minister who proposes to set aside, without proper investigation, the recommendations of the board. Its members do not confine their activities to public inquiries, but endeavour to keep in personal touch with the industries by visiting the factories and interviewing the representatives of industry. It is quite evident from the reports received that the inquiries are wide and exhaustive, and that all interested parties are given an opportunity of presenting their views in the form of evidence on oath. that report? honourable gentleman to think that he has scored a point in that discovery. The criticism would apply to any government. I quoted the report simply as a warning to the honourable gentleman, as quite a number of the board's recommendations have been set aside.

The board must, however, consider all cases from every aspect, and obviously cannot let the interests of the consumer alone be the determining factor, but it reiterates the statement that this aspect receives the most careful consideration in every instance. That is a perfectly fair statement. The Tariff Board also refers to the dangers of the tariff being used to bolster up the ever-increasing costs of production, thus adding to the price of products sold to the consumers. On page 21 of the same report, under the heading of "" The Abuse of Protection,"" there is this reference to industrial unions and also to manufacturersThe board regrets being compelled to place on record its conclusions arrived at, after tlie most intimate touch with all phases of industry within the Commonwealtli, that there is a prevailing tendency which is calculated to abuse the protective system, and by forcing the pace under disadvantageous conditions, to actually endanger the efficacy of the system.

However, it does happen that at times attempts are made to make use of the Tariff to shelter plant, machinery and methods which have passed, or are passing out of date under stress of modern development. Where the Board during its investigations finds evidence of such practise it does not hesitate to point them out and does not make recommendations which would encourage them to be maintained. Manufacturers have been known to request additional protection to enable them to continue working a plant to produce goods in competition with those produced overseas by greatly improves production at lessened costs. There are times when the local manufacturer desires the superior article he is making at a far greater cost to be so protected as to force the cheaper one off the market, and there are on the other hand instances known to the board where he is making an inferior article and asks that it be protected against a superior one. Then again, his ranges, sections, and patterns aro sometimes limited and he is not prepared to sympathize with the demand that exists for essential variety. Another feature of the situation is the use made by manufacturers of profits arising as the result of a high degree of protection. Parliament has imposed protective duties in the interests of the community as a whole and distinctly not for the purpose only of enriching certain manufacturers. When such duties are imposed upon the community aud under D o e s the honourable the shelter of such protection an Australian industry is made possible, one of the first duties of a protected manufacturer is to see If the honourable m e m that the community gets an adequate return for the protection it has accorded him, and that local prices sheltered by. the duty are I a m not suggesting kept down to the lowest possible l i m it consistent with a reasonable and legitimate return on capital.

Where a highly protected industry returns to its shareholders dividends considerably in excess of the ordinary commercial rates, it is obvious that the object of the protective duties is being abused, and that an appreciable portion of the profits disclosed should have been devoted to reductions in prices rather than as payments to shareholders. Thc board calls pointed attention to this state of affairs, which, if it continues, may involve consideration oi whether the duties imposed have not been higher than were necessary to protect the industry.

""We were all gratified, therefore, when the present Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) soon after his return to office, made a similar announcement; but, unfortunately, because of protests by certain unions, he was persuaded, apparently, that he was out of step with his party, so the proposal was dropped. If scientific protection means anything, it surely means that the employers and the workers should co-operate in efficiency. It certainly should not be used to bolster up ever-increasing costs of production. Eveni f our object is to manufacture for home consumption alone, we cannot progress if we give to those engaged in secondary industries a higher standard of living than it is possible to give to workers in our primary industries or to the workers generally. There is considerable room for manufacture for export in Australia if it can be done at a reasonable cost. I understand that at present we export less than 4 per cent, of our manufactures. Surely there is something wrong with our conditions. terest charges. interest rate is a factor in the cost of manufacture, -become high because the enormous demands of Australian governments on the resources of the banks has caused money to become scarce, and when a commodity is scarce it is always dear. In conclusion, let me say that the preaching of class hatred and discontent will not provide work for the unemployed, but ihe bringing about of co-operation and goodwill between the workers and the employers will do much to assist in the welfare of the people and in developing the great resources of the Commonwealth. I join in this debate as a representative of a waterside constituency in order that the views of the people I directly represent will be put before this House. Reference was made by the last speaker to certain collusion which he stated existed between the trade unions and the manufacturers for the purpose of securing tariff reform. reform, but tariff concessions. does not apply so far as the people whom I represent are concerned. The introduction of tariff concessions has placed a considerable hardship on them. destroyed the maritime industries of this country. front in Sydney the conditions are worse or at least, as bad as they are in any other part of the Commonwealth, and are due in a measure to the tariff policy of the Government. It is to that aspect that I wish to refer. We did expect, at the outset, that the employment lost to the waterside workers, because of the introduction of this Government's tariff policy, would be offset by employment gained in other directions. In other words, that if there were less work along the waterfront waterside workers could transfer to other activities, and by that means gain some measure of compensation. I am sorry to say that that situation has not developed, but the responsibility or blame for that should not be laid entirely at the door of this Government. In order to develop our secondary indusInterest charges have tries, and to provide employment for those who were previously engaged on the waterfront and for others, an expansion of our factories was essential. To that end capital or credit had to be made available; but the Government, although it attempted to develop our secondary industries by protective duties strangely enough, allowed certain institutions to exercise a power and influence which actually prevented that development from taking place. As the Government was sincere in its intention to develop our secondary industries by the methods already referred to, I claim that the responsibility for the failure to bring that about must be laid at the doors of the financial institutions which have been repeatedly referred to in this House during the last few weeks. The policy of these institutions is linked up with the visit of Sir Otto Niemeyer to Australia. It is known that prior to his departure from London many consultations were held between the representatives of the Government and the Bank of England.",51,Government S Position

It did not suit the interests represented by Sir Otto Niemeyer that Australia should become self-contained in respect of its secondary industries. self-contained. ber, and some other honourable members, hold the view that this country should not embark upon a policy of providing its own requirements. They are entitled to that view. They believe that Australia should be simply a primary producing country. we should send our raw materials to the other side of the world to be manufactured there, and the finished article sent back to this country. is wrong again. understand exactly what is the policy of the honourable member; but as far as I have been able to gather from his remarks I think that I have correctly stated his views. The interests represented by Sir Otto Niemeyer have invested enormous sums of money in industrial undertakings in other parts of the world, and those undertakings were, until recently, exporting large quantities of their products to Australia. With the introduction of this Government's policy this market has been affected and now the overseas financial interests are anxious to regain the Australian market. When this Government embarked upon a policy of building up, not only our secondary industries to provide employment for our own people, but also our population to a degree that would enable a home market to be established for our primary products, I felt that we were tackling our problems from the right angle; but unfortunately that policy has failed through the actions of the financial institutions and I am therefore forced to use my best endeavours in this House to see that justice is done to the people that I directly represent. It was also thought that the waterside workers would be compensated for any loss of employment consequent on the operation of the tariff policy, by being given additional employment in respect of our exports. Earlyi n the life of this Government it was found necessary to take steps to rectify the adverse trade balance and to meet the obligations that had been forced upon this Government by the administration of the Bruce-Page Government. It was felt by the Prime Minister that the only way to obtain a favorable trade balance and to meet commitments overseaB was to induce the primary producers to grow more wheat, and, as honourable members know, they responded nobly to .the call. It was thought by the people that I represent that that increased production would provide more employment and thus compensate them for the employment .that they had lost. That also has not eveutuated, because, instead of the wheat being shipped abroad, we have the sorry spectacle of it lying at country railway sidings and in some cases in the paddocks in the farming areas. It is therefore evident that . the waterside workers have suffered severely because of the tariff policy. The latest move of the Government is the imposition of an additional duty upon petrol in containers of a certain size and in cases and tins. To the waterside workers that duty is the last straw that breaks the camel's hack, because its operation will still further decrease employment on the waterfront. The waterside workers have particularly requested me to bring before the House some of the reasons why this duty should not be imposed, and they ask that steps should be taken by this Parliament to defeat the decision of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde). The following quotation is taken from correspondence that I have received from the Waterside Workers Federation:This duty operates from the 1st May and it w i ll be the means of quite a number of vessels which have been trading with the various states of the Commonwealth beihg withdrawn from the Australian trade. This w ill have a tremendous effect on .all waterfront unions, such as the Waterside Workerjs, dockers and painters, coal lumpers and a l l unions engaged in the various docks.

This means that a lot of labour is engaged to handle it even in the country, as against bulk oil which is transported in bulk oil trucks to the country, and as it is handled out of the bowser very little labour is engaged. Thc principle of bulk oil is to do away with labour and it is doing it successfully, notwithstanding what the large oil companies say to the contrary. . . . It is not necessary for me to tell you that the tariff proposals have brought starvation on our members and other waterfront unions. member a member of the Cabinet which is guilty of this iniquity? plained my position in regard to the tariff policy of the Government. It appears to me that the honourable member is asleep during a good deal of the discussion in this House. He reminds me of R i p Van Winkle, who suddenly awakened to find himself i i i a strange world. The honourable member seems unable to grasp the purport of my remarks, although other honourable members are f u l l y aware of it .

I am putting the viewpoint of the people that I represent, and I contend that, in view of the serious curtailment of employment on the waterfront, their case should receive serious consideration at the hands of the Government. A duty should not be imposed on oil and petrol in containers merely to assist large companies to freeze Out ing them from placing their products on the market. The report of the committee of inquiry, which was submitted to this House the other day, and which was commented upon by one of the Sydney newspapers is indeed illuminating. In it 'the committee statesIn 1027-28 we bought 177,870,000 gallons from the United States and other foreign sellers. tariff questions were embodied in the On the average figures supplied by two great companies, the c.i.f. cost was almost 7-Jd. per gallon, a total of about £5,500,000. In 1928-29 the quantity went up to 199,988,000 gallons. To one company alone we paid £8,325,917 last year, that figure including the duty, dislt tributing and other overhead. That company made a profit of close on £1,000,000. Its profit was 8.7 per cent, on turnover or 48.9 per cent, on paid-up capital. Another company of 714,245 shares (of which 714,245 are held in Kew York) increased its capital from £1,000.000 in 1004 to £7,500,000 in 1930. Ol this latter amount £1,800,000 consists of undistributed profits. This company estimates that the net return on each gallon of petrol sold at 2s. a gallon was 4.G24d. That extract from the report which was recently laid on the table of the House proves that these interests have been fleecing the public for many years. The Government should no longer assist or allow them to do so. The smaller companies should be prevented from marketI have already exing their product at a price below that now charged by these large importing firms, because the reduced price w ill be a great benefit to the community, particularly those engaged in primary industries. In the development of our primary industries; petrol, particularly that supplied in containers and cases, plays an important part. Por that reason honourable members representing rura l constituencies must be interested in this matter, although, perhaps they view it from a different angle from that from which I regard it . My mission is to put the case men are in a worse position than they have ever been in previously. Something should be done to grant them relief.

I desire to refer to another aspect of this question. Minister gave a guarantee that the deferred duty on petrol in containers and tins would not operate until the 1st June next. An alteration has been made, and now it is to operate from the 1st May-on e month earlier than was intended. alteration will have a serious effect upon those operating in a small way. Believing that the duty would not operate until the 1st June, they, no doubt, made arrangements for supplies to be landed before that date. Now they appear to have been caught. It is not fair that they should be treated in this way. I do not know the reason for the change, and I , therefore, hope that the Minister w ill give them relief. Justice demands that something should be done to meet such cases. I leave the question of the duty on petrol, hoping that the necessity will not arise for any definite action to be taken by Parliament, but that the Government, or the sub-committee of Cabinet, w ill see the wisdom of granting some measure of relief to the men whom I represent. I have also been approached by the Federated Tobacco ""Workers Union of Australasia in connection with a matter vitally affecting the members of that union. I bring this matter forward at this stage in order that the Minister may be in a position to place before us any information in his possession when the particular item concerned comes before us for consideration. As I have not had an opportunity of putting before the Minister the case as submitted to me by the Federated Tobacco Workers Union, I propose to read some extracts from a letter which I have received from its T h a t is a secretary. A fte r making some premethod of formulating a liminary remarks, he saysIn tlie sworn statement given by one of the I suppose there is directors, Mr C. L.

Od. yearly, spread over 5,294 employees, 00 per cent, of whom are suffering through decreased sales, and the acute depression now sweeping over the Commonwealth. The import duty on American leaf has been increased from 3s. to 5s. 2d. per lb., resulting in increased prices to the smoking public and bringing about a huge swing over to the Australian manufactured tobaccoes, owing to cheaper prices and economic circumstances, caused by unemployment and wage reductions I understand that the now operating. This has resulted in a rapid exhaustion of the local product, of which, in 192S, large surpluses were held. In the one big firm alone, the stocks held in 1928 were as follows:Bright and lemon leaf, the lasting period, 19 months; No. 1 dark leaf, 74 months; No. 2, The 40 months; total in all grades, 49 months. Within two years, this has now reached the exhaustion stage, and the above manufacturers have notified the wholesale distributing houses and tobacconists throughout the Commonwealth of a system of rationizing of stocks, now in operation, until the 1931 crop of Australian leaf is harvested. It has been the custom, over a number of years, for the purpose of maturing leaf, to hold the crop for at least twelve months, but owing to the shortage and the demand, they will be forced to immediately manufacture the leaf as it is received from the growers. The same position has been created at Dudgeon and Amelia, tobacco manufacturers, of Melbourne, who mainly rely on the Australian leaf, most of their brands being 100 per cent. Australian, and this firm has notified the officers of the federation that if no relief can be obtained, in relation to partial lifting of the tariff duty on imported leaf, they will be forced to dismiss the whole of their employees at the end of June, owing to the fact that the smoking public will not, or cannot, pay the prices now operating. The total amount of leaf grown within the Commonwealth for the year 1929 was 903,868 lb.; the figures for 1930 are not available. The total for imported leaf, for the same period, was 19,203,274 lb. Assuming that the amount of leaf, Australian-grown, increased to 1,000,000 lb. for 1930, and in conversation with Mr C. M. Slagg, Director of Australian Tobacco Investigation, in February of this year, he informed me that, despite increased acreage planted this year, owing to the ravages of blue mould, that the indications were that the 1931 crop would not exceed last year's output. The position which now confronts us is that, with the rapid consumption of the locallygrown leaf, and no relief from this year's crop, that the industry and the members of",54,Pabkhill Wha T As I T Affects The Waterside Workers These

The danger of the exhaustion of the Australian-grown leaf was stressed to the Minister for Customs, by deputation to him, at Canberra, when the last tariff was under review, emphasizing the point of the danger of popularizing the Australian-grown leaf, and not being in the position of keeping supplies to the smoking public; but, unfortunately, he was not prepared to accept our statements as facts; that our fears were groundless, and we were creating a bogy. Recent events have f u l ly justified our fears.

They are not backward at the present time, in adding their weight to the attacks made, on the New South Wales Government.

In conclusion, I ask the Minister to assist, particularly, a section of the community that I represent, namely, the, waterside workers. consider it scandalous that the tariff is only now being considered by this committee. Numerous schedules have been brought down since, the 21st November, 1929. Government, and seven or eight have been tabled since then by the present Government. There could be no greater political scandal than that of haying the fiscal policy of this country determined by administrative acts of the Government. I am pleased to know that there are. a few eleventh-hour conversions to sane fiscal beliefs, and I hope that the number of members who come t'o the penitent form in the light of the experiences of of Manufactures, among Australia to-day will be increased. Without doubt, thc fiscal policy of Australia has been thoroughly tested, and found wanting. With every increase in tariff duties we have had an increase of unemployment. Every Minister for Customs has promised that hundreds of persons would be employed if Parliament .only gave certain protection to industries. The present Minister is probably the most blameworthy in that respect. Since he assumed office, and since the present schedules have been tabled, the amount of unemployment has doubled. When will the promises of increased, employment as a result of the tariff, be fulfilled ? The honourable member for Werriwa' ( Mr Lazzarini) gave his case away this evening. He said that an English. sovereign would buy £7 worth of goodB in . Japan; but that sovereign will buy less than 10s. worth of goods in Australia, and, therefore, the Australian wages have to be fourteen times those paid in. Japan to equal them in purchasing power. Honourable members must realize that the important thing is the purchasing, power of the wages received.. It is better for a workman to have a little money than a great deal, if he can buy a lot with it. In a report on the present, tariff schedules prepared by the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce, the following passages occur:The present exeeasive duties on many lines, with the addition of embargoes and prohibitions, has narrowed the field of buying, and, in many instances, these excessive duties and embargoes are operating to the detriment of our import trade with countries with, which Australia has a favorable trade balance. An instance of this is the silk and artificial silk trade with the East, whioh is the natural market for large quantities of Australian produce. Such restrictions on trade make thc selling of Australia's exports very much harder to effect. In addition to that, the buying by One was submitted by the late those countries of Australian wool cannot be continued, at any rate in the same volume, unless Australia, in return, is prepared to purchase their manufactures of wool.

281,Mr Peowse (Eorrest) [9.36],"I can be.dune without in any way affecting the Australian .manufacturer, of the same type of goods, for there arc many lines for which there is a market in Australia,' but which market is not big enough to enable economical manufacture to .take place within Australia. In the revision and recasting pf the tariff it is essential that this phase of the effects of tariff legislation should be given very full cpusideration. Australia depends entirely on her primary producers. The ability of her secondary industries to find a market is also dependent upon the primary producers. In ' turn, the employment possible in the secondary industries is dependent upon the purchasing power made available by our primary industries. Every action that retards or restricts reciprocal trade between Australia and otlier nations of the world makes it more difficult for the primary industries to carry on. I believe that the Prime Minister, in his opening speech in this Parliament, emphasized that Australia depends almost entirely on its primary producers. The ability of secondary industries to find markets for their goods is'also determined by the success of our primary producers. In other words, employment in secondary industries is possible on account of the purchasing power made available by the primary industries. Every action which retards or restricts reciprocal trade between Australia and other nations increases the difficulties of the primary producers in carrying on their industries. ""What is the use of suggesting increased tariffs for our secondary industries ? How long could those industries live if the p r i m a r y industries failed ? A secondary industry does not bring a shilling into this country. No community can prosper when one section of the . community is subject to the law of supply and demand, and another section enjoys a sheltered position at the expense of the former. That statement is axiomatic. The present Government has made a great pretence of an attempt to help the primary producers by providing a bounty on wheat this year. Ministers will go to the country with an election cry that the members of another place have rejected four proposals under whioh they have attempted to do something for the wheat growers. the Government could do to take some of the load off the backs of the primary producers? equivalent of the value of a bushel of wheat for every three gallons of petrol ifr. Prowse. that he uses. . The Government should recognize that the States require the p r i mary producers to pay registration fees with respect to their motor vehicles, but ontop of that this Government has imposed a petrol tax. .Those two .taxes, together take from the farmers of Australia the value of '25,515,000 bushels of wheat! A government that places such an impost on the primary producers cannot f a i r l y be regarded as sincere in its professed desire to help them. There is also a highly proteotivo duty on farming machinery and a primage duty on jute goods and phosphatic rock, all of which are absolutely essential to primary producers, who have no protection against outsido competition. What protection does the wheat-grower, who has to carry those engaged in secondary production on his shoulders the wholo time, receive from this Government? It has even gone to the extent of imposing a 75. per .cent, duty on shovels, merely because someone has undertaken, their manufacture in Australia. Some eighteen months or two years ago five prominent economists, who were loyal enough to give their advice to the Oommonwealth, without fee or reward, stated that the tariff then in' operation levied upon primary production an impost equivalent to 9 per cent., but I venture to say that as a result of the action of this Government, during the time it has been in office, that percentage bas increased to 12, and at a time when the primary producers arc receiving a price for their commodities much below the cost of production. In such circumstances, it is difficult to understand why this Government' still continues to heap burdens upon this deserving and Strug. gling section of the community. I defy the Government to j u st i fy its action. What would be the use of the HughV . McKay Harvester Works at Sunshinei f the farmers were driven off the land? In consequence of our present arbitration system it is impossible for the agricultural machinery industry to produce at a price at which such products can be But what of the things that profitably sold overseas. This Government, which believesi n a highly protective policy, was The farmer pays the asked to impose a sales tax equivalent to £7 48. a ton on flour, which would not have necessitated an increase in the price of bread, in order to provide for a bounty of 6d. a bushel on wheat, but for purely political reasons it declined the request. Notwithstanding its action in that direction it still persists in tabling tariff schedules protecting secondary industries which are not of the slightest benefit to Australia. I think I am correct in saying that the primary producers of Australia provide 97 per cent, of the revenue required to ""pay those engaged in other industries including even the men employed iu sweeping the streets of Sydney and Melbourne. A farmer has to give one bushel of wheat for every three gallons of petrol which he uses, but the revenue derived in this way is of no assistance to him as it is all utilized in bolstering up secondary industries, principally in Melbourne and Sydney, many of which should be closed down. What possibility is there of our secondary industries assisting to pay our national debt and interest commitments falling due? The revenue used to meet these payments has to be contributed by the unfortunate primary producers upon whose shoulders unnecessarily heavy burdens are being placed by a government which has the audacity to say that it has made several attempts to assist them. I have never been an advocate of free trade; I believe in the imposition of a revenue tariff. With the liabilities we have to meet revenue must be derived from every possible source, and a certain amount should be obtained by the imposition of reasonable duties on luxuries, &c. Great Britain, which is always regarded as a free trade country, obtains a tremendous amount of income in the form of revenue duties. Some time ago the Tariff Board warned us against the imposition of unnecessarily high duties, and surely no one with ordinary intelligence will contend that our present fiscal policy is not detrito be handled on a commercial basis. For mental to Australia. Prior to federation, New South Wales, under a free trade policy, exported manufactured goods, and even under a reasonable fiscal policy that could still be done. Some years ago boots manufactured in Australia were sold in New Zealand. the industry were working for practically nothing. Tariff. 1417 sands of men in Australia to-day have no work at all owing to the policy adopted by this Government. Thousands of people were once employed in this country manufacturing goods which could be profitably marketed overseas; but in consequence of legislation passed during recent years that is now impossible. I venture to suggest that if it were not for the foolish policy of spoon-feeding industries our great iron, steel and other resources could be successfully worked. In that way not only would employment be found for our people, but we should also be able to export our surplus production. It is impossible to develop this country and meet a national debt, such as we have, by taking in each others' washing, which is what we are actually doing under our present fiscal policy. It does not bring in additional revenue, but prevents the investment of capital in Australia and strangles our primary industries. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has shown how the tariff is affecting some of his constituents, but when he was a member of the Cabinet he did not endeavour to influence his colleagues to assist the seamen. I suppose he was told by the Minister for Trade and Cu& toms ( Mr Forde) that they would be able to obtain employment in the new industries to be established as a result of the imposition of higher duties. The honourable member for West Sydney now finds that these jobs are not available. The Government's policy has also seriously restricted shipping to Australia, and in consequence, farmers have to pay higher freight on their overseas shipments. The Navigation Act, which constitutes another form of protection, makes it practically impossible for our raw materials instance, the freight on timber from Hobart to Adelaide is four times as great as it is from Vancouver to Australia, while the freight from Adelaide to Fremantle is greater than it is from New York to Fremantle. of the kind.

285,Mr Prowse,"I did not do anythingmember of this Parliament was to ask the Government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the working of that act. A conference of world economists pointed out that high tariffs had a very disturbing international influence, and in some cases, had actually led to war. Why does not the Government seek the beet advice available as to which Australian industries are worthy of assistance, and then concentrate on them? The iron and steel and implement industries, also the manufacture of woollen goods, should be natural to this country. A heavy duty is now imposed on imported matches, but I that if every person in the matchmaking industry in Australia were paid a pension for life the Commonwealth would profit to the extent of £250,000. Tn 1890 Sir James Service predicted that the tariff would be the lion in the path of federation, and, unless property slain, would result in federation being slain by it. The people in the State which I represent, are disgusted with the present fiscal policy imposing as it does unnecessary burdens upon them and, at the same time, seriously retarding the State's development. I have received the following letter from the President of the Royal Agricultural Society of Western Australia :RE PRIMAGE DUT Y. Deaf Sir, As we understand the customs tariff is shortly to be reviewed I would be pleased if can we hope for any improvement from a you would endeavour to have the primage duty Prime Minister who, when sitting in on phosphoric rock and jute goods removed opposition, said "" A t one time.

I no longer use tlte rate of exchange added, as in the case of the qualification ' commercially'; I want jute goods, it makes the charge to the producer to know only that an article can be made more than warranted under the present conditions. Furthermore, the above-mentioned goods beshort-sighted policy. Who pays for it? come almast immediately re-exports, either Who maintains the credit of the Comoe containers or iu the shape of produce, and monwealth? cannot be classed with other importations.

Yours faithfully, THOS H . WILSON , President. High freights from overseas which people are voluntarily wearing a hair are a handicap to the Mr Prowse. producers, should be of assistance to those engaged in secondary production, affording as they do very substantial natural protection. Why should the Government increase duties to such an extent particularly at this juncture, when the exchange rate is an additional protection to those engaged in secondary industries? In addition to the protection afforded by the exchange there has been a 10 per cent, reduction of wages, and a 15 per cent, reduction of the cost of living. Yet the Government has said, in effect, to the sheltered secondary industries "" We shall give you further probelieve tection so that you may bleed the primary industries. We want to get them down and out"". The Government and its supporters attach more importance to keeping Lysaght's iron and steel works prosperous than to maintaining the solvency of the primary producers. I invite honourable members to visit the dry wheat areas about Southern Cross, where men are working sixteen hours a day and getting less than Is. a bushel net for their wheat. Yet they have to pay double the price they should pay for the galvanized iron to build the humble shacks in which they, their wives and children, live. That is one instance of the madness and injustice of the Government's policy. If honourable members can show how this form of protection is likely to help Australia. I ask them to do so. But how in Australia "". That is a one-sided and Honourable members boast of the Australian high standard of living, but that standard is paid for by those member's attitude in regard to sugar? of friction in the Commonwealth.

287,Mr Prowse,"That is another causepay for one ton of Australian sugar as much, as would buy three tons from abroad. This is an impost of more than £400,000, or 19s. a head annually in excess of the price for which they could buy foreign sugar. But that is not the end of the injustice. If we could buy sugar from other countries we would not pay one penny in cash because they would buy in return Australian boots, wheat, meat, fruit and flour, and reciprocal trade would steadily develop. Under the £34,000,000 migration and development scheme many groups of settlers have been put on the land in Western Australia, but if their industry is to be profitable markets must be found for them. the Government find markets for them? but for the political influence exerted in this Parliament by the State of Queensland. The adverse effect which the sugar policy has on reciprocal trade between Western Australia and its nearest neighbour and natural customer, is repeated by the high tariff duties and embargoes imposed on imports from other countries. Belgium buys from Australia approximately £9,500,000 worth of goods annually, buy from it £900,000 worth, mostly cut wealth Belgian people by declaring thaH; we should not continue to buy their glass. luxury of offending a customer who buys £9,500,000 worth of our goods each year. Japan buys from us £12,000,000 worth of produce, and this Government would refuse to buy from it even a match. Can we wonder that other countries adopt a policy of reprisals-that Germany imposes a duty of 5s. a bushel on our wheat, and Prance a duty of 4s. 6d., whilst Italy has taken similar action? How to progress if we isolate ourselves and have not a commercial friend in the world ? Let us drop the "" tiddlywinking "" industries and concentrate on iron, steel, implements and woollen goods-industrie s that are natural to this country. God endowed Australia with a soil and climate suitable for the production of certain things. Instead of trying by artificial means to produce everything, let us eliminate those industries, primary and secondary, which may be regarded as unnatural to Australia. The goods which we can produce economically we can send to the uttermost ends of the earth, and in exchange we can buy those articles which other countries can produce better than we can. If a policy of that character were adopted, shipping would be plentiful, our ports would thrive, unemployment would disappear, even the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) would abandon his communistic ideas, the whole country would be prosperous, and there would be an end to the distress and discontent which to-day are evident on all sides. I congratulate the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) on having clearly stated his fiscal views. He has declared himself a revenue tariffist. For many years I have used the simile of children playing at see-saw to describe the differences between the protectionist, the free trader and the hybrid revenue tariffist. At one end of the plank is the chiefly meat, and we free trader who desires that all goods be admitted absolutely free of duty. Under glass.

Leaning alternately towards the protectionists and the free traders he obtained the support of each in turn and really ruled the country. The English system of protection was, at one time, the most severe the can we expect our country world has known.

After the Franco-Prussian war in 1S70, Bismarck, recognizing the need for Germany to build up its industries, raised a high tariff wall, behind which German manufacturing progressed at a remarkable rate. This industrial development enabled Germany to bring into being a huge army and a navy second in strength only to that of Great Britain. She could never have done that under a free trade policy.

The biggest ( Mr Prowse) spoke of the disabilities portion of the wheat area at the present suffered by the primary producers on day must be properly tilled and manured. account of the tariff. I propose to show I regret that, because of poverty, such how, in my opinion, the wheat-farmers action has not been taken this year by can be paid 4s, for every bushel of wheat the primary producers. that they produce. Saunders, of Eastwood, South Australia, was twelve bushels to the acre. Based for having given me the idea, in a letter upon a return of 13-i bushels to the acre, that I received from him. He suggested next season's crop, it is estimated, will be that the Government should buy the 162,000,000 bushels-49,000,00 0 bushels wheat produced by the farmers out of the less than last year.

I have not overlooked the fact that when sent to Great Britain that wheat would realize only 2s. a bushel. there would be a profit of at least Is. a That being so, how can we pay 4s. a bushel, the gain to Australia from the sale bushel in Australia, and yet make on the in Great Britain of 211,000,000 bushels transaction a profit of Is. 3 2-lld. a would be £10,500,000. The questions bushel? Answers by the Treasurer to that I asked the Treasurer werequestions that I have asked disclose that the minting of £1,000,000 worth of silver, purchased at Is. an ounce, would ounce produce currency to the amount of a charge of minting at 3 per cent, the net £5,500,000. What, then, would be the amount'of silver would be £5,335,000? value of the 4s. paid to the farmers? On that basis the cost to the Government introduced would be only 8 8-lld. Therefore, the pure silver content of silver coinage from 925 sale of the wheat in Great Britain at 2s. parts of silver in. 1,000 parts to 500 parts pure a bushel would show a profit of silver in 1,000 parts?

It is a matter of history that all parties urged the farmer to grow more and still more wheat, with the result 1S,000,000 acres were sown and produced Dr. Maloney, a crop of 211,600,000 bushels. That is an estimate only at present, because the figures for Victoria and South Australia are not yet final. The normal acreage is from 13,000,000 to 14,000,000 acres; thus last season there was an increase of 4,000,000 acresa brave response by the farmer to the appeal made to him to come to the aid of his country. In the present season it is estimated that the acreage will be considerably less, on account of the difficulties many farmers have been and are experiencing in purchasing fertilizers, and also because very The average I thank Mr return for the ten years ending 1929-30 I may say that, on the assumption that 1.

I received the following replies:1. £1,000,000 of silver purchased at Is. an that ounce would yield £5,500,000 in Australian silver currency. The charge for minting in Australia is approximately 5.75 per cent., but this would not affect the amount of silver coined, which would be £5,500,000. 2. Yes. 3. Yes. 4. £10,175,000. Surelyi f England started in 1920 and accomplished so much, we are justified in following her splendid example. In 1920 England reduced the silver content of her coinage to a level below that at which it had stood at any time in English history, except during the reign of Henry VIII . , of any but sacred memory. He alone, in the thirty-eighth year of his reign, reduced the silver content of the coinage to one-third. After the Great War, England's fiduciary note issue had grown to £260,000,000, and the English people were becoming somewhat timid. The Government availed itself of the opportunity to reduce the silver content of the coinage. Perhaps it was justified in doing that, but it seems to me that when the profit rose from £1,000,000 to £9,000,000, it could well have increased the silver content. I cannot say that the scheme I advocate is perfect, but I feel certain that there is something in it. If the Government were to give an order tomorrow for £1,000,000 worth of Australian silver, it would so stimulate the mining industry ait BrokenH ill that, instead of 56 per cent, of the miners being out of work as at present, all of them would be employed. Not only that, but employment would be found for many of the coal-miners now out of work. ing the production of real money. our notes become less than their face value -whic h God forbid-the silver coinage will always be worth at least its silver content. With the exception of Great Britain and the dominions of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, whose currency is based on the gold sovereign, every other country has its coinage based on silver. I . am prepared to own that we shall not have given the farmers of this country fair play until we can fulfil the promise we made them when we asked them to grow more wheat. The"" new protection "" has been advocated by our party for many years. What does the new protection mean? It has been defined as an obligation upon the community to ensure that if the employers are protected by means of the tariff, the employees must be protected by means of wages boards or other means to ensure that they receive a fair rate of pay. There is another consideration, even more important than that of the employers or employees; that is, the protection of the public. There must be a standard price for the product protected. I hope that I may live to see that, while the employers are protected by means of a tariff, and the employees by minimum wage legislation, the citizen, the buyer of the commodity produced, who supports both employer and employee, will be protected by a listed price for the goods produced. There is no man to-day who would say that either absolute free trade, a revenue tariff or aboslute protection amounting to prohibition, will remove poverty from the community. I know that conditions have been improved by force of law. When the Duke of York was here some time ago I was discussing industrial matters with his chief adviser, and he asked me for an expression of opinion. I inquired whether he wished me to answer diplomatically, or whether we were to put the cards on the table. He said that he preferred the latter course. I then told him that, in my opinion, never in the history of the world had the employers, as a body, reduced hours or increased wages. "" And they never will, Doctor,"" he replied. I have here copies of a report issued by Mr Harrison Ord, who was Chief Inspector of Eactories in Victoria in 1899. The report deals with the institution of a minimum wage. Thanks to the assistance of Sir Alexander Peacock, who was a Minister of the Crown at the time, we were able to pass the Factories Act, which provided that girls employed in factories must be paid at least 2s. 6d. per week. That amounted to two and a half farthings an hour, but even that provision was evaded by the employer. I quote one paragraph from the report to show what the employers of Flinders-lane did to their workersA girl is taken on as an apprentice, so it is said. She is not an apprentice in the remotest sense of the word, except that she is required to pay a premium. She can be sent away or can leave at a moment's notice, but as she is an apprentice, the officers are calmly informed",61,Pabkhill Wha T As I T Affects The Waterside Workers These
295,Mr Fbost,And they would be assist,63,Pabkhill Wha T As I T Affects The Waterside Workers These
296,Dr. Maloney,"That is so. If evertliat she is charged a premium of exactly 2s. 6d. a week. The kind employer will then say that, instead of insisting on the money down, he w ill pay her half-a-crown on the Saturday, and he w ill make her return it to him on the Monday. In God's name, what sort of conditions were those? A girl was paid half a crown on Saturday morning, and was required to return it to her employer on the following Monday. Flinder3-lane employers are dead now, and I trust that none of the honourable members listening to me to-night will be iu their company in the next world. The honourable member for ""Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) delivered a striking speech on the effect of the mechanization very long ago that one man can now de of industry on the workers.

I quote the following paragraphs pick and shovel men. from page 19 of it :Here are a few more striking instances of the wonders of machine productionThe Lancashire cotton industry can supply, by working only one f u l l week, the total cotton requirements of Britain for one year. Two months' work of the boot factories w ill do the same as regards footwear. One man tending 25 machines w ill produce 3,000 socks a day. A brick-laying machine used by A r r o l and Company, Glasgow, will lay 1,500 bricks per hour. The"" Wade mechanical woodman"" enables one man to do the work of 30 men. There is a machine for stripping currants off the bunch which disemploys 40 women, and does the work in less than half the time. One man with a machine w ill t u r n out tens of thousands of tins per day to can those currants when made into jam, and the fish that automatic fish-cleaners prepare for canning. The Boston Railroad Company has a freightcar handling device to take charge of a million ears per year. One man directs the whole operation, ""thus saving the labour of 400 men and so reducing labour costs by the wages of tlie 400 men. The Tube Railwayi n London has in use automatic booking clerks, doing all that is required in tlie work of issuing tickets. They even give the exact change. An electrical power plant near Berlin, producing 24,000 kilowatts, men and 50 clerks. Had it been equipped with Dr. Maloney. less modern machinery, not less than 3,000 workmen and 700 clerks would have been employed. In the TJnited States, there is a huge factory filled with practically one single machine turning out motor car frames almost untouched by human hands. The output numbers no less than 9,000 per day, and only 200 men are employed. No less than 45 frames per day being the output per man. On the East Loddon Estate, Victoria, a youth and a man on the bags, harvested 800 All those acres of wheat in three weeks. In the days of the stripper it would have taken live machines and fifteen men to do the same work in tlie same time. An improved machine does the work in even one-fourth less than this time. The managing director of the International Harvester Company told me not Here is an instance that should interest the A t St. Louis, wliere sewerage work is being carried on, 33 machine operators, aided An automatic mechanism producing 73,000 electric light bulbs every 24 hours, disemploys 2,000 hand-workers for each machine installed. We are undoubtedly living in the machinery age. I think it was Aristotle who said long ago that civilization could not be maintained without slavery unless machines could be invented to do the work that the slaves were then doing. Well, machines have been invented to do the work. With the object of coping with the situation which now faces us, I have given notice that when an opportunity is afforded me I intend to move a motion to the following effect:That, in view of the fact that machinery invented by the genius of the race has brought to pass(1) That in the gathering of food-crops one man with machinery can gather more than 100 men, without machinery, could gather a century ago; (2) That the fabrication of clothing has been equally advanced by machinery; (3) That the erection of buildings, &c, has been equally advanced; ancl (4) Thati n the multitude of needs of our civilization an equally advanced saving of labour has been made employs 200 workwithout a corresponding advance in the position of the workers; it is the opinion of tliis House that an amendment to the law controlling patents be introduced with a view to bringing into law that all inventions which are patented to obtain protection should be granted such protection only in consideration of the Commonwealth being made full partner in all benefits that shall accrue from such inventions, and that all profits arising from such share of partnership shall be used to pay off the National debt. In this way I hope that it may be possible I do not wish to delay the House very to do something to help humanity to overlong, but I feel that the conduct of the come the difficulties created by the Prime Minister to-day in attempting to mechanization of industry. The question brand the honourable member for Bourke which faces us is whether the nation shall ( Mr Anstey) and myself as untruthfu l control machines, or whether machines cannot go unchallenged. shall control the nation. To put it in arose out of a question asked by the another way, we must determine whether honourable member for Hunter( Mr. humanity shall be subject to machinery James) with regard to the appointment or whether machinery shall be subject to of Sir Robert Gibson, and, in the course humanity. Honourable members w ill have noticed ( Mr Morgan), the Prime Minister that I also have a motion on the businessdeclared in unmistakable language that paper to the effect that referendums shall the honourable member for Bourke and I be held at the next general election on a had lied. I have always felt that whatever number of important public questions.

298,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [10.41].,"governments circumstances w ill arise that cause differences of opinion, but I believe that such differences concern only those interested. I have never adopted a squealing attitude with regard to the outcome of any such controversy. I am sorry that circumstances have arisen that call upon me to defend, in a measure, my character, and which call in question the truthfulness of statements that I might make in this House or elsewhere. I say that the statement made by the Prime Minister about unanimity in this matter is not correct. 1 come now to the personal explanation of the honourable member for Bourke, and the claim of that he wrote on a slip of paper his opinion on the matter then being debated by Cabinet, requesting that it be recorded. treated the question of the honourable member for Darling Downsi n relation to the honourable member for Bourke in the same manner as he did mine. The Prime Minister was not present when the honourable member for Bourke wrote that opinion. He was then on his way to the Imperial Conference. The right honourable gentleman therefore did not know the true circumstances, and he had no right to attempt to create in this House, or in the country, the impression that any statement by the honourable member for Bourke or myself in the matter was untruthfu l in character. It is for that reason that I defend myself on the issue. the 22nd A p r i l last I asked a question of the Ministerf or Defence, which related to civil aviation, and the honourable gentleman said that he would have inquiries made and furnish me with the information desired. quote from Hansard of the current session; but I point out that when giving his reply to my question the honourable member omitted fro m it the words "" inter a l i a "" , and also the words "" and of providing more landing grounds "" as w ill be seen by a reference to page 1145. My question referred to the fact that FlightLieutenant Owen, who had just returned to Sydneyf r o m Wellington, had stated that civil aviation in New Zealand was in . an infinitely better position than in Australia. Somehow, when the reply was forthcoming my question was somewhat distorted. The reply was supplied by the Controller of Civil Aviation, and readsI have not seen the press report referred to. Mr Owen is an employee of the Shell Company. I asked that company to inquire whether Owen made any sueh statement, and am informed that he categorically denies having done so. The denial is credible as a statement tliat civil aviation in New Zealand is in an infinitely better position than in Australia could only be made or quoted in good faith by persons without any specific knowledge of the subject. Mr Owen is not in that category. That rather suggests that I asked a question that is not fair, or that is untrue. honourable gentleman that I , therefore, quote in f u l l the article that appeared in the Canberra Times of the 22nd of A p r i l last, which readsThe Prime Minister FACILITIES IX NEW ZEALAXU. Many Aerodromes. Sydney, Tuesday. Flight-Lieutcnaiit Owen, who returned to Sydney to-day from Wellington, said that, considering the size of New Zealand, its comparatively small population, and difficult flying conditions, the civil aviation facilities were infinitely better than in Australia. Towns of similar size to Wagga, Junee_ and Tamworth had their own aerodrome, with first class hangars and club-houses. Flying conditions were very poor, as the many mountains caused terrific downward currents. In regard to the latter part of my question, where I asked whether, in view of the recent loss of an air liner, the Minister would say if any alteration would be made with regard to the provision of wireless for aeroplanes, the Controller, through the Minister, saidIn connection with the last paragraph of Mr White's question, it might bo stated that the necessity of providing wireless for aeroplanes on certain routes was foreseen many months ago, and work is proceeding I am not permitted to actively in regard to the essential ground stations that must first be provided. In view of the distortion of m y question, and the fact that the person concerned has made very definite denials in the matter, I ask that my question be referred back to the Controller of Civil Aviation. Also, w ill the Minister ask whether, with regard to that part relating to wireless, it is correct that Electrical Commander P. G. Creswell, chairman of the Defence Communications Committee, stated at the inquiry into the loss of the Southern Cloud, that he had addressed a",65,Floods

Twice within ten mouths that district has been devastated by floods, and previous to that thc miners there were locked out of the mines for sixteen months. Although work has been resumed in thc coal-mines, the number of unemployed .in the district to-day totals 7,500. Some of the farmers for whom I am now pleading have had nothing from their holdings for three years. They are indebted to the State Government for the crops which have been destroyed by the recent floods. They are now without fodder for their stock; they have no seed millet; and, owing to the destitution which prevails in the northern portion of New South Wales, it is useless for them to seek relief locally. They are, therefore, forced to appeal to the Government. At thc time of the previous visitation the State Government assisted them; but now it is unable to do so because the Commonwealth is withholding from New South Wales money that belongs to the State. The floods have left the roads and bridges in an untrafficable condition; the river banks are so undermined that, should another flood come soon, there would probably be a disastrous loss of life. I do uot think that there is any other part of Australia in which the people have suffered more than the people of that district have suffered during the last two years. honouring our obligations overseas; bat, in my opinion, our first duty is to see that our own people are supplied with the necessaries of life. It is, unfortunately, true that many persons have taken their own lives, by throwing themselves over cliffs, taking poison, or shooting themselves, rather than face the position which confronted them. Our first duty is not to bondholders overseas, but to the hungry men, women and children in our own country. I do not wantto criticize the Government unduly; but, as I believe that it can help these people, I maintain that it ought to do so. It should show some humanitarian regard for them in their distress. It is said that if we spend money to feed our people we shall be forced to repudiate our liabilities overseas. Even so, that would not be the first time that this country has repudiated its promises. Have the promises made to the men who enlisted beeu kept? They were told that, if they enlisted, Australia would be theirs on their return; that, if injured in the war, they would receive generous pensions. Those pensions have been cut down, and during the administration of the previous Government many returned soldiers were ejected from war service homes. It is to the credit of the present Minister for Markets and Transport ( Mr Parker Moloney) that on assuming ofiice he restored their homes to thom. The action of the former Government in turning them out of those homes was repudiation of the worse type. I say emphatically that, if there is not.sufficient money in the country to feed our own hungry people, and also to meet our interest obligations overseas, the claims of our own people must be our first consideration-the overseas bondholders must wait. ter) [10.56] -Al l honourable members are glad to see the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) back in his place again, after his long illness, and displaying his usual vigour. matter raised by the honourable gentleman, I feel sure that every honourable member is sympathetic to the men in his district, whicb has so frequently been visited by We hear a good deal about floods.

The honourable member for Hunter said that the Commonwealth is withholding money belonging to the State of New South Wales. I point out that, even after allowing for money withheld, the Commonwealth is still £i,500,000 to the bad. I suggest that the State which has benefited to that extent should expend some of the money to assist the settlers visited by floods.

The honourable member for West Sydney said that he does not believe in talking about things that happened in Cabinet; yet he has gone throughout New South Wales and repeatedly blamed the Government for making certain appointments. Those appointments were made while he was a member of the Cabinet. Was not his action an attempt to disclose that he had no part in the making of those appointments?
