7,Mr Lang,"I ask the Prime Ministhe United States of America or the High Commissioner in London is responsible for making representations on a governmental level. That is done. It is true, however, that in respect of minor affairs associated with departments, Ministers have direct contact, or send mesof order. sages direct through me or through the Department of External Affairs to their departmental officers overseas. matters are mainly administrative or they may be requests for information. In matters of government policy the High Commissioner Ambassador in the United States of America, or the Minister in other countries, is the final representative of the government. It always has been a matter of some difficulty to determine just what constitute matters of policy and what are purely administrative matters, but, in genera], the High Commissioner in London ana the Ambassador at Washington, or the Minister in other countries, exercise oversight over all governmental work in their respective countries. It is not always possible to define what constitutes policy, or matters of administration, or what constitutes requests for information which, in the case of a Minister, can very often be best obtained direct wish to add anything to what has been from his office overseas thus obviating delay (hat would be involved when communications pass through me or through the High Commissioner or Ambassador. However, I shall examine the matter further and supply a more detailed answer to the honourable member. Mr Harrison having addressed a disto accept responsibility. allowed question to the Prime Minister, orable member for Wentworth has referred to rather a serious matter. He ought to know that there is only one way in which to charge a Minister or any of the Minister for Commerce and Agriother honourable member of this House culture to a report in the Melbourne with dereliction of duty. That is by Herald of a statement alleged to have submitting a specific motion, of which been made by Mr R. G. Casey. The notice should be given. There is no statement isdoubt that charges have been made today against Having made them, the honourable memother ber concluded by asking whether the grow pigs, or maize, or rice, or peanuts, or allegations were facts. Honourable members should have a sense of responsibility in connection with their duties as members of the Parliament and should, as far as possible, arm themselves with facts before they make charges and then ask their questions. I rule the question out made by me. They were made outside Such this House. I am asking that, the matter may be cleared up for the benefit of the people generally. in London or the whether the charges were made by the honourable member or not, he is retailing, them. He is, in a sense, accepting the responsibility for them and then asking whether they are, or are not, correct. The question is out of order. sonal explanation. The honourable member for Wentworth has said that a Mr Bate, a member of the Legislative Assembly of K""ew South Wales, made certain statements recently when speaking in the Ooogee by-election campaign, and he has suggested, I think, that I should answer, them when I , speak in that campaign. I shall speak in that electorate before the polling date. I do not said by Mr Speaker. I know that two of the matters referred to by the honourable member are completely untrue. The honourable gentleman issimply retailing what Mr Bate said outside this House. I propose to deal with Mr Bate. I ask the honourable member not to take advantage of the privileges of this House in relation to statements made outside' of it for which another person will have the Attorney-General.

There is no relationship whatever between the Marshall plan and the International Wheat Agreement, and no such statement was made at the conference which I myself, and the secretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture had with members of the Wheat-Growers Federation recently. Somebody asked what the Marshall plan had to do with the implementation of the International Wheat Agreement, and the reply was that the Marshall plan might assist some of the importing countries participating in the International Wheat Agreement to purchase wheat more readily than they could otherwise do.

Now, I realize that you w ill be needing all your people, but I feel that say five, (as a start, anyhow) would make so little difference to you but would be of such enormous help to us. Can you tell me how I should set about this matter. Should the Northern Rhodesian Government write to the Australian Government or could we circulate the Australian agricultural colleges, or should I come and get them ? I think the most crying need of Northern Rhodesia as present (next to machinery possibly) is agricultural staff and if you can be the means of putting us on the right lines to getting some of your qualified young men you would have done us a great service Sir, and incidentally have brought our countries a little closer together. Will the Prime Minister have this matter examined and ascertain what can be done about the request? member lets me have a copy of that letter, I shall have inquiries made as to what has happened when other governments have asked the Australian Government for the services of certain classes of scientists. the Army see a recent report in the press that decorated ex-servicemen of World War II . had received a gratuity of Â£20 LAND. in. 1943 for the erection of a dehydration Â£360.

My department receives its allocations from tbe Materials Controls Section of tbe State department. We are awaiting fulfilment of an order for 500 tons of cement, which is to come from the United Kingdom. Commerce and Agriculture inform the House whether a sale of 600,000 bushels-equivalen t to 15,000 tons-of grain sorghum was made by the Australian Government to the French Ministry of Agriculture in November, 1947? Did the Minister consent to its release? Will he say whether, despite such consent, the Department of Commerce and Agriculture refused to grant an export licence at that time, and withheld it until March, 194S, in consequence of which delay 4,000 tons of the grain was destroyed by weavils? Is this the kind of planning which the Minister envisages in the co-operative socialistic commonwealth which he promised in the speech that he made recently at Ballarat? vernment did not sell grain sorghum to France, but certain Queensland interests applied for permission to export this grain. A survey was made by officers of my department, assisted by officers of the Department of Agriculture, in Queensland, in order to find out whether we could safely allow exports from Australia without depleting stocks for the feeding of poultry, pigs, &e., in Australia. It grain or any other commodity. was found that there was in the hands of merchants in Queensland approximately 250,000 tons of grain sorghum which they were not putting on the market for local consumption. It was decided, after a survey had been made of stocks held by growers, th.it it would be reasonable to allow the export of 600,000 bushels, and I stipulated, as a condition of issuing an export licence, that only grain, held by growers could be exported, not grain held by merchants. After that decision was made known, those growers who held supplies of grain sorghum formed an organization to ensure that it should be exported by the growers themselves. Unfortunately, they did not adhere to the terms of the export licence, and forthwith sold grain to merchants at Â£24 a ton. The merchants promptly resold it to France at Â£33 a ton, the resultant "" rake-off "" representing their profit, and remuneration for their services. I believed that this sale of grain by the growers to the merchants was a violation of the condition which I had laid dow for the issue of an export licence, and I informed the growers that, in the circumstances, the licence was inoperative and that they would have to make other arrangements. They did so, with the result that, they saved thousands of pounds, and thenceforth they were required to comply with the terms of the licence, which were intended to protect the growers, as distinct from merchants and speculators. Any delay which has occurred was due to the action of the growers themselves in not observing the terms of the export licence, and to their failure to avail themselves of the measures which were designed to insure that they should obtain the maximum return. As for the honourable member's . references to socialism, the incidents which I have just described are an illustration of the wicked manipulations of some of those engaged in private enterprise in Australia. Unfortunately, in this instance, the merchants concerned had the cooperation of the misled growers of grain sorghum in Queensland. I have always tried to ensure that export licences are issued on such terms as to benefit directly the producers, as distinct from those who speculate in seen a statement attributed to high officials of the Australian Liberal party that Mr R.

However, I have my suspicions that the subject may be mentioned. In answer to the second part of the honourable member's question, I repeat that the Government does not object to money being brought to Australia for reproductive purposes. I should say in this case, of course, that any money obtained for the purpose mentioned would represent useless expenditure, but I do not know whether is could be accurately described as ""hot money"". I assure the honourable member that transfers of capital to Australia are being watched very closely. Those that will benefit the country will be welcomed, but those that will not be of advantage to Australia will not be welcomed. I described to this House in detail the actions of certain prices investigators, one of whom represented himself in my electorate as a wood merchant from Coburg, Victoria, and, by deception, incited farmers and others to commit breaches of the law in connection with the sale of mallee roots. I asked certain questions, but the Government gave no answers at the time nor has it done so since. I now ask the Prime Minister whether the Government approves of the actions that I mentioned?

Mi. POLLARD I realize that the pig 1 industry is of considerable importance to Australia and to the people of the United Kingdom. As to the price factor. I am aware that, whereas in 1943 pig -meats were selling for as little as 3d. per lb., the price to-day is well over' double that amount. I do not consider that the price factor is as unsatisfactory a3 alleged by people who have made representations on the subject to the honourable member. tinually reviewed by the Government with the object of ascertaining what more can be done to provide an incentive to pig raisers to produce additional quantities of pig meats. One of the problems facing the pig industry results from the attractiveness of other forms of primary production. When I was a lad, farmers usually engaged in half a dozen lines of production, but now they find that it pays to concentrate on one line, and too few of them bother about raising pigs. The problem of overcoming that position is one of great difficulty. The Government will gladly do anything it can to assist the pig industry to overcome the difficulty That Standing Order 70-I I o'clock rule-be suspended for the remainder of this week. BILL 1948.

Presumably the Government desires to amend the principal act so as to confer a wider interpretation on the scope of the functions of the Department of Supply and Development.

43,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"The reason for such a safeguard is obvious. During recent debates in this chamber the Government has repeatedly Stated that it will safeguard the security of all defence establishments and will not countenance the risk of subversive action. Nevertheless, members on this side of the chamber are seized with the necessity for inserting in this measure a provision of the -kind referred to in the amendment. I expeet that that Government will deeline to accept my amendment, and I propose, therefore, to recall certain statements made by the Prime Minister in regard to the security of the nation. On the 25th July, 1946, the honoroble member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) asked certain questions of the Prime Minister( Mr servants. Approximately 60,000 temChifley) in regard to Communist activity in Canberra. Those questions, and the answers thereto, are recorded in Hansard as follows:notice1. Has lie seen the statement in a Canberra newspaper of the 17th July that "" in Canberra, Communists have boasted they are working under cover in public departments to serve the ends of the p a r t y "" ? 2. Were any investigations made by Coin* monwcalth authorities during the war years as to whether Communists were employed in the Commonwealth Public Service? tf. If so, (a) were any Communists discovered, and (6) what action was taken? 4. W ill he direct the appropriate Commonwealth authorities to ascertain if Communists are employed in the Public Service in Canberra? 5. Will he take steps to have any Communists removed? able member's questions are as follows:1. No. I have not previously read the press statement quoted. 2. No investigations of such a nature havo been made. 3. See answer to No. 2. 4. Commonwealth public servants, in common with all citizens,, arc entitled to hold political views and the Government does not propose to initiate an inquiry on the lines suggested by the honourable member. Public Service Board has f u l l power under the act to deal with employees who violate the oath taken before entrance to the service whereby they swear allegiance to the King and to uphold the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. 5. See answer to No. 4. In other words, the Government has done not h in g whatever to investigate the boast made by C o m m u n is t leaders in Canberra that their members were acting subversively in the Public Service. The answer to the fourth question indicates the apathy and callous disregard of its responsibilities which characterizes the Government in these matters. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that the Commonwealth Public Service Act requires permanent public servants to take an oath of loyalty. It readsI , A.B., do swear that I will be faithfu l and bear true allegiance to the King, and w ill loyally as in duty bound uphold the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia establishedunder tlie Crown of the United Kingdom. So HELP ME , Gop! But that requirement, even if it were aseffective as this apathetic Government believes, applies only to permanent civil porary civil servants are not required to sign this oath of allegiance. I should like to know what the Government is doing to prevent the continuance of the ""white-anting"" which is definitely taking place. It appears to me that Ministers are the only people who are happy about the onward trend of communism. Members of the rank and file of the Labour party are deeply concerned about it, particularly those of them who have recently had definite physical evidence of the effects of Communist control of industries. The Government must take every means within its power to safeguard the interests of the country against this anti-British and anti-Australian penetration -The amendment, which I have submitted, must be accepted if the Government is alive to the necessity for providing adequate safeguards in the important Department of Supply and Developmenta war department-whic h exercises control, direct and indirect, over the physical and economic resources of Australia required for the preservation of peace and for defence against invasion.

According to an official publication issued by the Communist regime in the 1930's, there were only 23,600 Communists in the whole Russian empire prior to the outbreak of tlie revolution in 1917. able member propose to do with the 16,000 members of the Communist party in Australia? Does he consider that they should be put in gaol? them, as this Government does. previous debates on this subject several measures which we would take. For example, we would disband the Communist party, and would not permit it to carry on its activities in establishments such as Marx House, amply provided with telephones and all the resources to enable rapid and easy communication. The Communist party has declared itself to be out to overthrow the established forms of government in this "".ountry. We have seen how Communists have sought to sabotage industry in Australia. We have had enough evidence during recent years of the damage which they have done and could do. The Attorney-General has clearly expressed the opinion that Communists are working in the interests of a foreign power. nounced officially by representatives of the trade union movement when the guided weapons range project was under discussion in this chamber. In the face of all that evidence the Minister asks us what would we do. The Government could do many things in this matter. It could conduct a campaign against Communists in Australia in order to open the eyes of the workers to the damage that they are doing in this country and make it clear that the Communists' purpose is to use the industrial workers .;f Australia as tools for the achievement of their objectives, as they used the workers in other countries. The Government could inform the workers of the totalitarian governments which Communists have set up for the suppression of the rights of individuals as is evidenced in Soviet Russia to-day. Those are some of the things which the Government could do. But that is not the issue arising under the amendment. Here is a clear suggestion, a specific request that known Communist supporters or known members of the Communist party employed in defence establishments shall be removed. That would not commit the Government to depriving those persons of employment elsewhere, if it is not prepared to go so far at present; but it would ensure that Communists shall not remain in defence establishments. I am at a loss to understand why the Government rejects the amendment. If it is a fact, as the Minister has pointed out, that security officers have lists of all known Communists, it should be a simple matter for his department to ensure that such persons shall no longer be employed in defence establishments. In addition to the security officers I am quite sure that departmental heads would know from their dealings with employees, of persons who cannot be. trusted. Authority should be given for the removal of such persons. I suggested last night that, preferably, some limitation upon any such authority given to departmental heads could be imposed. Provision could be made for appeal to the Public Service Board, and a departmental head could then be called upon to show good cause why he believed that in the interests of security any particular emThe same view was anployee should be removed from a defence establishment. It is futile to insert in the measure provisions about secrecy and prevention of entry of unauthorized persons when the Government knows, or should know, that it now employs in these establishments persons who, because of their known political views, cannot be trusted to be loyal to Australia or even to a Labour Government. reason given by the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) for rejecting the amendment is not sufficient. Indeed, his answer is contemptuous of the Parliament. The measure which we are asked to take very seriously embodies provisions for the defence of the country against possible aggression, and the amendment seeks to prevent traitors from being employed in defence establishments. The Minister simply said that the Government cannot accept the amendment. The reply which",22,Supply And Developmen T

I pointed out that that particular gentleman was employed as an official photographer. I recall having read in the press that the result of photographobey the Communist tenet of making a ing the whole of Australia was to be made available as a No. 1 priority to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research which employs that gentleman. asked whether he was not the secretary of the Communist party in Canberra. To that question I am still awaiting a reply. I also named another gentleman. Later, both of them wrote to the Sydney Morning Herald denying that they were members of the Communist party. They are a Mr Pomeroy and a Mr Atcherley. That leaves me in the position of having made a statement that is not true, because their denial is the last statement to be published, on this matter. But the Government knows that what I said is true. If it does not know, then the Commonwealth Investigation Service is a sham and a mockery. If our security officers do not know that those gentlemen are members of the Communist party they are incompetent and have fallen down on their job. If they are aware that my statements are true, then the Government also is aware of the facts; but the Government has not yet supplied an answer to my question. ber's question on the notice-paper? off the notice-paper in the usual way.

One of the most Just prior to my election to this Parliament the same gentleman supplied to the Canberra Times a statement in connection with a certain election and signed it as the secretary of the Communist party in Canberra. Here in Canberra, under the very noses of the security officers, these potential traitors to this country meet, and are prepared to betray their fellow citizens. They suspend from the Communist party any person who does not Communist retraction. They debase themselves by taking a. pledge not to make the oath of loyalty or to subscribe I to the Constitution of Australia. Those are the kind of people who are being screened by the Government and. Minister for Defence. Desperate diseases require desperate remedies, and these people must be dealt with. I know that I cannot discuss a motion of which I have given notice, but have so far been prevented, I hope temporarily, from moving in this chamber. The Minister hurled at the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) the question, "" What would you do ? "" The Minister should address that question to me; but he does not need to do so, because in the motion of which I have given notice I have set out what I would do with potential traitors to AustraliaI t is not sufficient for the Government to say that it knows who are the members of the Communist party and that it will deal with them if they occupy responsible positions.

62,Mr Lang,"No; it has been taken the right honourable member for Darlingtrusted secretaries in Great Britain turned out to be one of the most trusted Communists. If the Communists were known to be what in fact they are, possibly they would not be of so much use to the enemies of this country; but because they are smart and clever and because they are in key positions they are valuable to those who wish to destroy Australia and its manner of life and to take away its freedom. The Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) will have to .say much more than he has said if he desires to justify his rejection of this .amendment, and he will have to say even more if honourable members opposite are to satisfy their constituents at the next general elections. A certain looseness of language appears to be creeping into the arguments used by Ministers in opposing amendments moved by the Opposition. One would expect that a Minister in charge of a bill, before making statements that committed his party to a certain course of action and that might be closely analysed to his detriment, would make sure of his facts. In answer to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr weeks ago, it has not yet been answered. Holt), the Minister for Defence( Mr When we find that all questions with Dedman) said that, according to the inx formation he had obtained from the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), the Commonwealth Invstigation Service had a complete list of known Communists in the Public Service and, I think, in Canberra. It is important to analyse that statement closely. In its relations with the Public Service, the security service is concerned with matters other than communism. Can we rely upon its efficiency? The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) recently alleged in a question that a delegate of the Treasurer appointed by this Government had been convicted upon eleven charges of forging and uttering and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. The honourable member must confine his remarks to the amendment under discussion. If he does not, I shall ask him to resume his seat. that the Commonwealth Investigation Service is not infallible. If , as the Minister has stated, it has a complete list of these people, I want to know why it permitted the appointment to the Public Service of a man with a criminal record. The security service cannot even police something that is criminal and not subversive. MB . LANG -The Government takes no notice of it. member for Reid. ( Mr Lang) raises a point with which I shall not deal at the moment. I want to pursue the statement made by the Minister. RecentlyI asked a question with regard to directors of an airline who were alleged to be Communists, and I was fobbed off with a temporary answer. Even if the Commonwealth Investigation Service has information with regard to Communists within the Public Service and in Canberra, its information generally with regard to Communists and their supporters cannot be complete. A l though my question was asked many regard to communism that are likely to embarrass the Government are not am swered, how can we place any reliance upon a statement by the Minister, loosely made in the hope of justifying the rejection of an embarrassing amendment that the security service has a complete list of these people? The Attorney General has referred to Communists as the agents of a foreign power. They were sufficiently destructive to cause special legislation to be introduced with regard to the guided weapons range.. Surely that in itself is a sufficient ground for the Minister to say, "" The Government acknowledges that Communists are agents of a foreign power, and that it is necessary to introduce special legislation to prevent them from sabotaging the Empire's war effort, and from giving effect to their traitorous and subversive doctrines. That being so, and realizing our responsibility to the people of Australia, we accept the amendment."" The Minister does not say that.

I rather doubt that. It may know quite a number of them, but I know something -of the Communist organization and of -our security organization, and I say that the Government does not know all the Communists in this country. It would be impossible for the Government to know them. The real Communist leaders are not those whose names appear in the press from day to day as the instigators of this or that industrial trouble, or as being engaged in organization work for the Communist party. Most of the big Communists are underground. Eveni f the Government does know the names of all the Communists, apparently it is not prepared to utilize this information to prevent any of them from obtaining government employment. The munitions establishments are not the only undertakings in which Communists are employed to-day. They are employed in the Post Office and in many other national undertakings. Is the Minister prepared to permit Communists to be employed in these vital services and, above all, in secretary to the Communist party at secret and important undertakings which are covered by the measure now under consideration? AgainI urge the Government to accept the amendment. I support the amendment, which if carried would prevent any member of the Communist party from being employed in any of the departments to be administered under this measure. From time to time, cases involving the employment of Communists in important undertakings have been brought to the notice of the House. I myself have instanced the appointment of known Communists to confidential positions in government departments, including departments engaged on war work, but on every occasion the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has shielded these people, endeavoured to explain away their motives, and has refrained from taking any action to remove them from the positions that they occupy. The Minister has cited one case in which investigation officers prevented a Communist from being appointed to a confidential position, but the honourable gentleman seems to assume that once a Communist has secured a position he should not be removed. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) brought to the notice of the House the employment of an alleged Communist at the Maribyrnong munitions factory, and the Minister, in his usual role of a defender of the Communists, asked the honourable member for Flinders whether he could vouch for the truth of the allegations, implying, of course, that the man was not a Communist. Some months ago I brought to the. notice of honourable members the case of a man named Norman Sheppard who was employed, and I understand is still employed, as chief engineering metallurgist at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. This man occupies a position of great importance. He is responsible for the heat treatment of rifle barrels, and should he wish to sabotage the work of the factory he could so alter the tempering process that our soldiers might go into action with rifles that would be about as useful to them as bows and arrows in modern warfare. This gentleman, Norman Sheppard, was Lithgow, and he occupied at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory a position which, I am informed, allowed him access to all its confidential records. When I asked a question about that, I received the usual partial answer from the Minister that the matter was being looked into. ThenI rereceived a letter saying that Sheppard was a member of the Communist party but that, as the Lithgow Small Arms Factory was then largely engaged on civilian activities, it was considered that no opportunity existed for him to indulge in subversive activities if he desired to do so. After the disclosures made in the report of the royal commission into the activities of spies in Canada, does the Government think that high officials of the Communist party occupying positions in the Public Service that give them access to confidential information will just sit down and twiddle their thumbs instead of ferretting out that information to send to their lords and masters overseas ?

It is noteworthy that whenever communism is attacked in this House, honourable members on the Government side speak at length about democracy, but fall short, I consider, of the high ideals of democracy. Recently, during a debate in this House, the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) said, ""Democracy must be allowed to express itself in its own way and in the proper way"". The Government appears to have a wrong impression of the true meaning of democracy. Abraham Lincoln's famous descriptive phrase "" Government of the people, by the people, for the people"" has become rather hackneyed, but it may pertinently be asked who are the people referred to. Are they the loyal, peace-loving, sons on projects of this nature. patriotic and industrious citizens of this country, or are they those who are disloyal to the King, who are always endeavouring to disrupt industry, and who owe allegiance to a foreign power. In Lincoln's nature. No one puts forward amendtime-in the days when democracy was born in America-an y one who did not show definitely, by some practical means, allegiance to the American President, was given short shrift. That is what should happen in Australia to-day. Eor these reasons I heartily support the amendment which has been submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party. amendment of the Leader of the traveller of Communists, then there are Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) "" fellow travellers "" sitting opposite me in asks very little indeed.

""Would he, knowingly, employ in the Department of the Army on a secret job, a known member of the Communist partya person known to be subversive to the interests of this country ?

I take this opportunity to clear the name of a resident of Canberra, whom the honourable member for Reid traduced in this House. I have here a letter received by the Prime Minister( Mr should be engaged in war they would take Chifley) shortly after the honourable member for Reid had made certain allegations in the House, and I now quote the letter in order to put it on record. It is as follows:'Dear Sir, I urn advised that Mr J. Lang, M.H.E., made * statement in the House yesterday that I am -secretary of the Canberra branch of the Australian Communist party; also that I have 'been appointed as Economic Advisor to the Prices Commissioner. I deny all these allegations in totality. Neither am I a member of the Communist party. I think that the Government should take some action to protect citizens against slanderous and malicious statements made .under privilege in Parliament. Politically I am a socialist and support the socialist plank. I am an Investigating Officer, Grade 3, in the Prices Branch and have never claimed to have any other position therein, ff I had done a tithe of the damage to Australi a that Mr Lang has accomplished in his political career, I would hang my head in shame. My record in the Public Service is Â«lear. In 1041 I was appointed as a shift chemist si.t the Commonwealth Explosives Factory at Maribyrnong, where I was responsible for the production of nitroglycerine and cordite. In 1943 I was transferred, at my own request, to my present position. I shall be grateful if you will make my posiwhether the charges are true or not, but tion clear to the House in which I have been traduced. That is all I have to say on this amendment. I am sure that the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) is hoping in his heart that no war will break out while he occupies his present position, lest he be called upon to face the consequences of the Government's refusal to take elementary precautions to ensure the security of the country. During the last general election in New South Wales, a noted Communist, speaking in the public square I have stated what was of Goulburn, openly stated to a huge audience that if war broke out in which Australia and Great Britain were on one side and Russia on the other, he would be on the side of Russia, and that he would do everything possible to induce other people to behave as he would.' This fellow got away with it, no action being taken against him by the police or any one else. I forget his name, but he made no attempt to conceal it. Therefore, we have it on the authority of one of the Communists themselves that if Australia their stand against the country to which they are supposed to owe allegiance. I believe that if war were to break out we should have sabotage on the scale of civil war, and that the enemy within would be a greater menace to the security of the country than the enemy against, whom we had declared war. not vouch for the truth of any of the allegations which they make. have to vouch for the guilt of a man before arresting him on a charge of murder? The man is charged, and then tried. get into trouble if he arrested a man without reasonable evidence. able evidence against some Communists. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has read a letter from a man against whom certain charges have been made. I do not know this man's letter amounts to no more than a plea of not guilty. Surely the Minister does not expect us to accept it as evidence?",30,Supply And Developmen T

I am prepared to accept the proposition from the Government that in the unsettled state of the world to-day, we are still virtually in a state of emergency, and, therefore, legislation of this kind must remain in force; but I contend that & time limit should still remain upon the operation of this legislation. Certain provisions of the bill, such as those which widen the field of the department's activities and give power to make regulations, go far beyond the scope of the original act.

Defence( Mr Dedman) to reinstate section 28 of the principal act, which imposes the limit of five years upon the operation of the legislation. That would ensure that, from time to time, this Parliament would review the working of the legislation, and ascertain whether any amendment was necessary in order to protect the public against excessive Executive action. The Minister has not given to the committee any reason why the emergency legislation of this kind is to be continued permanently. If there is no sound reason, the time limit should remain. Our minds are apt to become dull on some matters involving, the rights of individual citizens.

Some of the experiments will have only just begun I ask the Minister for after three or four, years, and will not be even approaching completion at the expiration of the five-year term which the honourable member for Pawkner( Mr Holt) has suggested. In the United Kingdom, where the problem of defence is no different from what it is in Australia, there has always been a Department of Supply, and. no time limit is attached to its activities^ If we are to take our responsibilities seriously in relation to the defence of this country and satisfy the governments of the United Kingdom and of the other dominions that we are anxious to assume greater responsibilities in relation to' the defence -of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we must ensure that the activities of this department, particularly those applicable to defence scientific research, shall not cease at the end of any given period.

They have the strongest claim to consideration, because by skill and devotion to duty they reached the highest levels in the Public Service. The Minister acts miserably when he says that the Government will not accept our proposal because it has no obligation in the matter.

The laboratory was later moved to the New Medical School, University of Sydney. As a result of inter-communication system was devised for excellent series of ear plugs was designed and adopted by the services for protection against excessive noise and blast from mortars, guns, armoured fighting vehicles and aircraft. With the termination of hostilities attention was directed to civilian problems in the acoustic field, the most immediate of these being associated with the rehabilitation of deafened ex-servicemen. A further important problem arose concerning a large group of children about five years old whose congenital deafness was the result of the mothers being affected by rubella, or germ an measles, during pregnancy. Techniques for taking accurate measurements of the hearing deficiencies of these children were devised, and special hearing aids were designed to assist in their education and speech development. This research work was initially carried out in collaboration with the New South Wales Education Department. In 1946, the National Health and Medical Research Council decided that, as tlie war-time research activities had ceased, and the amount of routine civilian work was increasing, it was no longer justified in financing the operations of the laboratory. The council, however, considered that the laboratory was much too valuable to be disbanded, and recommended that it should be taken over by the Commonwealth Department of Health. Cabinet agreed to this proposal in May, 1946, and the transfer was effected on the 1st January, 1947. The name of this establishment was then changed from the Acoustic Research Laboratory to the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratory, and it is now situated in Erskine House, York-street, Sydney. In the meantime, the work that was being carried out in collaboration with the New South Wales Education Department on school children with hearing defects evoked general interest, and requests [52] were received from other States for similar assistance. Staff and portable equipment were sent to Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, to measure the degrees of deafness in the affected investigation, a highly-efficient children, and to indicate which of the children would benefit by the use of heartanks and aircraft, and an ing aids. Calibration and fitting of the hearing aids purchased by individuals and by the State authorities were also carried out by the laboratory staff. In April, 1947, a request was received from the Repatriation Commission for assistance in the choice, fitting and maintenance of the hearing aids which were being supplied to deafened ex-servicemen. An arrangement wa.s made with the Commonwealth Department of Health that acoustic laboratories should be established in Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane, and that the Repatriation Commission should contribute to the cost of their establishment and maintenance. Those at Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth are now in operation. The main laboratory, situated in Sydney, attends to the requirements of the Repatriation Commission in New South Wales. At present, in private enterprise, no standards are defined for qualification as a hearing-aid technician, nor is there any provision for the registration of personsother than registered medical practitioners-recognize d as skilled in the measurement of degrees of deafness. The service provided by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories is, therefore, the only one of its type in the Commonwealth. The functions of these laboratories are (1) to carry out the requirements of the Repatriation Commission for deafened ex-service personnel and to provide a similar service for the Commonwealth Department of Social Services in respect of deafened ex-service personnel whose disability was not caused by war service; (2) to assist the education departments of the States in measuring deafness, fitting aids, and maintaining hearing aid equipment for school children; and (3) to act on behalf of various State and other authorities who desire to have independent tests made before assisting financially in the purchase of hearing aids for people under their care. With the development of the acoustic aspect by the national health organization laboratory service, it is proposed to extend which the Government proposes to its activities to the investigation of probestablish. lems associated with noise in industry. To do this, it will he necessary first to define adjourned. noise levels which affect the production and the sensibilities of the persons working in noisy conditions. Equipment and staff will then be provided to measure the noise levels obtaining in various industries, and to advise on methods for the reduction of noise to safe proportions, or (vide page 1428), on motion by Mr if this is not possible, for the protection of the worker from ill effects.

It was recognized that, in order to achieve the proposed construction rate, it would be necessary to expand both the building labour force and materials production accordingly. Building tradesmen would also be needed by other industries. The proposals for this additional building labour envisages a further 32,S50 skilled tradesmen, plus other associated workers. It was estimated that the 32,850 tradesmen would cover the following trades:Bricklaying Carpentry and joinery f a in t in g and decorating Plastering PI limbing Tiling The major responsibility for the recruitment of this force became that of the Commonwealth scheme. It was evident that such an ambitious scheme could be carried through only by the unstinted support of the industry, and to this end employers and trades unions were invited to take an active part in the administration and supervision of the training scheme. This support has been given ungrudgingly and has resulted in putting into training a force of no less than 17,300 trainees. This gratifying result is due, as I have said, to the energy of the industrial committee selected from the employers and the unions. Unfortunately, however, the training rate has outstripped the advance in materials production, with the result that there is now a real danger of the factors of labour and materials becoming out of balance. There has also been recruitment to the industry from sources other than the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. The closest consultations have been maintained with the industry, which, at a conference in February, agreed that the training rate for the building trades under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme should be adapted to the rate at which industry can absorb the partly trained wen with the materials available. Therefore, the industrial committees, on which employers and employees are represented, 1 invrliepn given the responsibility of recommending future training rates in each State for the trades concerned. Furthermore, close contact is maintained with the Commonwealth Employment Service which reports increasing difficulty in placing new trainees with employers in a position to complete their training adequately. No change has been made in the Government's aim to increase building output, including houses, to the level mentioned. This increase is essential if the people of Australia are to be adequately housed. At the same time, while the target for employment of building trades4,000 men in the building industry and else.. 10,700 where will be preserved, the future rate'of .. 5,850 training for building trades must, be re.. 3,500 1.200 gulated to accord with the realities of .. .. 1,000 the materials situation. The employers and unions have stated that, as the :i2.K -)0 materials position improves, so will entry into training. The shortage of materials and its effect on the training rate is not peculiar to Australia. Materials shortages reconstruction training forced a similar situation in the United Kingdom, as long ago as August, 1947. The temporary cessation of training under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme which has occurred in some trades is due to the shortage of materials. Training in these trades will be recommenced when greater supplies of materials ensure employment opportunities for-trainees. It is of little service to ex-servicemen to train them for skilled occupations unless it is reasonably clear that employment opportunities exist for the completion of their training on the job, and for their subsequent employment. It is, of course, to be expected that, as the number of skilled tradesmen, including Commonwealth reconstruction trainees, approaches the total requirements of the industry, there will be honest differences of opinion between employers and employees' representatives as to the numbers still to be trained. These differences of opinion do not indicate lack of goodwill on either side and the Government is not disturbed by them. It is concerned to ensure that in the industrial committees there is the fullest opportunity, with the best possible information, for these differences to be ironed out in consultation. The Government is satisfied that if employers and unions will use these opportunities in the same spirit as they have shown during the life of the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme, progress will continue to be made. Briefly, the Government policy is, first, to maintain the training scheme as an effective instrument for the re-establishment of ex-servicemen and the provision of skilled, labour for industry; and, secondly, with the assistance of em31ST JANUARY, 1948.

These requests are referred to the appropriate industrial which has to approve of the establishment of the employer concerned as an "" approved establishment"". stand that, as far as it relates to the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme, that machinery has worked reasonably well; but serious difficulties have arisen in one section, to which reference was made, in part at any rate, by the Minister in his statement. The facts in my possession indicate that a representative of the carpenters and joiners division of the Building Workers Industrial Union, who is a member of the Victorian Industrial Committee, will not approve of any establishments the proprietors of which are members of the Timber Merchants Association. Consequently, when a member of that association applies to the committee for a trainee to be allocated to him, the union representative to whom I have referred "" digs his toes in "" and refuses to approve. That, in my opinion, is not a genuine refusal to approve. It is not seriously suggested that the establishments from which approval is withheld are such as normally would not be approved. It seems quite clear from the facts which I shall place before the House that this man is merely using his position on the committee as a lever to exert industrial pressure on the Timber Merchants Association. In 1946, Judge Kelly, of the Arbitration Court, deleted certain clauses from the carpenters and joiners award. His action apparently arose from breaches of the industrial law by members of the carpenters and joiners division of the Building Workers Industrial In other words, the judge deleted the clauses as a disciplinary measure. The clauses in question granted to the union the right of entry, the right to post notices, and the right to inspect employers' wage sheets. When taking this action, the judge told the union that it could make application to the court for the re-insertion of the clauses, upon its giving assurances satisfactory to the court that it would, in future, abide by the provisions of the Arbitration Act and Mr Holt. the awards thereunder. In August, 1947, the union made application for the reinstatement of the .clauses, but on the 1st September, the judge, deeming that committee, the assurances offered were inadequate, declined to grant the union's application. Since that time, officials of the union I underhave not had the right of entry to any of the premises of members of the Timber Merchants Association. The union, aggrieved at this decision of. the judge, has taken this particular action in order to vent its spleen, and exert some pressure, apparently through the Timber Merchants Association, by the action that it is taking against members of the Timber Workers Association, on the court itself. The employers who are members of the association, are concerned, no doubt, with the problems which arise from the action of the court in their proper sphere, but when one of them asks the committee for a trainee to be transferred to his establishment, he is met by the difficulty to which I have referred. I should have thought that if the chairman, who is nominated by the Government, is satisfied that a deadlock exists between the representatives of the employers and the employees, he should exercise a deciding vote in the matter. However, I am advised that a decision of the committee must be unanimous, and for more than six months, trainees in this particular section of the building trades have not been transferred to employers who are members of the Timber Merchants Association. The organization includes the most important employers in the timber business in Victoria. The trainees have not heen able to obtain a transfer. Union -To emphasize the irony of the matter, I point out that on the 10th March last, the general secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union-no t the representative of the carpenters and joiners section-mad e the following statement in the course of an address to the Arbitration Court:I would point out at this moment there has been a retrogression of entry to the carpentry trade because of the inability of employers to absorb Commonwealth reconstruction trainees. This has created a position where there has been a restriction in the training of those trainees. It is obvious that the union is preventing the entry of trainees into the trade, while representing to the court that the employers are unable to absorb them. The Government has a direct interest in this matter. It desires that its reconstruction training scheme shall be a success, and we are in accord with that wish. We require an increased number of workers in the building trades in order to overcome the housing shortage. But by an utterly improper use of his position on this committee, the representative of the carpenters and joiners section of the union is preventing the scheme from operating. In my opinion, the remedy is clear. The Government can either discuss the position with the committee, and remedy it, or seek an amendment of the act or the regulation which provides that the decision of the committee shall be unanimous. The requirements of justice would be met if the chairman, who is the nominee of the Government, could decide the matter in the event of a disagreement between the representatives of the employers and employees. I do not know whether the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) is familiar with these facts, but he should at the earliest practicable moment endeavour to straighten out this difficulty. If the union has a legitimate grievance which should be aired before the court, then it should approach the tribunal. Commonwealth instrumentalities which are set up for totally different purposes should not be abused in this way in order that a union may carry out some intimidatory industrial action. Minister for Labour and National Service) [3.30] -There is a good deal of substance in the remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr subsidy at the time. In the operation of Holt), but the case is not so one-sided as he might think. He is perfectly right in saying that the Government is very jealous of its reconstruction training scheme, which to date has been most successful. In Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia, no ex-service man or woman is drawing what we call a "" stand-by payment "", which is made while the person is waiting to be sent to a job. Indeed, only 43 ex-service men and women throughout the whole Commonwealth are drawing re-employment payments. I did not know that the difficulty to which the honourable member has referred had been in existence for so long, because it has not been referred to the Department of Labour and National Service. Association tried to straighten out the difficulty with the committee. the manager of the Timber Merchants Association, made a statement on the matter, which was published in the press early this week. I shall explain how the difficulty arose. Nearly all the carpenters and joiners who have been trained to 40 per cent, efficiency, and who have been put into full employment, with the payment of a subsidy, have been able to obtain employment on construction work outside the mills. One reason why they prefer to do construction work, instead of being employed in the carpentry shops inside the timber mills, is that they receive an extra 5s. 6d. a week for it. The timber merchants are experiencing difficulty in obtaining trainee carpenters and joiners to go into the shops. trainees, but the committee will not approve. difficulty. During the operation of the vocational training scheme after World WarI . , some employers were not training ex-servicemen as they should have done. As a member of the appeal board for Victoria, I discovered that some ex-servicemen were being kept on one special little job and were not being taught their trade, although the Government Avas paying a the reconstruction training scheme after World War II . , we have not discovered any similar instances. I state that fact in order that the honourable member for Fawkner may not think that I am suggesting that employers are not "" playing the game"". We desire to ensure that ex-servicemen receive thorough training in properly equipped workshops, and, for this purpose, the representatives of the",45,Table Iv Hstumated Needs Or Government S Full Programme Compared Available To Indicate Additional Numbers Required

153,Mr Holloway,"There is a furtheremployers and employees must have the right of entry to these establishments. They will also re-assess the trainees so that the Government will not continue to pay subsidies in respect of men who may have attained 100 per cent, efficiency. In the difficulty to which the honourable member for Fawkner referred, I do not know who is right or who is wrong, but I assure the honourable gentleman that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) and I will jointly see the committee about the matter, and endeavour to solve the problem. Something has occurred to prevent the representatives of the carpenters and joiners section from entering these workshops. The judge, who denied them the right of entry, must have had some reason for doing so, but the union representatives are now endeavouring, through a Conciliation Commissioner to straighten out the difficulty. I understand that the union representatives were asked for certain assurances before they would be given the right of entry. To date, those assurances have not been given to the Conciliation Commissioner. The House will agree that we must have the right to ensure that the employers keep their part of the contract, and give ex-servicemen proper training. Those are the facts. I admit that there is no cause sufficient to warrant the continuance of the present position. There are, I understand, three or four trainees who have readied the stage when they can work in the carpentry and joinery industry. They would probably be prepared to do so if this hitch had not occurred. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and I will interview the committee and ascertain why it will not give permission for these men to go into the workshops. If there is any obstacle that can be removed, it will be our duty to remove it. adjourned. present the third report of the Printing Committee. Report read by the Clerk and-by leave-adopted . BILL 1948. Debate resumed (vide page 1534). -'Sinc e the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) made his second-reading speech, I have had an opportunity to examine this bill and to assess the claims that have been made. Members of the Opposition are in agreement with the principles set out in this bill and do not intend to oppose it. In his speech, the Minister dealt with the history of the formation of acoustic laboratories, and, in agreeing to the second reading of the bill on behalf of the Opposition, I propose to elaborate upon that matter. The Acoustic-Research Laboratory was originally established to investigate intercommunication systems for armoured fighting vehicles and aeroplanes and noise protection devices for their crews. At the end of the war it was decided that its activities should be diverted from the field of warfare to acoustic problems in civil life. That was a laudable object. As the result of the last war, there are in Australia 2,500 deafened ex-servicemen. It is not sufficient to allow those men to rely merely upon such chance developments as might occur in the field of hearing aids. The Government has a definite responsibility for them and, by the establishment of these laboratories, has shown that it recognizes that fact. It is also proposed to examine the problem of deafness of school children, which, as honourable members are aware, is caused in many cases by some disease of the mother in the pre-natal stages. The scheme envisaged by this bill will help to ascertain the extent to which deafness exists in Australia and will further the development and design of hearing aids. Facilities for the giving of advice will be provided so that sufferers from this affliction may take full advantage of the benefits that will accrue from this legislation. The functions of these laboratories were described by the Minister as follows:(1) To carry out the requirements of the .Repatriation Commission for deafened ex-service personnel and to provide a similar service for the Commonwealtli Department of",47,Table Iv Hstumated Needs Or Government S Full Programme Compared Available To Indicate Additional Numbers Required

(2) To assist the education departments of the States in measuring deafness, fitting aids, and maintaining hearing aid equipment for school children. (-i) To act on behalf of various State and other authorities who desire to have independent tests made before assisting financially in the purchase of hearing aids for .people under their care. These must commend themselves to honourable members as being very worthy objects. The bill, however, does not go as f a r as I hope ultimately the Government w ill go. For example, no attempt is to be made by the Government to assist those who suffer from this grave disability by helping them to purchase hearing aids; nor is any attempt to be made to undertake an investigation of the diseases that cause deafness. The percentage of deafness among children is very high, and we know that it is normally caused by what is known as rubella or german measles in the mother during the pre-natal stages. A close investigation should he made of the causes of the diseases that affect the hearing of the individual, and I have no doubt that that will be done in due course. The bill clauses. Clause4 readsThe Minister may establish, maintain and operate within the Commonwealth acoustic laboratories for scientific investigations, including tests in respect of hearing aids, and their application to the needs of individuals and in respect of problems associated with noise as it affects individuals. That is the pivotal clause. Clause6 gives wide powers to the Government. The Opposition feels that in a matter of this nature the Government is not in a. position at the moment to pin-point with any accuracy the powers it w ill require and, therefore, acknowledges the necessity for this clause which readsThe Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this act, prescribing all matters which are by this act required or permitted to be prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed, for carrying out or giving effect to this act, and in particular(a) for prescribing the conditions under which acoustic laboratories controlled by the Director-General shall be operated; and (6) for prescribing the terms and conditions under which the services oi those laboratories mÂ«y be made available and the charges which may be made for their services. We acknowledge that the Minister cannot pin-point, at this moment, everything that is likely to flow from a service of the kind proposed, but we hope that in giving the Government the wide powers proposed, we shall not see them abused by it in the making of regulations. pay tribute to the Ministerf or Health (Senator McKenna) Â± r having drafted u this legislation /inch has been introduced into the House on his behalf by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway). I have often tried to obtain from the Government help for the deaf. The Acoustic Research Laboratory was first designed to devise protection for members of the services and people engaged in heavy industries against the excessive noises and blasts of warfare and industry respectively. Later it turned its attention to civilian problems in the acoustic field, especially the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women for whom the Repatriation Commission provides hearing aids. the Government and the Minister. for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) for that service. For many years the plight of children afflicted with deafness has been neglected as far as the provision of acoustical equipment is concerned. The State Government has set up institutions at which deaf children are educated, but that is not enough. Science has perfected wonderful hearing aids that w ill give to deaf men, women and children something of the pleasures that their deafness has lost to them hitherto. I congratulate the Government on its decision to establish acoustic research laboratories in the various States. I cannot understand, though, why portable acoustical equipment has not previously been sent to every Australian State. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have had the equipment at various times, but only this year has Queensland been visited by the scientist in charge of",48,Second Readikg

159,Mr Conelan,"Yes. I commendthe Australian Government's acoustical laboratory. I am especially pleased that a laboratory is to be established in Queensland and that the Government proposes to do its utmost to restore to the greatest possible degree the hearing not only of ex-service men and women whose hearing was impaired by their war service, but also of all other people in the community similarly afflicted. During my chairmanship of the War Expenditure Committee, I found that the deafening noise in heavy industries, especially in boilermaking, was responsible for a great deal of absenteeism. I hope that researchwill lead to, if not elimination, at least considerable diminution of the deafening noises in heavy industries, because I am certain that that will considerably diminish absenteeism and increase production by leaps and bounds. Time and time again I have urged in this chamber that the provision of hearing aids should be one of the Commonwealth's social services. Great Britain this year the Government has started a scheme whereby hearing aids are provided to deaf people in indigent circumstances at a nominal cost and to other similarly afflicted people at a cost less than they would have to pay on the open market. I hope for the introduction for a similar system in Australia. Deaf people who cannot afford to pay for hearing aids should receive them free. Australia to-day is spending 2,000,000 dollars on the purchase of acoustic equipment and spare parts from the United States of America, but I am confident that with the aid of the more experienced acoustical equipment industry of the United Kingdom, we shall soonbe able to produce our own equipment and thereby save dollars whilst providing a wonderful boon to those afflicted with deafness. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [3.50]. -The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) referred in his second-reading speech to the deafness of children known to have been caused by the contraction of German measles by mothers during pregnancy. There we have a fruitfu l field of research. The person to whom honour is due for having made that discovery is a Sydney man whose name I must confess escapes me for the moment. whose name is Murray. Dame ENID LYONS -But he practices in Sydney. His discovery ought to be of tremendous importance in the prevention of deafness of the type referred to by the Minister. Research must be aimed at the prevention of German measles in women during pregnancy. At what stage of pregnancy does German measles have this effect upon the unborn child? I understand that it is known to be in the early stages. It is necessary to ascertain at what stage the danger is the greatest and when it ceases. Is there any possibility of inoculation of young women so that they shall escape infection during the months of danger? If that could be clone and we could thereby prevent the incidence of deafness among children we should lay our finger on the cause of a great deal of deafness and thus prevent suffering and loss of efficiency. It is in the field of preventive In medicine rather than curative medicine that I think the future of the medical profession lies. The part that the Government should play in the health of the nation lies in that direction. I commend the measure. The Government has made a great step forward in bringing it before the House, but I hope that it will not be content with this patching of defects that we know exist and that it will turn its attention to the prevention of the defects and, particularly, to the prevention of deafness caused by disease in pregnant women. not intend to delay the passage of this bill. I rise merely to ask whether the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) can tell me whether the Department of Health has made an estimate of what the proposed new service will cost. That would be useful information to have. Minister for Labour and National Service) [3.55] -in replyI cannot inform the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) of what the service will cost, but I assure him that the money is available to meet whatever the cost may be.

The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) directed attention to the necessity for scientific research into deafness caused by German measles during pregnancy of women. Research to that end is proceeding here, in the United States of America and in Great Britain. Our scientists are keeping in close touch with investigation abroad.

The Government, however, with the knowledge that victory over the Japanese was approaching, decided that men who had suffered the rigours of life in a prisoner of war camp for three or four years should not be called upon to undergo further suffering and declined to allow them to participate further in active service. They were discharged befoie the 15th August, 1945. There were other prisoners of war who, having friends in England, were absent without leave in that country after having been rescued from the prisoner of war camps in Germany. No one blamed them much for their absence. Who could do so when they had been incarcerated for so long ? The authorities turned a blind eye to their absence. The point I make is that former prisoners of war discharged after the 15th August, 1945, were granted re-establishment leave of 30 days. Among them were many of the men who were absent without leave whilst their companions hurried back"" to Australia to take up the fight once more against their country's foe. They came home and were discharged after the 15th August, 1945, and received special re-establishment leave of 30 days.

The total quantity of cigarettes containing American leaf which may be imported from the United Kingdom during 1948 . 5-Com is 2,250,000,000 cigarettes or an equivalent weight of tobacco calculated at the rate of 450 cigarettes to the pound. These quantities represent approximately the weight by which importations of American leaf have been reduced by the dollar restrictions. The quantity permitted importation is allocated amongst the British manufacturers on a quota basis according to their importance in the Australian trade and their ability to supply. The quantity available from some British manufacturers is very small. Licences are issued against the quotas to the Australian distributors of the manufacturers. There is no monthly quota. Licences are issued in January and July for half the annual quotas. If it can be established that the tobacco or cigarettes are manufactured wholly from leaf of sterling origin, licences w ill be issued freely to the quota holders mentioned above without debit to their quotas and also to other importers. The quantity imported under this heading would be additional to the figure of 2,250,000,000 quoted above. There is, therefore, no restriction on the importation of cigarettes made in the United Kingdom entirely from leaf of sterling origin, whereas the cigarettes made wholly or partially from American leaf are restricted on a qviota basis to a definite quantity. 4 and 5. Australian manufacturers have been striving to increase production of tobacco and prior to the recent restrictions had increased the quantity available for distribution to within 10 per cent, of the estimated demand. However, as from October, 1947, there has been a decrease in production owing to the restricted quantities of tobacco leaf permitted importation from America and the decrease in size of the Australian crop. In spite of this decrease, the quantity, of Australian tobacco and cigarettes distributed throughout the Commonwealth is greater than it was during the period when tobacco rationing conditions were in force. ter representing the M in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs, u p o n notice 1.

(6) Operations at the Hagley mill were temporarily suspended in February, .1948, because through the poor returns obtained by growers from their flax crops in relation to other crops sufficient acreage for llax could not be obtained to keep the mill in economic production. These poor returns were due to unsatisfactory seasonal conditions and the damage caused to the flax crops by the rust disease. The representative of the Tasmanian flaxgrowers has advised that the farmers in the Hagley district would be interested in again growing flax if sufficient supplies of sowing seed of a rust resistant variety were made available. 2. The Hagle3' mill, together with all essential plant and machinery, is being retained for the present by the Commonwealth in the hope that within a reasonable period sufficient The Minister for Trade supplies of a rust resistant variety which is being developed will be available for sowing in the Hagley district and that variety will prove suitable for local conditions. 3. In view of the fact that the plant and machinery essential for the production of ilax fibre is being maintained in a working condition at the Hagley mill and that the"" plant and machinery is not suitable for any other industry, it is not practicable at the present time either to establish another industry there or rent or sell the buildings for other purposes. 4. As Commonwealth-owned flax mills become surplus to requirements, they are disposed of through the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. However, f u l l particulars of all such mills are furnished by the flax production committee to the Secondary Industries Division of the Ministry of Post-war Reconstruction. That division, with the co-operation of the Disposals Commission, endeavours to arrange for these assets to be taken over at an appropriate valuation either by some new industry or by an established industry desirous of decentralizingits activities. A number of these surplus mills has been successfully disposed of in this way. The special flax processing plant and machinery at these surplus mills is not sold but is transferred to a convenient centre to meet future needs at mills where flax operations are being continued. senting the M in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs, u p o n notice1.

Approval has been given for the issue of a licence to import approximately 2,400 Dodge motor vehicles from France, ex-army disposals, together with a quantity of spare parts there for. 2. The vehicles involved comprise approximately 2,000 f-ton Dodge trucks one third of which are ""command cars"", i.e., truck chassis fitted with passenger accommodation and winopy tops, the balance being "" weapon carriers"" together with approximately 400 1-ton six-wheel drive Dodge trucks. 3.

Isi t a fact that clothing associations in Australia have unanimously agreed that clothes rationing has outlived its usefulness and that it should be abolished? 2. If so, has consideration been given to the view of the trade concerned, and' is it the intention of the Government to abolish cli thus rationing in whole or in part in the light of those views? 3. If not, for what reason is clothes rationing to be retained? T r a de and Customs has supplied the following information: 1. Representatives of clothing traders assoriutions in discussion with the Rationing Commission have recommended the abolition of clothes rationing. 2. Careful consideration was given to these trade opinions both by the Rationing Commission which endorsed that view in its recommendation to the Minister for Trade and Customs and by the Government when considering the Commission's report which was accompanied by a statement of these trade opinions. 3. The Government in . not accepting these recommendations was guided by information which would not have been known at the time either to the trade associations concerned or in the Rationing Commission. The very difficult position in regard to dollars has not abated and its effect is to l i m it considerably the future availability of woven cotton textiles. It must be realized that two-thirds of our woven textile requirements for clothing and household purposes are necessarily of cotton; that comparatively little cotton textiles are WOM'II in Australia; and that United Kingdom. India and other countries outside the ii<N:r area arc unable at present to supply milrequirements even up to a rationed level of demand. Notwithstanding that due to large shipments of cottons from the United States of America ordered before the dollar stringency The Minister for arose, stocks of many types of cottons and the garments made therefrom arc temporarily good, the Government decided on account of the circumstances set out above that it would not be prudent to discontinue clothes rationing at the present time. honorahle member for R i v e r in a ( Mr. L a n g t r y ) asked whether any in d i c a t i o n Correspondence and could be g i v en of the present p o s it i o n r e g a r d in g the i m p o r t a t i o n from the U n it e d States of A m e r i c a of h e a r in g aids and replacement parts for h e a r in g aids at present in use.

MEAT. honourable member for N e w E n g l a n d ( Mr Abbott) asked the following question:I direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs to the Commonwealth Statistician's report on food production and consumption in Australia for the year 1946-47, which shows that although the rationing scale for couponed meats permits an annual consumption of 95.6S lb. a head, the actual consumption of these meats was 181.4 lb. a head. Allowing 20 iper cent, for wastage in retail butcher shops, these figures indicate a consumption of approximately 145 lb. a head. To assist the people of Great Britain in their desperate economic crisis, Avhich, according to figures published in to-day's press, is worsening, I ask the Minister what steps, if any, have been taken to reduce the consumption of meat in excess of the ration scale in this country? The M in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs has supplied the f o l l o w in g in for m a t i o n : The honourable member correctly quotes from the Commonwealth Statistician's report on Food Production and Consumption for 1940-47 that the consumption of fresh meat",54,Department Of Trade And Customs Commercial Branch Sydney

184,Mr Pollard,"On the 22nd A p r i l , thewas IS 1.4 lb. a bond, which is stated in terms of carcass weight. His assumption that wastage would account for 20 per cent, is erroneous, as the deduction allowed off carcass weight by the Rationing Commission for bone, fat and trimmings in converting to butcher weight averages over 29 per cent, and even this is claimed by butchers to be too low. The Statistician's report states the individual ration for an adult as 1.84 lb. a week, which is equivalent to 95.68 lb. per annum (butcher's weight) as quoted by the honourable member, or 134.9 lb. carcass weight. An additional factor to be allowed for is that meat is necessarily made available for the following purposes, which account for over 100,000 tons per annum:-Hotels (for guests staying less than six nights) ; cafes and restaurants; manufacturing (for sausages and smallgoods); hospitals; vessels, &u. Furthermore, consumption in non-rationed areas and on farms killing their own meat is not restricted and would greatly exceed the ration. Unfortunately, there is also a leakage of meat and coupons from rural areas to consumers in cities and towns, which it is very difficult to police. It is to be regretted that the unrelated, and therefore misleading, figures quoted by the honourable member received wide publicity. A much truer picture would have been presented had he quoted from the concluding paragraphs of tlie section on meat in the Statistician's report. Those show that, in carcass weight equivalent of licef, mutton, pork, offal, canned meat and bacon and ham, consumption of which for the three years ended 1938-39 averaged 253.2 lb. a head per annum, declined on account of meat rationing to 218.7 lb. in 1944. 203.2 lb. in 1945, and 203.1 lb. in 194.R. Preliminary estimates for 1940-47 indicate a rise to 211.2 Jb: but, the Statistician remarks, this figure is inclusive of a small but unknown quantity consumed by services. In a memorandum to the Rationing Commission the Commonwealth Statistician estimated that if consumption of meat in 1946-47 had been at the same amount a head as in 1942-43, 132,000 tons more would have heen consumed, thus reducing exports by half. The Rationing Commission' and (he Government are aware that there are evasions of meat rationing by some persons in rural areas, as indicated above, by meat traders and by consumers, but the losses of meat thereby, although regarded as serious in existing circumstances, are less than is somct'mcs claimed. One of the main reasons, the Rationing Commission considers, for cou'iiiiHition beyond the permitted quantities, is the failure of the courts in some States to inflict penalties on offenders sufficiently high to net as a deterrent. honourable member for Griffith ( Mr Conelan.) asked whether the allocation of import licences for the forthcoming year would be on a quota system, based on the value of goods purchased during a specific quarter, or on the basis of purchases for the whole year. The special committee has reported to me that whereas it was originally hoped that it would be possible to issue licences on a quota basis related to importations made by individuals or firms in the financial year 1946-47, it has been found that such a system of licensing will be possible in relatively few instances. In these few instances each quota holder w ill be entitled to a licence each quarter of a c.i.f. and e. value equal to one-fourth of his annual quota related to his imports in special medical cases; merchant 1946-47. In other cases, the budget, which is in course of preparation, will allocate a certain amount of monev to specific tariff items or a specific commodity and licences will be approved against the particular budget allocations in cases where the importation is deemed to be essential. To secure an even flow of imports, the guiding principle will be that licences issued each quarter will not exceed one-fourth of the total annual amount allocated under each budget specification. honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr. Harrison), asked a question regarding the sale of 20-gauge brass sheet in Sydney. I am informed by the Minister .for Supply and Development that this matter has now been investigated by the Commonwealth Investigation Service, which reports that neither the person nor the firm concerned is an agent of nor in any way connected with the Commonwealth Disposals Commission; also there is no record of any sales of surplus sheet brass by the commission to these people.

The M in is t e r for S h i p p in g and F u e l has a prototype of the present-day aircraft? advised me as f o l l o w s : The difficulties referred to arose, of course, out of the delays occasioned by the industrialdisturbance in Queensland but since shipping operations have been resumed both the Australian Shipping Board and private shipowners have made every effort to l if t cargoes which had accumulated for Queensland ports. As at the week ending 1st May the quantity of cargo awaiting shipment from Adelaide for Brisbane was approximately 5,500 tone and the vessels Mungana and Beltana had been fixed to l if t this cargo. From Melbourne for Brisbane there were approximately 5,000 tons of cargo offering and the vessels Manunda, Carlisle and Cardross had been fixed for Melbourne loadings for Queensland ports. The Director of Shipping has been unable to obtain any clear indication of the actual amount of overseas cargo which was discharged at Sydney for transhipment to Brisbane. It appears, however, that from advices received from the various shipping interests 10,000 tons of cargo, both overseas and interstate, were awaiting shipment to Brisbane from Sydney during week ending 1st May. A number of vessels including the Arkaba, Manunda, Delamere, Carlisle, River Norman and Troilus have been fixed for Sydney loadings for Queensland ports and it is the view of the Director of Shipping that these vessels w ill be adequate to cater for all the cargo offering. Certain of the vessels mentioned w i ll also l if t cargo for other Queensland ports. There was, of course, an accumulation of steel products at both Newcastle and Port Kembla for Queensland ports but these accumulations have largely been cleared by recent shipments wit h the exception of a quantity of 1,055 tons awaiting shipment to Townsville from Newcastle as at 22nd April. Owners' Association anticipate that an early fixture will be made for this loading. As regards the waterside labour the position in [S3] Brisbane has been under close review by the Stevedoring Industry Commission for some time. It was only to be expected that following the settlement of the Queensland dispute, shortages of labour would occur in all Queensland ports where cargo had accumulated for shipment. The Commission is of the opinion that the waterside workers registered for the port of Brisbane are adequate for the normal needs of the port and that no good purpose would be served by increasing the registered labour available for the Brisbane waterfront at the present time. C i v i l A v i a t i o n , u p o n notice 1. Isi t a fact, as stated in a Sydney weekly newspaper of the 3rd April, that the Convair 110 is a smaller plane with considerable technical differences from the Convair 240, and is no more a prototype of the 240, as claimed by the Minister, than the first aeroplane to fly is 2. Isi t a fact that the licence to fly commercially granted in the United States of America modifies the makers' specifications and stipulates that the 240's must carry 1,500 lb. less than the take-off weight anticipated by the manufacturers? 3. If so, w i ll this reduce the weight of the pay-load that can be carried? ' 4. When is it anticipated that first of these aircraft will be delivered to the Australian National Airlines Commission ? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Although there are technical differences between the Convair Model 110 and the Convair Liner (Model 240), the two aircraft are of substantially the same dimensions and aerodynamically very similar. It is, therefore, right to regard the Model 110 as the prototype from which tlie Convair Liner has been developed for production. 2 and 3. The maximum take-off weight specified for the Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft has not been reduced. 4. In June, 1948, according to most recent advices from the United States of America. D r .

What were the reasons for the sharp f a l l during January in the output in bricks, cement, roofing tiles, bath-heaters, and other domestic appliances ? 2. Has he been informed that shortages of coal and labour are heavily curtailing the production of steel in Australia, and that 450,000 tons of steel a year are being lost to the nation? 3. If so, what were the reasons for this decline in steel production? honourable member's . questions are as follows:1. Bricks, tiles, bath heaters and other domestic appliances, with the exception of gas, electric, and fuel stoves, baths and cast iron porcelain enamel basins, are not controlled by the Commonwealth. Advice as to the reasons for any reduction in the output of these building materials and domestic appliances which are under the control of the State governments should therefore more properly be obtained from those governments. In respect of gas, electric, and fuel stoves, baths and cast iron enamel basins the Commonwealth controls the allocation of the raw materials used in manufacture and the allocation of the quantities of the completed units to each State. Distribution within States is the function of-the respective State governments. Output during the month of January appliances and domestic hardware would be affected by the incidence of tlie holiday period during that month. 2. It is estimated that the shortage of coal and labour is curtailing the production .of steel to the extent of approximately 9,000 tons per week. 3. The lag in steel production in Australia at the present time is brought"" about by the lack of sufficient man-power to mine coal, burn coke, operate the blast furnaces and man the steel mills for the production of steel products. A recent survey indicated that there was a shortage of some thousands of men for these requirements, and attention is being given to the matter of providing additional labour in the south coast area and at Newcastle by the Commonwealth Government in association with the State Government of New South Wales. Arrangements have also been made for the erection of four hostels in the Port Kembla persons from overseas. The State Government has arranged for the erection of a large number of single dwellings in the south coast area of New South Wales; in addition, the producers of steel and galvanized iron have provided hostels additional to those approved by the Commonwealth Government. last, the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) asked whether I was aware that a senior member of the Prices Branch had been charged with black marketing in connection with the renting of a house and that at the hearing certain Crown witnesses who had previously made statements supporting the case for the prosecution declined, on the ground that they might incriminate themselves, to give evidence with the result that the The answers to the charge against the official was ultimately dismissed. The honourable member further asked why was no immunity offered these witnesses to encourage them to give evidence against the defendant. The facts are that an officer of the Prices Branch, Sydney, was being transferred to Canberra. He"" had the occupancy of a house in Sydney and was approached by a fellow officera lady who was an old friend of his familywith a view to obtaining possession of the house for her married sister who was homeless and about to have a baby. The Prices officer agreed and said that, as he did not want the furniture in Canberra, he was prepared to sell it for Â£150, which of these particular was considered to be its fair value. The husband did not approve of the purchase of the furniture but, without his knowledge, the wife purchased the furniture and obtained a home. The husband complained to the Prices Branch, Sydney, and was referred to the Deputy Rent, Controller within whose province the matter fell. It is a breach of the National",57,Federated Clerks Union

The Deputy Rent Controller, in referring the papers to the Deputy Crown Solicitor w i th a view to prosecution, expressed doubts as to whether the circumstances were such as would warrant the institution of proceedings. It was doubtful whether the transaction was w it h in the regulations. The question of prosecution was u l t i mately referred to the Acting Attorney General, who decided in November last that, as the honour of the administration of the Prices Branch was at stake, the prosecution should proceed. .The charge was' not one of black marketing as alleged by the honourable member. Both women were unwilling witnesses and, after they had given portion of their evidence, they were advised by the magistrate that they need not answer certain questions if the answers might tend to incriminate them. Acting on this advice, they readily declined to give f u r t h e r evidence and the information was dismissed, without, of course, any r u l in g os the legal contentions of the defendant.

OK RENTSAND PRICES REFERENDU M. the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) asked me a question without notice regarding interruptions to the broadcast by the righ t honourable the Leader of the Australian Country party referendum. I have advised the righ t honourable gentleman by telegram as follows Reference interruption Mr Fadden's broadcast raised by you in House, Postmaster General has informed me that the intorruption was due to technical faults which resulted in the broadcast being six minutes approximately short of the allotted time on stations outside Queensland. To compensate for this loss the Australian Broadcasting Commission which is tbe responsible authority ou this matter is agreeable to provide a further six minute period at a time suitable to tbe Australian Country party to compensate for the loss of time caused by the interruption. The commission states that apologies were made for the interruptions on three occasions between 7.16 p.m. and 7.23 p.m. and that Mr Fadden's name was again mentioned as the speaker when the line fault was cleared. I have advised Mr Fadden of the foregoing. ' IMPLEMENTS AN DMACHINERY . ter, upon notice1. Has he seen the report in a New South Wales newspaper of the 23rd April, that the shortage of spare parts for farm implements and machinery was now becoming a major issue ill farming areas of New South Wales? 2. In view of the importance of maintaining production in primary industries at the highest possible level, will he have inquiries instituted with a view to taking measures to remedy tlie shortages Teferred to?. 3. Will he make a statement to the House as to tlie present position regarding the importation of spare parts for farming machinery) honourable gentleman's questions are as follows 1. No. 2. During the war period lirnis manufacturing spare parts were necessarily switched over to manufacture of essential munitions and consequently a pronounced lag in the manufacture of spare parts developed. Manufacturing firms are, however, endeavouring to overtake this shortage as speedily as possible. While there are gome shortages in locally manufactured agricultural machinery, the major difficulty arises from the fact that tractors are in the main imported, and spare parts arc difficult to obtain. This is brought On the 5th May, 1948, about by a variety of causes and is world-wide in its incidence. These matters are kept under constant review, and in view of the statement made by the honourable member, a further detailed investigation of the position in New South Wales has been undertaken. 3. During the recent review of import on the forthcoming prices licences covering goods of dollar area origin all existing licences for spare parte for farm tractors were. confirmed and the validity extended to 30th June, 1D48, where necessary. Extensive shipments of spare parts for tractors and agricultural machinery in transit at that time have since arrived. > Licences have been approved for spare .parte since beginning of December on a liberal scale, and requirements should be reasonably covered.
