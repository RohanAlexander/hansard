In view of the statements made by these responsible bodies, will the Minister for Eepatriation make the necessary amends to the srontleman concerned? member's question arises from a debate which took place in this House during the last two days in which references were made to the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement' Appeal Tribunal. course of the debate I said that Mr that adequate supplies of powdered ETickey had been considered unsuitable for re-appointment to the tribunal, and that the ex-servicemen's organizations had evidently thought likewise because no organization had nominated him in first place on the panels of names submitted by ex-servicemen's organizations to fill a vacancy on the tribunal. Mr Hickey's name was included on two panels of names submitted to the Government. On one he was placed third, and on the other he was placed fourth. I hope that that will clear up the point raised by the honourable member. Almost invariably when panels of names are submitted for consideration the organizations concerned indicate their first, second and third choices, Mr Hickey's name was placed third on the panel of names submitted by the Tubercular Sailors and Soldiers Association.

That position is entirely due to the fact that as the States now control price fixing the company which manufactures zinc products finds that the price for zinc within Australia is £22 a ton compared with the overseas price of £93 a ton. Naturally, the company is anxious to export maximum quantities of zinc and to sell miniir.um quantities in Australia. That position is unfortunate. While the Australian Government had power under the National Security Regulations to impose controls, it was successful in ensuring that local manufacturers had adequate supplies of zinc for galvanizing purposes. Considerable difficulty has arisen since the Australian Government had to relinquish controls, because the fixation of the price and the distribution of zinc is now administered by the Governments of '1>A six States. heen inadequate in Australia for years.

I am fully aware of the fact that che Australian Government exercises conrrol over exports of zinc and other minerals. However, it must be realized that in the operation of that control, the Australian Government is confronted with a problem arising from the production of zinc concentrates. If the Government were to place an embargo on the export of a portion of our zinc, which is the finished product, grave difficulties would arise over the control of the export of zinc concentrates, which are the raw material. I assure the honourable member for Balaclava that the Government has been in close touch with the situation during the last month. Officers of my department are now trying to reconcile the differences between various private concerns in this country, which are involved in the problem. I hope that, with the co-operation of the companies concerned, we shall succeed in reaching a .solution which will result in adequate supplies of zinc heing made available to the manufacturers who desire them. Prime Minister a question relating to the redistribution of electorates, but before doing so, I express the hope that the right honourable gentleman will forgive my ignorance about the subject. However, this House is the proper place for an honourable member to seek information on such a subject. After the Redistribution Bill has been approved by the Parliament and the new electoral boundaries became official, will the present member be able to undertake work in the new sections added to his existing electorate? Will the electors regard as their member their present representative in the House of Bepresentatives or the member into whose electorate they will be transferred as the result of the redistribution? until a new member is elected for u constituency, the present member will continue to be regarded as the representative, and will be fully justified in attending to the requirements of his constituents within that particular area. I have no doubt that, in connection .with the redistribution, honourable members will devote some attention to the new areas which they hope to represent. In the meantime, however, the people in the old electorates will be entitled to regard their present members as their representatives, and seek assistance from them when they require it. for the appointment of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission was to ensure that the adequate supplies of bauxite which are known to exist in Australia would be made available to meet the requirements of the aluminium industry.

Those who had considered the project also had in mind a claim that high-grade deposits existed in Malaya. After the Aluminium Industry Bill had become law, technical experts made an examination of the deposits in Australia, and a proposal was considered that the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, which is a joint authority representing the Australian and Tasmanian Governments, might take leases or options of leases over bauxite deposits in Malaya.. Subsequent investigations by experts employed by other aluminium interests have revealed that there are superior deposits in certain islands in the Pacific, and, consequently, the enthusiasm for developing the Malayan deposits has somewhat waned. alumina, and as this subject is highly technical, I shall have prepared a brief survey of developments in the industry with particular reference to the questions which the honourable member for Warringah has asked. to the Minister for Post-war Beconstruction who is in charge of the North Australian Development Committee, a body which appears to be defunct. Will the Minister ascertain whether the Mount Isa mines interests made representations in the early stages of development at Mount Isa to the Government of Queensland to build a railway to a port on the Gulf of Carpentaria, or to authorize it to construct the line because of the reduced haulage to a gulf port compared with the haul of 600 miles to Townsville via Cloncurry ? In order to appease Mount Isa Mines Limited did the Government of Queensland grant to it considerable freight concessions on lead bullion or zinc concentrates hauled to Townsville, and on back-loading of coal from Collinsville eastern seaboard? What concessions, if any, did the Townsville Harbour Board extend to Mount Isa Mines Limited in that regard? In 1936. a series of articles was written for the North Queensland Register by Mr Doherty, a competent journalist, decrying the whole idea of opening up the gulf by providing a port at Borooloola in the Northern Territory or another suitable place. Will the Minister have those articles examined in the light of present-day evidence and ascertain what influence in Townsville sponsored the opposition to the idea, of providing an outlet on the gulf for the products of north-west Queensland ? Will the Minister confer with the Minister for the Navy with a view to liaving hydrographic surveys made of the Gulf of Carpentaria ?

55,Mr Spender,"I have moved theto three vital matters. The first is that it should endeavour to establish the most friendly relationship ""with the United States of America, upon whose aid we relied so much in the desperate days of 1941, 1942 and 1943, and who in those days came to our assistance with generosity and speed. The second responsibility of the Government ought to be to present a united democratic front to those influences which are to-day endeavouring to destroy democracy. The Government's third objective should be to prevent the entry into this country of subversive agencies, and to destroy those already here. Within the limited time at my disposal I propose to draw attention to the activities of the Office of Education, which, I understand, comes under the authority of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. Among the functions of that office is the distribution cluded. By the cartoon it is sought to of literature, and of what are termed educational posters. I do not know what all the functions of the office are, but one controls the whole of the agencies of. the of them is, as I have said, the preparation and distribution of posters, under the authority of the Government, to what are called group leaders. Perhaps the Minister who replies on behalf of the Government will inform us who these group leaders are, for what purpose the groups were established, and why there is a governmental agency which feeds them with information. When the Estimates were last under consideration an amount of £441,000 was voted to advance the activities of the Office of Education. That i9 more than was expended on all our overseas embassies and legations. The office has circulated a number of what are described as discussion posters. I have one of them in my hand, and I draw attention to the fact that it appears to offer a gratuitous insult to a nation whosefriendship we at all times should seek to cultivate. The document is headed, "" The Discussion Poster-The Government of the People for the People "". On the left-hand side are diagrams designed to show how democratic governments operate in this country. On the other side are diagrams, issuing from a blue block entitled ""American Voter"", designed to show how democratic government operates in the United States of America. Were' it left at that, it may be said that that is purely objective and presents a good poster for discussion. The very serious matterI draw attention to, however, as an example of the subversive influence which is creeping into the agencies of this pountry, is the drawing at the bottom of the poster, which I cannot imagine that the Government will defend. I at least hope that it will have the decency to order that it shall be withdrawn. I refer to the cartoon, which in itself is grossly objectionable. I assume that the person depicted is supposed to be an American citizen, a representative of so-called "" Big Business"". He is shown holding all the stringsjobs, concessions, and contracts-of the American voters in his hands. The President and government agencies are inestablish that behind the government of that country there is a political boss who government in America. I cannot imagine any more abusive propaganda than this being engaged in by any government. If it were anti-Russian propaganda, there would undoubtedly be howls about it from 'one end of the country to the other by recognized Labour groups. But apparently a nation, the friendliness of which to us is unquestioned, and which has given generously towards the rehabilitation of the world. foUowing the conflict through which ii has passed, is to have this kind of insult hurled at it, not by an individual, but by the Government of this country. pense. cartoon, standing alone, a disgraceful thing to appear on a government document, but in addition these words appear on the right-hand bottom corner of the posterBehind the scenes, the political bossesfinanced by big business or by machines of their creation-contro l party distribution of government jobs and contracts.

57,Mr Spender,"Not only is thatGovernment of this country through the Office of Education. In other words, a Commonwealth agency is using the moneys of this country in a campaign against the United States of America. Clearly the American Government is -charged with being corrupt, and subject ro bribery and jobbery. is also contained in Communist literature. happen purely by accident. The nature of the cartoon is deliberately disgraceful. The propaganda contained in it, and in the poster generally, is not merely -similar, but indeed an exact parallel to what can be read in any Communist newspaper published in this country. Throughout the poster it is implied that behind the scenes in the United States of America there are political bosses, financed by big business, who control the government of that country. That is an assertion that has heen made time and time again by Communist newspapers and Communist agencies. It is extraordinary that at a time when we ought to be adhering fast to those friends we have left in the world, the Government appears to be doing its best to destroy those friendships. We are engaging, through our governmental agencies, in the destruction of those friendships, and in advancing the interests of a foreign power that has no desire foT friendship with us. In this instance there can be no doubt whatever that that is so. We, on this side of the House, have said more than once that the Government is allowing itself to be used, putting it on its lowest denominator, by Communist influence in this country. I should like the Minister personally to inform the Eouse how the Office of Education functions, to tell us the names of the group leaders to whom these posters are distributed, and to describe their functions. brought to the notice of the Minister yesterday, by way of a question which was directed to him by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), I asked him who was responsible for the creation of this poster. Does the Minister not know that this is merely Communist propaganda, being put out as the official Anew of the Australian Labour party in this country ? What action does he propose to take in respect to it? .1 urge the Government, in the interests of the maintenance of friendly relations between Australia and the United States of America, to order the immediate withdrawal of this poster. The Government should dissociate itself completely from the circulation of thtposter, and should forward an official apology to the Government of the United States of America for the perpetration of this insult upon that country. It should also ascertain who arranged for the publication of the poster, and should deal rigorously with the person or persons responsible. I contend thai this poster is an outstanding example of subversive influence in this country being permitted by a Minister of the Crown to further the carrying out of nefarious Communist activities. The technique of the Communists is well known. They infiltrate into a country and then proceed to turn fche government instrumentalities into agencies for the destruction of democracy. That has been going on little by little for year3 in this country. On every occasion that attention has been directed to such activities, the Governmeni has brushed the matter aside. On this occasion, however, the matter cannot so easily be turned aside. The Government must acknowledge that this poster is an official document and it should say plainly whether the views expressed are those of the Government. It will not be sufficient for the Government to say. "" This is merely the Office of Education setting out its views in an objective way for discussion "". This poster has a substantial circulation. It can only do incalculable harm to our relationships with the United States of America. This is not the only poster to which I shall draw attention, but it may be well, at this stage, Since this matter was to compare words appearing in it with the words uttered by the late John Curtin in 1942, when we were seeking the aid of America. I shall draw attention to his words then, because they give a direct denial of the type of propaganda contained in this poster. The words were uttered on the occasion when, without qualms, Mr Curtin sought the assistance of the United States of America. Having",20,Office Of Education Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

59,Mr Spendee,"Yes. This did notexpressed his admiration and gratitude for what America had done, the late Mr other nations barring its industrial exCurtin saidWe fight with what we liave and what we have is our all. We fight for the same free institutions that you enjoy. We fight so that, in the words of Lincoln, ""government of the people, for the people, by the people, shall not iirrish from the earth "". Honourable members will observe that -iorne of those famous words appear on rh is poster. Mr Curtin continuedOur legislature is elected the same as is yours; and we fight for it , and for the right to have it , just as you will fight to keep the Capitol at Washington the meeting-place of freely elected men and women representative nf a free people. This poster seeks to convey exactly the opposite of that, and suggests that in the United States of America there are no free people but simply minions of big business, and that in truth democracy does not exist in that country at all. V. ask the Minister to direct that this poster be withdrawn, and, further, to convey an apology to the government of the country that has been insulted by it. [ said that I did not intend to connne myself to one document. There is another poster which is entitled "" ""Why did Japan go to War?"" It will be as well if honourable members of this House who suffered at the hands of the Japanese know what is the omciai view of the Government on the reasons why Japan went to war. The poster states them as follows:Rising population pressure on small area of cultivable land. Japan's future industrial expansion barred by rising tariffs overseas. That statement causes the Opposition no surprise, because we know that, in the pastI do not say now-instrument s of government such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Department of Information were _ used as propaganda media by Coinmunists, who are to be found in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch, the Stevedoring Industry Commission and many other agencies of government. N'ow we find that a newly created government department, which is spending large sums of public money, is telling group leaders of education, whoever they may be, through its posters, that tbe reasons why Japan went to war were rising population pressure on a small area of land and pansion. That is a pretty piece of literature to be issued by a governmental agency. In the usual Communist jargon, the poster contain? the further statement that militarists and monopolists reasoned that only conquests could ensure markets and raw material sources. This poster is another outstanding example of how subversive elements are penetrating into governmental agencies. The people of Australia want to know for what purpose they are being taxed and they will take the strongest exception to the money that is obtained from them being used to supply t.he means of destroying them. The Opposition has drawn attention on other occasions to this kind of thing. On the 18th September of last year the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Eankin) asked a number of questions concerning a Mr Eobson, who was employed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The honourable gentleman alleged that Mr Eobson was a member of the Communist party. In its replies to the questions that were asked, the Government evaded the issue, as it always does, but"" in truth Mr Eobson was a member of the Communist party. I invite the Minister who is responsible for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in this House to listen to the foreign affairs discussions that are broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. If the one that is broadcast at half-past eight on every Monday evening is nof being used as a vehicle by some of the speakers for Bussian propaganda, ] should like to know what a vehicle for Eussian propaganda is. Let me give another example of what I have in mind. A man named Norman Eichmond was employed at Canberra University College. One of his duties was that of lecturing to officials of the Department of External Affairs. When the Opposition asked whether Mr Eichmond was a member of the Communist party, the usual reply was given that, in respect of such appointments, the Government does not concern itself with the political beliefs of applicants. That is the way in which i lie 'Government continually seeks to avoid facing up to the fact that Comiinunists are infiltrating into government -lepartments. It is true that normally -Lie political beliefs of a man have nothing desire ""to destroy our democratic instivhatever to do with his appointment to .tuy office, but when attention is drawn to the fact that a man is a Communist or is engaged in Communist activities differ-ent considerations should arise. [Exten<ion of Mme granted.] There are some members of the Labour party who have long realized that the Communists are seeking to destroy the present system of government of this country. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr ment, and the people will want to know Scullin) is one and the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) is another. The Government has shown singular inactivity in this connection. It is not to be wondered at that there are men in government departments who are indulging in propaganda for the Communist party ->r engaging in subversive activities. They .are not discouraged by the Government, and indeed on some occasions they Are encouraged by it. Could any greater encouragement be given to such men than ihe. unfriendly reference to the United States of America that was made within The .last 24 hours by a government supDorter in another place?

The Government has two courses open to it. Either it can say plainly that what is taking place is taking place with its approval, or it can say that what is taking place is taking place without its approval, and it can acknowledge that such activities are opposed to the interests of this country. In the latter case, some action will be demanded of the Governwhat, action the Government proposes tn take.

The poster has been issued by the Office of Education, a branch of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. The poster is grossly offensive to the United States of America, and is definitely Communist propaganda. The Minister has refused to state the name of the cartoonist who drew the foul insult to the United States which appears at the bottom of the poster, but it is plain that the cartoonist is probably one of those people who draw Communist cartoons in Australia. As I stated, the Minister has tried to dismiss this matter in an airy manner as a slight mistake in judgment. Ir reminds me of the man who plunged The officer who is a dagger into his mother's breast, and subsequently told the court that he made a slight mistake in judgment because he pressed the weapon a little too hard so that it pierced her heart.

100,Mr Spender,"I rise to order! 1L do not tliink that the honourable member is entitled, when moving the adjournment of the House in order to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, to launch a debate of an omnibus character. ""When the honourable member submitted his letter to me and indicated his desire to move the adjournment, I considered thai; the terms of the subject vvhich he proposed to discuss were too wide, and, at my suggestion, he modified them. I am still doubtful whether I should have allowed a discussion of the subject in its present form, and I ask the honourable member for New England to nonfine his remarks strictly to the definite matter that has been stated. Post-war Beconstruction pointed out that the publications of the Office of Education, which members of the Opposition regard as subversive propaganda, have a wide circulation throughout the Commonwealth. No doubt the publications are sent to many organizations such as the Eureka Youth Movement and the Russian-Australian Society, of which the Minister for Transport ( Mr ""Ward) was a vice-president [f the honourable member does not confine his remarks to the subject which the honourable member for ""Warringah has raised, I shall ask him to resume his seat. Post-war Reconstruction has stated that the publications of the Office of Education are sent to many important bodies in the Commonwealth, and I have pointed out that the Minister for Transport was the Vice-President of one of those bodies. In said that members of the Opposition cidentally, the Australian Labour party has described the Russian-Australian Society as a Communist organization. The honourable member is still wide of the mark. Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, the officer responsible for the issue of poster No. 19, to which honourable members of the Opposition object, is the gentleman who is in charge nf the issue of the Current Affairs Bulletin. I hope that a meticulous examination will be made of that publication for the purpose of ensuring that the Communist propaganda is not injected into the minds of the Australian people through that agency. The Minister has claimed that the posters are an experiment. I regard it as a raw and cruel experiment to endeavour to discover how much Communist propaganda the people will stand before they revolt against it. or before members of the Opposition protest against it in the House. The Minister has stated that he will withdraw the poster. He and his department have been exposed to the people as an agency for circulating Communist propaganda. They shield the Communists in government offices, and unless the Opposition protests, they allow this foul propaganda to be disseminated with the object of causing bad relations between Australia and the United States of America, the only country in the world which can save our democracy in the Pacific sphere honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis). ""Who are some of the members of the staff of the Office of Education? The first name that occurs to me is that of Dr. Lloyd Ross who, I understand, is a convert. For many years, Dr. Lloyd Ross was one of the leading lights of the Communist party in Australia. To-day, he is supposed to be cleansed. I am not convinced. If a piece of litmus paper were placed on his tongue, it would probably be turned a flaring red colour with the acid of communism still in his system. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, who is a defender of communism, honourable member for New England has said that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction is a defender of communism.

111,Mr Abbott,"I withdraw the exThe honourable member has withdrawn the expression, and I ask him to continue his speech. Post-war Reconstruction, who is a defender of socialism, has said that members of the Opposition are not interested in educating the democracy. That is a foul aspersion. What members of the Opposition are protesting against is a form of Soviet education which is being adopted. If the Soviet wants to try to educate the people of Australia, let it bear the cost of doing so. It should not be allowed to use the resources of the Oommonwealth to pay for foul propaganda through Commonwealth institutions. member for Warringah deserves the thanks of the Australian people for having directed attention to this matter in a brilliant speech. I hope that in the interests of the maintenance of good relations between Australia and the United States of America, this kind of propaganda will cease. Australia and America have a common inheritance in respect of democratic freedom. The legal institutions of both great democracies sprang from a common source in Great Britain, and the rights of the two peoples originated in Magna Carta, which King John sealed at Runnymede. Both peoples have fought to preserve their democratic rights. The honourable member has exhausted his rime. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [3.59] -The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has launched an attack on the Government in a general sense and in a particular sense. He has alleged that there is a serious penetration, with government approval and permission, of subversive influences into the instruments of government. However, the honourable member did not produce one piece of evidence to support the general charge. He has made smearing attacks on departments and people who have no opportunity to defend themselves, here and he has invited honourable memhers to listen to the Australian Broadcasthas publicly expressed regret, and stated ing Coihmission if they desire to hear alleged Communist propaganda night after night. The chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is Mr R. J. F. Boyer, who is very well known to honourable members on both sides of the House. He was appointed to his position on the Australian Broadcasting Commission by a government supported by honourable members opposite. The general manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Mr Charles Moses, was appointed by a commission which was set up by a government composed of members of the present Opposition. The honourable member's attack on the Australian Broadcasting Commission is an attack on Mr Boyer and Mr Moses. It was a The honourable most undeserved and improper attack. Those two gentlemen are responsible for what goes over the air. If any attack is made on those who talk over the air, if there is a labelling of certain people as Communist, the attack if really directed against Mr Boyer and Mr Moses, upon whom the responsibility lies, and I deny on their behalf that they have encouraged the dissemination of Communist doctrine. The Postmaster-General has no authority to interfere with the administration of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, or to nominate officers or speakers to talk over the air. That is the sole responsibility of the commission and its executive officers, and the attack of the honourable member was particularly regrettable, to put it mildly. It was in very bad taste, and is entirely indefensible. The honourable member then attacked the Department of Information, saying that it had done this and that. There is not the slightest evidence that any instrument of the Department of Information, whether it be the radio, film or the written word, has ever been used by any Communist or fellow traveller to propagate Communist doctrine. The honourable member was not able to produce any evidence to support his charges. He merely threw mud, hoping that some of it would stick. Then he came down from the general to the particular, to one poster, in fact. Regarding that poster, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction",27,Cameron S O Was The In Respect Of Which The Govern

The Minister cannot do more, and he has gone a long way towards making amends tor something that, was issued that was most offensive and grossly insulting to rhe United States of America that should uever have been issued at all. But once it has been established that the Minister has taken such action the case of the honourable meinber for ""Warringah falls to the ground. When he produced the poster, he claimed that subversive «lements in the Commonwealth Office of Rducation were responsible for turning -ut posters of that kind. There was a -econd poster, but he relied upon one to establish his claim regarding the existence ->f subversive elements. The other points raised by him are properly matters for disputation. He might have produced uther posters, but he did not do so. I liave one here which deals with the production in Australia of iron ore. On the >ther side-and I point this out for the information of honourable members opposite, who are not of the rude type as is the honourable member for New England -' Fire over Malaya "". The caption reads, -' Why Britain is standing firm "". The --ause of.Britain is then advanced and a rgued. The poster bears the noticePublished by the Commonwealth Oflice of Education, Grace Building. York-street, -Sydney. And underneath, there appears the following letterpress:Among the dense jungles of Malaya, there i terror awl tension: but with firm deter-iiination the Government has undertaken to -camp out both the Communist-led uprising -md the bandit gangs hiding behind a nationalist front. Leaders of the Malayan Mitbreak have taken a cue from neighbouring --oiintries-Burma, Siam, Indo-China and Inliuiesia-wher e unrest is common and local nationalism has gained victories and varying -logrees of .independence. Britain has offered the Malayans a greater voice in government, but the changes did not -utisfy the local residents. Why is Britain's policy in Malaya different from her attitude in India, and Burma, where she has withdrawn and allowed the local inhabitants to -risiune control? The letterpress then sets out how these --vents affect Australia. It is pointed out Afr. Calwell. that Singapore is a vital link in British Commonwealth defence, that friendship with the ultimate rulers of Malaya is vital to Australian security, and that a fall in British dollar income will hit us. The poster was designed to help the Britisli cause in Malaya. There is nothing Communist about it. Indeed, everything about it is anti-Communist. The honourable member for Warringah and other honourable members opposite must have known of the existence of this poster, but they tried to support a weak argument by referring to one particular poster only. I have here 26 numbers of the Current Affairs Bulletin, issued by the Office of Education. They discuss all kinds of subjects, including a very topical one under the title, "" United States of America chooses a President"". Other articles discuss the position in Malaya, and matters affecting Australia, as well as international affairs. Nowhere in the bulletins is there any evidence of subversive activity. If the advice of the honourable member for Warringah is to be followed, that all Communists should be removed from government positions, let him carry this advice to State LiberaT governments. There are more Communists employed in universities than anywhere else, and the .universities ar»undev the control of State governments.. that to be true? bers opposite know that it is true, but wehear nothing from them about removing .Communist lecturers ancl professors from universities which are under the control' of anti-Labour governments. If Communists are to be removed from government positions in the federal sphere, a.<honourable members opposite advise, ler them make a start with their friends in the States. We do not believe in persecuting people for their ideas, but we believe in prosecuting them when they Since the war, break the law. That is why we took action against a Communist in Queensland. In State spheres, many Communists hold prominent positions, bur honourable members opposite do not question their right to do so. The honourable member for Warringah referred to Mr Curtin's appeal to the United States of America during the war.",28,Cameron S O Was The In Respect Of Which The Govern

PART I -DEPAKTMEKT SAND SERVICES-OTHE B THAN BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS AND TEBBI ments in various parts of Australia. 1 I'OUIES OF THE COMMONWEALTH. Proposed vote, £27,594,000. L shall speak particularly with regard to the necessity for the provision of additional aerodromes in country districts. [ think all honourable members recognize the desirability of having aerodromes, or, at least, landing strips, conveniently located Several accidents and other mishaps which have occurred during the last couple of months could conceivably have been avoided if aerodromes had been available in certain areas. I hope that the Government will take steps at an early date to establish additional landing facilities for aircraft, at least in the more settled parts of Australia, particularly in the north coast and New England districts of New South Wales. I point out that at the present time little is being done to carry out improvements to existing aerodromes in those areas so that they will be capable of being used by the heavier and larger types of aeroplanes which are now operating in this country. A number of aerodromes in the Grafton, Kempsey and Taree districts of Sew South Wales are only suitable for ruse by the smaller types of aircraft, because the landing areas have not been sealed with bitumen or some other suitable material capable of withstanding the landing pressure of, heavy aircraft in all weathers. I suggest to the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) that if his department is unable at the present time to undertake the work necessary to improve aerodrome facilities, particularly those in the areas that I have mentioned, consideration should be given to the advisability of arranging for local contractors to undertake the work. I point . out that the aerodrome at Grafton is frequently swamped during wet periods. That constitutes a dangerous hazard to aircraft when landing there in inclement weather. In that town firms such as Theiss Brothers have large earth-moving and other equipment, and they could, J believe, be safely entrusted with the work drome. That firm is doing somewhat similar work for government departam convinced that if that firm, or any other firm possessing the necessary equipment, were engaged to perform the work on a contract basis, the job would be completed in a matter of weeks and safer facilities would thus be provided for aircraft. In many other country district? also there are small contractors who could at least undertake portions of thinecessary work, if given an opportunity throughout this country. to do so. Early this year I visited South Africa. In Southern Rhodesia, which has a white population of about 100,000 people only, numerous aerodromes and landing strips have been provided, which serve for normal landings by aircraft, and also, in certain areas, for emergency landings. As a result, considerable economy is achieved in the workings of various government departments in South Africa, the representatives of which are able to fly to various parts of Bhodesia on governmental business and thereby save many days' travelling time each month. Another aspect of the matter is that at the present time builders in country areas are experiencing difficulty in procuring materials. Frequently, they have to wait some weeks before being able to obtain certain materials in order to complete a building or a section of the work. I urge the Government to take advantage of that position. If certain contract? to effect improvements at aerodromes were let to local contractors, and a flexible arrangement was entered intowherebj those contractors could carry out work at the aerodromes during such waiting periods, in the course of several months quite a number of improvements could be effected at the aerodromes.

It has never been as evident before in Watson's Bay as it is now, when, of necessity, a lot of .*tuff is thrown overboard from the vessels that are lying at anchor in the bay.

T do not blame project let it vacate the field of aluminiumanybody for the failure to submit the report because I understand that there are good reasons for its late submission. I have discovered that the report will be tabled next week. I accept the reasonsfor the late presentation of the report but I do not accept the right of the Government to go on with this project until the report has been made available for the perusal of honourable members. The press has recently been full of suggestions that Tasmania's share of thisproject may be bought out by overseasinterests. Those interests, I have everj reason to believe, are the great world cartel the Aluminium Company of America,, commonly known as Alcoa.. and its associates. Discussions which the Prime Minister has had on this subject have lent weight to thesesuggestions. The Premier of Tasmania has spoken of the desire of certain interests to buy Tasmania's share in theproject. The Premier has not said thai he would not sell but he has insisted thai if Tasmania's share be sold to the cartel;, or to some other overseas concern, the industry should continue to be operated in Tasmania. Paragraph j of article 3: of the agreement which appears in the schedule of the Aluminium Industry Act reads as follows:Commission shall not enter into oi in any way concerned in or a party t<>sions are premature. I want an under1 paragraph j of article 3 of the agreement.. prove that it is unnecessary for them to production and leave it to those who can and will develop it. Had it uot been for the action of this Government-and I do not say that the Government did not act rightly at the time; but the effect is the same-Australi a would to-day be providing most of its requirements of aluminium. It has been prevented from doing so because of the war. At least, I shall be generous enough to blame the war. I draw the attention of honourable members to some facts which [ have gleaned about this industry in Australia. To-day the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) asked a question about the projected importation of bauxite from Malaya. It might be interesting to honourable members to know that thei'e are no large bauxite deposits of any quality in Malaya, and that good deposits are located in the Netherlands East Indies. The good quality bauxite which the Minister for the Navy -spoke of as being available in Malaya comes from the Netherlands East Indies, where all the deposits are owned by Alcoa, the greatest monopoly.in the world Only from the Netherlands East Indies is any considerable quantity of bauxite to be obtained. There may be some small deposits in Malaya but they are of very poor quality. I propose now to refer to a booklet issued by the North-west County Council which deals with the development of the north and north-western areas of New South Wales. Eecently, an important meeting of citizens was held at Inverell. [ am glad that the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) is present in the chamber because the honorof a fear that he may not get something able gentleman was present at the meeting. The meeting was held to discuss the possibilities of the development of the north and north-western areas of New South Wales. It turned out to be a gala day for Labour parliamentarians. Every one said the nicest possible things, and left unsaid those things which might have largest deposits are situated inland where they dimmed the rosy picture which they wished to portray. is waxing poetical. Vice-President of the. Executive Council to become poetical now and again. However, his major task in the Ministry does not give him much scope for poetry. The honourable member rarely says anything but, "" I move that the question be now p u t As an illustration of the nice things that were said at that meeting, Mr Hogan, a member of the Australian Labour party, and, I have no doubt, a very estimable gentleman, said that it was a wonderful thing for Australia, for Inverell, and for the world, that there was a Labour government at Canberra and a Labour government in New South Wales. It would have been sheer cruelty to dampen such enthusiasm by the application of a little cold logic. No interjector at that time would dare suggest, as I have suggested to this committee, that but for the Labour Government in Canberra Australia would now be providing most of its requirements of aluminium and not importing them. The major contribution to the discussion at Inverell was made by Councillor Mather. He submitted some pertinent data and some interesting facts. I intend to quote what he said as an illustration of how illogical and, for want of a better word, how stupid this Labour Government has heen. Eeferring to bauxite potentialities at Inverell and the establishment of a plant there, Councillor Mather saidAn alumina plant of the proposed size would have a capacity to produce 20,000 tons of' alumina per annum and at tliis rate there is, I am informed, sufficient supplies of bauxite in this district to last for well over 100 years. After that he became completely illogical because in this semi-dictatorship of ours one has to walk quietly. One cannot stand up and say what he likes because that he wants. Councillor Mather was afraid to carry his argument to its logical conclusion and suggest that the plant be established at Inverell, and defy the Government to prove that he was wrong. Instead, he continuedTo my mind it is fortunate that Australia's are less vulnerable in 'times of emergency; direct r a i l connection to a deep sea port is all that is required. While he applauds the fact that bauxite fields are widely dispersed over Australia he concurs in the proposal that the product of these fields be centralized at one focal point, in Tasmania, at a place where a. blind pilot could not help but",33,Estimates 1948 49 Auditions New Wobks And Otheb Services Involving Capital Expen Diture

127,Mr Bowden,"I should like thefind it on a dark night and be able to blow the whole lot to smithereens with one single bomb. First he proposed that a plant be established at Inverell to produce 20,000 tons of alumina per annum, which could be converted into 10,000 tons of aluminium; then he said that it was fortunate that Australia's largest deposits of bauxite were widely distributed throughout Gippsland and inland areas of New South Wales and Tasmania, but notwithstanding those views, from a defence viewpoint he failed to see the folly of piling the whole of the alumina beside a river in Tasmania which could be used as a pathfinder by any pilot to lead him to the stock pile on the darkest night. equally as vulnerable if the plant were ""Stablished at Inverell? be nearly as vulnerable as the site selected for the plant in Tasmania. I do not object to Tasmanian members entering this discussion in an attempt to justify the Government which they support; but F cannot but remind them that the people in their own State did not want this industry, which they regard as a "" white elephant"". The Tasmanian Government is obliged to provide £1,500,000 as its share of this project, which will involve it in an annual expenditure of at least £60,000 for interest, but the most it can hope to get out of it will be the employment of a few people. This industry will be a mill stone around its neck. ber talks like that he almost makes me cry. ber for Denison (Dr. Gaha) might look a little bit more interesting if he cried, f want to touch now on t.he high light of the meeting at Inverell. According to the booklet, the Vice-President of the Executive Council said[ am, and liave heen for some time, 100 of aluminium annually for 100 years. per cent, behind you. [ do not blame the honourable gentleman light. Honourable members will recollect for that statement. He did not have to that the bauxite a.t Inverell is low-grade accept responsibility for the project. The ore. honourable gentleman went on to say that rhe Minister for the Navy( Mr Riordan) [08] would have most to say about the proposal as he would be responsible for presenting the case to Cabinet. In the most tragic statement. I have ever heard, the Minister for the Navy saidIf an aluminium plant were established at Inverell and an aluminium plant in Tasmania, there would be two points which could be interfered with. Could a more fatuous statement be made by a Minister in charge of one of our defence arms? Following the same reasoning he might well have said that if we had two battleships and not one, two would have to be sunk by the enemy instead of one. The thought of a whole flotilla would appal him! We should have to inconvenience the enemy sufficiently to induce him to blow both of them ""up! If that is the sort of reasoning upon which our defence policy is based we might well pronounce the benediction now aaid start for home. matter, and the honourable member should treat it as such. serious. According to the booklet the Minister also said that it is proposed to import 40,000 tons of bauxite per annum from Malaya. He meant, not from Malaya, but from the Netherlands East Indies. ber's statements are not quite correct. contained in the booklet to which I have referred.. One of the reasons given for the decision to obtain bauxite from Malaya is the necessity to conserve Australia's resources of the mineral, because tbey may be required in a war-time emergency. According to the statement of the Minister, 40,000 tons of Malayan bauxite, or 67,000 tons of the Inverell district bauxite, will yield 10,000 tons of aluminium. The opinion has been expressed that the resources at Inverell alone are capable of yielding 10,000 tons I shall now deal with another high-",35,Estimates 1948 49 Auditions New Wobks And Otheb Services Involving Capital Expen Diture

The Minister for the Navy has also stated that there is 1,000,000 tons of bauxite in Gippsland. He has carefully avoided describing the grade of the ore, because he has to justify the importation of bauxite from Malaya. bauxite at Inverell and not with the bauxite at Gippsland. Minister's 5,000,000 tons of bauxite is available at Ijiverell, another 1,000,000 tons is ro be obtained in Gippsland and 1,000,000 tons in Tasmania. Incidentally, the Tasmanian bauxite is low grade ore. It does not come higher than "" C "" grade; it is not a metallic ore. 5,000,000 tons of bauxite should be transported from Inverell to supplement the 1,000,000 tons of low-grade ore in Tasmania. Obviously, the sensible plan is to transport the 1,000,000 tons of lowafter a Government spokesman had stated srrade ore in Tasmania to supplement the 5,000,000 tons of higher-grade ore at Inverell. If the statement by the Vice President of the Executive Council is eorrect, the 1,000,000 tons of low-grade ore in Tasmania should certainly be transported to supplement the 20,000,000 rons of high-grade ore in New South Wales. From the word "" go "", the establishment of the aluminium industry in Tasmania was prompted hy considerations of political expediency. I desire to make some observations about the bauxite deposits in Gippsland. The fact that I represent that area will not influence niy views, because the portion of my constituency in which the bauxite occurs will be included in another electorate after the redistribution of seats. The estimate of 1,000,000 tons of bauxite in Gippsland is purely hypothetical. The autliorities have no definite information about the extent of the deposits. Several million tons may be available there. The proportion of this ore is 4 to 1, that is to say, 40,000 tons of bauxite will yield 10,000 tons of aluminium. The quality of the Gippsland ore is equal to The visible supply, I guarantee, h sufficient to provide 10,000 tons of aluminium per' annum for the next 25 or 30 years. Yet the Minister is considering transporting high-grade ore to Tasmania, where a comparatively small quantity of low-grade bauxite exists. He also statedIn the event of war, supplies from oversea* could be cut off, but they could not be cut off from Tasmania. Did honourable members ever hear sucb nonsense as that assertion? An enemy could occupy Tasmania with a platoon, statement approximately and, in that event, would have possession of the plant and the bauxite. The only practical plan is to establish the industry where large quantities of bauxite are available. Why does the Minister favour the location of the industry in a most vulnerable position, where supplies of low-grade bauxite are comparatively The Minister proposes that small? A business in Melbourne has produced from bauxite a finished ingot of aluminium. I had the pleasure of showing one of the ingots to the House during an earlier debate on this subject, that no one in Australia had suflicient technical ability to make aluminium here. The ingot was manufactured by one of the cleverest metallurgical chemists in the world. He was cleverer by far than any member of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission. In appointing that body, the Government did uot claim that it was selecting experts in the subject of aluminium, bauxite or alumina. They may have been expert -in other subjects, including engineering, but they had little or no knowledge about aluminium.

141,Mr Bowden,"According to thebauxite deposits bad to be pointed out to xhem. Yet those officials had the responsibility of reporting to the commission on the practicability of establishing an aluminium industry in Australia. Considerable importance was placed on the establishment of the aluminium industry in Tasmania, because cheap hydroelectric power would be available. I point out that the power has not yet been provided. Recently, the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Cosgrove, spoke of borrowing £1,000,000 for the construction of hydroelectric works to provide the necessary power. The interest bill alone on the -Government's aluminium plant will be considerable. That item is one of the reasons why such instrumentalities make heavy losses. Probably, the aluminium industry will be subsidized in the same way as Trans-Australia Airlines is. The -Government grants £3S0,000 a year in order to make its operations payable. As the Government proposes to manufacture 5,000 tons of aluminium a year, and the plant will cost £3,000,000, the interest hill alone will amount to £24 a. ton. I have already shown that, under the act, the Australian Aluminium Production Commission must not have any dealings with any commercial trust or coinSine, but must always remain an indepenlent Australian undertaking. Another interesting point is that negotiations for rhe disposal of the plant shall not be comMinister( Mr Chifley) whether there menced without the approval of both -chambers of the Australian and the Tasmanian Parliaments. That provision was inserted in the Aluminium Industry Rill at the instigation, not of Labour -members, but of members of the Opposition. However, honourable members on rhis side of the chamber become apprehensive when the Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania, who are the two -major executives in this business, speak of selling the plant to an overseas organization. I do not know the nature of the information in the possession of the Government, but I am sure that that overseas concern is associated with the monopolistic cartel. Members of the Opposition desired to avoid that position, and their anxiety in that respect prompted -them to urge the Government to include the safeguard in the original act. Great emphasis has been laid on the advantages of cheap power to the aluminium industry. Honourable members opposite may be interested to know thai the cost of power in the production of aluminium represents only 10 per cent, or 12 per cent, of the total. The cost of alumina represents approximately 50 per cent., and the cost of labour, electrodes and flux accounts for the balance. Undue emphasis has been placed on power, because that is the only excuse that the Government has for establishing the industry in Tasmania. As member. 1 of the Opposition declared when the original bill was under consideration, the location of the industry in Tasmania-was a political expedient on the part of thr Government in order to win another seal at the then approaching election. The nei result was that the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) became a member of this chamber. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Burke) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. one respect, it is regrettable that the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) was not able to complete his speech. I am gratified that he has raised the subject of aluminium, because the matter is becoming increasingly urgent in Australia. Yesterday, I asked the Prime was any likelihood of the aluminium industry being removed wholly or in pari from Tasmania. The right honourable gentleman replied to the effect that, within the next few days, he would send certain information to the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Cosgrove, about the whole position, but that whatever happened. Tasmania, would not suffer industrially, but rather would gain from any decision? that were reached. I do not know what the Prime Minister meant by the last part of his reply, but many people in Tasmania fear that tbe island will lose the aluminium, industry. In 1944, the Aluminium Industry Bill was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, and the Government appointed the Australian Aluminium Production Commission.

Altogether, she presented a very good case for her company, and I placed it before the Minister for Munitions. I should like to know what has been done about her offer, and whether, in the opinion of the Government, there was anything wrong with it. As a supporter of the Government, I now ask the Prime Minister for a statenient on the matter. For my part, I should prefer that the Reynolds Company had an interest in the aluminium industry in Australia, than that the international cartel should have any hand in it. I am not discussing this matter in a parochial spirit. The aluminium industry is a defence project, and a contract regarding it was entered into between the Commonwealth and the State of Tasmania. We have an obligation to choose the best site for the industry, irrespective of State interests, but all that tralia, and I have no doubt that the has been investigated. The available bauxite deposits have been surveyed, and Tasmania was chosen as the site for the treatment works. A contract was signed, and work has begun. It would be bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth to break that contract now, either by changing the site for the treatment works, or by allowing any outside commercial interest to shove its way in. I endorse the statement of the honourable member for Gippsland that the aluminium industry should be placed on a national basis, but I contend that Tasmania is probably just as safe a place for the industry as is New South Wales, from a defence point of view. As a matter of fact, Tasmania does not appear on some maps at all, for whatever that may be worth. When everything is considered, it must be admitted that Tasmania is a very good locality for this industry. I do not want any overseas cartel to bc iriven the right to develop the aluminium industry in Australia, and to take the profits out of the country. For a long time, we have had a suspicion that overseas oil interests have prevented the development of an oil industry in Australia. member for Gippsland, there are ample Mr Ihithie. bauxite deposits in Gippsland. Indeed, he represents Gippsland as a land which, if not flowing with milk and honey, is. at any rate, filled with deposits of bauxite. There is no need to go to Malaya for bauxite, if it is present in Australia in the quantities suggested b,\ the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully). Let us, therefore, develop our own industry. Let us not invoke the intervention of outside interest to do what we are quite capable of doing ourselves. These Estimates provide £5,759,000 foi various works to be undertaken by the Department of Civil Aviation. It is the second largest vote on the works schedule for the year, and it should be analysed.

I do not propose to discuss the unfortunatiaccident in which an aircraft recently crashed into a mountain top. That matter is sub judice, and when the inquiry is finished we shall know all about it.

Honourable members will notice on references to the Estimates for Capital Works and Services, oii page 421 that tlie amount allocated for works by the Civil Aviation Department for the year 1948-40 is £5,759,000. Some details concerning the proposed expenditure appear on page 425 of the publication. Provision should be made for an improvement in the beam system. The Minister for Air said on a previous occasion that the system is too expensive. However, the lives of Australian citizens should be protected, and the expenditure would be justified.

In addition, -another plant was established in the -United States of America by Mr Kaiser, 'who built the Liberty ships. I remind 3.1ie honourable member for Gippsland, as I mentioned before, that a prosecution was instituted in the United States of America and the cartel was broken up. To suggest that a cartel still exists shows a lamentable lack of knowledge on the part of the honourable member of what is occurring in the aluminium industry to-day. The cartel was smashed during the war years. member referred to Mr Hogan's statement. If I heard him correctly, he quoted Mr Hogan as sayingWc would not have had the aluminium industry at nil but for the Labour Government. 'The honourable meniber for Gippsland said also that why we have not got an aluminium industry tc-day is clue to the war. I wish the honourable member would make up his mind. He This Labour Government did not come into office until October, 1941, when the war was well on the way. Within three months of that time we were fighting Japan. When the war ended there were enormous stock-piles of aluminium, and everybody was worried as to how the aluminium was to be disposed of. It was not long, however, before there was a world shortage because the demand for aluminium hacl increased. It was not possible for the company to secure plant during the war, as honourable members are well aware, and we all know that it will now be three or four years before the plant can be manufactured. than that. I give to the honourable gentleman who blamed this Government for the nonestablishment of the aluminium industry. A question was asked in the House this morning with regard to the importation of bauxite from Malaya. It was said that 40,000 tons of bauxite a year will be exported from that country. It may well be asked, why should -the Government take steps to obtain bauxite from Malaya when there exists such enormous deposits of it in Australia? The Canadian company, known as Alcan, has enormous external deposits of bauxite vvhich it exploits and takes to Canada for the production of aluminium. The American concern, Alcoa, also secures most of its bauxite outside of the United States of America, I believe from the northern or central part of southern America. Erom time to time. I have heard honourable members on the other .side of the chamber and their satellites outside of the Parliament advocate that what is wanted is a government with initiative. honourable The honourable member for Wilmot was quite correct in his remarks in that connection. With regard to the aluminium industry, what the commission suggests doing is what the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited is doing at present with regard to iron ore. That company is exploiting its iron-ore deposits at Kolan Sound during times of peace, but is keeping in reserve the deposits at Iron Knob in South Australia cannot have it both ways. to work during any period of waT. All that is happening in the aluminium industry is that the commission suggests that as the supply of raw material from which alumina is produced is limited in Australia, we should conserve our internal deposits in times of peace so that they will be available to exploit during war-time when it is not possible to work on external deposits. As .honourable members will agree, once the internal deposits have been worked out we would have no alternative but to import aluminium. The commission proposes to obtain raw materials from outside Australia in a time of peace. Then, if war breaks out and we are denied access to deposits in other countries, the Australian deposits can be utilized. It is proposed, in other words, to follow the methods that are used by big business, or. to adopt the word that was used by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr' Bowden), the cartel, which utilizes bauxite deposits outside its own country. Eecently, Alcan secured an option on an enormous bauxite deposit on an island iv. the Pacific. It is one of -the richest",42,Estimates 1948 49 Auditions New Wobks And Otheb Services Involving Capital Expen Diture

155,Mr Bowden,And probably longer,43,Estimates 1948 49 Auditions New Wobks And Otheb Services Involving Capital Expen Diture
156,Mr Eioedan,"That is the answerof which we know. The bauxite that is obtained from Malaya is 50 per cent, aluminium. Malayan bauxite we can produce 10,000 tons of aluminium. The bauxite at Inverell is only 38 per cent. pure. Sixty-seven thousand tons of it would be needed to .produce 10,000 tons of aluminium. It was agreed at the outset to establish a plant that was capable of an annual production of 10,000 tons. I know of one industry that may be established in this country which will consume 3,000 tons of aluminium a year. An annual production of 10,000 tons of aluminium would be a mere drop in the ocean, but with an industry of that capacity we «hould have a source of supply that was capable of exnansion in a time of war. The honourable member for Gippsland said that the deposits at Inverell will last for 100 years. That is so, if we use only those deposits and produce only 10,000 tons of aluminium a year from them. But who will say that we should not produce more than that quantity when we know that our present consumption is greatly in excess of it? From the defence standpoint, it, is necessary to secure as quickly as possible as much plant as can be established and utilized economically. We diould not limit our annual production of aluminium to 10,000 tons for any specified period. It is diflicult to secure the necessary plant, and inquiries are being made to see whether it can be obtained from overseas. The production of aluminium at present involves two processes. First, the bauxite goes through what is known as a reduction plant, and, secondly, the resulting alumina goes through the aluminium plant. The second process requires enormoiis supplies of electricity. Gippsland referred to the proposal to establish the industry in Tasmania as ridiculous, and pointed out that electric power is not available there. Although the transmission lines may not have been laid to the proposed site when the decision was made, the potential existed. Hydro-electric power, which is the cheapest kind of electric power, was available. The two governments decided to establish the plant in the vicinity of Launceston, Tasmania, because hydroProm 40,000 tons of electric power could be made available to it within a measurable period of itme. It has been suggested that one plant should be established at Inverell and the other in Tasmania, where cheap power is available. We do not' know whether new discoveries may enable the two processes to be amalgamated, .or whether an entirely new process will be introduced. I understand that the present method of produetion has been in use for a long time. We do not know whether it may eventually be possible to combine thetwo processes to which I have just referred. If the reduction plan were at Inverell or another place where there are deposits of bauxite, it would be necessary to transport the alumina from there to Launceston. It would have to be put into special bags, and carried in special railway trucks and ships. Although it is not impossible to transport alumina, there is no part of the world in which alumina is taken from a reduction plant to an aluminium plant some distance away. The plants are always in close proximity. If alumina is contaminated in any way, the impurity will adversely affect the aluminium that is produced from it. It is essential that the two plants should be i.n close proximity. By utilizing a port; we can receive bauxite from other countries, and thus conserve our own deposits so that they may be used in the event of war. The establishment of the two plants at Launceston would mean that only bauxite would need to be carried there. Bauxite can be transported in any kind of railway truck or steamship, and does not require to be handled in the same way as does alumina. Those are some of the considerations that moved this commission to recommend that both plants The honourable member for should be established at Launceston. While the honourable member for Gippsland was speaking, the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully), referred to the faet that it is now estimated that theve is approximately 20.000.000 tons of bauxite in the vicinity of Inverell. The honourable member for Gippsland said that the commission's experts had to be shown the bauxite deposits in Gippsland. He ridiculed the commission and suggested that its field officers are not experts. If they were not, they would not have been engaged by the commission. I am not an expert geologistI was a geological student-bu t I know bauxite when I member was endeavouring to mislead the House, or he is so hostile to governmental enterprises that he wishes this industry to be handed over to a company which will enter into an agreement with the cartel, as he called it. The field officers of the commission have estimated that there are approximately 5,000,000 tons of bauxite in the Inverell area. At a place called Emmaville, which is not in the immediate vicinity of Inverell but in that general area, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited have extensive leases. In the areas to which the leases apply there are, 14,000,000 or 15,000,000 tons of bauxite of approximately the same alumina content as the deposit at Inverell. What is to happen at Inverell has been left to the Minister for Supply and Development (Senator Armstrong) to decide, and in due course he will advise the local people of his decision. With regard to the statement by the Premier of Tasmania that was published in the press all I can say is that if there is to be any amendment of the agreement that is . contained in the Aluminium Industry Act, it must come before the Parliament, and all honourable members will have an opportunity to say what they want to say about it. Progress reported. Sitting suspended from 5.55 to 8 p.m. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [S.O] I move That the bill be now read a second tinie. Existing immigration law provides for the deportation of an alien who is convicted of a crime of violence against the person or of extorting any money or thing from any resident of the Commonwealth by force or threat, or of any attempt to commit such a crime, or who is convicted of any other criminal offence for which he is sentenced to imprisonment for one year or longer. Admittedly, these power? are fairly wide and at first glance would see it. Either the honourable seem sufficient to cope with aliens who are proved undesirables. Unfortunately, in practice this has not been the case. In the first place, before an alien can be deported undeithis provision, an order for deportation must be signed by the Minister for Immigration upon the expiration of, or during the term of imprisonment imposed on the alien. In a number of instances my department ha received notification of the conviction after an alien has been released from gaol and it is then too late to effect his deportation. It has also been found that some aliens have been convicted on a number of occasions, clearly showing that they are undesirables, but none of the offences has I understand, approximately been punished by imprisonment for one year or longer and, accordingly, sucb aliens have not been brought within the scope of the act. Lastly, and most importantly, the Commonwealth's immigration power is limited by tbe Constitution. The Immigration Act does not place any limitation on the time when action may be taken for deportation on the grounds I have previously mentioned, but the High Court has ruled that the immigration power does not authorize the I'arliament to legislate with respect to persons, who, having emigrated to Australia, have made their permanent homes here and so have become members of the Australian community. Incidentally, it was t.he decision of the High Court in the case of Walsh ancl Johanson whicli established that fact. The Commonwealth also has power under the Constitution to legislate in respect of aliens resident in Australia and this power is not limited in respect, to time, as is the immigration power. By making use of this power the Government will be able to take effective action in regard to those aliens whose character and conduct are such that they should not be allowed to continue to reside here, but whose deportation cannot be effected at present because of the limitations upon the Commonwealth immigration powers.",43,Estimates 1948 49 Auditions New Wobks And Otheb Services Involving Capital Expen Diture

Therefore, the DeUndoubtedly we shall be partment of Works and Housing should proceed at once to construct an emersatisfactory gency landing ground at Bilinga, which is not subject to fog, and, being situated on the coast, is more likely to be free of the people's money from dust clouds than the Archerfield We should be told precisely and Eagle Farm airfields. I should like I the Minister to explain whether he profor poses to proceed with that urgent work whether at Bilinga. If his department is unable include provision for to do the work, he should allow the local a't the 'aerodrome at authorities in the area to undertake it. in QueensMany local authorities employ engineers, T have pressed for (his work and possess up-to-date equipment required for the job. I believe -that the 'local authorities would make their plant. equipment und employees available for 3uch urgent work. If the municipalities have not adequate machinery for the purpose, they can probably arrange, on this occasion as they haA'e done on previous occasions, to borrow the equipment from the Department of Main Boads. Incidentally, the authority will probably be prepared to undertake an urgent work such as the construction of an emergency airfield, which might be the means of saving many lives. The site of the Bilinga aerodrome Was examined some years ago after the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) had been involved in an accident. He was travelling to Queensland in a passenger aircraft, which was unable to locate the Archerfield aerodrome. After the plane had circled for a considerable time, alarge number of motor cars were assembled around the racecourse near Beaudesert, and the aircraft came in to land. As it was about to touch down, it struck a fence and overturned, and the right honourable member for North Sydney broke his collarbone. Being a Minister of the Crown at that time, he became interested in the provision of emergency landing grounds, and caused'inquiries to be made into the construction of such a field near Brisbane. Experts made a careful examination of Greater Brisbane and surrounding areas, aud the Northern Bivers district of New South Wales, and finally selected Bilinga, which is situated on the south coast of Queensland, near Coolangatta, as the most suitable site for an emergency landing ground in the vicinity of Brisbane. Some time ago, the government of the day made provision for the construction of a landing ground at Bilinga for use in an emergency by aircraft such as the D.C.3, carrying between twenty and thirty passengers. The hazards of flying, which I have already described, should prompt rhe Minister to treat this public work as urgent. Apparently, the plans and Specifications have been prepared, because the type of work proposed was described in the letter which the Minister wrote to me on the 9th June last. Another reason why this airfield should be constructed without delay is that it will be extensively used by aircraft from the southern States carrying holiday makers to and from the seaside resorts on the south coast of Queensland. No other seaside resorts in Australia are comparable with them. Because of the unsatisfactory railway services, for which this Government cannot be held responsible, the journey from Brisbane to the seaside takes longer than a flight from Sydney to Brisbane. Australia should endeavour to develop the tourist trade. Canada has recognized the importance of encouraging tourist traffic, which now yields to the dominion an income of £300,000,000 a year. We can improve our tourist resorts by providing aerodromes adjacent to them. I do not contend that the necessity to encourage the tourist trade is the principal reason for providing a suitable, airfield at Bilinga. As I have stated, this emergency landing ground is required for aircraft which, because of unfavorable weather conditions, are unable to land at Brisbane and, therefore, are forced to return to Sydney. I hope that the Minister will give me an assurance that the work will be undertaken without delay. If his department is unable to cope with it, he should authorize the municipalities in thc area or the Department of Main Boads to do the job. Becently, I asked the Minister for the[nterior ( Mr Johnson) a question about the loss of certain absentee votes in the Moreton electorate during -the last referendum. By an extraordinary circumstancethe honourable member is not frightened to mention the last referendum. ber for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) always blushes when that referendum is mentioned, because the people so overwhelmingly rejected the Government's proposals.

161,Mr Fbancis,"The honourable memReturning Officer for Moreton has his head-quarters at Ipswich in a tiny, poky building vvhich is unworthy of any Commonwealth department. A considerable time ago, I invited the Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland to visit Ipswich, and showed him the deplorable conditions under which men and women are required to work in that office. I'jiiter, I prevailed upon the then Minisaccordance with the practice in existence ter for the Interior, Senator Collings, to inspect the accommodation. quently, a very minor alteration of the premises was made, which provided a little more accommodation, but I am satisfied that if some absentee votes went ;i stray, the Government must be held responsible, because it has provided such hopeless quarters for the electoral staff. 1! urge the Minister for Works and Housing, who controls the construction of new buildings, to discuss this matter with the Australia, and as usual, his contribution Minister for the Interior with a view to remedying the position. I hoped that the Estimates now under consideration would contain provision for the erection of a new huilding. At Ipswich, several Commonwealth departments, including the Department of Labour and National Service, are housed in an old, dilapidated structure. It is time the Government showed some interest in Commonwealth departments in Queensland, and made an effort to provide better structures than the temporary quarters in which staffs were accommodated during the war. The Divisional Returning Officer and his staff of six persons are huddled in a building which is as poky as a stall or stable. Accommodation of that kind is a reflection on the Government. A private employer is required to provide a certain floor area and cubic air space for each employee, and his offices or factory must comply with the provisions of the Shops and Factories Act. But I am certain that the accommodation provided for the Divisional Beturning Officer and his staff at Ipswich does not comply with the requirements of any act similar to the Shops and Factories Act that has been in operation since the days of Methuselah. I urge the Minister to examine the as did the last pre-war government. In form in which the Estimates for new recent months, because of the activity of works were presented to the Parliament the Minister for Immigration ( Mr before 1939. When he does so, he will Ur.

The honourable member stated that the Department of Works and Housing should be re-organized, and that I , a* Minister, should put some ginger into ite activities. He recalled that before the outbreak of war, the estimates for new works were accompanied by a detailed statement of the proposals. I remind the honourable member that before the '-outbreak of war, when the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) was Treasurer, the works programme, including all defence works and services, did not exceed £3,000,000. Although there has been keen competition for labour and materials, we succeeded in doing £9,000,000 worth of work last year. In 1938-39, there was a reservoir of 300,000 unemployed, yet only £3,000,000 worth of work was done in the year. Had we had such a reservoir of labour to call upon, we would have been able to do more than £9,000,000 worth of work. I do not claim that because we expended £9,000,000 as against £3,000,000 expended by a previous government, we did three times as much work. Costs have risen in the meantime, but only by about 45 per cent. Allowing for this increase, it is clear that the present Government has succeeded in doing more than twice as much work",48,Estimates 1948 49 Services Involvi Ng Capitalexpe N Diture

It is engaged on construction projects as far north as Manus Island, and as far south as Tasmania. Many of the air strips laid down during the war have to be resealed, and some of them have to be extended so as to accommodate the latest types of aircraft. We have embarked upon a programme of aerodrome construction associated with the defence of north-western Australia, an area which, before the war, was quite undefended. Only the shortage of labour and certain materials is preventing us from doing even more, although the position in regard to materials is better than it was. An amount of £2,000,000 has been provided for the improvement of aerodromes and the construction of buildings for civil aviation. I ask honourable members to compare that amount with the amount of £3,000,000 expended before the war on Army, Navy, Air Force and civil projects combined. Such a comparison shows what a complete humbug the honourable member for Moreton( Mr ""rancis) is. to be expending £300,000,000. ber says that we ought to be expending £300,000,000; yet only the other day he was crying to high heaven that taxation should be reduced. Apparently, in his opinion, all public works ought to be financed out of loan money, so that, instead of paying our way as we go, we would hand on the obligation to our children and our children's children. The honourable member for Moreton also said tliat we should avail ourselves of the assistance of municipalities in carrying cut public works. He claimed that local bodies were looking for work, a statement, which indicates clearly that he knows very little about the matter. If construction plant is available, we are always anxious to hire it to the municipalities, or to State governments if they want i i . For instance, the work of laying some miles of pipeline from Port Augusta to the rocket range has been let to the Public Works Department of South Australia. It is proposed to expend £11,000,000 on the reconstruction of the Mascot aerodrome, and on the construction of a seaplane base. Much of the earth-shifting work will be done by the Publio Works Department of New South Wales, although the project as a. whole is the responsibility of my department. It is our policy to employ to the fullest extent possible any governmental or semi governmental body which can assist nt. but many of the municipalities are not able to cope even with their own work. When my department, had control of the allocation of large track-type tractors, many honourable members wrote to me on behalf of municipal councils seeking the purchase of road-making plant. They said that plant belonging to the municipalities had been taken over by the Allied Works Council, with the resull that roads had fallen into disrepair, and people in the outback could not get their produce to market. Now, the honourable member for Moreton gets up and waves his hands about and says that the municipalities have a lot of road-making plant lying idle which tbey are anxious to employ. His last glorious effort was to declare that my department should build some houses at Ipswich, ancl complete the Commonwealth offices in Brisbane. That sounds as if an election is due. Not long ago, when I introduced an amendment to the War Service Homes Act, the honourable member for Moreton said that the construction of war service homes was so urgent that my department should concentrate upon that work to the exclusion of everything else. Then, before the cock has crowed three times, he gets up and says that we should erect Commonwealth offices in Brisbane. It is evident that the honourable member does not know what work is being done in Australia at the present time.

The Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr that State. The honourable member said Harrison) also made some interesting criticisms. He saidHow can Australia hope for trade agreements if we enter into the production of an already surplus commodity ? Se spoke later in the debate in the same strain, and used the following words:The Government, which has heavy comm.itments in the conduct of the war, for social services and in post-war planning, cannot afford to waste money. It has no right to waste £1,500,000 of the taxpayers' money in a venture of this nature. Those are the speeches that were made when the Government was introducing the legislation to establish the aluminium industry in Australia. We made it abundantly clear at the time that we were investigating the position and that we were not going to rush into this venture. We had to seek information from all parts of the world, and, in many instances, did not obtain it until comparatively recently. The honourable member for Gippsland is pushing for an industry in his own State. Before the bill was introduced, no investigation was made into bauxite resources in this country. The only thing we knew about it at the time was that there was some in New South Wales, that there were small but rich deposits in Gippsland, in the Hughes Valley and along the east coast of Tasmania. We did not fully investigate the quantity or quality of the deposits. We knew vaguely about the Enverell scheme, and the existence of high-class bauxite other parts of the world. the Canadian and American aluminium works obtain their bauxite from great distances across the water. I am not impressed by the argument advanced by the honourable member for Gippsland that a Dr. Gaha. ' factory on the banks of the Tamar Rivetwould be more vulnerable than one at know a great deal about military strategy. I believe that unless factories are 'built underground, the relative safety of sites is immaterial. I believe that the AusHe said that tralian Aluminium Production Comniission is doing a good job. The honourable member derated Tasmania thiafternoon and we, the representatives of Tasmania, must protect the interests of that we did not have available the hydroelectric power that is essential for the manufacture of aluminium. I can assure honourable members that the Butler's Gorge electricity scheme will be ready to operate when it is required for the manufacture of aluminium. We have to produce direct current for this venture, not alternating current. The project is all ready to go ahead. Would it be sane for the Government to go ahead with a £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 project until it was certain where and when the plant was to be established? Of course not. That would not be good government business. Now that the site on the banks of the Tamar River has been decided upon, we can, with confidence, plan for the generation of the necessary kind of electricity by means of a hydro scheme. This matter has been _ thrashed out on many occasions in the past. There is a lot of State jealousy in regard to this matter. My friend laid emphasis upon the fact this afternoon that an overseas company, possibly a combine, was trying to secure a big interest in this venture. What does that signify? It signifies not, as was said by the Opposition at the time that we were trying to get the bill through the Parliament, that the aluminium industry was no good, but that there must be great merit in it. That is clear and unmistakable. Otherwise the overseas organization would not be interested in it. Rather than condemn the whole project, on the basis that prideposits in vate industry is trying to secure an Even interest in it, I think that the Government should be urged to proceed with the attempt to develop the aluminium industry in this country. I believe that the private concern that has been inquiring into this matter visualizes a market for probably double the output -if aluminium that was contemplated by tiie Government at the time the bill was introduced. I maintain that the Tasmanian Government has acted wisely by awaiting the recommendations of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission as to where the plant should be located and when it should begin to operate. I believe that the commission was wise to investigate where the best deposits of bauxite are in Australia and what the best methods of manufacturing aluminium are. Al thought there has been a delay of four years, at the end of that period there is not the glut of this metal that existed at the time the bill was introduced. All the indications are that the necessity for the establishment of an aluminium industry in Australia, is greater than ever before. Hecause it has not yet been decided from where the bauxite is to be obtained, it -loes not follow that bauxite cannot be mined in Australia. Hydro-electric power required for this project will be made available to the commission by the Tasmanian Government when it is ready i""> go into production. I a.m interested in the establishment of .in aluminium industry and the special ii ppropriation of £450,000 that is proposed in respect of it. Much has been said fibout this industry to-day. What disturbs me greatly is the fact that the Government isinviting tenders from Malaya for the supply of 50,000 long tons of metallurgical bauxite each year for a period of from five to ten years. The =peech of the Minister for the Navy( Mr bauxite, the raw material; secondly, the Riordan) and the interpolations of the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) force me to the conclusion that the Government is considering the possibility of not fully establishing this industry. Certain statements which have been made by the Prime Minister, who .<aid he had discussed this matter in Great Britain, and by the Premier of Tasmania lend support to this fear. It is well to remember that in 1941 gation of and research into the bauxite the Menzies Government laid the foundaresources of this country, the chemical tions for the establishment of an and electrolytic processes, and the plant aluminium industry in Australia. The required. From the outset, therefore, it purpose was to secure our supplies of was the intention of the Government, as aluminium in the event of war. It if important that we should have availahle adequate supplies of aluminium produced by an industry established in Australia, yet to-day we see the spectacle of thc Governnient making arrangements to obtain supplies of essential raw material from overseas for a period of from five to ten. years. The Government should explain why that i9 being done. We were told by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that ample supplies of bauxite are available in this country. As1 understood the Minister for the Navy, one of the reasons for seeking bauxite from, overseas is that thiquality offcheore that could be obtained from that source is much higher than that of Australian ore. Another reason that he advanced was that the Government wishes to conserve the bauxite resources of Australia against possible demands upon it in the future. An examination of those reasons will reveal that they are very flimsy. BeforeI examine them, it may be worthwhile to refer to the two reports that have been made by the Australian Aluminium Production Cornmission. The first one is dated the 9th September, 1946. In it the commission admits that the Menzies Government approved of the basic plan for the establishment of the industry, but says that many matters remained to be settled and that it was not until 1944 that the administrative arrangements were made and the negotiations witb the Government of Tasmania were concluded. The problem that faced the Government and the commission was a three-fold one. It concerned, first, the availability of chemical treatment of the bauxite to produce alumina; and thirdly, the electrolytic process necessary to produce the metal. Those three matters were considered by the commission. The purpose was to deal with each of them in this country so that ultimately we might produce the quantities of aluminium that we require. The first report dealt with the investi-",52,Chairman Mr It Aerodrome And Consequently There Is

Fortunately, however, as the result of the efforts of .the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell), we may be able to accomplish very much more in the future that we have done in the past. We have nothing for which to apologize in that respect. The Department of Works and Housing has charge of works for the Department of Civil Aviation estimated to cost £7,176,000. I do not think that any one will say that that is not an extensive programme. Honourable members ask for the establishment of aerodromes here and there and complain that established aerodromes are not of sufficient size to meet requirements.

180,Mr Drakeford,"That is largelybe granted. If all tbese requests were granted we sbould probably end up by having aerodromes all over tihe country, each of them having to be manned and provided with radio facilities. The provision cf aerodromes on such a grandiose scale cannot be justified at the present stage of aviation in this country. I am not prepared to consider favourably requests for the provision of bigger aerodromes to cater for aircraft of the larger type when the population of the surrounding districts and the air traffic to be served do not warrant the use of such aircraft. Many factors have to be considered before decisions on matters of this kind can be reached. [ trust that honourable members opposite will view this problem in a statesmanlike way and not adopt a parochial view. The honourable member for Moreton wants what he calls an emergency aerodrome established somewhere in his electorate. The name of the place he mentioned is quite unknown to me. Minister's letter to me on the subject. ably indicated only that the honourable member's examined and that I would what I could to help him. If it be found that by comparison with other works the provision of such an aerodrome is not so urgent, the honourable member will have to rest content with thnt. However, I do not blame him for pushing the claims of his own electors. The honourable member for Balaclava » Mr White) in a brief speech was good fiioi-gh to say that he thought that the Department of Civil Aviation was attempting to provide the necessary facilities for safe flying, particularly air navigation aids. are somewhat out of date. programme which I have announced will give some satisfaction to the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) and the honourable member for Balaclava. Tbe outstanding commitments of the department amount to £4,587,000. The amount authorized for 194S-49 is £2,588.000, making a total of £7,175,000. The estimated expenditure for this year for works under the control of the Department of Works and Housing, principally comprising aerodrome buildings and housing for employees, is £2,000,000. If we are able to expend that amouni during the current financial year we shall have made a considerable advance. 1 do not propose to give precise details. Since the honourable member for Moreton has pressed for information relative to the proposals of the department in Queensland, I can tell the honourable member that of the £7,000,000 programme an amount of £S23,000 will be expended in that State. In New South Wales, the proposed expenditure is £2,900,000. We hope to complete a very large programme of works during the current financial year. As to the amount of money to be expended on the piovision of radio aids, I repeat what I have said on many occasions in answer to questions in this chamber, that while we do uot claim to be infallible, it is generally admitted by experts who have had an opportunity to compare conditions in Australia with those overseas that we are well advanced in the provision of radio and other air navigation aids. We shall continue to request would be advance until we are on a level with the do most advanced country in that respect. Whilst the Department of Works and Housing executes major works in the nature of buildings and aerodrome construction jobs for the Department of Civil Aviation, the latter executes minor works of the same nature, mostly in the more remote localities. As an example of how a good deal of money may be saved, the outstanding commitments include £7,500 for the installation, at locations to be selected, of 50 anemometers being purchased through the Meteorological Branch. These instruments provide accurate wind data which will save very considerable expenditure on runways and landing strips. This was amply demonstrated at Cairns, where such an instrument had been installed for several years when it became necessary to reconstruct the runways and widen the landing strips there. The precise wind data, which would not otherwise have been available, enabled two landing strips to be omitted from the reconstruction programme, which resulted in a saving of",57,Chairman Mr It Aerodrome And Consequently There Is

Consequently, honourable members will recognize that every endeavour is being made to improve safety measures. If the system is capable of improvement in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization's standards -or any other standards, I , as Minister, believe that we should adopt the improvements in every instance. The distance measuring beacons which will be installed will be manufactured in Australia, and I do not expect that it will be necessary for us to go outside the sterling area in order to obtain any components for manufacture or installation. The programme provides for instrument landing systems at thirteen locations at an estimated cost of £455,000. Unfortunately, we shall be able to expend only a limited amount in the current financial year, but the expenditure has heen planned and the work will proceed. These locations have been chosen on two criteria. The first consideration has been given to international gateways, where installations have been recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization and where they are necessary because of the extreme desirability, if not necessity, to ensure that aircraft at the terminal stages of long trans-ocean flights may be assured of being able to land even under greatly deteriorated conditions and low-ceiling visibility. At other locations, the calculation has been made on the basis of the losses, including petrol consumption and decreased aircraft usability factors which occur when aerodromes are closed due to weather conditions involving diversion of aircraft to alternate landing grounds. Provision has also been made for airport control radar at the busier airports on the east coast. I come now to the subject of airport lighting and power supply. The remarks of honourable members during this debate could have been actuated by their desire to make our airway system better than it is, and to provide the best possible facilities. That is the spirit in which [ accept the criticism that has been offered, but I give an assurance that a trood job has been done in Australia. doing a better job. should never negleet an opportunity to improve the system. I appreciate the remarks by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), who indicated that he considered that we are doing a fairly good job in that direction. provement. contest that statement for it moment. We are trying, by every means in our power, to improve the system. I regard it as my duty, as Minister, and as the duty of the department, to adopt improvements wherever possible. I shall now give the number of aerodromes in in each State. The figures are as follows:-Queensland , 110: New South Wales, 88; Victoria, 25; South Australia, 39; Western Australia, 111; and Tasmania, 9. There are also 45 aerodromes in the Northern Territory, The large number of aerodromes in Queensland is easily accounted for because of the huge dimensions of that State, whilst the small number in Victoria is understandable because of its comparatively small area. Considerable work is being undertaken in Tasmania because air traffic across Bass Strait is probably greater than air traffic between any other two States. When considered on a population basis, the air traffic between the mainland and Tasmania must be considerably greater tlian it is between any other two States. Tasmania is situated in a weather zone where fog and cloud conditions are more likely to occur than in the northern areas of Australia. Therefore, we must construct alternative aerodromes. Such a landing field is being built at Pardoe, near Burnie. We have already expended a considerable sum of money at Wynyard, and we shall undertake the construction of a new aerodrome at Llanherne, near Hobart. In addition, we have expended a large sum of money on the construction of a concrete runway at Launceston. That will not be the last of the expenditure by the Department of Civil Aviation in Tasmania, any more than the present, estimates will provide for the final expenditure in other States.

There is another aerodrome at Evans Head which used to be a Royal Australian Air Force aerodrome. The honourable member for Moreton uomplained that the number of airports is insufficient, and urged the construction of an aerodrome at Belinga, south of Brisbane for emergency purposes. Let us examinine the facilities on the route. The village to which he referred may be important in his view, and it may be desirable to provide aerodromes at such places, but the Government cannot construct aerodromes in a locality just be-tause it happens to be within the constituency of a particular honourable member. The department cannot work on ihat basis. The aerodrome at Narromine is capable of taking planes engaged on international services including Constellations and D.C.4's. There is another aerodrome at Dubbo. England district? member for New England, apparently, wants the Government to build aerodromes every 50 miles. Despite his capable advocacy, T am not prepared to yield to pressure of that kind. There are several aerodromes in that .particular area although, perhaps, they are a little far apart. The honourable member himself has mentioned some of them. His '-omplaint is that they are not big enough ro take planes of the size he desires. They are big enough to provide the kind of --ervice most suitable to the particular locality. I assure the honourable member ' bat thc department intends to develop all existing aerodromes where the traffic warrants extensions being made. Under that programme priority will he given to the extension of aerodromes where extension-! the opportunity to speak at this juncture, because I believe that I should give to honourable members full particulars with respect to navigational and safety aids in order to allay any misgivings that the department is not doing its utmost in tha' respect. Up to date, the department has done an excellent job. Within the department we have experts who understand our requirements. I know from my personal experience overseas and from contacts I have made with people interested in civil aviation, who are kept abreast of what Australia is doing through the medium of civil aviation reports, that Australia has done a wonderful job in this respect. In saying that I am not egotistical. Most of our developmental work was accomplished during the war years, when aerodromes were constructed primarily in strategic localities. Admittedly, under present conditions, some of those aerodromes may not be as valuable as we should like our aerodromes to be. However, the capital cities are well catered for with aerodromes. In Western Australia there are aerodromes at Guildford and Maylands. In Tasmania, there are aerodromes at Launceston and Cambridge and there is another to be built at Llanherne which when completed will meet requirements, whilst the aerodrome at Wynyard is already ver\ good. We are also constructing an aeroNew drome at Pardoe, near Burnie. At Sydney the aerodrome at Mascot is being developed, and in that metropolitan area there are aerodromes at Bankstown. Schofields and Bichmond, any of which can be used should any difficulty arise at Mascot. At Brisbane, there are aerodromes at Eagle Farm and Archerfield. They are a little too .close together, but should service difficulties arise on the Sydney-Brisban e route there are twc> other aerodromes capable of taking D.C.3's. In addition, there are aerodromes at Maryborough, Bundaberg and Rockhampton as well as at Lowood. 1 am not too happy about the aerodrome at Parafield, Adelaide. However, it i> useful and is taking D.C.4's at present. A new aerodrome is undeiconstruction at West Beach.

I am always suspicious of trust accounts.

Opposition, in general, has been opposed to the Government's ship-building project, but I suggest that the Government might well engage in the construction of mallow-draft vessels for the navigation of our rivers in the north of Australia. Beyond that, I do not support Government ship-building. The Estimates provide money for expenditure on aero-communications and navigation facilities. This is the most important section of the Estimates. On Monday next, in Melbourne, there will commence the biennial conference of the Australian Institute of Surveyors, and I have been invited to attend. I am a member of the Institute of Surveyors of S""e\v South Wales, and also of the Queensland institute, and it has been proposed that I should attend the conference as a delegate. However, the president of the Victorian Institute has invited me to be present as a guest. One of the subjects to be discussed is a geodetic survey of Australia. Little work of this kind has bcen done in Anstralia comparable with the famous American undertaking known as the Geodetic Coast SurveySimilar India and Britain. I nronose, during the discussions which will follow the conference, to suggest that representatives of the institute should wait upon the Government with a request that a geodetic survey of Australia be undertaken. I Jfr. Main. recognize that the survey section of the Army h:is done some remarkably good work but, naturally, the Army has concentrated on surveys for strategic purposes. Usually, money for this work is voted when war is imminent. At the conclusion of the last war, I discussed thi subject with senior officers at Victoritt Barracks, in Sydney, who expressed the hope that the Government would maintain a staif of 500 to carry on the work in Australia, and in the islands to the north. The completion of such a work has been delayed too long, and we lag far behind other civilized countries. When the geodetic survey is completed, not only will every physical feature of the continent altitudes of all the main mountain peaks. I am preparing members now for the recommendations which will be forwarded The to them from the conference of the Australian Institute of Surveyors. conduct the survey? tinuous in our time. Money is provided in the Estimates for the acquisition of sites and buildings, and in this connection I desire to draw attention to the mistake which has been made in the reconstruction of the aerodrome at Borroloola. Through the Postmaster General (Senator Cameron), I was able to have nioney voted for the repair of this aerodrome, which is at an isolated spot on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Instead of expending the money on improving the old site, the department's official crossed a rough creek, went about 3 miles farther and located the new site in a sand dump. Eor that purpose a special float had to be used to haul materials from Darwin, and because of the condition of the road approximately £1,000 damage was done to tyres. Later an additional sum of from £5,000 to £10,000 was expended on the construction of the aerodrome which surveys have been made of is useless now. Had that money been expended on the extension of the aerodrome at the old site, it. could now have been used for large aircraft.

I hope to have time to deal with that matter, because I desire to impress upon the Government the necessity for providing adequate truck services. I admit that the Postmaster-General's Department is doing a good job in subsidising Connellan Airways Limited, avhich is at present carrying mail through the. north of Australia. However, the persons for whom I am speaking reside beyond the Finke Biver and at places as far remote as Borroloola and Arltunga,. Wave Hill, Tanami, and the mica fields. Many of the people are married and have children to rear, and they are anxious to obtain fresh fruit and other necessaries for them. Obviously, they cannot afford to purchase fresh fruit carried by tlie airline, on which the freight of 9d. per lb. Chifley), who recently directed Austrahas to be paid. Therefore, I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster General to take action to re-establish the truck, mail service on at least a monthly basis, as formerly, for places which lie to the east and west of the bitumen road «nd outlying areas of the territory. I return now to discussion of the production of aluminium, in respect of which certain estimates of expenditure have been made which appear at page 419 of the Estimates. A great deal has been said in regard to the matter by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr sent to examine bauxite deposits in Bowden) the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr at night; it is.too dangerous "". He went Duthie). However, I do not propose to discuss technical details of the production of aluminium because I am not qualified to do so. My principal knowledge, of the production of aluminium is that which I retain from the study of chemistry .which I made in my schooldays. aluminium, was the hardest of all metals toseparate from the oxide, and I ; believe that' it is only in com( Mr Lazzarini) -.Order! The honorparatively recent times that it has been able member must return to the. discuspossible to extractthe aluminium sion of the Estimates from the aluminium oxide which is knowm as bauxite. AJI electrical, furnace TJnder is required to accomplish the extraction. An interesting example of. the use to which aluminium has been put is to be found in the operations which were carried on at the former great Fingal mine, near Cuein Western Australia. A sheet of aluminium waserected facing the sun at an angle of 42 degrees and "" hard"" watei and anhydrous solutions containing, salts were pumped across the sheet, and because of the gases that arose from the solution when contact was made with the aluminium much of the saline content was deposited. That had the effect of softening the "" hard"" water, so that ir could be used in the boilers of mini engines. It is well known that during the war an alloy known as duralium was produced and used extensively in the production of aircraft. I must express my very great surpris* at the action of the Prime Minister( Mr lian geologists to visit Malaya for the purpose of examining bauxite deposits in that country. After listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Warringah, and bearing, in mind the deposits of bauxite in this country, one wonderswhy he should have adopted the American policy of going outside our own country to obtain bauxite tb producealuminium..

Estimates for the development of Darwin, and I should like the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) to be present while I discuss that matter.

But what are the silly people Lemmon), who is under the control of the silly planners in Collins-street, Melbourne, to take heed of my comments. I have with me a treatise on the Greater TiOndon plan prepared by the eminent ti uthority, Abercrombie, who is now visiting this country and whom the Government entertained a. few days ago. Incidentally, although I am the only member of the Parliament who is trained in town planning and might have been able to converse with Sir Patrick Abercrombie in his own language, the Government did not invite me to meet him. I urge the Minister for Works and Housing to read the report on the olans for Greater London If he does so he will discover rhe extent to which his leg has been pulled by the architectural planners in Melbourne. Last Aveek the Minister invited me to name the gentleman to whom I am now referring, and although I deelined to do so at that time, I now tell the committee that his name is Jack Walker "">n went to Darwin and made a mess of the Molnnes plan. The chief activity of Mr Walker during the war, apart from spending government money on various architectural projects, was to criticize the conduct of military operations in New Guinea. I believe that as a member of the Australian-Soviet Friendship Union he was also responsible for collecting funds for the erection of a building for that body in Flinders-lane, Melbourne, which is the "" Marx House"" of Melbourne.

We should not allow Darwin to be treated in the manner suggested in the Government's wretched plan. The correct principles of town-planning have been violated. Provision has been made in the Estimates for an appropriation of £3,400 for buildings, works and sites for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. 1"" shall refer to the establishment of a reI urge the Minister not to make any search station at Katherine River, concerning which I have sent a lengthy letter to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. ( Mr Dedman). I congratulate the Government on establishing that research station. However, I draw attention to the fact that we have to wait too long for results of experiments conducted there to be announced. I discussed this matter on the spot, a few weeks ago, prior to the Minister's visit to Alice Springs. The officers there were rightly uot allowed to give me any information. They are essentially research officers, who should present their reports to the Minister. But there should not be undue delay in publishing their findings. Great strides have been made at Katherine River with investigations concering cotton growing. It would be helpful to people in that area if the Minister could hasten the release of reports by the research offices concerning rhe three main crops which are suitable for development there in the monsoonal -eason. when the rainfall aggregates about 40 inches. T refer to cotton, tobacco and sorghum. I went to a lot of trouble to investigate the scheme that is being sponsored in Queensland to provide food for Britain, but I shall reserve my comment on it for a later stage. i ry party opposes that scheme. that connection but I support the project. proposed appropriation of £50,000 for ihe construction, of a permanent building for the Australian National University. The architectural design of the proposed building is of intense interest to me, as it should be to every other honourable member. WhilstI have only a superficial knowledge of the architectural orders, I have studied the progress made in that science from Egyptian to the Byzantine times, and also the later DorkOrder, and later still the introduction of the Ionic and Corinthian Orders. I have traced the transition from the Gothic Order to the flambuoyant style, emerging, finally, into the architecture of the period of the Renaissance, and thence, as Buskin aptly described it. into ""filthy commercial architecture"". decision in this matter until it has been debated fully in the Parliament. The Minister has not yet announced whether a competition will be held. University Commission, the University of Melbourne was asked to prepare designs. They have since been prepared, under the direction of Professor Lewis, who is Professor of Architecture at the University of Melbourne. will the Minister say whether the new university is to be built in the Doric style of architecture? Probably it will not be, because I visualize this university as depicting something flambuoyani rather than basic. Proposed appropriations for public health facilities in the outlying areas of Australia, particularly in the electorate of the Northern Territory that I represent, are mentioned on page 427 of the Estimates. The matter of the shortage of medical personnel at Darwin is disturbing to the people there, because they are entitled to be provided with amenities of life comparable with those in southern areas. Doctors who have gone there have left witliin a month because adequate housing has not been provided for them. Notwithstanding that I am trying to get a workers' home scheme going at Darwin for people who are not on the public payroll, I think a doctor should have priority I shall refer now to the in the matter of housing.

A dentist named Mr Turnbull is in practice at Alice Springs and is carrying on with only one mechanic. He has urged me to try to arrange for the erection of a clinic there, and also to have an extra dentist appointed. I have approached the Minister for Health on this matter. I understand that this week or next week an extra dentist will be appointed, and facilities are to be provided for another mechanic. I was pleased to hear that the,Minister has promised that a suitable clinic will be built for the denis essential to the manufacture of bauxite tal officers there as soon as possible. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN"". -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. of the Executive Council) [10.20] I am indebted to the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) for his speech about the aluminium industry. I was not privileged to hear his opening remarks, but I ""was greatly interested in his comments on the visit made by a parliamentary party to Inverell. I am not in complete agreement with the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Douglas Mather has been active in pressSpender), but I endorse his remarks in the main. The development of the aluminium industry in Australia is of the utmost importance. The most substantial known deposits of bauxite in this continent are located in the Inverell district in the electorate which I represent. I do not decry the value of other Australian deposits, nor do I criticize the plans for the establishment of aluminium manufacturing plant in Tasmania. One of the outstanding requirements of supply of hydro-electric power, and no other ""part of Australia yethas a power system comparable with that of Tasmania. However, there are potential sources of hydro-electric power on the mainland, and one of the most important of these is in the Inverell district not far from the 'bauxite deposits. I refer to the Nymboida scheme on-the Upper Clarence River, -which is the greatest yet planned on the mainland. Nymboida is only a short distance by direct line from the bauxite ""deposits. :F.urthermore, adjacent to those deposits is an almost unlimited supply of coal. Geologists told members of the parliamentary party that at Ashford there are vast coal deposits, the size of which cannot yet be reliably estimated. They could supply the needs of the aluminium industry and all other requirements of the area for hundreds of years to come. Some geologists contend that they are -part of a great coal seam extending from Maitland to Queensland. Many hundreds of thousands of tons of that coal could be won economically by open cut methods. Furthermore, countless millions of tons of limestone, which into aluminium, can be obtained in the district. All the natural ingredients of the aluminium industry are at hand. One disability is that Inverell is not connected by direct line to a port. However, a survey for a direct line to Iluka has been completed and a survey has also been made for a port there. These are matters of development which depend upon the establishment of the aluminium industry in the Inverell *rrea. With the support of all municipal councils in northern .and north-western New Soutli Wales, Councillor ing the claims of the industry. Its potentialimportance, especially in time of war, is readily recognizable. I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Warringah that the aluminium commission's report is farcial. I am entirely opposed to the proposal that we should purchase our main supplies of bauxite from Malaya. That would not be a reliable source of supply ihe industry is a plentiful and, in the event of war, we should be cut off from it completely. I say advisedly that the suggestion that we should not use local bauxite deposits in order to conserve them for the future is stupid. Beneath the ground in the Inverell district ar<> bauxite deposits representing considerably over 5,000,000 tons of aluminium. Two days a;go I received a letter from Comncilloi' Mather, who had recently visited the Mines '.Department of New South Wales. He informed me of the leases held by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company.Limited.at Emmaville,",66,Chairman Mr It Aerodrome And Consequently There Is
213,Mr Scully (Gwydir,"Vice-Presidentabout which I had not known previously. He told nie that departmental geologists had informed him that there were between 12,000,000 and 14,000,000 tons of high grade bauxite in the area leased hy th<? company. The aluminium content is estimated at 39 per cent., which is about o per cent, above the content disclosed by analysis of the Inverell deposit. Assuming an annual output of 20,000 tons of aluminium, there is sufficient bauxite iu that region to keep the industry going for 300 years without even drawing upon deposits in Gippsland and elsewhere. These facts disclose the stupidity of the aluminium commission's recommendauon that we should support a foreign industry to the detriment of Australian industry. which visited Inverell included New South Wales Ministers and memhers of the State Decentralization Committee. The visitors were unanimous about the great potentialities of the deposits. I do not wish to be harsh in my common ta about the aluminium commission, but I consider that it has failed to explore to r.he full the possibilities of developing the aluminium industry on the mainland. The industry can be developed, and it should be developed as soon as possible, f t would bc entirely wrong .to continue buying supplies from overseas and to neglect our own rich deposits of bauxite. T could never support such a plan. The commission's reports may be good from a technical point of view. As a layman [ cannot express any authoritative opinion upon that aspect of them. However, common sense shows that the commission's scheme is absurd. Cts proposition that local supplies should be preserved for the future is merely ridiculous. We have deposits that we can draw upon for centuries. [ hope that the commission will reexamine its proposal. The Government of New .South Wales is prepared to assist in the construction of a railway line from Inverell to the coast and also the development of the Iluka port for the purpose of the decentralization of what should be and will be a major industry, [t would take some time to establish an alumina plant at In verell. I have been informed by Cr. [«!)] Mather, the chairman of the organization which controls the electricity grid in northern New South Wales, that it is proposed to build an expensive generating plant in the area that will be able to supply all the electricity required by an alumina plant. Any one who is conversant, with New South Wales knows that at Tamworth there is the greatest inland electrical generating plant in the Commonwealth. That is to be hooked up with Inverell within a few months. The industry could use supplies from that source in the early days of its establishment. There is plenty of water, limestone and all the basic materials that are needed. I am not pressing the claims of Inverell in opposition to those of any The parliamentary party other part of Australia. I am merely describing the potentialities of the district. They are all that could be desired. There are deposits of bauxite in other parts of Australia, that are worthy of examination. I say advisedly that, in my opinion, the commission has not paid proper attention to them. It does not appreciate these potentialities. In its reports, the commission has made no reference to the huge bauxite deposits in respect of which leases are held by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, which is one of the most efficient industrial organizations in Australia, and perhaps in the world. If it is sufficiently interested to take up such leases, it must recognize the potentialities of the deposits. Progress reported.

The quantity was about double rlie normal recei val s for a good season. Some stacking sites wliieh would not normally be need had to be used. These were low-lying sites, and they were built up by high dunnage, in some eases to four sleepers height. Despite the high dunnage 27 inches of rain between December and July caused damage. This was increased by second-hand bags not standing up to storage, and by mice and rat infestation. It was necessary to re-bag 8.000 bags of wheat and about 2,000 bags were lost. This loss if covered by insurance.

I am uow able to inform the honourable member as follows:Permission was originally granted prior to the dollar crisis in July-August, 1947, for the importation of these machines for particular users, but this was withdrawn when thc original licences were revoked as a result of tlic Government's decision of the 2Gth November, 1947, which had as its object the curtailment of dollar imports for the 1947-4S financial year. In the case of thc thirteen licences referred to, requests were made early this year for reconsideration of the importation of the machines. These requests were considered individually and, in view Of the element -f hardship in each case brought about by the revocation of the original licence, it was decided to authorize the issue of thirteen new licences for bottle-labelling machines on the condition that importation into Australia would not be effected before the l s t July, I94S. Tin's condition was imposed so that lollar imports for the financial year which ended on the 30th June, could be reduced to the desired level and so tliat tlie dollar mthorization involved in the thirteen licences -ould be brought within the dollar budget licensing scheme for the 1943-49 financial year. follows:(n.) Seven -machines which were ordered from and manufactured in the United States of America to work in conjunction with whicli had been ordered and/or obtained by various users from United Kingdom and Australian manufacturers. ordered from local.and "" S t e r l in g "" sources was considerably greater than the value of the labelling machines ordered from the United States of America. For example, the most expensive bottle-labelling machine was valued at £1,580 c.i.f. and e. or approximately $o,O!)0 c.i.f., whereas the associated Britisli and Australian equipment valued at approximately £8,000. In otlier cases the value was as high as £15,000. (6) One licence covered labelling machines to replace worn out units which were beyond reconditioning. (c) Four licences related to machine which have been specially constructed and electrically equipped for particular requirements of the users for whom they were ordered. (</) One licence was for a machine which had been completed and paid for in the United States of America in Air. CHIFLEY On the 29th September, the honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley) asked whether it would be possible to grant diplomatic cadets who live in Western Australia the right to travel home by air for their Christmas holidays. The question has received the consideration of the Public Service Board, but the board is unable to grant diplomatic cadets more favorable concessions in respect of mode of travel when proceeding on recreation leave than those applicable to other officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. Diplomaticcadets may use air travel when returning to Western Australia on leave, but if this is done, the amount of reimbursement which w ill be made by the Commonwealth shall not exceed the amount by which return rail fare, including sleeperand seats, exceeds £10. ber, the honourable member for Moreton Particulars of the licences are as ( Mr Francis) asked me a question concerning an alleged statement by Mr E.
