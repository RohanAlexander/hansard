ST. MARY'S FILLING FACTORY. tion to the Minister for Defence Production in view of hisanswer to the question about the St. Mary's ammunition filling factory, asked yesterday by the honourable member for Werriwa. I preface the question by stating that, last June, the Minister made his statement about the additional cost of £3,146,000. Yesterday, he stated that, at the end of. December last, he knew that the cost would be substantially increased. I now want to ask the Minister this specinc question: Did he know before 30th June, 1956, that, although the architects were endeavouring to keep the costs down to the estimate of £23,200,000, the contractors had stated quite clearly to the Department of Defence Production and Government authorities that they estimated that the cost would be increased by approximately £3,000,000? the question. First of all, I was not Minister for Defence Production in June, 1956. In any case, I have already told the House that my first knowledge of the increase of the cost above £23,200,000 came at the end of December last year. Dr. EvattI asked about the estimated cost, not the actual cost. first knowledge of the fact that the architects had said that the cost of the project would be more than £23,200,000 came at the end of December last. Dr. EvattI asked the Minister specirepeated assertion that the arguments in fically about the contractors. all of what the contractors may have said. Our information is derived from the archiin the first statement. I made to the House. tects, who are acting for us. They advised I have nothing to add. us at the end of last year that the cost would be increased. The contractors had certainly never advised me one way or the other, because we do not deal with the contractors; Minister noticed recent reports that, at we deal with the architects. Minister for Primary Industry say why tbe shortage of steel fence posts, which are essential to many primary industries, has become more acute ih the last few months? Is anything being done to overcome the shortage? the Department of Primary Industry has been consulting the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited to see whether the manufacture of steel fence posts can be increased. We have been informed that the existing factories are operating at full capacity. The company is increasing its capacity, but the additional plant will not be completed until early next year. Therefore, it does not think that any relief can be-given until then. I should point out to the honourable gentleman that there has been an abnormal demand for steel posts, probably due, first, to the fact that dry conditions this year have enabled primary producers to put in posts throughout the year; and secondly, to the flooding that occurred last year in various parts of South Australia and in other States. We are looking at this matter from day to day to see what can be done. The export position is being watched, and I assure the honourable gentleman that only one-tenth of 1 per cent, of Australian made steel posts is exported. In addition, the import of steel posts is treated in a generous fashion by the Department of Trade. HereI mention that the big difficulty is that imported posts cost much more than locally' produced posts. ST.

' aware of the decision of the State Savings Bank of Victoria to lend up to £4,000 to finding one-third of the cost of the home, the interest charge being 6 per cent, and repayments being approximately £7 a week? Does the Prime Minister know that since the bank made this announcement, hundreds of personal and telephone inquiries have resulted? Will the Prime Minister concede that this rush of applicants reveals a grave housing shortage? Is he aware that it is estimated that there are in Australia 250,000 people who require homes, the majority of whom are young couples who are compelled to live in converted garages, in caravans, and under other undesirable conditions?

It is customary, however, when land is advertised for application in the Territory, for improvement conditions to be stated as a part of the terms of the lease. 1 assume that if this land is in the vicinity of the Goroka air strip it would be advertised for either business or residential purposes, and I do not .think that a condition which required the placing on the land of a structure of a value of £3,000 within the stated period is a very onerous one. to the Minister for Trade. Is it a fact that the trade treaty with Japan was entered into on the understanding that Japan would at least maintain her high imports of Australian wool, and that she would purchase more Australian wheat? Is it also a fact that, according to the Japanese Ministry of Trade, that country expects to cut its wool imports by 30 per cent., and that because of this warning, wool prices have dropped a further 2 i per cent.? Further, is it a fact that, due to drought conditions, there will be little export of Australian wheat?

The arrangement with Japan, in respect of purchases of Australian wool under the treaty, is that, of the total exchange made available by the Japanese Government for the purchase of wool, at least 90 per cent. will be available for the purchase of Australian wool. That is the firm arrangement. It is an arrangement of immense value to Australia, and is recognized as such by all except those hopelessly prejudiced or those who are seeking to gain some political advantage at the cost of inciting bad feeling between these two neighbour countries. to the Minister for Trade and relates to the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. Some time ago, the Minister indicated that a commissioner had been appointed to the new corporation, and it is understood that some administrative arrangements have been brought to an advanced stage. Can the Minister indicate when and where the corporation will, commence its operations? aheady in business, and I think its address is Market-street, Sydney. I will confirm that information for the benefit of tbe honourable member. The corporation has been writing business, in the terms contemplated by the statute, for the last couple of months. On my present information, it has already issued more than £1,000,000 of cover. ST. MARY'S FILLING FACTORY. Mr L. R.

28,Mr Beale,"I invite the honorablehe raised. A t an interdepartmental committee, meeting on 18th October, 1956, the representative of the contractor then and there stated to officers of the Government that he believed the project would be completed on time and for the original estimate. NeitherI nor the officers of the department ever received from the contractor or anybody else any advice to the contrary until December of that year. supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Lawson. It is in respect of seed wheat, not feed wheat. I ask the Minister for Primary Industry whether he will take action to see that adequate supplies of seed wheat will be made available in those districts which are suffering from the severe drought at the present time, and which probably will not produce any wheat at all for next season's sowing. answered the previous question I did not answer it insofar as seed wheat was concerned. On receipt of the resolution of the Australian Wheat Board, the matter was considered by me and the department and immediately a query was raised as to what action was to be taken in connection with seed wheat. Unfortunately, the resolution did not make that point clear. Therefore, we have asked the chairman of the board to make a decision on this matter as soon as possible and to inform us of that decision. I assure the honourable member that this matter is being looked at, and as soon as I get an answer I will let him and the honourable member for Lawson know what it contains. Mr J. R. FRASER I ask the Prime Minister: Does the fact that the Russians have successfully launched a 180-lb. satellite, which has remained in orbit around the earth for two weeks, indicate that the Soviet has gone immeasurably ahead of the Western world in developing a solid fuel for the projection of rockets? If this is not so, would it be correct to state that to launch a 180-lb. satellite with liquid fuel, the Russians would have had to use a 100ton rocket? Will the right honourable gentleman have the results of Australian and other investigations collated in order to present a full statement to the House on the alarming possibilities consequent on the Russian technical development? to answer these highly technical questions, than, I dare say, my friend was yesterday. Therefore, I shall have them looked at by the experts. Minister for Labour and National Service as Minister acting for the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Can the right honourable gentleman say what progress has been made with the introduction of the European rabbit flea as a means of spreading myxomatosis? Has the Minister actually seen those fleas? Are they propagating rapidly throughout Australia? Do they resemble, in their habits, the ordinary flea with which some of us became so familiar during our years of war service, or are they more selective and more predictable in their targets, and happier in their results? one sense, to be able to tell the honourable gentleman that I have not seen, nor come into any personal contact with, the European flea; but, knowing the importance attached to it by our scientists and people engaged in the primary industries who are looking for some effective conveyor of myxomatosis to rabbits in areas where other conductors cannot effectively introduce the disease, I have secured some information from the CSIRO. about the progress we are making with this particular "" animal"". The European rabbit flea apparently is a rather difficult but not unpredictable creature, from the scientist's point of view. It is yet to be ascertained whether it will have harmful effects upon animals other than the rabbit, including Australian native species, and experiments are being conducted into this aspect of tbe matter.

35,Mr Harold Holt,"I should havesuccessful introduction. This work is being carried out in Canberra under what, I am assured, are strict quarantine conditions. There have been occasions, in the last few days, when I have not been so certain as I should like to be that the quarantine is being completely enforced, judging by some events in this chamber. The fleas are being collected in England by an officer of the CSIRO. and, on arrival, they are introduced to captive rabbits in the laboratory. Arrangements have been made for a continued supply of the fleas and attempts, not entirely successful I gather, are being made to breed them in the laboratory. This process, I am informed, is extremely difficult, and attempts by European scientists to breed the fleas under artificial conditions have so far met with failure. Our own scientists seem to be a litde more successful. The fleas in Canberra have followed an expected trend, and are now grouping on the ears of the rabbits, and it can be confidently expected that eggs will be produced in the very near future. i that I now direct to the Minister for Supply will produce a flea in somebody's ear. My question refers to vacancies for employment in the design establishment of the Department of Supply. I have in my hand a letter from the department which was received by a person outside after he had applied for a vacancy which had been advertised. The letter readsIn connection with your recent interview for the position of Fitter's Assistant at this Estabput the matter to the committee that is lishment, I have to advise that the position has now been filled and that your application was not successful. That letter is dated 3rd October, 1957. I also bave here a cutting from the "" Essendon Gazette "". able member's question is based on a newspaper report it is out of order. advertisement inserted by the Department of Supply which conflicts with the letter that the department sent out. I merely want to put the Minister in possession of the facts so that we can get the answer. The"" Essendon Gazette"" of 10th October carried an advertisement for the design establishment of the Department of Supply, stating "" Vacancies exist for recognized tradesmen . .. . also fitters assistants"". First, will the Mimster have an investigation carried out to see that all the original applicants for the positions received a fair chance of getting a job? Secondly, will he find out why the Commonwealth Employment Service is not used for the recruitment of men to these positions? the view that, where it is appropriate, one should investigate matters of employment carefully and sympathetically to see that no disappointment or injustice is suffered by an applicant. I do not know the circumstances of the case mentioned by the honourable member, but I will have it investigated and give the honourable member an explanation. Primary Industry a question. Because of the glut of low-rgrade potatoes on the Sydney market, the price has dropped to a level where the cost of shipping is more than has reduced the price of choice, red soil, Tasmanian Brownell potatoes to a low level. Would it be possible to encourage the use of second-grade potatoes for stock feed, particularly in drought areas? the use of second-grade potatoes for stock feed. It is obviously a very mteresting suggestion, as are so many of the suggestions made by the honourable gentleman. I will dealing with this problem of dry conditions and the need to provide drought feed, and if I get a favorable answer I will let the honourable member know. say when this Parliament may expect the return of the Minister for External Affairs, so that honourable members may have the advantage of any information that be can supply, together with a review of the contentious and very serious implications of present world affairs? date of the Minister's return is the first week of November.",14,European Rabbit Flea

ST. MARY'S FILLING FACTORY. Defence Production: Is it a fact that on the 9th August the honourable member for East Sydney addressed a meeting at the St. Mary's filling factory, which occupied one and three-quarter hours? What was the purpose of the honourable member's meeting? Was it to cement employer-employee relationships?

As to the first question, about a stabilization plan, as the honourable member knows, the initiative in these matters comes from the Australian Dried Vine Fruits Association. That association thought that it would be wise to have the matter thoroughly thrashed out with its constituent organizations and among the growers themselves before it made up its mind as to what further action should be taken. It is implied in what the association has stated that, for the time being, it will not make additional representations to the Government. Mr J. R. FRASER -Does the Minister for the Navy know that the doctor at Jervis Bay is one of the tenants who are required to vacate cottages at Jervis Bay to enable the return of the Naval College to that area? Does the Minister know that the doctor is expected to vacate his cottage at the end of the coming week? Will this leave the civilian community remaining there without the services of a medical practitioner? Can the Minister say when a medical officer from the Navy will be taking over the area and whether the officer will be able to provide medical services for civilians, who include children at the two sehools in the two settlements? Will the Minister do what he can to ensure that this community, which is completely isolated, is provided with a medical practitioner service? question raised by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory is that, some time ago, the doctor to whom he referred applied for an extension of his tenancy to 30th November. He had been instructed to vacate by, I think, 30th September. Such applications are a matter for discussion between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Interior. The latter department is, of course, charged with the task of preparing the area for return to the Navy at the beginning of next year. The attitude of the Department of the Navy has been that any such matters must be determined by the Department knows whether extensions would in its duties. In this particular case I know that an extension was granted to 31st October, and I feel sure, from my knowledge of my colleague's administration, that if he were reasonably satisfied that proper efforts were being made to obtain reasonable accommodation he would be prepared to consider sympathetically the granting of a further extension. That is a matter that I shall discuss with my colleague, who is not present at the moment. The intention of the Department of the Navy is to establish a sick bay, attended constantly by a nursing sister and nurses, at the college itself, and that, for a start at any rate, the medical services will be provided from the air station at Nowra. It is considered that these arrangements will be adequate to deal with all cases that may occur. of the Postmaster-General to the fact that some time ago in this HouseI suggested that the words ""Post Office"" should be preceded by the name of the post office at the entrance to all post offices, official and non-official, throughout Australia, for the convenience of travellers and other persons who do business with the post offices. At that time the Minister was somewhat impressed with the suggestion. Has he made any investigation of the matter, and has he any further information on the subject? honourable member for Mallee made this suggestion to me some considerable time ago. I discussed it with the Postal Department. It is, I think, a very good suggestion.

63,Mr Speaker (Hon. Lohn Mcleay),"viewer and listener as an Australian. When the matter was first raised, during the consideration by this House of the Broadcasting and Television Bill 1956, the Australian Labour party declared, through the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), the necessity to require a specified quota of Australian material to be used. We suggested that 55 per cent, of tbe material used in all programmes sbould be Australian material, in order that Australian actors and other performers, script writers, and others dependent on tbem for employment should be assured of a reasonable livelihood. We depend upon Australians employed in this new medium of mass communication to present the Australian viewpoint and the Australian way of life. We pressed for a specified quota of Australian material, because we did not believe -that private enterprise -and commercialism, of their own volition, would -use sufficient Australian material, since tbey -were looking for profits and not to the -propaganda value of the presentation of the Australian viewpoint. Although the Opposition's proposals were defeated in the Parliament, we received assurances from the responsible Ministers that the position would be watched carefully. We now tell the House that it has not been watched carefully enough, and that the Government has failed, time and again, to honour the promises that were made. I should like the Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson) to know that I think that he is trying to do his best. On the personal basis, I believe that to be true. However, because of the complex machinery of the bureaucracy behind him, we are not getting any results. Therefore, this has become a political question inasmuch as it relates to the situation against which the Opposition warned during the consideration of the Broadcasting and Television Bill 1956. It is a national question, because, on it, depends the sort of television that we. shall ultimately have. Therefore, the country should not be . held to ransom by licensees, whose licences we control, merely because we have not the guts to tell them that they must use Australian programmes. I had the honour and privilege to move amendments on behalf of tbe Opposition during the consideration of the Broadcasting and Television Bill 1956. In a general reply to observations that I had made before that bill was introduced, the Minister saidI am in full sympathy with the need to ensure that TV programmes are adequately Australian in character, and I know that this view is shared by the Board. In that instance, the board referred to was the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The Minister continuedThe matter is regarded as one of considerable importance, and if in the future any action is considered necessary to protect the interests of Australian artists, you can rest assured that such action will be -taken. This morning, we call on the Government to take the action that the Minister promised, and we will prove, in the debate that will ensue, that considerable importance is attached to the fact that every promise made by the Minister has not been fulfilled. This is not necessarily his own fault. In addition, the requirements that are stipulated in the Broadcasting and Television Act have not been fulfilled. Therefore, the Minister must answer tbe case that the Opposition is putting. As the Minister responsible to the 'Government for the administration of broadcasting and television services, he must stand by his assurance that action would be taken, because, as I will explain later, television programmes have become simply programmes of cheap material obtained .from overseas. Some attempt has been made, notably by station TCN, to preserve a reasonable Australian content. However, most -television licensees ace looking for revenue. They complain that they are losing money, that sponsors are scarce, and that television receiving sets are not being sold as freely as they had hoped. But that is not our worry. The television licensees came crawling -to the Government, and succeeded in persuading it to give them licences, which, in the aggregate, had a total asset value of between £500,000 and £750,000. They assured the general public and -the Australian Broadcasting 'Control Board, at -its inquiries into the granting of licences, that they did not expect to make profits, and that they would build up their programmes slowly, because -television was a medium in which development had to be taiken slowly. Although they knew all the problems, they are now trying to bilk the Australian listeners out of a fair enjoyment of 'the expression of Australian sentiment and culture, simply because they have fallen for the cheap and nasty "" quickie"" that comes in a can, mostly from the United States of America. It is astonishing to hear some Australians who should know better asserting that nobody is going to foist bad Australian programmes on them. My answer is that cheap and bad foreign programmes are being foisted on them, and, to judge by the absence of protests, they seem to like it. There will be no such' thing as a bad' Australian programme, because the demand and preferences of the Australian public will see that Australian artists live up to what we know they can do, and also the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the Minister, and the Government will not be very tolerant of Australian productions that are not of high standard. This matter involves the employment of Australians, but there is another aspect of it that will touch the heart of the Government much more closely than the employment of artists and technical experts in a profession for which they are trained. Assets worth, I think, £3,500,000I do not wish to overstate the case-ar e tied up in television studios, which have been placed at a great disadvantage by this flood of cheap and nasty "" quickie "" rubbish from overseas. I have said that I do not wish to overstate tbe case, and 1 do not, because I want a serious answer from the Government. Australian television production studios are using about only one-tenth of' their capacity, and, as a result, many actors, technicians, and script writers are merely standing by waiting for work. When shall we lose our unfortunate feeling that Australian productions, particularly those in the art forms, are inferior? To-day, world audiences are enjoying two Australian plays that are among the finest ever written. One of them has revived the British theatre, which was in the doldrums and was very happy to get "" Summer of the Seventeenth Doll"". The Elizabethan Theatre Trust in Sydney, to come nearer home, was very proud indeed to. present a new Australian play, "" The Shifting Heart"". These things are evidence that Australians can deliver the goods, and that Australian productions need only nnanciai backing to assure their success. Yet, faint-hearted Australiansmostly on the Government benches-sa y that they will not have cheap Australian programmes foisted on them. Australian programmes are nothing to be ashamed of. However, I return to the Minister's assurance that he would watch the position Carefully. The Opposition told him that it did not trust the television licensees, because they would look only to making profits as quickly as possible. What is the good of a protective section in an act if penalties are not prescribed for breaches pf it? I call on the Minister to-day to do what the Opposition asked him to do when the Broadcasting and Television Bill 1956 was being considered by the Parliament, and to require that a satisfactory quota of Australian material shall be used in television programmes in order that Australian artists, actors, script writers, and technicians may figure in the field of television as they have a right to do. The sort of thing that has happened in television in Australia could not have happened anywhere else in the world. In no other country would local talent and material be excluded from television programmes. Does the House know that not one Australian drama has been televised since television was introduced into this country7 We have had newscasts, trots, horse races and interviews of the great, the near-great and celebrities who appear in the daily news, but not one play, even of a length of ten minutes, a quarter of an hour or half an hour, has been shown. The only answer to this state of affairs is the introduction, of a quota. The Government shrank from introducing a quota because it thought that would be an interference with private enterprise. Private enterprise is sponsored by the Government and, indeed, it issues television licences. With the experience that we have had, both as a government and as an Opposition, we thought the Government would impose a quota. The British people, have a splendid record for the production of entertainment, not only of the highest character, but also of comedy and the music hall type. It is all reasonably good entertainment, all entertainment in the genre character, and it has provided employment for actors and actresses, scriptwriters and playwrights in England. It was realized that this medium was mechanical and a million-dollar job and that the employment of artists should be protected. Accordingly, a quota of 80 per cent, was imposed. The United States of America imposed a quota of 100 per cent. Only American productions are shown on television screens there, and the rubbish, when it has been used, is exported to mug countries such as Australia, which is on the end of the line. Some programmes are years old. We ask again that a quota be imposed in Australia or, at least, that some effort be made to ensure that employment is not lost to Australian artists in the way that it has been. This is a valid case. »The Scandinavian Government also has imposed a quota, and many other countries have followed that course. The Postmaster-General knows that that is so and I need not reiterate the facts for him. This new medium is of tremendous imliamentarians to reject deputations that seek portance. It is as new in the entertainment to interview us. field as Sputnik is in the satellite world,, and it is as revolutionary. Yet the Government has decided that Australians should trate what is being shown instead of Ausnot have any voice in it. That decision is tralian plays, which would provide employcompletely preposterous and must not be ment for Australian actors and actresses. conditioned by what television licensees The survey revealed that ABN, the national think about it. If a quota is not introduced, station, showed nine stabbings, three I have a warrant from the party wbich I stranglings, one attempted murder, one represent to say that we will closely wounding, one suicide, three murders disexamine the position, from the point of cussed and one murder demonstrated. Not view both of quota and the issue of licences. one of those programmes was made in AusThat is not a threat but a solid attempt to tralia. ATN, the commercial channel 7, do something for the Australian comshowed six bashings, one maiming, eight munity. The problem goes deeper indeed brawls, one blinding,. one armed robbery, than employment, which is important. It eleven murders, two woundings, two killings, goes deeper than politics, which must be eighteen corpses and a scene where a child involved because the Government issues described how she found the body.

Having stressed tbe exclusion of Auspromise. We know, from the union contralian talent from television programmes, cerned, from the Australian Broadcasting let us see what is substituted for the AusCommission, and from the force of public tralian programmes that cannot find a place opinion, that Australians will not put up on the television screens. Some little time with tbe programmes that I have mentioned. ago, a group of listeners decided to analyse The Postmaster-General has no alibi to the types of programmes shown on teleenable him to say why Australian talent vision-the sort of programme they would should not be used on television. He has see and the sort of material that would be had an opportunity to do what he wanted shown to their children. They spent four to do in his own wisdom,, but a quota has days on this task. I shall give the House not been imposed. It is right up to him now the result of their efforts. This group of to impose a quota, to so advise his leader citizens, whose names are available, found that the items I shall list, which came from America and other countries, were shown on Australian, television screens. With the notable exception that I mentioned, channel 7, which has made an attempt to do something for the Australian producer and actor, the television stations work on the slogan, "" Give them blood baths, TV is for blood, bud""! That is one of the slogans. A team of protesting actors came to Canberra. It is to the eternal disgrace of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), as an Australian) and the Postmaster-General, that they refused to receive a deputation from these actors. After that refusal, they had a long interview witb the Leader of the Opposition. Surely, it is not within our province as parBecause my time is limited, let me illusI appeal to the Postmaster-General, who promised to do something about the Australian content in television, to honour his and to so persuade his party. What we ask is only fair trade practice, but that has been -denied. When the Broadcasting and Television Bill was before the House, we issued a warning that no provision was made for Australian content in television. No work has been provided for employees in the theatrical industry and no Australian plays are offered through this mass medium of propaganda and entertainment. The broad cultural level of Australia is not dealt with at all. The Australian actor, looking for a job, has to pit his skill against Rin Tin Tin or something equally absurd. I appeal to the Postmaster-General to impose quotas and do something for the Australian actor, actress and technician. member's time has expired. General and Minister for the Navy) [11.32]. -Let me say at the outset that I am glad of the opportunity which the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has presented to me to discuss this important question. I am also glad that, to a large extent, he has submitted the matter in a reasonable way. He remarked on the fact that he had only limited time to deal witb quite a wide subject. That also applies to me. I shall attempt to be brief and to answer only the main points that he has made. If1 miss some of the points he has dealt with, then those who follow me on this side of the House will deal with them. The honourable member for Parkes has charged me particularly with having failed to carry out an obligation and an undertaking that every effort would be made to use as much Australian talent as possible in the development of television programmes throughout Australia. I say that there has been no refusal to carry out the undertaking which was given by me on behalf of the Government. He said that I had no alibi for not using Australian talent. I reply that an alibi is not required because Australian talent is being used and will be used in increasing proportions. I make the point early that the best way in which Australian talent can be used on an increasing scale isfor all the elements mvolved in this diffigrammes that have been put on by the cult matter, including Actors Equity, to get together and by intelligent co-operation, mstead of the use of threats, to create a state I shall show that a very high percentage of affairs in which every one associated with this matter can derive the greatest benefit from it. Let me remind the House briefly that the Government's policy on television and the use of Australian talent was expressed in the Broadcasting and Television BiH. New section 88 (1), providesThe Commission and licensees shall, as far as possible, use the services of Australians in the production and presentation of broadcasting and television programmes. That is fhe statement of Government policy. In some instances, that has been interpreted to mean that only those who belong to, say, Actors Equity or are musicians and so on shall be taken into account in determining what constitutes the' Australian content of television programmes. I have never stated, and I have never accepted, any such thesis. The position is that this Government's policy is to present television programmes which will properly portray the Australian way of life and which will include such items as drama, variety, children's sessions, sport, news, talks and interviews, women's programmes and the like. Australians will be used in all of those programmes, and they will present, not only to Australian viewers but also to those who visit our shores, a proper idea of the Australian way of life. That is the undertaking that has been given. That is the object at which we are aiming and which, when finally achieved, will result in a very high percentage of Australians, including actors, actresses, musicians, script writers, and so on, being employed in, and benefiting from, television. It has been said that the Government and I have failed to honour an undertaking that we would watch the development of television and ensure that our policy was carried out. I want to point out briefly to honourable members that this undertaking has been carried out mainly by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which is the appointed instrument of the Government to give effect to this policy. At the same time, of course, the Australian Broadcasting Commission has its own authority, and also is applying the general policy so far as its programmes are concerned. Shortly, I intend to indicate the actual procommercial television stations and by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and of Australians has been employed!",18,Australian Content Of Television Programmes

Let us pause for a moment to consider some of the 'important facts which have a bearing; on the development of this industry and the attainment of .a high Australian content. Let us remember that television in Australia is an entirely new venture. After al}, only one of the .six stations at present operating has celebrated its first birthday, the first birthday in a life which will extend -far beyond our normal span of life. So, television can truthfully ""be said to ""be in its 'infancy. The present television licensees-and I am now speaking particularly of the commercial licensees-ar e the pioneers of this new medium of amusement and entertainment. They have expended, as the 'honourable member -for Parkes has said, almost £4,000,000 in .the early stages of the development of the industry. They are facing considerable losses each .year. That was expected to be so at the start, but we must appreciate that they are facing these losses on behalf of the whole of the community, because the stations that will be established later will benefit from the experience of the earlier ones and the expanded market which they will create. Station TCN, for instance, lost £250,000 in fhe first year of its operations. -In order to succeed, these pioneers must be able -to .present attractive programmes which -will interest a large number of viewers. ,In doing that, of course, their own advertising will be developed, 'so that they will .go from strength to strength and enable us to improve -further -the whole of Jt -[57 ] the service. At the same time, these licensees are -required by Government .policy to increase the Australian content-of their programmes. They face :the position ithat .there is in .Australia mo established film production industry, producing ifilms suitable for television, on which they can draw.

They also face the position that there 'are no trained television technicians, -script ""writers, directors .and peop'le of 'that Jkind. All of this organization has to 'be -developed, and these <are the jnoneers who are 'doing fhat.

66,Mr Davidson,"I say'they were. Thisproductions, the establishment of a finance corporation to finance them and to enable them to proceed with film production; and the blocking in Australia of the income of overseas producers, so that it may be turned back into the industry. These are the problems that this section of the industry is facing, and they are problems that I have referred to my colleague, who will be speaking shortly on this matter. I mention them in passing in order to show that here is an important part of this industry, whose operations are essential to the development of a high content of Australian talent by the licensees, admitting that at present it is not in a position to meet these requirements. Can it be contended that, because of this, the licencees must be forced to have no reliance whatever on the import of films? Such a position would be disastrous to the ultimate success of the industry, because its ultimate success depends on attracting a large body of viewers who are satisfied with the quality of the programmes. Reference to the viewers reminds me that they also represent a very important element in the development of the industry, because they purchase television sets, pay licencefees, and so on. They want good programmes. The reviews that have been taken to date show that they have Very catholic tastes. They do not want rubbish of any kind, whether from Australia or overseas. Therefore, to force on them a low grade type of programme of Australian production would be just as disastrous as to force on them any other low-grade production. I turn now to the other group, the artists, musicians and playwrights, all of whom are equally entitled to share in the profitable development of television in Australia. But they also are required to play their part, and this is the point that I want to make for the benefit of the honourable member for Parkes, because he may have some influence with these people and be able to direct them along wiser lines than they are following at present. They cannot expect these benefits to be handed to them on a platter, such as is suggested in the resolution which states that Australian actors, actresses, artists and musicians should be guaranteed engagements and contracts. Engagements and contracts are there for them if they like to co-operate with those other sections of the industry which are trying, under difficulties, to establish it as rapidly and as efficiently as possible. I say that, by reasonable co-operation, the actors and musicians represented by Actors Equity of Australia can have the opportunity that they seek. It is there waiting for them to take it, but it cannot be acquired by threats and by direct action, which do more harm than good to the whole of the concept. In order to demonstrate what I have said concerning the opportunities available for the employment of Australian talent I should like to read some of the latest reports from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. However, since time will not allow me to do so, I advise the House that I have been informed by television stations TCN, ATN and HSV that they are already employing large numbers of members of Actors Equity and other artists who are available. From time to time they have made efforts to build up the presentation of Australian plays, but, with the exception of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, they report that they have received no cooperation whatsoever from Actors Equity. They say, further,. that if Actors Equity likes to get down to a basis of friendly and constructive co-operation with the licensees, it will find that witbout resorting to demonstrations or strikes it can build up its rate of employment very considerably. All commercial licensees have assured me that they desire to employ Australian artists and use Australian productions. I have that in black and white, and I accept their statement. They are just as much Australian as we are. These people who are criticizing what is being done, are withholding a lot of information about the actual volume of employment. They should get down to a reasonable and sensible understanding of the other elements in this industry and take the opportunities that are available to them for employment. Because of its great importance, I propose to make such information available later by way of a statement.

That shows how hostile to Australian sentiment the Government is. of order, Mr Deputy Speaker? Adennann) -Order! The honourable member for East Sydney need not remind the Chair about keeping order. Report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for the year ended 30th June, 1955, the board gave undertakings as to what would be done in the matter of employing Australian artists and musicians. It saidTelevision should provide great opportunities for Australian artists and we agree with the Royal Commission on Television that "" There is an undoubted obligation on the operators of television stations to ensure that the best use is made of Australian talent"". We are satisned by the evidence which was given to us on this subject that is before the licences were issuedthat licensees will discharge this obligation and we therefore do not propose to recommend that any specific condition should be incorporated in licences for television stations. Then the board said that imported film material had to be controlled. Of course, the Postmaster-General avoids the real issue. The decision of Parliament was taken, and I will read it. It is contained in section 88(1.) of the act. That section providesThe Commission and licensees shall, as far as possible, use the services of Australians in the not taken, positively, by the Ministry to see production and presentation of broadcasting and that this broad duty is discharged. What is television programmes. But they are not doing that. The limitation there, according to the act, is simply the possibility of the licensees doing this; it does not say as far as it is economically possible to do so. It says they are to employ Australians in the production of television programmes. That is the relevant portion of it. Are they doing that? any Australians, to my knowledge* talking in front of the microphone. speak against the conversation on the other side of the table. honourable member for East Sydney is making more interruption than anybody else. kind. all round. protection for Australian artists, the Postmaster-General is not enforcing it. The Australian content of programmes, which the Minister says is increasing, includes matters which have no relation to what is of actual value from an Australian point of view-suc h as weather reports and news. The news does not relate to Australia only, but also to all the world. Does a news broadcast have an AustraUan content because an Australian reads it? The real point is that Australians must be used in the production of programmes. That means that Australian actors, musicians and writers have to be employed to the maximum possible extent. The act says "" as far as possible"", but that is being completely broken by the Postmaster-General and the Government to-day, and also by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The board has been most shameful in its neglect of its duties. It passes responsibility away from itself. What does tbe act mean? It means that this must be done, whether the Government intended it or not. It is an obUgation to employ Australian artists. I cannot understand why opportunity is the good of the Minister complaining about a particular organization such as Actors Equity because it protests? He says, in effect, that if Actors Equity behaves itself and like a good little union does everything that it is asked to do and adopts a timid, tame-cat attitude,. somebody will be graciously pleased to give its members further opportunity to be included in programmes.

It is a completely contradictory policy on the part of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), who only a fewhours ago was arguing that the Australian public is being unwarrantedly denied access to such books as "" The Catcher in the Rye_"". He was the spokesman in this House last night against censorship. He is the most vocal man in the Parliament against control of what is to be availableto the Australian reading public. But this morning, in different guise-in thes guise of an actor, if I may put it so-he is showing us to what atransformation he has apparently been subjected. This morning he is advocating that there should be imposed the most absolute: form of censorship that I have ever beard propounded, in thisplace.

However, like other industries, it will grow, and, to the extent that an Australian film industry can be shown to be really capable of carrying on, the traditional protective devices will be available to if and regard will be paid;I give that assurance-to any representations for tariff protection of a practicable kind. Let me remind the House, however, that at the present time to exclude television films from being imported would not be to deny films to the television transmitting stations because, of course, there has been an accumulation through the years of great numbers of older films of the kind that have been mentioned in this debatefilms such as those dealing with Rin Tin Tin, the performing dog.

95,Mr Mcewen,"I have some sympathymation provided to the House by the Opposition has certainly vindicated the point of view we have submitted. Our only purpose in this debate is the express objective of stopping the unhealthy and un-Australian trend that has developed in the television industry over the last few months. As a matter of fact, the Minister for Trade( Mr since the inception of television twelve McEwen) has, to take the most charitable view, engaged in nights of fancy. For example, he said that the primary consideration should be the Australian viewer. That is what the Opposition is concerned about. We contend that the Government is not looking after the interests of the viewer as it would be doing if it implemented the provisions of the act. Subsection (1.) of section 88 of the act readsThe Commission ahd licensees shall, as far as possible, use the services of Australians in the production and presentation of broadcasting and television programmes. But the latest report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for the year ended 30th June, 1957, does not sound too happy about the present position. The Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson) threw out his chest and, with pride in his voice, told us that 56 per cent, of the programme material in August was Australian. The board states that the programmes represented by that percentage include children's sessions, variety and talent sessions, news sessions, sport sessions, quizzes and panel sessions, women's sessions, religious sessions, talks and interviews, and demonstrations. Taken at random, these programmes could include the trots, or the last quarter of the football in Melbourne. The panel shows and quizzes cost the television stations nothing. The ninth annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board contains this very significant statement, which the Postmaster-General apparently has not readThe remainder of the programmesa very, substantial portion indeed-ar e being provided on films from overseas sources . . . Many are excellent productions which provide much appreciated entertainment for Australian viewers, but others are of a type which, while in general complying with the Board's standards, do not appear to the Board to represent the type of programme which would be desirable as a permanent feature of the Australian television services. In other words, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is not very happy about the present trend of television services in Australia. The Minister himself seems' tb be extremely pleased with the trend. He stated that Australian drama was being used on television, and .it is quite possible that nfe has been misinformed by interested people, because there has not been one Australian drama televised on commercial television months ago. The Minister stated that the board had received co-operation from licensees. That does not seem to be on all fours with the statement made by the board that it is not satisfied with a lot of imported programmes. The Minister said that the viewers want good programmes. Of course, they do, and I suggest that the Minister should have a word or two with the viewers. I have had interviews with quite a lot of viewers in my electorate, and all and sundry say that, whilst there is quite a number of good programmes on television, the imported film content of television programmes is far too high. I hope the Minister will not conclude that television viewers are perfectly satisfied with the programmes. The hiatus in the sale of television receivers has been brought about, first, by the fact that the cost is too high, and secondly, by the predominantly poor overseas programmes which are being televised. I suggest that if television stations were prepared to put on decent Australian programmes, they would find that the sales of television sets would rise. The Opposition's objection to the present small content of Australian programmes is not for political purposes. We, on this side of the House, are concerned about an unhealthy development, and we say unequivocally that the Government must not allow television screens to become a medium for the dissemination of imported culture and imported ideas. That is what is happening to-day. There must be ample opportunity for the presentation of Australian culture and the Australian way of life. The Minister this morning painted a gloomy picture of the future when he said that we could not expect any improvement on the present situation. Australia will be inundated with importations from overseas. The Opposition pointed this out when the bill was being considered in 1956. At that time, the Opposition said that there were already' in Aus| tralia a large number of television films, which had been brought into this country",27,Australian Content Of Television Programmes
96,Mr Bird (Batman) [12.3],"The inforfor the purpose of flooding the market as soon as television was inaugurated. That has happened.' Television stations intend to apply the same policy in ths future, and it is clear that the Minister intends to allow the television stations to have an open . go. What are the prospects for the future? America this year is producing 120,000,000 dollars worth of television films. Last year, 100,000,000 dollars worth were produced, and similar quantities have been produced in previous years. Many of those films have been dumped in this country at a fraction of their original cost. They were very profitable transactions years ago, and the owners of the films in America are quite prepared to send them out here for a mere fraction of their original cost, because if they do not get that money they will get nothing at all. This Government, up to a month or two ago at least, was able to prevent an extension of that policy by having a ceiling limit on the amount of films which could be imported-£60,00 0 worth-bu t to-day the sky is the limit. Television stations can import as much as they like, and I have no doubt at all, seeing that the original intention of the people who entered television was to make a profit, that they will buy on the cheapest market and sell on the dearest market. The cheapest market, as far as they are concerned, is the overseas market, and they have now received the green light from the Minister. I do not know whether the Minister is too naive or whether he is trying to put it over the Opposition, but the fact remains that last year he saidIn its report to my predecessor on these hearThe commission has produced 26 live plays ings, the Broadcasting Control Board pointed out that there was an obligation on the operators of of half-hour or one-hour duration, in which television stations to ensure that the best use was a total of 150 professional actors or actresses made of Australian talent, and that licensees were were engaged. Three of these plays were ready and willing to discharge this obligation. Surely in the light of what has happened authors. Like"" Blood on the Bottie "", their over the last twelve months the Minister authorship is Australian. In the field of still does not believe that the licensees are light entertainment, there were 883 engageready and willing to discharge the obligaments of Australian artists by the A.B.C. tion that rests on them.

What hope is In the children's session the A.B.C. has used there for Australian talent when this attitude is adopted by the television stations, and they are backed by the Minister? When the Government refused to insert the quota clause twelve or eighteen months ago, I hoped that the Minister would do the right thing, in accordance with the provisions of the act, and see that, as far as he possibly could, tbere would be a fair percentage of Australian material in television programmes. But. such has not proved to be the case, Knowing the Minister to be very sincere, I would have expected him to stand up to. the moguls of the television industry, but he has not. The Opposition, in making a noise about this matter,, exhibits its usual reckless disregard for facts. Opposition members have been presenting a case based on information supplied by other organizations. It would have been to the advantage of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) if he had checked the information given to him in his brief, and had given honourable members of this House a factual outline of the case, as I now propose to do. The honourable member for Parkes used the phrase "" blood baths"". This purist, this great exponent of culture, once wrote a play entitled ""Blood on the Bottle"", or "" Blood on the Wattle "", so these phrases come readily to his lips. Let us consider the facts in relation to the Australian content of television programmes, taking the Australian Broadcasting Commission first of all, and the way it has worked over the past twelve months. specially written for television by resident for the talent of members of Actors Equity?",28,Australian Content Of Television Programmes
97,Mr Pearce (Capricornia) [12.13],"149 live programmes catering especially for children, and in this regard 824 engagements were made. As far as the A.B.C. is concerned, in Sydney over a period of nearly twelve months the Australian consent has been 48 per cent., and in Melbourne 39 per cent. Further, during August, of the people appearing in live programmes from the national stations, 86.9 per cent, in Sydney and 89 per cent, in Melbourne were paid artists. If we turn to the commercial stations and look at what they have to offer in this regard we find that on station TCN, 43.5 per cent, of all programmes are of live origin or concern happenings in Australia. That station says quite definitely that few live programmes for Australian artists of any quality and at a reasonable price have been offered to it. Indeed, it can give the list of programmes that was offered to it which it put on, but having no audience appeal attracted no sponsor. The stations complain that they have had no co-operation from Actors Equity in this matter, and I ask the honourable member for Parkes if he has any influence with Actors Equity, to induce its members to co-operate with those people who are anxious and who have demonstrated their desire to use Australian content in their television programmes, instead of coming along with this fatuous nonsense we have heard to-day. If anybody has a good live show or a good Australian film, and if it can command an audience .and a sponsor it will be given first priority by TCN and other commercial stations. We go on then to station ATN. Although this station has been established for two years and has been transmitting for ten months, apart from conferences with the court for the purpose of making awards it has not bad any approach or offer of assistance or co-operation from Actors Equity. Where does Actors Equity expect to get if it will not co-operate or make offers of assistance? Neither before nor after its decision to strike in protest against the Government's intention to make currency available for the importation of programmes has it approached the station or sought to ascertain what was proposed. The stations have not received the slightest assistance from /Actors Equity and, generally .speaking, have received little co-operation from the artists themselves. For some time past musical shows have been planned and scheduled for presentation before the end of .the year, but the greatest difficulty has been experienced in getting good talent at reasonable fees. The fees that have been asked have ranged from £25 to £50 for a single half-hour performance. Is this .the sort of co-operation that is going to .ensure the employment of Australian artists on a television programme? We now turn to station HSV. It has been regularly and consistently increasing the Australian content in its television programmes, but again not .a great deal of support or co-operation has been received from Actors Equity. That station says quite definitely that opportunities are being extended as production experience grows and the .knowledge and technique improves. The organization recently acquired station .HSV7 and will transmit from the end of this month a completely .new Australian series employing leading Australian actors; and the station has agreed to underwrite this locally produced series without .any revenue support, .as it has done on many occasions. What greater guarantee can one have of the faith and desire of a station to employ Australians when it is prepared at its own expense to start a programme, without any financial support in any way whatsoever, for the encouragement of these Australian artists? Looking at the facts, it is clear that the Opposition has been led by the nose by Actors Equity, and I urge honourable members opposite to look a little deeper at the intentions or desires of Actors Equity, because it has received the greatest encouragement from the broadcasting and television -stations. Immeasurably more -money comes to the artists and musicians of Australia from broadcasting and television than from any other medium. They have to sell themselves to the public, and instead of carrying on with their stupid demonstrations and .furnishing stupid briefs to the honourable member for Parkes, they should clean up their own house. Why should honourable members opposite take their brief from men who are seeking to destroy the Australian way of life?

(Ordered to be considered together.) to resume the debate where we left off last night on tbe Department of Customs and Excise insofar as it relates to the administrament of Customs and Excise for quite a tion of the censorship. The honprable member fior Parkes( Mr Haylen) entertained us to an amusing speech in characteristic style. I suppose that many of us, and the listening public, should be grateful to him for some of the interesting titles that he gave us. No doubt, there will be quite an amount of examination of those references. But he spoilt what would otherwise have been, from my point of view, a good case by descending into party controversy and attacking the Government. I should have thought that on a matter such as literary censorship we could have abandoned political divisions, for the time being at least, and tried to examine this whole question deliberatively and with some degree of adjudication. The truth is, surely, that all governments have been culpable in this matter, over the years. If one wanted to be political, it is a legitimate objection to state that the Labour party was in office for eight years, between 1941 and 1949, and its administration of literary censorship left a great deal to be desired. But, I ask, is the Government, to-day, really happy about the way in which the censorship is being operated? Despite the speech last night of my friend, the Minister for Air( Mr Osborne), who was previously a distinguished Minister for Customs, I doubt whether it is. For myself, I shall say at once that I believe in the necessity for some degree of censorship. One has only to look at some of the frankly pornographic publications, usually written by American authors and displayed in some of the most reputable book-shops in Paris, to appreciate the wisdom of preventing this calculated, deliberate, filth from falling into the hands of eager schoolboys, excitable adolescents, and highly emotional or relatively uneducated people. Opposition members interjecting, wanted to be uncharitable, one could include in this compendium some honourable members opposite. In Austraha, we have gone to extremes. Books that circulate freely in England have long been banned here. Other honourable members have given the committee examples of such books. I would remind them of one or two others. Since the war, for example, a classic by the writer Apuleius, "" The Golden Ass "", was detained by the Departprolonged period. In this connection, surely there is some appropriateness in that title. The same fate overtook a novel which I think was very dull indeed, called "" Love Me Sailor "", which appeared after the war, and which I first saw in a Methodist book shop in Adelaide, where it remained until it excited the departmental mind. We have now had the latest incident involving the novel, "" Catcher in the Rye"", which, I understand, has been circulating in Australia for six years, and has been for a long time on the shelves of our own National Library. These books, of course, to the great joy of their authors and publishers, become best sellers overnight when the interdict is lifted. As I said a moment ago, I am not opposed in principle to censorship. I believe that some form of it is necessary. My point is that there is, surely, ample evidence now on which to question the present practices of our customs officers, of the Literature Censorship Board, and of the appeal censor himself. Inevitably one asks: Are people of sufficient talent, of adequate breadth of mind, of refinement, and of learning employed by the department on literary censorship work? What are the qualifications of customs officers for this work? Is tbere sufficient liaison between the customs officers and the Literature Censorship Board? Have members of the board the true personal qualities necessary to discharge a task demanding a rich maturity of mind and uncommonly good judgment? Finally, is the Government offering adequate recompense to the board of censors? I see in the Estimates an amount, described, truly enough, as honoraria, of £1,125 for distribution among these people. My submission this morning is that the whole subject of literary censorship should",31,Pairs
108,Mr Downer (Angas) [12.31],I wish,32,Pairs
109,Mr Downer,"I suppose that if onebe re-examined by the Government. I do not wish to attack the censors personally nor customs officials. Customs officers, in my experience, are diligent, reasonable, courteous and most helpful men, but surely we all agree that censorship requires very special qualities which are not possessed by the great majority of people. Accordingly, I put three proposals to the Government. I suggest, first, that the task of book censorwords, the 35 years would be reduced to ship should be taken away from customs officers and placed in the hands of a small committee or board, composed of men and women-and I emphasize "" women "", because I think their views would be extremely valuable in this respect-of wide knowledge and broad sympathies, possessing a true erudition, and also-and this is most important-wit h a practical experience of the world. Such a body would need to be available at short notice, preferably at immediate notice, to pronounce on books, magazines, and pictures that appear questionable to examining customs officers at the port of entry. The present Literature Censorship Board could, of course, be used for this purpose, but it should be required to give its decisions expeditiously and without the delays to which we have grown so accustomed. ,My second suggestion is that from this present for £6 or £7 a ton. re-constituted board's decision an appeal should lie to the appeal censor, who would be obliged to give his decision within a Sound and Koolyonobbing amounting to period not^exceeding two months. Thirdly, 200,000,000 tons, and there are other known if we are to operate a book censorship deposits as well. I direct attention to that system intelligently, we must be willing to fact in order to emphasize the grave inconinduce those responsible for this function sistency of the policy of the Department of to devote sufficient time and serious conTrade. While the department regards the sideration to their work. If we expect this export of iron ore as constituting a danger of them, we must be prepared to offer farto the national interest, it allows such higher emoluments than appear in these valuable minerals and metals as manganese, Estimates. . As it is, these recurrent controversies, with which we have become boringly familiar since the war, are making Australia look like a high-hatted, tightlyment. corsetted, lorgnette-gazing dowager, such as used to frequent South Kensington in Loncation was made to, and a reply received don before the war, in the eyes of all from, the Minister for Trade, or his secreserious-minded, thinking men and Women tary, so that the matter involves his departthroughout the world. remarks will be directed to the Department matters merely to emphasize the inconsisof Trade. Recently, the Government of tency of departmental policies. The MinisWestern Australia applied for a permit to ter claims that fresh supplies of scrap iron export 1,000,000 tons of iron ore from Koolyonobbing. It was told by the department that the known deposits of iron ore would approach exhaustion within 30 to 35 years. The Premier of Western Australia pointed out that even if this estimate was anywhere near being correct, the export of 1,000,000 tons would reduce that estimated period by only five weeks. In other 34 years, ten months and three weeks. The Premier also pointed out that by exporting this 1,000,000 tons of iron ore, for which he could get £6 or £7 a ton, he could make a profit of £1,450,000, which he needed to expand the charcoal iron industry at Wundowie, and to establish a new plant at Bunbury. At present, iron ore is being brought from Yampi Sound and sold to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company at ls. 6d. a ton. When the agreement was first made with the company by the McLarty Liberal Government of Western Australia, it provided for a price of 6d. a ton, but the company voluntarily increased this price to ls. 6d., realizing that it was getting far too good a deal. It is clear that the McLarty Government let Western Australia down when it sold that iron ore at such a cheap price, particularly when it is found that it can be sold at There are deposits of iron ore at Yampi coking coal, scrap iron and scrap steel to be exported to other countries. by the Department of National Development as well.

112,Mr Webb,"The point is that the appliand steel become available every day. That is so, but it is important to note that the raw material from which these iron and steel articles were originally manufactured was iron ore, and that the scrap is much easier to process into steel products than is iron ore. While it may appear that there is a surplus of scrap steel for immediate use in Western Australia, the position can change very rapidly. The depletion of scrap steel stocks in that State was intensified in the immediate post-war years to such an extent that negotiations were entered into to obtain this material from South Australia, when there was less than -three months' :supply of this important material available. Secondary heavy industries in Western Australia are negligible when compared with the large structural steel and engineering establishments in the eastern States. Consequently, Western Australia must rely for its supplies on the mining industry and government departments, and only 12 per cent, of the total weight of castings that come from the mines is recoverable as scrap. It can be seen, therefore, that very limited supplies can be expected from that source. Scrap dealers say there is a large surplus of scrap in Western Australia. Had it not been for the unfortunate closing down of the Wiluna and Uig Bell mines, users of scrap in Western Australia would have been m a very difficult position. At the moment, certainly, 'supplies of scrap are available from the State railways, but this is only a temporary situation, due to the breaking up of old locomotives and wagons that have been replaced. As honourable members know, Tthe life of a locomotive is between 20 and 30 years. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. suspended, I .had drawn attention to the inconsistency of the Government in refusing a licence to the Western Australian Government for the export -of 1,000,000 tons of iron ore whilst at the same time permitting the excessive export of scrap steel from that State. As I pointed out, scrap steel contains iron ore -and is much easier to process into steel products than is iron ore, I pointed out also that there was a .grave shortage of .scrap steel after the last war. Indeed, the shortage was .so great that we were in .danger of having to import scrap steel from South Australia. In addition, .as soon as .the source from wbich scrap steel is now obtained is finished, we will -probably have another grave shortage. I do not say that an embargo should be placed on all scrap steel leaving the State, but I urge the Government not to grant licences to dealers to export this scrap. In competition with legitimate buyers, dealers have forced up the price, and consequently scrap steel has become more expensive to the foundries. 1 shall give an example. When Big Bell and the Wiluna mines closed down, Hadfields (WA.) 1934 Limited, an engineering establishment in Western Australia, .tried to purchase all the scrap on those two properties for ore for their foundry as Bassendean, but dealers exporting to other countries outbid that company, as they have done from time to time. Consequently, the price was forced up. These dealers are reaping big profits from the export of scrap. I wrote to the Minister on this matter on 4th June last. I shall not quote the letter because what I have said in the course of my few remarks here is what I said in the letter. In his reply, the Minister advised me that the export of scrap was referred to a committee and that the interests of the local users were closely examined. He pointed out, also, that there was no shortage at the moment. That may .be so, but we are concerned with the future and with the fact that licensed dealers are forcing up the price of scrap. I again emphasize that we in Western Australia want to know why the Commonwealth permits the export of scrap iron and steel, which is much easier to .process into steel products, whilst at the same time it refuses a licence to the State government to export iron ore, on the grounds that it is necessary to preserve the nation's resources. If the Government is anxious to safeguard Australia's steel production, why should the export policy for iron ore be different from that for scrap steel, particularly as we have been able to show that the deposits of iron ore in Western Australia are ample? I wish to refer now to the Department of Primary Industry and to deal with fisheries development.

Honourable members will remember that an offer to purchase that station was made by the Western Australian Government, finally, the decision was that the station should be sold to the Nor' West Whaling Company at a .giveaway price. The merger of the two whaling projects has meant that the profit of the Nor' West Whaling Company has doubled. The profit was given recently as £274,266.

When one says "" censorship"", people's hackles naturally rise. They do not like the idea of censorship because it is against their idea of freedom. But we have to remember always that there is a stage at which freedom can become licence. If we look at the matter from another point of view and ask, "" Do we want blasphemous, obscene and indecent literature?"", the answer immediately is, "" No "" . Mr Allan Fraser -Can the bonorable member define any of those three things? definition of obscenity, and if the honourable member cares to go to the relevant books he will find it there. Mr Allan Fraser -Would the honourable member give us the authority, so that we may be able to find the definition? should be allowed to state their own case. speech. The authority is to be found in the books. There has been power, under the Customs Act, to deal with obscene, blasphemous and indecent literature ever since 1901, when the act was first brought in. It is a part of the police power of the Commonwealth. When an honourable member says, "" Leave this matter to the police power of the States"", let it not be forgotten that there is also a police power of the Commonwealth, which the people of the Commonwealth expect to be exercised. If a government were to remove that provision from the Customs Act, I do not believe that it would remain in office after the next general election. There would be such consternation that it could not survive. Certain books have been referred to in the course of this debate, including one called "" Redheap"", which was banned in May, 1930. A great song was raised by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr arising from a dispute between subject and Haylen) about that banning. It was spoken of as a shocking thing on the part of the Customs of the day. Who was the Minister in those days? It was the period of knowledge of history misleads me, the Scullin Government was a Labour government, and the Minister for Customs, I understand, was Mr Frank Forde, a Minister of considerable experience. It was, therefore, the view of the then Minister for Customs that "" Redheap"" should be banned. The honourable member for Parkes and his leader, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), endeavoured to manoeuvre the debate last night so that the present Government would be shown to be solely responsible for the way in which the Customs Department administers the regulations, and an attack was made on the regulations themselves. I point out that those regulations provide not only for an appeal, but also for an appeal upon that appeal. In 1930, when Mr Forde was the Minister for Customs, there were no such regulations. The matter was entirely one for the discretion of the Minister. The regulations were introduced in 1937 by the then Minister for Customs, the late Sir Thomas White, during the regime of a Liberal government, the idea being that there should be appeals; not merely one appeal, but appeal upon appeal, under the regulations. We heard the right honourable member for Barton say, last night, that he denounced the system, and that the Minister for Air( Mr Osborne), who was at the table at the time, stood up for it only because he was himself once Minister for Customs; otherwise, he would despise it. Of course, the right honourable member was merely indulging in one of his frolics with regard to freedom. "" I am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark ! "" That is the right honourable member for Barton. If any one else happens to bark, and says to him, ""You should not be the leader"", out he goes! That is the right bonorable member's idea of freedom. The right honourable gentleman said that he would require the department to place the books, not before a civil servant or a professor, but before a court.

124,Mr Joske,"I propose to make my ownsubject, or between government and subject There is no power, under the Commonwealth Constitution, for a judicial tribunal to decide whether or not a book should be banned at the instance of the Customs Department. That is to say, the Customs Department cannot do that. All that it can do is to ask an administrative body or tribunal to decide these matters, and that is the very thing for which provision is made under the existing regulations: That there should be an appeal to one administrative tribunal, and then a further appeal afterwards. The very procedure that has been denounced by the right honourable member for Barton is the only procedure by which this matter can be administered. Let us see how this lover of freedom, this denouncer, behaved when he, himself, was in power. As1 have already said, these regulations were brought in in 1937. The right honourable member for Barton was the law officer of the Crown from 1941 to 1949. Did he denounce these regulations and say that they were to be despised? No! He allowed them to stand. He allowed books to be banned under them and did not utter so much as a murmur of objection. Therefore, as I say, his present denunciation is just a frolic on his part. There is no sincerity in it. This is a matter on which, of course, Censorship Board that at present exists or people's minds are greatly divided. No two against the ability of the appeals censor to people will agree at any given moment on form a capable judgment-so far as judgwhether a particular book is decent or ment can be capable in this matter?

The to the Literature Censorship BoardI subhonorable member referred to a book called mit to the Minister that that should be the "" Love Me Sailor "", and he said he thought practice; that an appeal should come about, it was a dull book. I am given to underipso facto by the very fact of banning. stand, however, that it had a somewhat more Furthermore, if the Literature Censorship seductive title when it was translated into Board bans a book, it should go, ipso facto, French. It was then known as "" Prenezto further appeal before the appeals censor. moi Matelot"". The honourable member for Only by a constant regard being had to the Angas thought the book was dull, but it matter of whether a book, being banned, was the subject of a criminal prosecution in the Supreme Court of Victoria, before a jury, and it may well be said that on a matter of this kind a jury is the best judge. The jury found that the book was an obscene libel. In order to establish an obscene libel, it must be shown not only that a book is indecent, but also that it is likely to cause morality to be corrupted. That common jury found this dull book to be an obscene libel. That example indicates to honourable members just how possible it is for minds to differ on this matter. It shows that a common jury, a court of ordinary men in the street, may regard some of these matters as indecent and how men's minds may differ on these subjects. That being so, I would say that whoever comes to decide-whethe r it is a small committee, or a board such as the honourable member for Angas asks for, composed of men and women of broad sympathies, possessing erudition and with a broad knowledge of the world, or whoever it is-ther e will be some people who, all the time will say, "" You have done the wrong thing"" either in allowing something through or in disallowing it.

That was distributed, as future400 buyers operating in the Australian wool market to-day, buying wool for export, are finding it very difficult to operate because they are not able to obtain adequate financial accommodation from the financial institutions. As a result, the purchasing of Austrahan wool is getting into the hands of small minority of four or five buying interests which are buying for various parts of the world and are establishing themselves as a monopoly. They are able to force down the prices of this product. I believe that 90 per cent, of these buyers represent foreign interests. So it is very important that the Government should do something in that regard. I have here a copy of an article written by the financial editor of the ""Sydney Morning Herald "", in Which that gentleman statesYet it was a reminder that a large part of Australia's trading future will be in awakening Asia. The Government is doing nothing about developing markets for our primary products in that area. We have heard from various sources that China, for instance, is exploiting the markets of the East and other parts with its manufactured products. China and many other countries to-day are becoming potential purchasers of Australian products. We should go after those markets to our very utmost. There has been a reduction of primary production in many of the countries of the Soviet bloc while they concentrate their energies on the development of secondary industry. There are markets in these countries now, we are informed, for wheat, meat, dairy products, steel, aluminium, building materials, machine tools and many other things. Australia could provide many of those commodities. I have not heard of the Government's making any substantial move to try to promote markets for Australia in these areas. I say that if the Department of Trade and the Department of Primary Industry were doing their job in developing our rural industries a greater measure of prosperity and success would be brought to those industries, and our overseas balances must be improved. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr for us to get away from parochial thinkTimson) -Order! The honourable gentleing, and to think on the national plane, man's time has expired. honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) began his speech by complaining about the small number of people who have gone onto the land in the last eight or nine years. I should like to ask him to direct his remarks to the Government of New Soutb Wales, because most of the matters about which he spoke are the responsibility of that government. It is of no use, when a State government falls down on its job, to say, as the honourable member said, "" Let us forget about the State government, and see whether the Commonwealth Government can do something about it "" . Honourable members on this side of the House believe in the federal system, under which the sovereign States must accept their responsibilities in these matters. Without going into too much detail, I shall cite some examples of the failure of the New South Wales Government to discharge the responsibility that rests on it. The honourable member says that the people of New South Wales should be encouraged to go on the land. The New Soutb Wales Government has discouraged them, first by greatly increasing rail freights and fares to country areas, and secondly, by failing to provide water storage facilities with reasonable expedition and at reasonable cost-.and I particularly bave in mind the Glenbawn dam in the Hunter River area. A scheme to supply water to the central coast of New South Wales was mooted ten years ago, but it has not yet reached the drawing boards. I give those examples to show the responsibilities that the States have in these matters about which the honourable member for Darling has complained. The honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb) said that he wished to register his disgust at the placing of the Commonwealth trawling vessel on the eastern side of the Great Australian Bight. I should like to say to the honourable member for Stirling that if the vessel had been placed on the western side, or at Albany, as he suggested, no doubt the people of South Australia would wish to register their disgust. I agree with the well-known Australian who, some three weeks ago, said that if ever there was a time in Australia's history now is the time. I suggest to the honourable -",39,Pairs
130,Mr Dean (Robertson) [2.55],"Th emember for Stirling that quite a number of things must be taken into consideration in deciding the most suitable base for the trawler. It is necessary to consider not only the geographical situation, but also the matter of markets. The location of markets would be a most important consideration, and to my way of thinking was probably one of the deciding factors which influenced the decision to base this trawler on the eastern side of the bight. I only cite that as an example, but I plead with the honourable member to think nationally on that matter, as on all matters before this House. I want to say something about the Department of Trade. In the last few years, the Department of Trade has had a most difficult job in its administration of import licensing. Those of us who sit on this side of the House, who believe in true, liberal government do not like at any time to increase controls upon organizations or individuals in Australia. It obviously became necessary several years ago for certain import restrictions to be imposed, and I am very glad to say that, as conditions have permitted, the Minister for Trade relaxed those controls. I wish to pay my tribute, not only to the Minister, but also to his officers, for the manner in which they have administered the restrictions and the understanding way in which they have acted. Their work was not easy, and it is easy to see that anomalies could arise. In paying that tribute, I mention the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Swartz), who has had a great deal of responsibility in this matter. I wish to mention the Tariff Board, and in doing so I am not pointing thefingerof criticism at any person in the department, or any member of the Tariff Board itself. I refer to some of the delays that have occurred in getting decisions from the board. I shall give one illustration in the hope that investigations may be made with the object of preventing a recurrence of such a happening. I refer to the inquiry that the Tariff Board made into the importation of passion fruit juice and pulp into Australia. The original inquiry was held some two years ago, and in due course the Tariff Board made its report to the Government, and the Government, in its wisdom, referred the report back to the Tariff Board, enlarging its terms of reference. I have no criticism to offer about that action. The Tariff Board, acting on the enlarged terms of reference, held its sittingsI speak from memory-a t the beginning of the second half of 1956. At that time, I made representations to the Minister and the board, on behalf of the growers, asking that the report be made available prior to the harvesting of tbe summer crop, because the findings of the board would affect the industry and the preparations it would be making with regard to the crop. I know that the chairman of the board was most understanding. I know that the Minister realized the position and was also understanding, but the fact remains that, so far, the report has not yet been presented to this House, and the next summer crop will soon be harvested. I suggest that the evidence that was taken at that time-say , in October, 1956-wil l not be applicable to the present situation. In other words, some of tbe assistance that the industry was asking for under the terms of the inquiry will not now be required because circumstances have changed. If the report of the board is to be of benefit to the industryI am not saying which side of the industry, the growers or the processors-it will be necessary to make the report available to those interested much quicker than in the past. In conclusion, I wish to mention something under the heading of our trade commissioner service. I think it is necessary for us to increase our trade with those countries to the near north of Australia, those within the British Commonwealth of Nations, and those which are joined with us by such treaties as Seato. As I understand it, one of the difficulties of increasing our trade is the irregularity of shipping services to quite a number of the ports in the areas I have mentioned. It is comparatively easy to obtain a cargo from Australia for certain ports, but it is most difficult to get a return loading. Therefore, it is necessary, I believe, for our trade commissioner service to investigate further the possibilities of reciprocal trade with certain of these countries. I mention, for example, timber. There is a great deal of goodquality timber coming to Australia from such countries as North Borneo and Malaya. I think it would be true to say that a great many people in the timber industry in Australia believe that it is necessary for Australia to import her oregon requirements and",40,Pairs
131,( Mr Mcewen) And The Department Have,"other timbers for joinery work from dollar sources, but I have been informed that quite a lot of the timber from South-East Asian countries would be suitable for that purpose. It would be a much shorter haul, and dollars would not be involved to anything like the same extent. I just give that as an. expression of my belief in the necessity for reciprocal trade between Australia and the countries I have mentioned. .desire to criticize one aspect of the work of the Literature Censorship Board. A deputation from booksellers waited on me some time ago in my own city and complained about the time that elapses between the arrival of imported books or literature and the time they are returned to the importer from the censorship authorities. I inform the Minister of one specific case. He knows that lists are compiled of books imported from all countries. The book to which I refer was listed among those imported from India. A purchaser or an interested party went to the owner of the business and requested that this book be imported for him from India. This was eventually arranged and the book arrived in Australia in one particular month. Tbe ordinary procedure was then followed. At the end of the month correspondence passed between the Department of Customs and Excise and the bookseller as to when he could expect to have the book returned to him. There was no reply until another month passed, which meant this book had been held up by the department or by the censorship authority for two months. I then made a request to the department for information, and a couple of weeks later the book was returned to the owner and he was permitted to isell it. He then brought the book to me tto show me its condition when it was returned from ithe Literature Censorship Board. The book cost the purchaser approximately 60s., but I want to tell the Minister 'that wben tiie book was returned it was not worth 5'6d. It was in a deplorable condition. My two complaints-and I think the Minister will be just enough to give .these matters consideration-ar e these: .First, -the time .that elapses between the arrival of literature in Australia after being ordered --and .business is keen to-day in Australia, the same as it is anywhere else-and the date on which it is returned to the importer; and secondly, the deplorable condition, in which books are returned to the bookseller. Those two important points should be investigated immediately. I do not know whether the Literature Censorship Board meets periodically, or whether some one person has authority, immediately a book is submitted for censorship to direct that it be perused immediately and returned to the bookseller or the importer as soon as possible. It is even more important, particularly with a costly book, that every precaution be taken to see that it is not damaged during that time. I believe that the Literature Censorship Board is actually doing a grand job. I have no complaint other than in respect of the matters I have mentioned. They are two important factors which should be taken up by ithe department immediately. I appeal to the Minister to take particular note of my complaint because I think what I have said is sufficient to indicate there is some desirability and some need to have a look at the particular instance I have mentioned to ensure that remedial action is taken immediately. wish to speak on the 'Estimates for the Department of Primary Industry and to deal witb tbe point raised by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark). I was astonished at the statement he made. He is supposed to represent a .rural .seat, but as his electorate is dominated by the City of Broken Hill, his ignorance about the point he raised is understandable. He dealt with the number of rural holdings, and quotedfiguresin respect of the period from 1949 to 1956. He said that in spite of the enormous increase in population, the number of rural holdings bad increased by only some hundreds. He implied that there has been accretion of land in the hands of the few. I cannot believe he does not know the truth, because I am quite certain he would like to give the truth rather than mislead. The Bureau of Census and Statistics, for its purposes, regards an area in excess of one acre as a rural holding. But in tbe true sense of .the word .one acre is not a holding. However, in the big cities, particularly Sydney .and Melbourne, thousands of rural holdings-of that area in .tiie suburbs",41,Pairs
132,Mr Chambers (Adelaide) [3.6],I,42,Pairs
133,Mr Anderson (Hume) [3.11],"Jhave been .absorbed in the expansion of those cities, and that is why the number of rural holdings bas decreased. In fact, tremendous sub-division has taken place in rural areas throughout Australia. But the honourable gentleman, because of his socialistic training, wishes to imply that more and more land is falling into the hands of fewer and fewer people. That is not true. Again he claimed that under this 'Government the number of workers in rural production has fallen. Of course it has, because .there has been a revolution in primary industries. -But he would not know it, because his outlook is dominated by Broken Hill. There has 'been such a revolution m fhe last seven years. The Tural industries have been mechanized as a TesuTt of the policy of this Government. If one wants to ascertain Labour policy on rural production, one need only read fhe White Paper on full employment of 1945. The whole -emphasis of the ""Labour party's policy was on secondary industries, irrespective of fhe imbalance that its policy would have brought about. The only reference the policy made to the primary industries was a casual allusion to war serdeliberately planned fiscal policy. Thirty vice land settlement. These are serious matters because the life of the nation depends on the policies whicb guide our balanced expansion. I cannot believe that the honourable gentleman is so ignorant as he exposed himself to be. He charged the Government with failure to encourage land settlement. Surely, he knows that land settlement is primarily a State responsibility. The Government of New South Wales has failed dismally to implement any agricultural policy. The policy of the Government seems to 'be directed towards making it harder for the people Who are engaged in rural .production. If we want .to have more rural production we must have more and more subdivisions and more and more people settled on the land. That can be done easily by the State governments. It is not the concern of the Federal Government The honourable member for Darling talked about our policy in .relation to ithe selling for the man on the land to produce. Tbe of products. I remember .that when this Government took over from the iabour government it inherited the terrible tragedy of the butter producers. One of .the first acts of the Parliament after the Menzies Government took office was to restore the proper relationship between the selling price of butter and the cost .of production. As a result, the butter industry has benefited by about .£130,000,000 in subsidy in the last seven years. The honourable member also mentioned farming conditions in the TJnited Kingdom. They are completely different from conditions in our own primary industry. There, a system of subsidies is relied upon because the United 'Kingdom bas had to import a great quantity of food in time of war. Consequently, the United Kingdom Government has deliberately encouraged the production of foodstuffs, even at the expense of the .exchequer. That is a policy whicb is governed by environment. We should aat foster a policy whereby primary production jests on subsidies. The policy of the Government is .to get away from subsidies and allow production to improve as a result of the methods of primary industry. But the Government has done an enormous amount for Australia since it has been in office. The mechanization of primary industry was accomplished by a per cent. x>f all foreign loans raised by the Government have been .spent on agricultural machinery. That is why primary industry is .now mechanized. It has been the result iof a designed policy. People have also .been encouraged to put capita] into primary .production by the Government's policy of permitting depreciation allowances, for income tax purposes, on capital equipment. The success of that policy has been proved by the enormous increases that have taken place in production in 'primary industry. Any party that attacks -the Government on the ground that it is 'laggardly in its interest in primary producers is not talking facts. What has been accomplished in New South Wales has been accomplished despite tbe Labour government. .As tiie honourable member for Robertson has said, -the Labour government's policy has .apparently been deliberately designed to make it harder State government has increased the price of rural electricity and has taken other action wbich .bears heavily against tbe man on the land. The industry which has been much affected is the timber industry. It is becoming extremely hard to sell timber. Timber was originally carried by sea but the policy of the railways eliminated that means of transport. By offering cheaper freights, at the cost of the national exchequer, the railways killed the sea trade of the northern rivers in timber. As soon as the sea trade ceased, the railways put their freights up. There is also a problem in moving timber from Tumut to Canberra. It has to go by road and road tax has to be paid on it. Everything is designed to mitigate against primary producers. After all, the timber industry is a part of primary production. Then the honourable member for Darling talked about wool selling. He said that under this Government the purchase of wool was falling into the hands of fewer buyers, and that therefore prices were being forced down. That is nonsense. Does the honourable member not know that brokers are paid commission on the value of their sales? Does he think that they would try to bring prices down and so get a lower commission? This allegation illustrates the foggy Labour thinking that goes on the whole time. Ths wool sales are conducted entirely by free auction and any possibility of lot splitting is very carefully watched by the brokers and producers. The price of wool is not affected. Is not the fact that brokers are paid commission according to the value of their sales sufficient to ensure that the sales referring to his remarks other than the point are made at the highest possible price? This is in the interests of the primary producers and of the national welfare. The next matter referred to by the honourable member for Darling was the meat agreement. The benefits of that agreement are spread throughout the industry and the agreement has had a most important effect on the production of beef. It has given security of markets for the next 15 years. On the question of marketing, it is interesting to recall that every member of the Labour party opposed the lapanese trade treaty. Is not that a marketing treaty? Yet the honourable member for Darling said that we were not interested in improved marketing! Under the Minister for Trade technique has undergone a revolution and I suppose that it is now as advanced as techniques anywhere else in the world. In view of the Labour party's attitude to the Japanese trade treaty, it should not accuse the Government of lack of interest in marketing. Surely that treaty was designed to secure wider markets for primary industry. Yet the honourable member for Darling, who is supposed to represent a rural seat, has attacked the Australian Country party for neglecting the farmer! It does not make sense. I think the Government's record as far as primary producers are concerned is a very enviable one, and there is still new drive being applied to make the record even better in the future. the honourable members for Darling( Mr Clark), Robertson ( Mr Dean) and Hume( Mr Anderson), I wish to direct my remarks to the Department of Primary Industry. I do not wish to commence with any detailed attacks on State governments or previous speakers. I shall deal merely with one point raised by the honourable member for Hume wbo criticized the honourable member for Darling who had previously spoken on this subject. I usually speak before the honourable member for Hume and he usually has the opportunity to make personal remarks about me, I appreciate his highly combative character. I give him all'credit for it. He is one of those people who believe in a fight even if there is no particular point in indulging it it. On this occasion I will not take up my fifteen minutes by which he made about the honourable member for Darling. I i one is to deduce anything as to the character of State governments from the number of rural holdings in their States, I think it might be significant to point out that between the financial year 1938-39, the last full pre-war year, and 1955-56, the last year for which any figures are published by the Commonwealth Statistician in the "" Commonwealth Year Book "", the number of rural holdings increased in New South Wales and Queensland, the only States which throughout that time had Labour governments, and the number decreased in Victoria and South Australia, the only two States which throughout that time either had Liberal governments or had Liberal majorities controlling legislation in their upper bouses. In Tasmania, and Western Australia which, respectively, have had all",42,Pairs
134,( Mr Mcewen) The Whole Of Our Marketing,,44,Pairs
135,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [3.22],"Lik eLabour governments and mostly Labour governments, the number of rural holdings has remained stationary. The honourable member can find that information in the "" Commonwealth Year-Book"" for 1957 at page 881, I give that reference because I see that the honourable member for Canning( Mr useless to criticize the States for the internal Hamilton) will seek to follow me and he, similarly to the honourable member for Hume, very much likes a fight. I have not referred to the area of rural holdings, for it alone has the power to seek an amendment would be a singularly unprofitable pursuit to compare average holdings in Queensland, which is primarily a pastoral State, with average holdings in Tasmania which is primarily a horticultural one. It is the garden State. The matters that I wish to refer to in dealing with the Department of Primary Industry are matters that concern the Commonwealth. They are matters in which the States cannot be blamed, and in which the various honourable members who have spoken in this debate cannot be blamed. To illustrate my remarks, I shall refer to the to the abuse and exploitation which flow poultry industry since it suffers from all the from section 92. This is particularly so in disabilities suffered by any other primary industry and enjoys none of the government assistance received by nearly every other one. We have not yet been given the report of the Australian Egg Board for 1956-57. The report for the previous nnanciai year was tabled on 31st October, 1956, and we have been given pretty nearly all the primary industry reports for 1956-57 except that of the Australian Egg Board. Secondly, we have not been given the Bureau of Agricultural Economics' publication. "" The Egg Situation"", which, as honourable members will recall, came out in July, 1955, and July, 195*6, but did not appear in July, 1957. The egg industry singularly illustrates all in Victoria is the firm of Barrow Bros, in the difficulties which surround marketing in Australia. There are difficulties in marketing all the products of which we produce a surplus except when fhe overseas price is higher than the home price or where the Australian or United Kingdom Government subsidize our export losses. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has complete control over the marketing of exports. It controls the amount of exports of any commodity and the destination of the exports of any commodity. ,The Commonwealth, similarly, is in thei best position to gather and disseminate information on marketing conditions abroad as when the former Minister urged the egg industry to increase its exports for 1952-53. Next the Commonwealth alone is in the position to do anything about remedying the situation with regard to internal marketing. It is marketing situation, since Section 92' of the Constitution denies them power, as it denies us power. But the Commonwealth of the Constitution which would enable internal marketing to be carried on by tbe Commonwealth or by the States, or by the States with delegated powers from the Commonwealth. It is only by seeking such amendments, as was done by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) when he was Attorney-General in 1937, and by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) when he was Attorney-General in 1946, that we can correct the chaotic internal marketing conditions which exist in Australia. The egg industry is peculiarly susceptible Victorian, which is a very compact, highly developed State, where the producing areas are close to the borders of other States. These conditions have encouraged the growth of two bodies of exploiters, defying all marketing schemes sought by all their fellows in the industry. The first of them is Carter Bros., whose property is situated near Werribee. They are the largest and most efficient egg producers in Australia, and they send all their products across the border, thus exploiting section 92. In this way they make no contribution towards paying for the export losses which are inevitable in this and any other seasonal industry. The second of these exploiters Victoria, which has set up some of its employees as directors of a subsidiary company called the Tocumwal Trading Company Proprietary Limited. As its name implies, it is situated on the New South Wales side of the Murray River. Victorian producers are encouraged to sell their eggs to this company, which then sells the eggs back into Victoria, again avoiding all the equalization charges and pool levies which every other person in the industry who is any distance from a border has to pay in order that the Australian people may have a continuous supply of fresh eggs. As I have mentioned, the Commonwealth alone has power to regulate the .export market, and the Commonwealth alone can seek an amendment to the Constitution which is necessary if there is to be any decent, orderly internal marketing. In many forms of primary industry subsidies are necessary, and, in fact, one was paid by the Commonwealth to the egg industry on the eve of the 1954 elections. Despite an answer that was given to me by the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr the United States of America a financing McMahon) when I asked a question supplementary to one which the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) had asked the Minister, it is impossible for the States practice that has been followed by thc without our consent, to grant any aid to or bounty on the production or export of goods. It is possible for the Commonwealth alone to pay them. section 91, which provides that a marketing on 30th September Of this year. It will be subsidy can be paid. none has ever been paid. if they want to. sense of the laymen in this committee to see It is now appearing for the first time in for themselves what sections 90 and 91 trade journals of the industry. mean. get is that marketing control is provided for. there was a distinction between the two gentleman, as I recollect, a few weeks ago on burden. The honourable member knows if he would assist the passage through both that the other document was published. He Houses of this Parliament of something admitted it himself. All the information, that would certainly put the position comwith the exception of the report of the pletely beyond disputea resolution of both Australian Agricultural Council, is in that Houses authorizing the payment of such document, or is in the two documents. So subsidies by State governments to prothe honourable member knows that it was ducers within their borders. You know, published long ago. Mr Temporary Chairman, the general plan of the Constitution on the question of subFalkinder) -Order! The Minister must sidies and excise duties. Those two matters, allow the honourable member to make his which concern production within Australia, speech. should be on a Commonwealth basis, not on a compartmented basis between the the minds of honourable members, I believe. various States. If the Minister is right, It is true that a roneoed version was pubnothing is more certain than that there lished, or was given to eight persons whom would be a challenge in the High Court the Minister mentioned, and to technical of the validity of any State legislation that experts of an unspecified number. It was was passed, by Attorneys-General of States confidential. But a printed version is now that did not like to have other States payavailable. Do not let us be side-tracked. ing subsidies and so granting an advantage to some of Australia's primary producers and not to others. I have mentioned the three matters in which the Commonwealth is predominantly or solely responsible, and in which the States cannot be blamed. There are some other matters in which, I would suggest, the Commonwealth is in the best position to give assistance. One concerns financial assistance of the character of loans. In agency, the Farmers' Home Administration, has been set up by the union government,, the Governmenf at Washington. The United States Government in assisting industries such as the egg industry has been recommended as a procedure to be followed by the Australian Government, in a report on the commercial poultry industry remembered that the Minister for Primary the report had been published and widely circulated, but in fact it was on 30th the effect that the report was available, and The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr",44,Pairs

The-difference between this industry 'and Other seasonal industries is that eggs cannot be stored for more fhan ten ! or twelve weeks, if they are to remain fresh, whereas most other seasonal products, such as butter and cheese or -dried 'fruits, can be stored for years, if necessary. similar nature. But nobody has suggested, The public should be advised of the benefits of organized marketing. It should be shown that only the exploiter, the big producer and big retailer, benents from section 92 and that orderly marketing is necessary if huge fluctuations are not to occur in both the supply and the price of fresh eggs. The .surplus must be disposed of on the export markets, where inevitably losses are suffered, and all producers and consumers should share those losses. Those engaged in the industry should be assisted with advice. The Commonwealth is in the best position to give advice and, .to a certain extent, it is doing so. Those in the industry should be told how they can increase productivity and decrease costs by improving the layout of farms, the feeding of birds and the collecting of eggs. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member's time has expired. not something that I wish to discuss. No Sir WILFRID (Chisholm) [3.37] I wish to discuss items investigating the Public Service will look 85 to 10.7 :for tthe -Department /of Trade. aChose items -relate to the Tariff -Board and the ""Commercial Intelligence .Service. Towards the end of-.the nineteenth century, most trade expansionist .movements believed in the old adage that trade followed the flag. In this part of the twentieth century, the position has been reversed for the communistic, imperialistic expansionists and the belief .now is ithat the flag follows the trade. In -this .respect I should like to draw the attention of honourable members to the existing lack-of liaison between representatives .of the Department of External Affairs and the Department of Trade in overseas posts. This -problem has already caused considerable embarrassment .to the Government and is likely to cause more embarrassment in the future. In addition, it is a .continual source of danger to our international relationship. ""-Whether -the reversal of the old adage is true or not, the fact remains that nearly all -Communist countries are using trade as a -major weapon in fbe cold war, par; ticularly in Asia. Trade is used as a ""bait to catch the bigger fish that they wish to fry and consume a't leisure. Recently, we have had variations of the old nursery rirymes as a result of "" Sputnik"". For instance, we have had "" Little Bo-Bleep -has lost its JPeep "", and other rhymes of a "" ' Will you come into my trade parlour', said the red^backed spider to the fly "". Yet .that probably -sums up the position of many Of the trade relationships that exist in countries close to us. No sensible survey of any .trade .relationships or agreements with Communist countries can ignore the advice of expert after expert-that is, that such trade agreements are fundamentally political and only incidentally economic. How does that affect the appointment of our trade commissioners to overseas posts? Recently, the Department of Trade and Commerce was split into two. I do not say this witb any dhect reference to the department but, like the lowest forms of life, the one cell, when it splits, multiplies rapidly-and -that happened in both the Department of Trade and the Department of Primary Industry. That increase may or may not have been necessary, and it is KENT HUGHES doubt, ithe Cabinet sub-committee which is into it. On the other hand, the mcrease in the appointments to overseas posts has also been fairly rapid. That again may be necessary; I am not criticizing it. However, it brings into very sharp relief the necessity for the review of the method of operation of overseas posts. As I understand it, appointees are independent of the Public Service Board. I shall leave that for the day. Secondly, they are responsible to and report directly to the Minister, and, thirdly, they work almost entirely independently of their colleagues who are representatives of the Department of External Affairs in the particular country. Since the war, the line of demarcation between external affairs and trade has become more and more blurred as a result of the development of trade on a political rather than an economic basis. The question arises whether we should continue our overseas representatives in those two departments as completely separate entities or whether we should try to get, at least, a very much closer liaison so that the reports on trade questions should be received here at head-quarters concurrently with comments by the diplomatic representatives. In some ways, some of the postings are difficult to understand. I mention as an instance Hong Kong and Tokyo. In Hong Kong, which is a most important trade market and which is also one of the two most important listening posts in the Far East, we have a trade commissioner, an assistant trade commissioner, and, I think, a third secretary or junior officer of the Department of External Affairs. On the other hand, in Tokyo, where the volume of trade is very much larger, we have an ambassador and the ambassadorial staff, but only a commercial counsellor and an assistant trade commissioner. Why that should be so, I do not know. Personally, from the circumstances that exist in Hong Kong, I think it would be much better in some ways to reverse the position so that we would have high external affairs representation and a much lower trade representation, when we remember that trade with red China is, as I said, fundamentally politically based. Eighteen months ago, the trade commissioner at Hong Kong was sent by the Government on a visit to Peking, partly as a result of which, newspapers have reported, we are now to have a^jtrade delegation from red China. According to reports,, in the "" Far East Asian Economic Review "", which is published in Hong Kong, Opposition members, during their recent visit to red China, did much to further the visit of that trade delegation to Australia. I cannot understand the logic of the Opposition's argument that the trade agreement with Japan is bad and a great danger to Australian industry, but that increased trade with red China is everything to be desired. Everybody knows that the Chinese would undersell the Japanese, probably in the normal course of trade, but certainly in textiles. If they could not undersell the Japanese from the economic point of view, then they would use their political power, because this is all done through the importexport department. They would under-sell the Japanese any day of the week that tbey wanted to do so. Therefore, what logic there is in the arguments which members of the Opposition have been placing before the Parliament and the people of Australia with regard to trade with Japan and trade with red China, I just do not know. I am not aware of the position regarding the trade delegation, and whether it is actually coming here. I understand that it has not been invited officially, but if it is coming, one cannot entirely ignore it, although some people may be very embarrassed if they are asked to look after it. When we consider the question of increased trade with red China, the prospects are not very bright. We have to remember that, in the first place, between 75 per cent, and 80 per cent, of the present trade of red China is tied to Moscow in order to pay for industrial goods that the Chinese have already received, and for a very large amount of war-like goods which certainly do not contribute to peaceful coexistence with those countries. Secondly, there is the desire to gain political face, and in this respect I wish to remind honourable members that a part of Mao Tse-tung's programme, which was taken to Moscow by Chou En-lai in 1953, read as follows:, Diplomatic offensive: The United States must be isolated by all means possible. Britain must be placated by being convinced there is no possibility of settling the major issues between East and West and that the Communist and Capitalist countries can live in peace. Opportunities for trade will have a great innuence on the British mind. In other words, those who are advocating increased trade in this respect have to remember that one of the main items of foreign policy, and one of the considerations underlying the trade policy of red China, is the need to drive a wedge between the United States and Britain, in the first place, increase of trade, and I think he has been and between the United States and other countries, in the second place. I know that when I first directed attention to that policy I was not very popular in certain quarters, but it .has since been adopted as a fact and as the official policy. Finally, I think we have to recognize that honourable members very conclusively the trade dealings with red China would be used as a step towards demanding recognition of the existing government and weakening the anti-Communist front in South-East Asia. Therefore, I emphasize again that the appointment of a trade commissioner to Hong Kong should be looked at in the light that our representative ia Hong Kong should, first, be an expert in international relations, and secondly, have a knowledge of trade, instead of the position that applies removed the China differential, in accordat the present time. On this subject, I wonder whether the trade commissioner in Rangoon has been asked about, or has reported on, what has happened as a result of the trade treaty between Burma and red China, under which, for 20 per cent, cash and 80 per cent, barter, Burma agreed to sell fairly large quantities of rice to red China -It is well known-it has been reported in Far Eastern newspapers-that Burma has received in exchange many goods which are fairly highly pricedI think that that is probably a classic understatementand also many goods which she does not actually want, or does not want in the quantities in which they have been delivered. Then, to add insult to injury, her own rice has been exchanged for Ceylon rubber at less than the ruling market rate. In other words, the rice which has been sold or bartered to red China is used to undersell Burma in her own markets, as a result of which the whole Burmese economy has been considerably dislocated. Has the trade commissioner in Tokyo been asked about the result of the trade agreement between Japan and red China, whereby the Japanese were told that China required a large number of Japanese goods, particularly the products of secondary industries? Again, although the bait has been 'dangled, very little has materialized. All these facts must be taken into consideration by anybody who advocates that we should increase our trade with red China. I notice that the. honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) is in the chamber. As we know, he is very keen on such an one of the chief critics of the trade agreement with Japan. It would be very interesting to know how honourable members opposite square their arguments on these two points. I have referred to these incidents, and cited the facts, to indicate to necessity for the closest possible liaison between our representatives of the Department of External Affairs in overseas posts, and our trade commissioners or assistant trade commissioners. Such liaison does not exist at the present time, and I believe that its absence constitutes a very great danger. In conclusion, I point out that tbere is no embargo on the export of goods to Hong Kong at the present time. Hong Kong has ance with British policy, and therefore there is no actual bar, so far as the differential list is concerned, to prevent Australian goods from going into red China. We could apply an embargo, but I understand that that has not been done. I think it Would be far better if we were to be honest in declaring our policy rather than to resort to a subterfuge of this nature which will not endear us to our friends and will only gladden the hearts of our opponents. If our policy is that we do not agree with the abolition of the China differential, we should place an embargo on the type of goods, covered by the list, going to Hong Kong. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) has been dealing with the subject of trade with red China. Like the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), I think that we should trade with red China, and with Japan as well. In fact, we on this side of tbe chamber think that Australia should trade with everybody. We believe that there is some truth in the saying that if trade does not cross frontiers, armies will. If the honourable member for Chisholm refers to "" Hansard"", he will probably find that, in my speech on the",46,Pairs

I want to refer tocensorship, a subject required to bring the reasons for their deciwhich has been raised here in an incidental kind of way. It is a very difficult subject, as bonorable members on both sides of the House will agree. The honourable members for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) and Angas( Mr consider the subject of censorship from that Downer) both spoke of the matter in a general' way, and in much the same manner as honourable members from this side have discussed it. I am a little astonished by the one of the great problems of civilized attitude of honourable members opposite, an attitude that they sometimes take in connection with matters of this kind, in assuming that they personally are under attack. The Minister for Air( Mr Osborne) may rest assured that I do not want to lay at his distinguished door responsibility for everything that has happened' during the 57 years of censorship. The responsibility lies df objectionable publications or of any parts with this Parliament. I have been through the "" Hansard"" indexes for the last few years and have found that this subject has not come up for general, discussion for some years, and has, been mentioned only in an incidental way on relatively few occasions. That is a bad thing. Nobody denies the very great importance of the principles underlying it. I think it was the honourable member, for Balaclava, who said that the whole notion of censorship was against our ideas of freedistribution in Queensland of any literaturedom. The problem that faces us,, therefore, when we stand up to speak in this debate, is that we in fact know very little about the subject of Australian censorship. That is the first point I make. It is the very anonymity of the matter which put it in a poor light, so far as I am concerned and also, I think, so far as most honourable members are concerned. This anonymity is quite a serious thing. The important thing is not that the names of the books are not published. There are approximately 1,100 books on the list. Last night the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) asked whether the Minister could give the names of the members of the Literature Censorship Board and those of the appeal censors. The Ministers said that he could not recall them all and it would not' be reasonable to expect him to do so. But when a subjectbeen prohibited. Anybody who does any matter of this kind comes up for debate, tfie people wbo are charged with the responsibility of deciding what every one of us from the Chief Justice of the High Court to the humblest petitioner of this Parliament shall be allowed to read, should be sions before us for examination. To that extent I agree with honourable members on the Government side. It is very important that all of us should angle. Is there any party political element in censorship? We do not know. There is nothing new in censorship. It has been society. The various States have passed measures relating to obscenity. The Objectionable Publications Act of Tasmania provides for the setting up of a board, to be known as the Publications Board of Review; the functions of which areTo examine and review publications with the object of preventing the distribution in this State thereof. That board has to decide whether publications are objectionable. In Queensland, the Objectionable Literature Act provides for the establishment of a literature board of review. That act provides,, in Section 10(T) The board may by its order prohibit the distribution in Queensland of any literature for that that literature or some part thereof is, in the opinion of, the board objectionable. (3) (a) an order of the board prohibiting the (i.) Shall apply with respect to all copies of that literature including, in appropriate cases, all copies of every addition, part, number, or series thereof. The New South Wales Obscene and Indecent Publications Act defines all kinds of things which are to be prevented from being distributed. So, in Australia we have a system to prevent the distribution of literature of various sorts. We have assigned to the Customs Department, for some obscure reason-perhap s we could relate it to the constitutional setup-the task of deciding what kind of literature we shall read. All Australians are bothered about the anonymous, rather ambiguous and capricious nature of the censorship that prevails. Examples have been quoted of expensive editions being allowed entry whereas cheaper editions of the same works have reading at all will probably find in editions of Shakespeare, "" The Arabian Nights""', ""Pepys' Diary"", ""The London Journal"", and even parts of the Bible itself, passages which wouldprobably fall within the ambit of the acts that have been passed by State parliaments. We should facethis matter with a great deal of concern and bring the scrutiny of thesethings' into the light of day . I believe that the people respon1 sible fbr censorship should' have to table in Parliament a report of their activities so that it might be examined and debated here. After all, the censorship of literature and the decision of what shall' be distributed in the community is not a matter of literary criticism; it involves a different kind of judgment altogether. I believe that, on the whole, we start from the wrong end in dealing with this matter. The general attitude is that we must prevent certain: kinds of publications coming, in whereas: we should rather be primarily concerned to ensure freedom of publication. The only"" way in. which that can be done is through discussion in this Parliament.. Therefore, the Literature Censorship Board, the appeal censors or the Customs: Department must be placed in a position where its judgment can be open to debate in Parliament. I cannot see the rationale of preventing' the distribution of even the names of certain publications. This is a contentious subject, but I do a few matters on which I should like to not think that honourable members could reply. In Milton's, day the government was do much better than to read the work of not faced with problems with which modern John Milton entitled "" Areopagitica"", governments have to deal. To-day, there is written 300 years ago. Although he makes a great flood of commercialized vice, of no an eloquent and fluent appeal for the literary value whatsoever. The problem is licensing of writings, if we examine his to know how to control production of works we will find that even Milton fell volumes of that class of printed material from the Olympian heights of true tolerance about which there is a general consensus of when considering religious literature. In adult opinion that it is valueless and harmthis work he wroteI deny not, but that it is of greatest concernwords of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. ment in the. Church and Commonwealth, to have Evatt) last night, would not dare and would a vigilant' eye how books demean' themselves as not be permitted to abandon control over well as men;-, and. thereafter to confine, imprison, the flood of this sort of material which and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors. For books, are. not absolutely dead tbings, but do would appear in quantity if it were not for contain a potency of life in them to be as active some discrimination by customs officers, as that soul was whose progency they are; nay, who, at the same time, are very conscious they d'o preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy of the need to preserve the freedom of the and extraction of that living, intellect that bred them. I know they are as lively and as vigourously, public to read works of literary value. As productive, as those fabulous dragons' teeth; and I have already said; there is a large volume being sown up and down, may chance tospring of works of no literary value at all, about up armed, men. And yet,, on: the other, hand-, which people generally agree that their unless wariness be used, as good almost kill a appeal is only to theinnocent, or immature man as kill a good book. Every honourable member, ought to give serious, consideration to. this problem. A final note sounded by Milton in dealing with this matter reminds us. that when we set ourselves up as censors We are sitting in judgment on people who are fundamentally equal with ourselves and who are as capable of exercising the same kind of judgment that we seek to pass on their works. Perhaps, the eloquent words of Milton express this far better than I can. He wroteLords and Commonsof England, consider what Nation it is whereof ye are, and whereof ye are the governors: A Nation not slow and dull, but of a quick, ingeneous and piercing spirit, acute to invent, subtle and sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point, the highest that human capacity can soar to. An English judge, in discussing censorship in a famous case, had this to sayIf literature is to be controlled, having regard to the lowest common denominator in the land, then there is no literature at all.. I say again that censorship should be subject to the fullest examination in public debate, and that the decisions of censors on behalf of the people of this country should be open to the closest and most careful scrutiny.

Binns, former Commonwealth Parliamentary Librarian, a man of knowledge and long literary experience, with a trusted record as a true public servant of the Australian people. The members of the board are Professor E. R. Bryan, Professor of English at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and Professor D . P. Scales, Professor of Modern Languages at the Canberra University ' College. The appeals censor is Dr. L . H . Allen, emeritus lecturer in English and Latin at Canberra University College. He is very well known to many members of this House. He succeeded the late Sir Robert Garran as appeal censor. Members of the committee will not be surprised to know that Sir Robert Garran, even in his latest years, continued to exercise a judgment on these matters that was in the finest humanistic tradition. I recall one occasion during my period of responsibility in these matters when, there was a divergence of opinion among the members of the board on one of those difficult cases on which people do have conflicting views. Sir Robert Garran's view, as appeal censor, was exercised in favour of the admittance of the disputed book. WhatI want to emphasize is this: That those cases in which books are referred to the Literature Censorship Board are the cases in which some question has been raised as to the validity of their exclusion by the wide sieve of the customs examination. The method of ensuring that the wide sieve of the customs examination does not exclude things of literary value is dependent Customs Tariff Amendment (No. Amendment (No. 2); Customs Amendment (No. 1). In Committee of Ways and Means: [Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 6).] That the Schedule to the Customs Tariff 1933-1956, as proposed to be amended by Customs Tariff Proposals, be further amended as set out in the Schedule to these Proposals, and that on and after the eighteenth day of October, One thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, reckoned according to standard time in the Australian Capital Territory, Duties of Customs be collected in pursuance of the Customs Tariff 1933-1956 as so amended. 2.

The fact that protests such as that over the exclusion of "" The Catcher in the R y e "" are made is not evidence of the stupidity of the system. It is evidence that the system is working, and that an article of value is re-examined by the appropriate authority and, generally, is re-admitted. I cannot pursue this matter any further in committee. I myself agree with the honourable member for Wills that some purpose could be served by having a wider examination of this matter at present. The Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Henty) is well aware of that himself, as is obvious from a press statement that his department issued on 3rd October last, which readThe Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Henty) conferred to-day with the Literature Censorship Board and the Appeal Censor and discussed with them aspects of an overall review of the existing long standing procedures on Literature Censorship.

A "" Summary of Alterations "", which is now being circulated to honourable members, sets out in concise and convenient form the new rates of duty as compared with those now in operation.

The tariff protection provided by the new amendments covers various metal-working ..grinding .machines, a range of chemicals .mainly of the insecticidal and weed-killing types, slide fastener tape and cycle saddles. An alteration to the wording of the item dealing With pneumatic rubber tyres is also proposed to remove any doubts which may be thought to exist concerning the tariff classification of tubeless tyres. s Gne of the i more important amendments -is -the proposal to impose protective duties on certain insecticidal and weed-killing type chemicals.

Another important amendment is also proposed in respect of the duties applying to imported natural and synthetic rubber and rubber latex. This action has been decided upon by the Government after considering a report by the Tariff Board dealing with the measure of assistance that should be accorded to the Papua and New Guinea rubber industry. Although as from to-morrow the present duty on rubber from all countries other than the Territory of Papua and New Guinea will be increased from 2d. per lb. under the Customs Tariff to 4d. per lb., concurrent action is being taken to remove the 10 per cent, ad valorem primage -duty presently operating. This will actually result in a reduction of the import duty payable. . The primage of .10 per -cent, on present prices considerably exceeds the amount of increased duty now imposed, so that a general reduction of duty payable on imported rubber will be effected by these proposals. The tariff amendments also include provision for the by-law admission iof natural and synthetic rubber and Tubber latex at a concessional rate of duty of 2d. per l b . ' in approved .circumstances.

This is a necessary amendment to ensure that Territory rubber will continue to be admitted into Australia at the same rate of duty as at present. In its report on rubber, the Tariff Board reports of the Tariff Board on the following recommended a substantial reduction in the subjects:rates of duty, but recognized that, in view of the revenue implications, it might not be possible for the Government to implement its recommendations in full immediately. The board envisaged that the reductions recommended might, therefore, need to be implemented by stages. The Government's present proposals are the furthest it feels able to go at this time. These proposals represent a significant cost saving for local industry at a manageable cost to revenue. At the same time, the duty reductions will represent significant concessions to major suppliers of natural rubber to the Australian market. The Federation of Malaya, supplying some 90 per cent, of total natural rubber imports, will be the major beneficiary. Moreover, rubber accounts for almost 85 per cent, of our total imports from Malaya.

160,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane),"The shipping companies employ the pool to do most of their work around the wharfs. It has effected the quick turn-round of ships thus saving many thousands of pounds for the shipowners. In addition, the Brisbane branch of the pool has agencies along the coast of Queensland from Brisbane to as far north as Cairns. There again the pool has done a very fine job, so much so that the harbour boards in Townsville, Rockhampton, Mackay and Cairns, have made use of it to help keep their ports clear. Apart from those people, many private industrial concerns have also engaged the pool, and every one of them has protested very strongly against the Government's decision to dispose of the pool. Speaking again from the Queensland point of view, I am informed that every member from Queensland, with the exception of two, has replied to the employees who wrote asking for their opinion on the disposal of the pool, to the effect that they oppose its disposal and would protest strongly to the Government. I hope that now an opportunity has presented itself, those honourable members will carry out their promise to the employees concerned. In this matter I think I can speak for every other Labour member in this chamber. We replied pointing out that we realized the value of the pool, not only to the shipping companies and the harbour boards, but also to many hundreds of other private industries. The pool has been employing a comparatively large body of loyal employees. Otherwise it would not be in the position in which it is to-day. The fear of dismissal has been hanging over the heads of employees now for the last four or five years. It is four or five years since the Governlend-lease agreement between the United ment first mentioned that it intended to disStates Government and the Australian Gopose of the pool. Evidently, the Government was not able to do that because it could not get any organization to take the pool over on the specified conditions. Therefore, as I have said, the employees have been carrying on under these conditions for the past four or five years and they cost the Government very much, if anything have carried out their work faithfully and loyally to this Government. The Government should never forget that. In about June of this year the Government again decided that it would dispose of the pool. It placed advertisements in the press calling for tenders for the purchase of this project. The employees, who know the workings of the pool and the way in which it operates on behalf of the public in Queensland and other States, realized the value of this project not only to employers in Queensland, but also to themselves as employees. They decided to form a cooperative company and to tender for the purchase of this wonderful project. Immediately they decided to do that they were able to collect from amongst themselves sufficient money to pay the deposit on the tender price of the project. As a matter of fact, the amount that was required in accordance with the Government's specification was over-subscribed. The employees have now tendered for the purchase of the pool. After all, they would not have done that with their own money if they had not known how valuable the pool has been, is, and will continue to be to the people who use its equipment. However, they have guaranteed, in accordance with the requirements of the Government, that if their tender is successful they will be in a position to provide the balance of the money which the Government has determined as the value of the equipment. Actually, this equipment was not purchased by the Government out of any particular funds allocated for that purpose. The pool was set up during the war by the Chifley Labour Government in order to assist the quick' turn-round of ships and to do other work which, as I have said, it has done. The pool was made up of handling equipment left behind by the American authorities. It had been delivered to Australia by the American Government in order to assist the American authorities' here during the war. As a result of the vernment, the equipment was taken over because, I understand, the Australian Government was on the right side of the lendlease ledger. As I have said, no money was appropriated for the purpose of setting up this pool. Therefore, the pool did not at all. As I have said, the employees have been very loyal to the Government. It is now three months since the Government decided to call tenders for the purchase of this project. Those employees are still carrying bn just as though nothing had happenedjust, as though their positions were not in jeopardy at all. They are carrying on in the hope that their tender will be successful. I do not know whether the Government has received one,, two or a dozen tenr -ders for this project but, no matter how many have been received, the Government should give the employees who have registered this company preference over other tenderers provided that all things are anything like equal. The employees have done awonderful job. If the pool is sold to someone else we do not know whether the new proprietor will carry on in the same way as the pool has been carried on since it was first brought into being. I am satisfied that if that is not done the shipping ment of Territories in the present grouping companies and all others concerned will lose a very valuable project. will be affected. honourable member fbr Petrie( Mr Hulme) pointed out, the cannery at Northgate makes extensive use of the pool', and many other outside industries have also used it. All speak very highly of what if has done. I appeal to the Government, now that it has definitely decided to dispose of the pool, to give to the employees who have been so loyal for many years,, an opportunity to continue it. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr easy talk, there bas been a kind of disposiFreeth);^-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Territories) [4.43] -We are debating,, at. the moment, the estimates for a group of four departments-the Department of Social Services, the Department of Shipping and Transport, the Department of Territories, and the Department of Immigration. I want to refer briefly to the estimate for, the Department of Territories. I would like to point out that this proposed vote of a comparatively small sum for the Department of Territories is not the main item in the Estimates for the territories. In Part3 of the Estimates, at page 144 and on following pages of the printed parliamentary papers, appears the item of approximately £30,000,000 for the terrir tories; whereas, at the moment we have before us an item, of £263,000 for the Department of Territories. Although it is a matter entirely for your discretion, Mr Temporary Chairman, I respectfully suggest to you that at this stage we should not attempt to have a debate on the whole gamut of activities in the territories administered by the Commonwealth, butthat we should reserve that debate for Part, 3 of the Estimates and confine ourselves narrowly at this point to a debate on the Department of Territories, located in Canberra, and the comparatively restricted activities carried on by that department.. I feel sure that this procedure will be more satisfactory to honourable members, because it will enable them to have a single debate on Part 3, whereas when attempting to deal with the Departthey will, be taking part in a debate which covers, three other departments as well. the other aspects, of the Department of Territories later? debate on Part3 of the. Estimates. Confining my remarks to the section of the Department of Territories covered: by the item before the Chair,. I should like to make one point briefly. I do so because there has been a certain amount of cheap and easy talk to the general effect that the territories are run from Canberra, and that there should be more decentralization of control. Accompanying that cheap and tion to blame the public servants in Canberra for anything that goes wrong, while withholding from them the credit for anything that goes right. In order to put matters in a proper perspective I should like to direct the attention of the House to two sets of figures. One set relates to the financial provision that is made for the territories. In the departmental vote that we are now considering, we have a total provision of £273,000. In. the other votes that are applied to expenditure in the territories themselves, that is, in the Northern Territory, in Papua and New Guinea, in Nauru, in Norfolk Island, in Cocos Island, we have a total of about £20,000,000. This is actually spent in the territories and applied to purposes in the territories. The work on which this money is spent is carried out in the territories themselves. To make a comparison on one useful index, the salaries actually paid to the",60,Estimates 1957 58

Those figures are significant. mates there is shown a total of £11,000,000, not £20,000,000. able member is wrong, with all respect. The total for Part3 is given as £30,000,000, and we must subtract from that approximately £11,000,000 for the Australian Capital Territory. The remainder is the money applied to purposes in the Northern Territory, Papua and New Guinea, Norfolk Island, Cocos Island and so on. To -continue with the point I was trying to make, those figures regarding the nnanciai provision have alongside them figures showing the disposition of staffs actually employed in territorial work. In the Department of Territories in Canberra we have a staff of 213 officers. In the Northern Territory itself the staff .totals 738, and in Papua and New Guinea 2,700. [Quorum formed.] I was making the point that the major proportion of the staffs employed in territorial administration is employed in the territories themselves. That is the result of a consistent and deliberate policy of decentralization in administration. I can illustrate self-contained territorial administrations. this by givingfiguresshowing the changes in the strength of the staffs during my own administration. The staff of the Department of Territories in Canberra has grown, between May, 1951 and June, 1957, from 169 to 213; in the Northern Territory, from 451 to 738; and in Papua and New Guinea, from 1,400 to 2,700. Translating those figures into percentages, we find that the Canberra staff increased in that period by 26 per cent., the Northern Territory staff by 63 per cent., and the Papua and New Guinea staff by 93 per cent. The committee can see clearly the way in which we are concentrating our efforts in, and directing our expansion into, the territories themselves and not head-quarters. BecauseI have mentioned some rather large increases in the numbers of public servants employed in the territories, some honourable members and the outside public may revive the old cry about the growth of the Public Service. 1 should point out in passing that this increase in staff has followed a remarkable increase in activity in fhe territories. Population has increased greatly, developmental activity has expanded, production and industrial activity have increased in all the territories, not twofold, but in some items as much as five-fold, and in many items three-fold. It is because of that great expansion in activity in the territories themselves that it has been necessary to increase the numbers of public .servants. Moreover, when we started off with what was admittedly a neglected area of the Australian sphere of responsibility, and attempted to live up to our responsibilities with regard to those territories, we had to make these increases. My main purpose in this debate, however, is to point to our deliberate policy of decentralization of effort, to show that this decentralization is taking place and that the work we are trying to do in territorial administration is concentrated in the territories themselves and not at head-quarters in Canberra. Having said that, I should like to indicate briefly what the Department of Territories actually does. The portfolio of Territories differs somewhat from other portfolios in the Commonwealth structure of government. The usual structure consists only of a Minister and a department. In the case of Territories there is a Minister and a department, and alongside the department are In the case of Papua and New Guinea and of the Northern Territory, the territorial administrations have themselves a structure closely resembling that of the governmental organization in any of the Australian States, although at this stage, of course, on a rather smaller scale. A Minister for Territories stands in rather an unusual position, inasmuch as he has both a Department of Territories and two rather large territorial administrations preparing and submitting matter to him. In that structure of administration, the Department of Territories located in Canberra, with a branch office in Sydney, carries out the customary functions of a department in providing services for its Minister, in acting as a .secretariat for its Minister, in preparing recommendations",62,Estimates 1957 58
166,Mr Thompson,In Part3 of the Esti,63,Estimates 1957 58
167,Mr Hasluck,"No, I think the honorand submissions of various kinds and assisting its Minister in the performance of his duty. In addition, it carries out certain services for the territories, such as the procurement of supplies, arrangement for the shipping of those supplies, the recruitment of staff and a multitude of matters of that kind. It also acts as a channel of communication so that submissions and recommendations prepared in the territories are channelled through the Department of Territories in Canberra towards the Minister's table. Finally, the department performs a number of special functions in relation to the British Phosphate Commissioners, the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission, the Australian School of Pacific Administration, the South Pacific Commission, our international obligations to the Trusteeship Council and other matters of that kind. Overall, the department attempts to carry out a job of assembling and co-ordinating information which has a common application to all the territories. From time to time, as the occasion arises, officers of the Department of Territories have been used at my direction to carry out what might be called inspectorial or expert functions in the territories. It has happened that a territorial administration, not having the particular kind of expertness that is required on its own staff, has gratefully accepted the temporary aid of senior officers sent from the Department of Territories to help them through a particular difficulty. It has happened that, ""if some particular matter comes under notice that seems to require, in the ordinary course of administration, examination and report, a senior officer of the Department of Territories has been called upon to make that examination and report. BeforeI conclude, I should like to pay territories. I am sure that that will be so a tribute to the self-effacing way in which with the Northern Territory. the officers of the department have applied themselves over long hours and with a great Minister on his assertion concerning the deal of capacity to assisting the territorial workings of the department in Canberra as administrations to meet their special diffiit affects the Northern Territory. Remote culties and to carry out their responsicontrol has the effect of slowing down the bilities. I fear that the officers at headadministration of the Northern Territory. quarters, like all head-quarters officers, have I have no reflection to make on the departsometimes received undue criticism simply mental officers in Canberra. I know that, because they happen to be at head-quarters. to the best of their ability, they do what The same sort of thing happened during the they can to perform the functions for which war. The front-line soldier thought that they were engaged in speeding up or every one at the base was probably a fool, smoothing the administration of the and the brigade commander probably thought that he would have won far more battles had it not been for some one at Melbourne who was impeding the operation of this genius. The same sort of thing happens in public administration. Having had the opportunity to observe these matters with what I hope is a certain amount of detachment, and having some knowledge of what happens both in the territories and in Canberra, I should say that the officers of the Department of Territories in Canberra deserve far more credit than they customarily receive for the work that they do on behalf of and in the interests of the territories. It is a selfeffacing work which never comes to the 1 front, but it is work which is constantly done with considerable capacity. I know that, like senior public servants in other departments, the administrations of the territories and the people of the territories owe a lot to the senior score or so of officers in Canberra who have made'"" this their r special field, who have made this their constant care and who, year in and year out, have applied themselves with singleminded devotion to trying to do the best job they can to assist the territorial administrations to make further progress and to do their own work better. -As the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) wishes, I shall confine my remarks to the estimates for the Department of Territories and shall take part in the broader debate when Part3 comes before the committee for consideration. Last year we had a general debate without any restriction, but I think that this procedure will work quite well and will probably allow a much wider discussion on tbe affairs of the At the outset, I join issue with the",63,Estimates 1957 58
168,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory) [5.0].,"Northern Territory. However, the system creates delay in the smooth, efficient and speedy administration of the Territory. A few instances which illustrate this point have been referred to me. I have been told that the Public Service-no t necessarily the Department of Territories-slow s down matters concerning the Northern Territory. 1 instance the appointment of officers. The lands section of the Northern Territory Administration has considerable difficulty in getting surveyors. The appointments are made by the Public Service Board, but months elapse between the time applications are received and the time appointments are approved. In many instances, the surveyors have become tired of waiting and have taken other employment. Surveyors are key men in the Northern Territory because, until block surveys, mining surveys or lease surveys are made, the whole process of settlement and development is held up. That applies also to the construction of roads, which is delayed until adequate staff surveyors are provided. I do not think that I would be wrong in saying that the work of the Northern Territory is years in arrears because of the lack of appointments to these vital positions. It is a fact-and I think it is well known to the Minister-that this year it is hoped to throw open some pastoral land. This occupied for many years by temporary will be the first pastoral land thrown open officers. in the Northern Territory for four or five years. One would think that there would many temporary civil servants in Darwin be plenty of land available for settlement and Alice Springs. I have received from in the Northern Territory, but if a person Mr W. Wheatley, the secretary of the tries to obtain a block for either agricultural Federated Clerks Union in Darwin, a letter or pastoral purposes he is told that no land dated 4th October, referring to a meeting is being thrown open for settlement. Much held in Darwin last month. It reads, in of it cannot be made available for settlepartment because surveys and other preliminaries have not been carried out, Mr R. W. Holt -I s this land thrown open for settlement by Australians? hope that four or five lots will be made available this year. It is obvious that remote control from Canberra slows down land settlement in the Territory. There are other matters, of course, which also have a delaying effect. For instance, departmental heads in the These officers have been recruited since the Territory prepare estimates and works proend of World War II . to fill positions in the grammes which are sent to the Department Administration, and, as I have said, for the of Territories in Canberra. They then go to the Cabinet, and so on. In many instances, the original programmes, as drawn up by the officers in the Territory, are drastically altered. I believe that that position would be overcome if the Northern Territory Legislative Council were permitted to draw up and approve, within financial limits set by the Treasurer, programmes of works. Matters connected with appointment and salaries, are, of course, of considerable importance to administrative officers in the Territory. In this respect, I think that greater control should reside in the Territory itself. The conditions under which civil servants work is a current matter of concern. In the past, when suitable permanent officers were not available, a considerable degree of reliance was placed on the recruitment and employment of temporary officers to do the work of administration. In the main, those officers have done excellent work in the various services. I understand that now, however, directions have gone out to the effect that many temporary civil servants in the Territory are to be replaced by permanent officers from other parts of Australia. I take it that Canberra will provide a considerable proportion of the officers to fill positions that have been This matter is of the utmost concern to Members expressed concern at the Uncertainty and insecurity of their positions. At present there is no sense of security for temporary officers and this is causing much concern to the union in respect that many members, especially those who are married with' families and those renting government homes, have with them the continual worry of not knowing from one month to another whether they may possibly be put off. This is causing the health of many of our members to deteriorate. Many of them are around the fifties, many of them returned soldiers from both world wars and they have the feeling of no security for either themselves or their families.",64,Estimates 1957 58
169,Mr Nelson,"Ballots are held. Wemost part they have done so with distinction to both themselves and the Administration. Having done the spade work on the resettlement of that part of Australia after the devastation of war, and having put up with primitive conditions, they are to be replaced by permanent officers who have not had previous experience of service in the Territory. I think that the Minister should look into this matter with a view, at least, to having these officers assured of permanent employment elsewhere, if they cannot be given permanence in the civil service. Some of these officers have been told that they had the opportunity to qualify for permanent appointment under the Public Service Act, but I think that honourable members readily will appreciate that many of them are getting on in years and are in no position to recommence their schooling. Others have not had the necessary basic education to enable them to qualify for permanent appointment. At least, they have not had a great deal of theoretical education, but they have had considerable practical experience. In my opinion, they have demonstrated conclusively, by the manner in which they have performed their duties, that they are at least the equal of any permanent civil servants who might replace them. I think that the test in these matters should be whether the officers concerned are competent to do the job that is required of them. In many instances, these officers have built homes, in Darwin, while others occupy government homes. It will be a definite hardship if they are suddenly thrown on the scrap heap and replaced by other officers. As honourable members no doubt appreciate, conditions in Darwin and Alice Springs are different from those in most other parts of Australia. Opportunities for employment in those places are strictly limited'. I suggest that it would be a greathardship for a person who had been employed for. many years in a clerical position, in the Northern Territory Administration suddenly to have to undertake mining, or pick and shovel work on the roads. His previous work would, have rendered him entirely unsuited for occupations of that kind. If the Minister cannot remove the uncertainty which hangs over these officers by having, them appointed permanently under the Public Service Act, I suggest that the difficulty could be surmounted by establishing a Northern Territory Public Service, such as that which existed some years ago. Ea the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, there is a completely autonomous Public Service, and I think that a similar organization should be established in the Northern Territory. I know that, in theory, the present position permits of interchange of officers between the various departments. It is said that that system serves to keep the officers up to date, but that is not always so, because it is sometimes found that when civil servants in the Northern Territory apply for positions in, say, the Australian Capital Territory, they are unsuccessful because of their classification. Departmental heads in the Australian Capital Territory are reluctant to disturb the order of seniority in their own departments to make room for civil servants who have been employed in the Northern Territory. Some of these officers, because of hardship or sickness, have been advised to leave the Northern Territory and they have tried to find positions in their own classifications in the southern States. Tbey have been offered positions at a lower classification because none of similar classification are open to them. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. to address myself to the proposed vote for the Department of Immigration. Since 1947, approximately 1,200,000 people have been brought to Australia as immigrants. That is one of the great facts that is now embedded in Australian, history. It is no small undertaking for a young, country with a population, of 8,000;000or 9;Q00,000 to plan for the mass movement and accommodation of an additional 1,200,000 people. For a comparable example, one has to turn to the history of the United States of America. That country, over a period of 60 or 70 years, managed to increase its population by way of immigration, at the rate of approximately 3 per cent, per annum. To me, it is almost inconceivable that 1,200,000 people could be brought to this countiy without a display of great organizing ability, patience and understanding on the part of those responsible here.

That was the starting point of its great strength and capacity. For my part, I see no reason to be timid about bringing people to this country. We need many more of them. I should, like to make a suggestion to the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Townley) and Nationality Act be made. I propose to adumbrate a case well known to the department which illustrates the need for the: amendment I have in mind. In 1947, a. Now, a curious situation has developed... One of the children, for whom this man such as a citizen of the State, but I employ it merely to illustrate my point. of the Queensland lower courts, and as a This case reveals a rather interesting conflict between Commonwealth and State electoral laws because, as I understand the Commonwealth Electoral Act, a person is entitled to vote in a Commonwealth election provided he or she is eligible to vote for the more populous legislature of the State in which he or she resides. In any event, this woman was struck from the roll. It seems to me an extraordinary circumstance, a fantastic conflict, that she can enjoy a right in a State and yet not enjoy a similar and comparable right in the Commonwealth. This conflict is unknown to the United Kingdom authorities now. It was one of the reasons why the following section was inserted in the Adoption Act in 1950Where an adoption order is made in respect of an infant who is not a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, then, if the adopter, or in the case of a joint adoption the male adopter, is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, Division 116 of the Estimates deals with the infant shall be a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies as from the date of the order. In other words, from the date of the order an infant born abroad and adopted by a British subject acquires British nationality. I want to suggest seriously to the Mimster that we have before us a conflict which, although I suppose it is small in the overall scheme of things, is signincant. The Minister is a kindly man, an understanding man, and I appeal to him to consider urgently the ramifications of this conflict. IfI may give another illustration of it-althoug h this may be going to the extremeI point out that it would be possible for a person residing in a State to institute and complete adoption proceedings for the adoption of a person who was not eligible to be, and, for that matter, not welcomed by the Commonwealth as a citizen. Where is the end to it? Surely it is not too much to ask that this further manifestation of a conflict between State and Commonwealth law be ironed out by a sensible, rational and realistic approach to the issue. Honourable members may say that there tually to become a new State the first steps is a very simple solution to the case that I towards that end should be taken now. I have mentioned. They may say, "" Let the am not here to espouse the cause of new young woman apply for naturalization"". states in the Northern Territory or in any Of course, that is perfectly simple. But other part of Australia, for I believe that the man who adopted this young woman many constitutional problems would have as an infant is a man of great pertinacity to be resolved before such states could come and obstinacy and at the same time a man into existence. of great character. He takes the view that Northern Territory of its quota of senators when he completed the adoption proceedings, when he brought those kiddies to Queensland, and the Queensland authorities recognized them as being under his control and guidance, the children acquired citizen rights. That is his attitude of mind, and 1 believe that it is perfectly understandable. Although some people may disagree witb his point of view I do not believe that any one could say justly that he is not entitled to it. I appeal to the Minister and his department to give earnest and serious consideration to amending the Australian act in the same way as the British Adoption Act was amended in 1950, so that when a person living in Australia adopts a kiddie from outside Australia, and the adoption order is completed, the child will assume the same status, rights and responsibilities as any Australian citizen. what is the nerve centre of the whole administration of the Northern Territory. It is also fundamental to the question of tbe future of the Territory. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) in the course of his thoughtful remarks addressed himself to the need for local autonomy, for the right of the people in the Territory to pursue the course of government that they believe to be best suited to the Territory. We are indebted to the Minister for his remarks, despite the fact that at the beginning he restricted to some extent the normal course of a debate on the Northern Territory. I support most enthusiastically the case made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, for I believe, as has been expressed before, that no government, good or bad, is better than local self-government. Some time ago it was reported in the press that the Minister had expressed the view that the Northern Territory should be made a new State at the earliest opportunity. If the Northern Territory is evenThe sending by the",66,Estimates 1957 58
171,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [5.29],"to this place, and all the other problems inherent in the establishment of a new State in the Northern Territory, are so much in the future and so visionary that I think they can be dismissed at once. In the course of his remarks this afternoon the Minister set out to prove that what is happening here in Canberra is unimportant, first, because a greater sum of money is being spent in the Northern Territory than in Canberra and, secondly, because the number of people engaged in government in Canberra is small whilst the number so engaged in the Northern Territory is great. I do not think that that proves the Minister's case at all. The important aspect of this matter is that in Canberra we have the people who direct policy in the Northern Territory. Canberra is the nerve centre of Northern Territory thinking and Northern Territory attitudes. The honourable member for the Northern Territory, in dealing with this matter, pointed out very clearly what happens in regard to delay in making appointments to the staffs of the various government departments in the north. Reference has to be made to Canberra by the officials in the Northern Territory, from the Administrator down, before any decision can be reached on the appointment of the most humble person to the staff of a department there. That is not a very desirable state of affairs, local self-government established. How can and the evil of delay and procrastination is one of the matters that ought to be resolved and overcome. The Northern Territory will never be great, will never expand, will never develop, and we will not be able to build up in that vast area of half a million square miles a consciousness, an attitude, an awareness, and a responsibility, if direction is to come forever from Canberra. I put it to honourable members that direction from Canberra is stultifying the development of the north, and I most enthusiastically support the proposal made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory that the old practice of having a Northern Territory Public Service be tried once again. I believe that there is very much to commend this proposal, and very little to be said against it. In the first place, if there were a Northern Territory administration and a Northern Territory Public Service people who feel dedicated to render service to the Northern Territory would be eager to go to the Territory because they would know that they were going to an area where they desired to serve. What is the position at present? Many public servants from southern and eastern States, and from the west, too, go to the Northern Territory as a matter of course and serve a period of time there in order to qualify for promotion to some other field of government activity. I am not saying a word against the excellent public servants who are in the Territory at present, the great majority of whom I admire. I wish to pay a tribute to them and acknowledge their service to the Territory and to Australia generally. But I think it is wrong that we should have people going to the Northern Territory as mere time-servers in order to qualify for promotion to better Public Service positions in the southern and eastern States. I think that the public servants in the Northern Territory should be merged into a Northern Territory Public Service. One of the evils of administration is the fact that we have a Director of Works and an Administrator. I am not quite certain of the practice at the present time, but' some time ago the Director of Works, with respect to Northern Territory activities, had authority to spend much greater sums of money than had the Administrator. I should like to see some firm system of this be done? In the first place, I believe that the Legislative Council should be made more than a mere front for democracy in the north. It should become real and effective. It should be given opportunities to translate into legislative effect the desires and the aspirations of the people of that area, lt is pleasing to note that Darwin has a city council. That is wholesome, progressive government, which will be applauded by every thoughtful person in this country, and I congratulate the Mayor of Darwin and the members of the town council for the manner in which they have accepted their responsibilities, and are discharging their duties, in that great city, the front door to Australia. Why is it that votes for this department in previous years have not been spent? It is not because of the clash between those on the spot and those here in Canberra; between those with local authority and those exercising remote control? The Estimates that we are considering at the present time reveal very clearly that--quite a'considerable amount of money which will be voted this year -is merely a re-vote from llast 'year. ' I believe 'that ithat js brought about by ithis clash of -authority. If the Treasury could break new .ground and give ithe Minister for Territories ;( Mr Hasluck) a Budget for his Territories and permit 'bim, with the democratically-organized government of the north, to determine just 'how that vote ; should be spent, I 'think it would Ibe a much more 'effective way of dealing with the affairs of -the Territory than to allow some officer in the Treasury, however competent be may be, to determine matters such as this. They 'can be determined to 'the best advantage only by (those who -live in the area, who understand and appreciate its problems, and can be 'guided -by the person who is 'responsible to the Parliament, namely, the Minister. It is for -this Parliament to decide whether a better system is to be -instituted. The challenge of the Northern Territory will not be successfully taken >up as long as we are content, year by year, at Budget time to vote on expenditure that -has already been decided upon by some one who is not on the spot. I doubt very much whether the (officer who makes suoh decisions is advised or guided by the Minister as to bow the money should be spent. I suggest to the committee that the vote for the Territory should be commensurate with the national income and the productivity of the north. Those who have considered the development of the north cannot he unmindful of the fact that the mining industries yield something like £4,0OO,OO6, and -the pastoral industry something like £2,000,000 a year. The north in its own way raises something like £900,000 in revenue. These matters sbould be considered as a whole. A Budget should be drawn up and presented to the Minister and bis elected representatives in the north. The honourable member for the Northern Territory should be clothed with full voting rights in this Parliament. It is idle to talk about giving a vast tract of land like the Northern Territory, with fewer people than Goulburn, Bathurst, or Lithgow, the status of a State while the honourable member for the Northern Territory has no right to vote on most of the matters that come before flue Parliament. There are problems, but tbey can be resolved provided we face them fairly and squarely. m./BRIMBLECOMBE !(Maranoa)?[5.413. I propose to .confine my remarks to the 'Northern Territory. At Tthe outset, I want to pay a itribute to '.those people holding responsible positions iin the Northern Territory for the wonderful enthsuiasm they display and the wonderful jdb they are ; doing ""under adverse conditions. When fl was in the Territory recently-and it was not my first trip; I -have been there several ! time.

They were -keen -to do the work, and they wanted to know tfhe reason sfor the delay in 'granting leases to them. I do not know the reason. Perhaps the Minister for Territories ;( Mr Hasluck.) will be able ito explain that. I believe that all these problems connected with the north stem from the remote control here in Canberra. I am not condemning the people in the department. I ! believe *hat they do a good -job, as far as they are able under the policy of the Government, but it is something the ""Minister should look at in order to ascertain Whedlher there 'is some better method whereby decisions could be made more expeditiously so that the Territory can be developed in the'way it should be developed. If we are to hold Australia, Parliament must take more interest in this wonderful Territory of more than 500,000 square miles. The time is not far distant when something will have to be done about giving the Territory the status of a State and providing it with .self-government. It is becoming one of the wealthiest mining areas in the Commonwealth, .and the anticipated revenue from that area is one good reason why :the people on the spot should be able to make their own decisions an ithe interests of the residents and in conformity with existing local conditions. That cannot be done effectively by remote control from Canberra. At present more and more people are goes back into the development of the touring the Northern Territory, including Northern Territory.

172,Mr Bird (Batman) [5.50],"I desire tofilling in a pothole here or there, or by just filling up the edges. Something more tangible than that is necessary. At the present time the roads systems, in the main, are in the hands of the various State governments, but those systems to-day need replanning on a scale far beyond the States' resources. nationallyfinancedprogramme; and by that I mean the Commonwealth must come to the party. There has been too much political sidestepping in relation to this all-important matter. I realize that under the Constitution the Commonwealth has no power to deal with roads. I can quite understand the position that applied in 1900, in the era of the horse and buggy and dray and that sort of thing when a motor car was a matter of great curiosity. Roads at that time did not constitute a problem of national dimensions. To-day, the States, which have been given the power and the authority to control the roads system, find they have no power to raise finance for road construction by the imposition of customs and excise duties. That power is not vested in the States. Therefore, they cannot raise this money to be hypothecated for road construction or reconstruction. The Commonwealth has this power. As a result of the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act, which has been in existence for over 30 years, the Commonwealth raises money by means of a tax upon petrol, and a certain percentage of the money is handed over to the States. For many years, I have contended that this Government and previous governmentsI make no exceptions-hav e not carried out the intentions with which the act was passed in 1926. Perusal of the "" Hansard"" report of the debate on that measure leads one to the inescapable conclusion that only enough money was raised then to give to the various States £2,000,000 for roads. The Commonwealth decided that it would give the States £2,000,000 and that it would fix the tax on petrol at the amount per gallon required to raise that money. Nevertheless, the States now receive only two-thirds of the petrol tax revenue. I was very disappointed to hear the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) say in his Budget speech that this year the Commonwealth would retain £17,000,000 which, in my opinion, should be given to the States for road purposes. Whilst everybody agrees that there is a road problem, apparently they do not agree on the solution to the problem. Many much-ballyhooed meetings have been held. Various authorities meet at regular intervals at a very high level for the purpose of putting forward positive plans for a national The problem calls for a road programme. We have been told for years that the solution to the problem is just around the corner. I thought, when the Australian Transport Advisory Council got to work some years ago and informed all and sundry that the first item on its agenda was the solution of the roads problem, that something would be done. The council has had numerous meetings. After each meeting those who are interested, as I am, read the reports of the proceedings. It then appears that the council has dodged the question and put it on the agenda for the next meeung. On each occasion one thinks that at the next meeting they will bring forward a positive solution to the problem. But the most notable contribution that the Australian Transport Advisory Council has ever made is the production of numerous reports and statements which have clearly defined the roads problem and set forth the amount of money required. But that is as far as they have ever gone. The Australian Transport Advisory Council consists of six federal Ministers and the six State Transport Ministers. It is presided over by the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator Paltridge). So it can be seen that everybody on the council is a very influential man in his own right. I would have thought that, as all of them were agreed that there was a road problem, they would have put before their respective Parliaments, including the Federal Parliament, some positive plan for implementation in the near future. But the council has only produced reports ad nauseam. It has issued reports after every meeting and no one can disagree with them because all that they say is that money has to be spent in large quantities to solve the problem. I agree wholeheartedly with the latest report. I cannot find a comma in it with which I disagree. It states that a minimum of £1,600,000,000 must be spent during the next ten years if a reasonable and practical programme of road construction and maintenance in all States is to be establisbed. That amount is large but it only works out at £160,000,000 a year. It has been estimated that from all sources, federal, state and municipal, about £110,000,000 a year is being spent, so that another £50,000,000 a year has to be found. When we examine the conclusions of these meetings, we find that there is no prospect of any worthwhile national roads plan being hatched by the Australian Transport Advisory Council. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. the sitting, I pointed out that the Australian this need in principle, because it proposes Transport Advisory Council had, to all intents and purposes, failed to give a lead in solving the roads problem, which is daily becoming more acute throughout the Commonwealth. Some months ago, a Cabinet sub-committee was appointed to suggest ways of improving transport in Australia. I do not know whether the appointment of that committee has any connection with the pronouncement made by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), in his Budget speech, that the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act would be reviewed in 1959. Perhaps the Government intends to take advantage of the recommendations of the sub-committee in formulating a new policy. I hope that the sub-committee will not prove to be as ineffective as. were a number of other Cabinet sub-committees, which, from time to time, were appointed mainly for the purpose of delaying decisions on matters. I hope that, on the contrary, this sub-committee will speedily make recommendations to the Government that will help to solve our transport problems as early as possible. It is undoubtedly vain and futile for me to express the hope that, before 1959which is almost another two years awaythe Government will see fit to amend the act. In the meantime, we are witnessing an unedifying spectacle of the crumbling of the roads throughout the country. Apparently, the Government considers that a review of the act is necessary, and I hope that it Will, Without delay, confer with the State governments about the drafting of an amending measure that will provide for a new plan. It should not wait until 1959 to start on this task. If it did, we should not see any results from the amending measure until at least 1960. Australia's roads are in a parlous condition, and action should be taken immediately to improve them. Until something is done, the States will have to make do with the £34,000,000 a year that they are receiving from the Commonwealth out of the proceeds of the petrol tax, from which this Government Withholds £17,000,000 annually. If the Government is not prepared to give to the States the full proceeds of the petrol tax, it should make an interim award, if I may use that expression, and at least increase the grants to the States. The Government apparently recognizes to implement a tax on diesel fuel. It has stated that this tax is being imposed because of the problems associated with the construction and maintenance of roads. It is estimated that the tax on diesel fuel will return to the Government £2,000,000, and it has announced that it will grant to the States an additional £3,000,000 for road works. In other words, the Government recognizes that the States must have more money if they are to tackle this all important problem effectively. In addition to making the extra grant, the Government should make an immediate and positive approach to the States to ensure an effective solution of our road problems. I suggest that it should leave the Australian Transport Advisory Council out of the picture altogether, because that has proved to be a moribund and ineffective body, which has failed miserably to deal with road problems. The Government should announce immediately that it recognizes that our road problems are immense, and must be tackled as early as possible, and it should ask the States to confer with it in order to reach a compromise about the ultimate solution to the problem. A completely new national programme, possibly providing for the transfer of responsibility for some main highways from the States to the Commonwealth, would provide the only sure foundation for a better system of roads. If the Commonwealth would accept responsibility for main roads between States, leaving the States with the responsibility for the construction and maintenance of other roads, the States would be relieved of a great deal of a tremendous financial burden, which, at the present time, they are quite unable to sustain. This would be a fair and legitimate solution. I suggest that, under any new national plan of this kind, the entire proceeds of the petrol tax should be paid to the States, and that other",71,Estimates 1957 58

The honourable member's time has If it were not eventually demolished, the expired. considerable time, many published comments about the number of British immigrants coming to Australia have been appearmore accommodation for British immiing. Most of these comments have been to grants. But there are two limiting factors. the effect that more British immigrants In the first place, Australians, who enjoy should come to this country. We should high living standards, are mostly reluctant take as many British immigrants as the to share their accommodation. A family country can possibly absorb, and the Gowith two or three children, living in a vernment should accept as many as are three^bedroom home, is naturally reluctant, offering. There are obvious reasons why as a general rule, to take some one into the number of British immigrants coming to the home to share it with them. I think Australia is limited. One very obvious that, conversely, a family in England, with reason is that the Government has decided, several children, living in a comfortable as a matter of policy, that an assistedhouse there, would be most reluctant to passage immigrant from Britain must have journey 12,000 miles to Australia to share accommodation in Australia assured. Many accommodation here with another family. people consider that this restriction should These are real limiting factors that have be removed. However, its removal would an important influence on the number of greatly accentuate the problems of national British immigrants coming to Australia. development, because tremendous difficulties The Australian people as a whole, and stand in the way of the assimilation and especially those who say that too few absorption of British immigrants who have immigrants are coming here from England, no accommodation to go to on their arrival must resolve definitely to sink, as far as in Australia. Two alternative methods could be adopted. more British people to migrate to this One would be to increase tbe amount of eountry. The people in England who are hostel accommodation. Let me say, as anxious to come to Australia must be made unequivocally as possible, that I do not aware that when they reach here as nomifavour increasing hostel accommodation, nated immigrants it Will be necessary for because a hostel, by its very nature, reprethem to share accommodation, sents temporary accommodation only. It is highly undesirable that the amount of temporary accommodation in use should selection officer in England for the Departbe increased, more especially when it is ment of Immigration.. The officers of the intended that it should be occupied by department in England are very enthusiastic newcomers to Australia who, generally, and tremendously keen on their job. Indeed, have very few friends here, and whose there could be no finer bunch of Australian means are extremely limited. Hostels men than those employed as selection should be regarded merely as places for the officers overseas. The departmental officers temporary accommodation of people who in England have, in the main, two functions are anxious to come to Australia, and who to perform. The first is the selection of the are so much needed here that the Governimmigrants and classifying them into various ment can afford to disregard the undesiracategories according to the accommodation bility of hostels, and provide a limited that is available.

I would point out, Mr Chairman, that the. construction of additional hostel accommodation would absorb finance, building materials, personal labour, and other factors that could be better used in other sectors of the economy. These things would be channelled into the construction of temporary accommodation that would ultimately have to be pulled down. problem would only be aggravated. The other alternative, Mr Chairman, is to induce Australian families to provide they can, their natural disinclination to share accommodation, if we are to induce I had the experience of working as a",73,Estimates 1957 58
174,The Chairman ( Mr Adermann),,74,Estimates 1957 58
175,Mr Snedden (Bruce) [8.5],"Fo r athey arrive in Australia. The other function is that of publicizing Australia. During my term of office in England, I found that about half the departmental employees were engaged on each of these tasks. In carrying out the duty of publicizing Australia, the selection officers, usuaUy travelling in pairs, undertake a tour of selected provincial towns. The inhabitants of those places are informed of their coming arrival, and when they do arrive they contact the local press representatives and try to give them some colourful story which will induce people to come and see them. It is true that many people in England want to come to Australia, but many of them do not realize the problems that will confront them when they arrive here. When they come before our selection officers these problems are explained to them. It is not a simple matter to take one's family from England an'd transport, them to Australia, and it is most necessary that our officers in England fully explain to them the problems involved before they sever their employment and housing connexions. Of course, after these explanations the number of people who are keen to come here is reduced. With regard to the remainder, who may be accepted as being keen to come here, it is incumbent on the Government, I believe, to retain is present policy of offering assisted deserts his ship in Australia will, after apprepassages to them' only if accommodation is available for them in Australia, provided either by a potential employer or by friends or relatives. I do not believe that the hostels system should be extended to any great degree. When the stocks of Australia slumped, as a desirable land to which to emigrate, it was caused largely by a number of English migrants who had been in hostels' in Australia, became dissatisfied and returned to England. Upon their return they spread a great number of tales, largely fabricated and certainly exaggerated, about Australian conditions, thus preventing a great number of English people from volunteering to come to Australia as immigrants. That was a direct result of the hostels system, and any extension of that system beyond its present limits is, I think, highly undesirable. The factors that I have outlined, the natural reluctance of the Australian people with their high standard of living, and of the British people with their standard of living, to share accommodation, do not apply to Europeans, and so it is only natural that vast numbers of Europeans wish to come here. I think it is most necessary to say that 99 per cent, of our immigrants from Europe are thoroughly fine people, and any attempt to derogate from them is malicious propaganda. European immigrants have done a tremendous job. It is not necessary to go through the whole range of functions that they have performed, or the various fields in which they have made tremendous contributions, such as the motor car industry, the iron industry and the various primary industries. I believe that they should be encouraged to come to Australia. Many of them have left behind in Italy, Greece, Germany, Holland, Austria or other countries parents, wives or children, and it would be disastrous if Australia adopted a policy that made it difficult for them to be linked with then families again. There are a couple of other matters to which I wished to refer while dealing with the subject of immigration. I wish first to express dissatisfaction regarding the method of dealing with seamen who desert their ships in Australia with the intention of residing, here permanently. I understand that an agreement exists between the Commonwealth Government and the shipping companies, providing that any seaman who hension, be returned to the country of his origin. This has, on many occasions, caused tremendous hardship. It may be regarded as highly undesirable for a seaman to desert his ship, but, nevertheless, many seamen who have arrived in Australia in this way have obtained jobs and, in many cases, have married here, and to adhere strictly to the letter of the agreement and make them return to their country of origin before coming back here as immigrants not only shows an unreal approach to the problem, but in many cases is quite cruel. I wish also to refer to the Immigration Act itself, and to suggest to the Minister that it is time the act was revised. Many aspects of it are quite out of date. It has been patched up from time to time, and I feel that it is time an entirely new immigration act was introduced into this chamber and debated by honourable members, so that the law relating to immigration could be made more clear to the community as a whole. I believe that a review of the act has already been instituted by the Minister and by the permanent head of his department. I must say that Australia has been extraordinarily fortunate in its Ministers for Immigration. The first, of course, was the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr able member's time has expired. Calwell), followed by the present Minister Harold Holt) and the present incumbent, who has kept up that extraordinarily high standard of warm humanity that is so necessary in the administration of a department such as this. But I feel that, although the ultimate responsibility must obviously rest on the political head of the department, the Minister, it would be unfitting, on this exceptional occasion, not to say a special word about the permanent head of the department, who, to my knowledge, has occupied that position since it was first created. He has done a magnificent job, and every person who has come in contact with him has paid him the greatest respect and the highest tributes. Included in the group of Estimates that which tbey live are detrimental to their we are now discussing are the Estimates health and are not conducive to their assimifor another department about which I wish lation in this community. to say a word or two. I refer to the Department of Territories. It was my great pleasure during the last parliamentary in my electorate which is known as the recess to accompany two other honourable Finsbury hostel. It was built when the members to the Territory of Papua and honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr New Guinea. Upon arriving there we were Calwell) was Minister for Immigration in greeted by every one, public servants and the Labour government. All sorts of reject private individuals, with great warmth and materials were used in its construction sincerity. In the course of our peregrinabecause of the shortages that existed at the tions around the territory we came in contime. Old timber and other material of tact with a great number of public servants. very poor quality was used. The hostel AlthoughI do not want to spend my time was initially built to house displaced persons in adulation of the Public Service, I must from Europe who were thankful to have say that I have never seen such devotion even a place of that standard for living to duty as that shown by the members of quarters. I recognized then that, because of the Department of Native Affairs partithe shortage of material for homes, we had cularly, and the public servants there to conserve the material that was available generally. Being of the legal profession, for our own Australian people. I was naturally particularly interested in the department of the Secretary for Law. I of a long structure with a tar-paved floor. found that the growth of that department It was two rooms wide and about ten or was quite amazing. At first I thought that twelve rooms long, and the doors opened this growth may have been too great, but, to each side. The rooms were very small. after speaking to three of the officers there Later, when the buildings were converted whom I had the great good fortune to have known many years before, I realized for that the job that they were doing was really fitted and the walls were improved, but first-class. There are, however, certain the fittings and conveniences were not deficiencies that obviously must become apparent in such a fast-growing territory. The first matter I wish to mention in this regard is the very great need within the territory for an appeal court. I wish to speak for a few minutes on the subject of immigration. I shall not devote much time to it, because I have only fifteen minutes in which to speak, and in that time. I should like to deal with three or four subjects. I must say, however, that most of the people in Australia during the last year or two have come to the conclusion that our proportion of British immigrants should be higher. I believe the general feeling is that we should get more British immigrants to come to Australia. However, when we see the conditions under which many British immigrants have to exist when they arrive in Australia, it is our duty to direct attention to those conditions in this place. The conditions under I have personal knowledge of a hostel The hostel buildings originally consisted occupation by British immigrants, they were improved. New iron roofs were",74,Estimates 1957 58

177,The Chairman,"Order! The honoraltered at all. Many British immigrants -who had left decent homes in England have to live in that sub-standard hostel. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr that they had bought two blocks of land on Townley) has informed me that a committee had advised against the provision of sitting rooms at hostels. That is causing much dissatisfaction among British immigrants. I shall give honourable members details of the conditions under which one family is living. The members of the family are the mother and father, a girl seventeen years of age and two boys aged twelve years and about six or seven years respectively. That family was allotted three rooms, each of which was about 9 feet by 12 feet. The father and mother had one room, the daughter had another bedroom and the two boys shared the third bedroom. There was no sitting room, and they had nowhere to sit after their meals. The dining room which is used by all the residents of the hostel is a very fine room, and the officers who serve the meal are giving a very good service, but immediately the meal is finished the residents have to go to their rooms. On Saturday afternoons, the residents of the hostel have to stay in their bedrooms or go outside. Under those conditions, the people who are living in the hostel are very dissatisfied. The family to which I have referred wants a sitting room. When the daughter returns from work, her parents cannot very well tell her to sit in her bedroom. If friends visit them, they have nowhere to entertain their visitors. In England that family had a six-roomed house with a bathroom and a small garden. At their invitation, I visited them at the hostel. I found that the room that had been occupied by the daughter had been divided with a curtain, and that one of the boys slept on one side and the i?irl on the other. The parents had single beds for themselves and for the younger son in a second room, and they had retained the other room as a small sitting room. The older boy was sitting at the table doing his homework, and the other boy was reading. The parents said that if tbey had not tried to make up a small sitting room by cramping their sleeping space, they would have had nowhere to entertain friends who had visited them the previous night. They said that there was no common sitting room or lounge, but some distance away there was a recreation room. The wife told me terms and hoped to build a house, but they had become so discouraged that they had considered returning to England. They were influenced by conditions under which they had to live. Adjoining their three rooms there was another room the same size as the bedrooms. It had been empty all the time they were in the hostel. When they put a few boxes into the room, the management made them remove the boxes. For obvious reasons many British immigrants are returning to the United Kingdom because they have to live in similar conditions. They did not expect to be asked to take such accommodation. I listened with interest to the statements that were made by the member for Bruce( Mr Snedden) about hostel conditions. Adverse reports that are being sent back to England and statements that are appearing in the press invariably arise from the shortage of good accommodation. If we want British immigrants to be happy in Australia we must be sure that they have reasonable living conditions. The immigrant to whom I have referred said that he had a friend who was living in much worse circumstances. I saw his friend. He had two children, girls, aged about ten and five years. That family had two small rooms. They had bought some furniture, including a wardrobe, to put into one room. Their view was that they should all sleep in one room so that the other room would be available as a sitting room. The mother, father and the two girls were cramped into a room 12 feet by 9 feet. They were not complaining but were hoping that they would be able to get something better. We should ask ourselves whether that is a decent way to live. A health officer would be amazed to see four people sleeping in a room 12 feet by 9 feet in which were a double bed and two single beds. The mother and father were huddled into the double bed, a single bed was against the foot of it and the other single bed only 6 inches away. They admitted that the girls should sleep in the other room,, but they felt that the second room was better used as a sitting room for the girls. I make the plea to-night for something -to he done. It is all very -well for a eomTrrittee to advise that sitting rooms are unnecessary. The attitude that, if peopie are made too comfortable at these hostels Chey will not try to find another place to live, may apply in some cases. However, generally speaking, something more should ""be done for these people, particularly for families such as fhe one I mentioned. Spare rooms could easily be made available in such cases. If the hostel were crowded, I could understand the family being given only two rooms. If a hospital is crowded, one could agree that the authorities should put beds in corridors. Similarly, if a hostel is overcrowded, then the residents must suffer some inconvenience. But if one of the four dining rooms in a hostel is closed because all the rooms are not occupied, people .should not be compelled to live under the conditions I have mentioned. I do not think .that these peqple .are being treated fairly. Most of the immigrants in the hostel to WhichI referred were British; a few were from Holland and other European countries. I ask that this matter be investigated and that these people be given some encouragement to stay. When I was told that the couple I mentioned intended to return to England, I asked them to keep their chins up and to stick it out until they could get somewhere .else to live -I -did not encourage them to complain or to go back to England; I told them of the struggles that others -have had and how tbey have overcome their .difficulties. II we want to keep these people here, let us do a little bit more for them than we are doing now. My experience of the Department of bogie-changing apparatus, a new invention, Immigration is similar to that of the honorwhich was being tried out at Albury. Some able member for Bruce. Perhaps the Minisinteresting, because, although this problem ter for Immigration ( Mr Townley) will say has been considered by many governments that I have not been to him with these during the last 50 years, only this year is matters. I do not bother the Minister. I something being done. This Government learned long ago that it is not much help has seen fit to begin the unravelling of this going to the Minister, because he will only peat national problem. The report of a get a report from the man I should have speech made by Mr Waddell, who was seen in the first place. I very rarely go Colonial Treasurer at the time, readto any of the Ministers, but I get a wonderful deal from their officers. I think the Wales Ministers appreciate that the best way to other ithe question of the break of gauge was approach these questions is to go to the man discussed, and when the two .lines were connected directly concerned and see if he can fix every up the trouble. I have always had excellent treatment from the heads of the departments. IfI put anything before them that warrants investigation, they are prepared to investigate it and to meet any case of -hardship that I can estabUsh. I am thankful to say that many people for -whom I have made representations have appreciated not only what has been done for them by the department but also my own efforts on their behalf. As the honourable member for Bruce said =able member's time has expired. speak on a subject which concerns tbe Department of Shipping and Transport. The announcement in the Budget speech that the Commonwealth would arrange with the State governments concerned for the construction of a standard-gauge line irom Wodonga to Melbourne is the first major step 'towards solving our break-of-gauge tangle, and will give considerable assistance to the commercial and manufacturing economies of Australia. I would be remiss if I did not congratulate the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator Paltridge) for bis untiring efforts in bringing this scheme to fruition. I have known the Minister for a number of years. I served with him in the Royal Australian Air Force, and I know something of his fine qualities. At all times, he made himself readily available to the Government Members Rail Standardization Committee, of which I was a member. During research into the break-of-gauge tangle, I found a newspaper report, dated August, 1907.

This: apparatus, unfortunately, was: not a complete success. As we look back on previous proposals, made by many committees;. I feel We canagree that they were aU far too ambitious and far too costly for this great nation of only 10;000,000 people. The present proposal is. to deal first withone section-the provision of a standard gauge linein Victoria which, will give a through run from Sydney to Melbourne. Two other projects will then remain, to complete the standard-gauge trunk system. They are Broken HilL-Port Pirie-Adelaide and Kalgoorlie Perth Fremantle. Wodonga-Melbourne link, scheduled to start as soon as negotiations with the States concerned are brought to finality-I believe they are almost completed now-involve s a substantial outlay. Its completed cost should be approximately £10,000,000, At present, the standard 4-ft 8}-in. gauge line from Sydney to Albury continues over the: Murray river to Wodonga. From here toMangalore, a distance of roughly 120 miles, there is a single 5-ft. 3-in. gauge track. The plan is to lay an additional 4-ft. 8i-in. line roughly parallel with the existing broad, gauge track over this section. Ultimately, of course, it is proposed to convert the whole of the Victorian 5-ft. 3-in. system to the standard gauge. From Mangalore to Melbourne,, a distance of roughly 70 miles, the 5-ft. 3-in. track is at present duplicated. The plan is to narrow one of these lines to the standard gauge, leaving, the other 5-ft. 3-in. gauge linefor the time being to take local Victorian traffic. Central train control signalling will probably be installed upon it in order to increase its carrying capacity. The Victorian railway authorities have suggesteda solution of the problem of approach through the Melbourne suburbs. Erom Broadmeadows,. about 10 miles from Melbourne, the line will, bend eastwards, using one of the existing goods tracks into Tottenham. From there, it will follow the mainline and goodsspur into Dynon-road yard, which lies between Melbourne and tension will bringpassenger traffic into Spencer -stieet station,, probably to a platform on the opposite side to that at present The economic advantageswill be very considerable: The. line' should make a substantial profit upon its cost: and, therefore, should: greatly improve thefinancialposition of both the Victorian and. New South Wales railway systems. What is more important, it will, provide cheap and speedy transport, forgoods between the two capitals and this should' make no. small contribution to the reduction of real costs throughout industry in those States. The modern goods terminal at Dynonroad will enable a high standard of service to be offered. This, in conjunction with modern handling methods, will produceThe efficient rail operation. Once again I congratulate the Government and, when parochial: State attitudes' can be put aside, we shall all be looking forward to the commencementof the construction of the remaining two main railway links. Honourable members will recall that a Cabinetcommittee has been formed to investigate the problem of transport. I know that it has done a great amount of work already and I sincerely hope that in the very near future it will submit a grand national roads plan. I am certain we are all looking forward to such a plan, just as I am confident that the Mmister fbr Shipping; and Transport (Senator Paltridge) will leave no stone unturned in his efforts to have evolved speedily a national roads system for the Commonwealth. Mr O'CONNOR: (Dalley) [8.45] I propose to discuss the Department of Shipping and Transport and to direct my remarks, in, particular,, to this Government's policy inconnexion with shipbuilding. First, 1 must express my complete, dissatisfaction at the amount of money the Government proposes to make available by way of subsidy to the shipbuilding industry. We find from: a perusal of the Estimates that the allocation for merchant ship construction is £1,855,000, and although this represents an increase of £421,000 over the amount allocated last year, it is by no means sufficient to meet the change that has taken place in conditions in this industry, especially in New South Wales. The Government may be satisfied with its shipbuilding policy, but I can only express grave alarm at it. To my mind, the shipbuilding industry has deteriorated in recent years. It was the Chifley Government which made the first approach to the problem of developing the industry. It was the first government to accept the responsibility of determining what amount of subsidy should be paid, and fixed it at 25 per cent. Following requests for an increase in the subsidy, this Government shirked the acceptance of any responsibility in the matter and placed it on the shoulders of the Tariff Board. Fortunately, after hearing evidence, the Tariff Board saw fit to increase the subsidy to 33i per cent. I am by no means satisfied with this Government's attitude towards the industry. It is a vital industry; it is a national indusand to develop the shipbuilding industry, try. Australia is a mercantile nation. We have 13,000 miles of coastline. We depend upon the sea, and shall do so for many years to come for our communication with overseas countries. I submit that the dilatory attitude this Government has adopted towards shipbuilding is by no means a credit to it. I point out here that it is a matter of history that whether a nation becomes a mercantile power does not depend exclusively upon either economics or population. It is recorded in history that many a nation with a much poorer economy and a lower population than Australia has by its determination and vision, become a power in the mercantile world. It is because of the Government's lack of vision, and its failure to appreciate the importance of this problem that the shipbuilding industry is languishing in Australia. Different nations throughout the world industry. In support of that contention. nave different approaches to this problem. I read this telegram which I received yesIndeed, many of them do not hesitate to terday from the shop committee at Mort's adopt every means at their disposal to proDock, Sydneytect their shipbuilding industry, and perhaps it will be of interest to the committee Urge Copy telegram Mimster for Shipping to-day. if I give a brief outline of the methods Dock boilermakers and iron workers dismissed adopted by other countries and the steps they take to protect their mercantile marine industry. Compared with them, this Government shows up very poorly indeed. This outline of the methods adopted throughout the world to assist the shipbuilding industry is contained in the report of the inquiry held into this matter by the Tariff Board. We find that the assistance takes various forms. The countries whicb subsidize shipbuilding include tbe United! States of America, France, Italy, and India. Those which subsidize shipping operations include the United States, Canada, Italy and Japan. Norway, Sweden, Denmark', the Argentine and the United Kingdom grant taxation concessions; the United States gives a trade-in allowance on old vessels; Japan, Canada and the United States reserve coastal trade for national vessels; and the United States affords tariff"" protection in respect of ship repairs. I remind honourable members that, as far back as 1908, when the United States began to emerge as a world power, it did not hesitate to use whatever means were at its disposal to protect its mercantile interests in marked contrast to the vacillating approach of this Government. I regret to say that the Australian shipbuilding programme is not so impressive as supporters of the Government try to make out. At the moment, the Australian Shipbuilding Board has a construction programme involving twenty-five ships, of which fourteen have been completed and three are almost complete. The remaining eight are either about to be commenced or have had expenditure in connection with their construction approved. Of those eight ships, six are being constructed in South Australia, one in Queensland, and one at the State dockyard at Newcastle. The port of Sydney has facilities that make it one of the major shipbuilding ports of Australia, but, due to the failure of the Australian Shipbuilding Board to place orders for ship construction in Sydney, there is increasing unemployment in the your intervention. Twenty-three Mort's while industry declines. Urge immediate start on "" Delungra"" conversion to halt this and further threatened dismissals.

I believe that unless yesterday, and he was good enough to give it takes more vigorous and imaginative me a reply which, unfortunately, does action to keep the shipbuilding industry nothing to alleviate the situation.

We have made a higher contribution towards the fares of assisted We have reserved all available berths on commercial lines of shipping on the United Kingdom-Australia run and have obtained additional charter vessels in a highly competitive field to provide the maximum of shipping accommodation for British immigrants. It is interesting to note that we have launched the ""Bring Out a Briton"" campaign, and it is pleasing to see that the great majority of Australian people are supporting that campaign. Applications received by the Chief Migration Officer in London in the first five months of 1957 were approximately 55 per cent, higher than in the same period last year. The campaign has been highly effective and the scheme has stimulated interest among potential British immigrants as well as among potential Australian nominators. It invites Australians to help to reveal jobs and accommodation vacancies for British immigrants. Whilst it cannot be expected that this campaign will yield instantaneous and spectacular successes, we are assured that the Australian people will respond to the appeal to bring out as many British people as possible. More than 160 committees have been formed throughout Australia, mainly in country centres, since this campaign was launched and so far 434 persons in 120 family groups have come to Australia from the United Kingdom under this scheme. What is more important, however, is that one direct result of the interest created by the scheme has been an increase of 56.8 per cent, in the number of personal nominations submitted in Australia during the first nine months of this year, compared with the number of nominations submitted in the corresponding period last year. Personal nominations until the end of September totalled 23,404, compared with 14,927 in the corresponding period of 1956. Yet, we hear criticism in spite of this great increase in the number of British immigrants coming to Australia. Our record of British immigration contrasts more than favourably with the experience of our greatest rival for immigrants, Canada. The net intake of British immigrants into that country has been less than 20 per cent, of her overall immigration programme in the last seven years. Side by side with this special effort to are becoming excellent Australian citizens encourage maximum British immigration, and are contributing greatly to our cultural the Government has pursued an enlightened background. Through immigration, we are policy of working to ensure the smooth assimilation into the community of the 643,'000 non-British immigrants who have joined us in the post-war years. These people have made, and are continuing to make, a valuable contribution to the welfare of Australia. We welcome them as partners in our enterprise of joint development. The ultimate aim of our assimilation policy is that all who are eligible shall become naturalized Australian citizens as soon as possible. The new European settlers are warming to this task with alacrity. They like our way of living and they want our citizenship. The number of applications for naturalization increased by 25 per cent, last year, compared with applications made during the previous year. By last June, 110,000 persons had been naturalized since 1945. This satisfactory result is due partly to the enthusiasm of the immigrants themselves for the way of life they have found in their adopted country. It is due, partly, also to the enlightened policy of the department and the generous co-operation of many local-government organizations. Inmy electorate, two councUs have set up committees to support the "" Bring Out a Briton"" campaign. The Australian practice of holding simple yet most impressive naturalization ceremonies has so caught the imagination of other countries that New Zealand is sending representatives of its immigration departments to Australia to observe how our naturalization ceremonies are conducted. The Government, by looking after the welfare and education of immigrants, and by the encouragement of the effective work of the Good Neighbour Council, to which I pay special tribute, has devised a highly effective assimilation programme, which has reacted in the best interests of the immigrants to this country. We need immigrants in Australia. We have offered them the privilege of coming to this country, and we hope and trust that those who follow them will be many more in number, and we know that they will emulate the good example of those who have come before them. This nation has gained considerably in strength through immigration, not only in labour to develop our economic strength, but in having good people who developing a nation of distinctive character, which combines the high ideals of our own British heritage with the best qualities of the other democratic countries from which we draw our new settlers. able member's time has expired. sure that responsible Australian people will seriously deprecate the speech by the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Aston) to which we have just listened. Almost every word that he said was said with the idea of playing the game of politics on this question that is supposed to b'e of a non-party character, on which the Parliament has an almost unanimous view and expects to have some mutual co-operation. But there are honourable members opposite who never lose an opportunity of trying to cast some sort of reflection on the attitude of members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Phillip and many others fail to remember that the Australian Labour party represents over 2,000,000 of the people of this country, and that it is capable of expressing a responsible view upon this matter and upon all other matters that it discusses. Therefore, I object, in the most serious manner possible, to the outrageous statements that are made concerning the Labour movement and its attitude to immigration. We take that attitude because we want decency, and conditions that are at least proper for the comfort of these people. Is our attitude to be regarded as something that is foreign to the ideals of this country, tration in attending to applicants for social merely because we want British people here in greater numbers than the numbers in which they have been coming in the past? Is it wrong to advocate principles of that description? opposite call into question the ideas of honourable members on this side and their advocacy of these conditions. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) made a revelation to-night of conditions that are horrifying to imagine in relation to the reception that we give to newcomers to this country. I join with him in a protest against the fact that many of the people who seek to share the fortunes of this country find conditions so uninviting during their initial reception here. I hope that something better will be done for those people who are required to accept temporary accommodation before getting their greater chance to enjoy the home-life that this country can make possible for them. I hope that the words of my friend from Port Adelaide will be taken seriously by the Government and by those persons who administer these affairs, so that better arrangements may be made. It was not really my intention originally to speak upon this subject, but I was prompted to do so by the most outrageous statements made by Government supporters in relation to the Opposition's attitude to this question, and I shall continue to protest in this chamber, as long as I am capable of doing so, against the kind of charges that Government supporters never seem to tire of making against members of the Labour movement. Our service to this nation as a political entity, and the great achievements of governments that we have formed, provide a full and ample explanation of where our loyalties lie and of the effectiveness of our principles in government. I wish to express appreciation of the administration of the Department of Social Services in South Australia, for what I consider to be the excellent work that it has done, particularly in the last ten years, during which there has been a decided reform in the methods adopted by the department. Originally, in the 1930's, there prevailed a feeling of fear, that people were really justified in having, upon approaching the examinations that were required. But since then there has been a much more considerate attitude on the part of the adminisservices. That is all to the good and is to be Warmly commended. But much more remains to be done to aid these people, who have the right to expect from us every Yet honourable gentlemen consideration that we can possibly give them. In the discharge of our responsibilities in these matters, I suggest that we should study the convenience of applicants, particularly in regard to the examination of their claims. Instead of requiring them to come to a central position in a city, we should decentralize the administration in such a way as to provide for a more immediate consideration of claims. For instance, in my electorate there is a very important centre which was originally the chief electoral centre for the division of Wakefield, but is now in the division of Bonython. It is a",81,Estimates 1957 58

182,Mr Makin (Bonython) [9.11],"I amcommunity of considerable orient and importance. I refer to Gawler, wbich is approximately 28 to 30 miles from Adelaide People in Gawler who apply for pensions are required to attend in Adelaide to have their claims examined and to go before a magistrate. 1 think that is altogether wrong. There should be an Officer of the department at Gawler capable of. giving the assistance and service so essential to pensioners. Similar provision should be made in. other places like Gawler throughout the whole Commonwealth, so that aged folk as well as invalids can be helped 'in relation to their claims for pension. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to have an inquiiy made into the prospect of giving assistance to that very laudable organization known as "" Meals on Wheels "", which is staffed by voluntary workers and does a most wonderful work in providing meals for the aged and infirm. I hope the Minister will realize that by bringing comfort and assistance to the aged and the invalids that organization has added greatly to 'the well-being pf those people. Such a service, as it provides should be a truepart of -the Commonwealth social service provisions, i pay' a great tribute to Miss Taylor and those who are associated with her .in this grandwork for aged people. So, 1 ask the Minister to have his department examine this great work and to afford all the help and encouragement possible to "" Meals on Wheels"" in order to enable the organization to extend its wonderful service to aged people. I hope that what I have had to say Will make honprable gentlemen realize that there are still many things for us to do in improving'the conditions of our aged people as well as the conditions of the new people coming into the country under the immigration scheme. We sbould earnestly consider sucb matters and not seek to play the game of politics with them in the waythat it is played at present by many members on the Government side. We should do our best to serve the people and have a more worthy Objective than seems to have been the motive behind the speeches made in this debate by honourable gentlemen opposite. I do not. agree:. With the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin) on the subject of immigration, I most certainly do agree with many of his statements regarding social services. I know of the good work .that is done in my own electorate by the organization known as "" Meals on Wheels "", and' 1 am glad that this Government has been able to make grants to the various State and municipal authorities in order to enable an extension of this work. I hope that the existing grants will be increased, but I hope even more that State governments and municipal authorities will greatly extend the service in their own -fields; because, although we can take action from here, the responsibility for providing the impetus for this great service rests with the.local authorities. I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Bonython about this very laudable service, and I congratulate the Government on the way that it has helped the service during the past year. I should also like to direct the attention of the committee tb the estimate for the Department of Social Services, particularly to the vote for the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, which last year expended about £-568,000 and whose estimated expenditure this year is £626,000. I am glad tp see that more money is being made available to this service this year. 1 only wish that the vote could have been even larger, because there is no doubt that the service is producing a wonderful effect and doing work of great importance throughout the country. I should like to deal in greater detail with some of the work which has been accomplished during the last twelve months by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. I must congratulate the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) on the production of this extremely helpful leaflet, ""The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service"", published in April this year, .in which we can find a good deal of valuable information about tbe work being done. -The work of rehabilitation is, I think, one of the good fruits of war, and it is a lesson learned from war. .It is not-often that we get good things from wars, but I think that the rehabilitation service is certainly on the credit side.

The more jobs that can be found, the more quickly can they be placed in a position of independence, and helped towards a better way of life, and the more quickly can intending patients be absorbed by the scheme. i should like to commend the department very warmly upon the work that it has done this year, ahd express the hope that the service will be greatly expanded in the years to come. I hope, too,' that every one, and industry in particular, will co-operate in this great work. to say a few words about the activities of the Department of Immigrauon and, at tbe outset, join those who have expressed appreciation of the work of Mr Heyes, the departmental head. 1 have had extensive dealings with Mr Heyes, and with other departmental heads, and every honourable member will agree that no one could be more courteous and helpful. The same may be said of the members of his staff, and especially of Mr Nulty, the chief immigration officer in Brisbane. This gentleman is always prepared to give honourable members-certainl y myselta good hearing. I have never been able to.understand the Government's policy in regard to the selection of European migrants. I want to say at once that .there haye been seasons when our sugar cane could not have been harvested without , the assistance of the Department of Immigration. Ighave in mind a period when the honourable member for [59] Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) was Minister for Immigration, and also a period when the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) held that portfolio. I express the gratitude of the sugar industry when I say that we cannot forget the tremendous assistance that has sometimes been given us in gathering the harvest. All the immigrants, of course, were not suitable. That was to be expected. When we speak most extraordinary if every one of thera Was suited to the industry in which he worked and remained in it Of course, all of them did not remain in the industry. Without wishing to discriminate between countries, I am sure all honourable members who know anything about the sugar industry will agree that the best immigrant ever to work on cane-cutting was the Italian; and. more Italians remained in the industry than people of other nationalities. One result of that in the north of Queensland, in my electorate, is that there are more Italian farmers than any other foreign, fanners in the sugar industry and naturally they would be assimilated easier and quicker than immigrants from, other countries. be growing cane? cutting cane, but their countrymen are growing cane They are sugar farmers. There is a matter whicb is worrying thc Italian farmers, particularly in the. Herbert River district, and I mention this to the Government in complete sincerity, not with any desire to criticize, but in tbe. hope of being able to obtain an explanation. From time to time Italian ""farmers return to Italy and there they come in contact with people, observe them working, and get to know their background and to understand everything about them. Knowing that they will want immigrants to work on their farms or in the fields for the next season, these Italian farmers would like to nominate those people about whom they feel' completely satisfied and in respect of whom ' they can guarantee security.

I put those propositions to the Government, not with any desire to criticize or to be nasty, but in a constructive way, with the hope that something will be done when ihe matter has been considered by the Government. honourable member for Herbert( Mr gory to close relatives, such as wives, Edmonds) made a very thoughtful and constructive contribution to this debate. He touched On one of the serious problems in Australia, the problem of seasonal employment; and there is no doubt that coming as he does from the cane-fields in Queensland he is familiar with that problem. I put to him, however, that the level of immigration does not entirely solve it. If we had they were dependent, and to redress the no immigration whatsoever we would have the position where in the sugar season, to take the example he has given, if there were full employment there would be a shortage of available labour to fill seasonal vacancies. On the other hand, if we have sufficient labour to take up the seasonal employment that is offering, then quite obviously when that particular seasonal employment cuts out we are faced with the problem of Where that labour is to be placed. dressed. That matter has been raised in this I am quite sure the honourable member appreciates that problem. We have met it in the past, as he freely acknowledges, by being able, when there has been an acute shortage of labour on the cane-fields, to bring in a number of Italian immigrants. However, it can only be met permanently for the Australian economy by intelligent planning on the part of both State and Federal governments to provide the' sort of production and industry which coincides with the slack periods in the seasonal industries to absorb those employees thrown oh the market. approach would achieve far better resulb than trying to trim down our immigration programme on any day to day -fluctuation in the employment figures. It can be adJusted to some degree. I want to deal with trends in immigration particularly over the last few months which show that it is possible to adjust the intake of immigrants of the type absorbed into the country to the employment situation. It was found some time ago that the Italians and other southern Europeans already in Australia were seeking to nominate friends and relatives to come to Australia in such numbers that our balanced programme was in danger of being upset. We have the position where, for the year 1955-56 there were 55,942 of what are called Form 40 nominations, that is, applications by southern Europeans nominating friends or relatives. The Government had to restrict those admitted in that cateminor unmarried children who were dependent on their parents, dependent parents or other aged dependent relatives, and unmarried' females under 35 years of age. That was for the specific purpose of enabling families to be reunited, to enable dependants to come to Australia to receive the assistance of those upon whom slight unbalance of sexes that had crept into our southern European immigration programme. That policy has improved the position to such an extent that at the end of the current year we shall receive only 15,833 of these Form 40 nominations as against 55,000 for the preceding year. Not only has that trend been corrected and the surplus arrested, but the balance of the sexes also has been rechamber on several occasions. Whereas before we were getting a preponderance of male Italian or southern European immigrants, we are now getting a proportion of three females to each male. The monthly average has declined from about 5,000 in the preceding year to about 1,300 in the current year. Those who have been critical of the Government's admittance of southern European immigrants to this country, in the face of those figures must admit that we have tried to restore a very satisfactory balance.

189,Mr Edmonds,"We are more concernedWithin that rule-and it is necessary to enforce that rule fairly rigidly because there is a tremendous pressure for southern Europeans to come to Australia-it is not possible for those people to come to this country. However, the type of people whom the honourable member for Herbert mentioned would have at least as good and probably a better chance of selection by the Australian immigration authorities if it were necessary to import workers for the particular type of work for which they are required. Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. If they want us to keep a balance of immigration-and this is a policy which has been pursued ever since the inception of the immigration programme^-w e must impose and enforce restrictions impartially and fairly whenever that programme tends Ito become unbalanced. It will be appreciated! from the figures cited to. the Parliament that i the balance has been noticeably restored. On the matter of British immigration, it has been suggested at times that the Government is not trying to do all it can to obtain British immigrants. It has also been suggested at times that we are deliberately trying to encourage southern Europeans instead of British immigrants. I think from what the honourable member for .Phillip( Mr Aston) told the committee and from the figures I have just cited in regard to southern European immigration,' it will be apparent, as indeed it should be apparent, that this Government is anxious and willing to have every suitable British immigrant who can be brought to this' country; buf it is not as simple. as that. There are to-day about 14,000 applications in Great Britain for entry to this country covering about ""40,000 people, but unfcn> tunately' those applicants have not found a sponsor in Australia or will not fit into a category of work available h'ere. To those who say that our proportion of British intake.is not high enough, the only possible way of restoring that proportion would be to reduce the intake of other immigrants who can be fitted into this community, because a larger proportion of the British applicants are people for whom no suitableemployment can be found here. They are people such as white collar workers and the like, and I think honourable members will readily appreciate the difficulty of placing, say, a bank clerk or an insurance clerk in a similar situation in Australia. Australian employers are naturally more anxious to have people with an Australian background who have worked their way up from the bottom in their particular business'rather than accept the British equivalent into their firm or business. That is the sort of difficulty with which the Government is faced. Another difficulty is the ability to recruit suitable skilled immigrants for the type of work that is available. I must say quite bluntly that we do not receive from either the United Kingdom Government or trade unions. the co-operation and assistance to which we are. entitled. If we had more facilities accorded to us by the United Kingdom Government, the trade unions, and other people concerned, we might conceivably attract the skilled workers for which . employment is available in Australia. The only other alternative, if we are to maintain a certain proportion of British immigrantsa fixed percentage if you like-is to reduce the intake, of other immigrants I should like honourable members to consider the possible consequences of that. This Government has followed a programme initiated by the Labour party of aiming at the maximum possible absorption of immigrants. That policy has been tested over a period of years, during which the number of immigrants entering the country has fluctuated,' and* it has been found that we can absorb .approximately 1 per cent, of Our current population. Our intake has been geared to that relatively stable figure over the last few years. * to live in? , , does exist. , The honourable member will . forgive me fbr just mentioning it Very briefly , because I , do' not want to be sidetracked. . . However, the fact is that immigrants build . more homes than they , require for them: selves. We have decided oft a stable intake', of immigrants which the community can' ' absorb, and has absorbed successfully with immense benefit to Australia. The question is: Are we to review that number'each' year in accordance with the varying intake ' of British immigrants which will fluctuate, not only with changes in conditions in Australia, but also with changes in conditions in the United Kingdom over which",89,Estimates 1957 58

192,' Mr Freeth,"That is a problem that,we have no control? The numbers also fluctuate according to changing international conditions, such as the Suez incident and other happenings. Honourable members will agree that it is desirable to keep our intake reasonably balanced, and while taking as many British immigrants as we possibly can, to maintain the yearly target we have set ourselves. That is the policy that this Government has followed. In the brief time left to me I want to deal with one other point that has arisen during the course of this debate. I think it was the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) who suggested that the accommodation we provide for British immigrants is not sufficiently attractive. I have only one answer to make to that suggestion. We provide them with cheap, but reasonably attractive, accommodation. One of our problems is the long-term resident in these hostels, who will not get out even when other accommodation is available to him. member ever seen the hostel to which 1 referred? of an immigrant who continued to live in a hostel although he owned more than one dwelling-house for which he was receiving rent. That is the problem the Government is facing. We try to make the highest standard of accommodation available at a price in accordance with the relatively limited resources of the immigrants during their early period in Australia. Subject to that, we do not encourage them to live any longer in the hostels than is necessary. We like them to go out and obtain their own accommodation, because that is a very important factor in their assimilation into the community. agree, as a result of my knowledge and experience, with every word that was uttered by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds). He gave the committee a very clear and concise description of the position. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) seemed to have some difficulty about the slack season. There would be no difficulty if the Government were to encourage young Australians, British-born immigrants, and immigrants from other countries to go on to the land R -[60 ] and so become used to the climatic conditions. They could then cut cane, and in the slack season earn additional money. While we are prepared to welcome immigrants from all countries, of course, we prefer to see more British immigrants coming into the country, including, of course, immigrants from Malta and Cyprus. We should like to see a greater number of British immigrants entering the country than is the case at the present time. I was shocked to read in the press, over the name of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Townley), a statement that thousands of immigrants have applied to come to Australia but apparently are unable to do so. As far as the housing situation of British immigrants in Queensland is concerned, the position is certainly not as it was described by the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson). The holding capacity of the Yungaba hostel in Queensland is equivalent to that of a large hotel. As soon as the immigrants arrive there they are allocated to certain positions. They may remain in the hostel for only a week. No trouble whatever has been experienced in handling British immigrants in Queensland. The honourable member for Phillip( Mr Aston) on a number of occasions has made mention of political expediency. The only interpretation I can place on such statements is that members of the Opposition use the immigration question for political purposes. That is a very narrow-minded view. Surely the Government should accept advice from honourable members on this side, who probably know more about this problem than most of its supporters. Some eighteen months ago I brought to the notice of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), who preceded the present Minister for Immigration, the disproportion in the numbers of male and female immigrants. Apparently, he did not adopt my suggestion to maintain a balance between the sexes. I have since obtained some further information. I have before me a pastoral statement on immigration by the Catholic bishops of Australia. Many immigrants are, of course, Catholics. Many of the Catholic priests are fine linguists who can speak the language of the various immigrants. English-speaking priests have been brought into this country",90,Estimates 1957 58

196,Mr Dean (Robertson) [10.1'9],"I referto the time at which it occurs, and take its full place in the Commonwealth of Australia. When one goes on a visit to these places one is able to discuss day-to-day problems and objectives not only with the administrative officers, but also with those who are engaged in private commerce, farming and the development of the lands of the Territories. I refer to the Australian and European population as well as the native population. No doubt other members had that opportunity, as I did, of visiting the very successful farm conducted by a native and also the co-operative gold mine. We saw the success of the new experiment of encouraging the native population to take part in local government and in the Territory's council. In other ways, also, the native own way of life so that they may take their population is gradually being encouraged to take its place in the full life of the Territory. Once again, I say that this is not easy, Administration in the Territory for the way because of the different standards of value in which they are prosecuting this objective. that are held by the natives. They have their own ancient culture and traditions, which are completely different from our I propose to discuss Division No. 115own. An incident which illustrates this fact Ship Construction--unde r the proposed happened in the Goilala area after the vote for the Department of Shipping and arrival of the Chief lustice, Mr Justice Transport. I was a shipbuilder before I Mann, and I pay tribute to His Honour for entered the Parliament. the manner in which he dealt with the case. It received some publicity in the Territory. Honourable members may remember that, able member had been a boilermaker. quite recently, a native was committed for trial in the Supreme Court of Papua and shipbuilder before I entered the Parliament. New Guinea, sitting at Tapini, on a charge Therefore, I am in a position to speak of having murdered his wife. The Crown authoritatively about the tragic situation reduced the charge to one of manslaughter. that has developed in one of Australia's Then, because the incident could reasonably basic industries since the Government has have been taken to have been an accident, been in office. Australia is a continent with the charge was not proceeded with. But, a coastline of 12,000 miles. Consequently, because of an old tribal law which demanded it needs ships, for various reasons, first and that a death, even if accidental, be repaid foremost among which is defence. Daily, with a death, it seemed likely that quite a the newspapers lead us to believe that number of deaths could take place, one there is grave danger of war. That talk, after the other, and that innocent people of course, has been inspired by this Gowho had nothing whatever to do with the vernment for a number of reasons. If the incident might be harmed. His Honour was fully aware of this, and, honourable Ministers have been sincere in consequentiy, he invited a number of memtheir claims that the Government was prebers of both family groupsI think about paring for any eventuality, and that 100 in number-int o the court and asked £200,000,000, or £190,000,000, as the case them if they would consider compensation may be, was urgently needed for defence for the woman's death. This was an entirely expenditure in any one year, the Governnew departure from the traditional proment should not have neglected the shipcedure. First the representatives of the building industry as it has done. offended family asked for the only compensation that they knew of for death, and that was another death. Mr Justice Mann persuaded them to. talk the matter over. In due course, they returned and told him that they had decided to waive the tribal law and had agreed on compensation of two pigs, two dogs and two tooth necklaces. I cite that incident in no spirit of levity, but as an example of the different standards of value that I have mentioned. That compensation was sufficient for the relatives of the dead person. I believe that that illustration proves htat we have to be understanding in handling the continuing problem of absorbing the indigenous people of New Guinea into our full responsibility as they receive their training.

199,Mr Curtin,"I was a boilermakerTwo of the greatest dockyards in Australia are situated in Sydney. They are Cockatoo Dock and Mort's Dock, both of which have modern shipbuilding equipment. These two dockyards employ the finest skilled tradesmen in the world-Australia n tradesmen. Why are these two dockyards not fully occupied with orders? Other Australian dockyards, such as the establishment of Evans Deakin and Company Limited in Brisbane, and the Williamstown Dockyard, in Victoria, also are partly idle. Other small dockyards in various parts of Australia which are not large enough to build ocean-going vessels, are idle. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited dockyard, at Whyalla, in South Australia, has modern slipways and equipment, and is capable of building vessels in excess of 12,000 tons dead weight. It is largely occupied in satisfying BHP.'s need for orecarrying vessels to transport iron ore from Yampi Sound, in Western Australia, to its steel works on the east coast. The situation prompts the question: Why is the Government so lackadaisical about formulating a shipbuilding programme to provide ships and keep the work force of skilled tradesmen together in case war should break out? What protection does it intend to afford us? The only Navy ships that we have are lying in mothballs near Bradley's Head, in Sydney Harbour, and are not in a fit condition to put to sea. These facts prompt another question: What is the Government doing to defend our 12,000 miles of coastline? What is the defence vote being spent on? Yesterday 25 boilermaker shipbuilders at Mort's Dock were dismissed. This means that 25 of their assistants, and at least 100 other men employed in allied trades, must be put out of work, because the construction of a ship requires the employment of a considerable number of tradesmen, both highly skilled and unskilled. Indeed, the construction of a ship of 10,000 tons dead weight needs, as much material as would be required to construct a village of twenty houses. What is this Government allowing to happen to the steel that we produce in Australia, and could use in our own shipbuilding yards? The A-in. steel plate that is used in the upper strakes of a ship, above the water line, is the most important plate in a vessel. With the Government's permission, 90,000 tons of that grade of steel plate have been shipped to Kobe and Yokohama. Those cities, of course, are in Japan. Government supporters -Ha, ha! men in the ranks of Government supporters to take note of the fact that, with the Government's permission, 90,000 tons of steel plate for shipbuilding have been shipped to Japan. Why? Does the Government propose to encourage the shipbuilding industry in Japan to the detriment of the Australian shipbuilding industry? Evidently, the giggling supporters of the Government do not know the first thing about what is happening, and, in any event, they approve everything that the Government does. The Government, with the consent of the Prime Minister, apparently has decided to give Japan favoured treatment, by sending to that country shipbuilding plate that the Japanese will use to construct ships that should be constructed in Australian shipyards. In other words, this Government is allowing the Japanese to import employment, and Australia to import unemployment. The patriotic shipowners, of course, claim all sorts of concessions from the Government by way of freight increases, and they seem to get whatever they ask for. Freights have increased by 12 per cent, over the last twelve months. It is interesting to note a reply given by the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Townley), on 8th October, to a question on notice asked by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam). The Minister's answer indicates clearly where the shipping companies propose to obtain the vessels that they need for trade on the Australian coast. These companies take the cream of their pronts from trade on the Australian coastline. In effect, therefore, the Australian people are paying for the new ships. But where are the ordersfor them being placed? I am sure that the people of Australia will be disgusted to know.

This is the Minister who of discussion in this House, to know that, in has the audacity occasionally to reflect on accordance with legislation passed in 1945 the veracity of honourable members on the by some other government, and by interLabour side of the House!

226,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister forand not by the Government of which I am a member. As I have said, all official discussions were conducted by my colleague, not by myself. It is perfectly true that at some time early in 1953, when I returned from Manus Island, it was suggested to me by one of my senior colleagues that as I was the .Minister who was taking a very active part in trying to ensure the return of the Japanese from Manus Island to Japan, I should discuss it as a matter of courtesy with Mr Yeo. I rang Mr Yeo and asked him if he would care to discuss the matter with me. He said, "" Yes. I will get a couple of members of my executive"". I said, "" All right"". I went along and explained the facts to him, he knowing that I was not the Minister with jurisdiction, but thai the jurisdiction lay with my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, and not with the New South Wales branch of the RSL. but with the federal body. I explained that to Mr Yeo, and one has not taken exception to the attitude of of the other gendemen said, "" Yes, we think the Commonwealth Government. it is a good scheme to let them go back, for the reasons you have given ""-the main one being that so many of the war criminals I think that the House had better consider were becoming insane. As a matter of for a moment all the implications of the justice, I thought that too many of them things that have been said by the honourable were becoming insane and that they should member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), in view be repatriated from Manus Island, where of what has been said by the honourable they were living in tropical conditions, to member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce). The Japan, where they could live under somehonorable member for Parkes read out some what more decent conditions and where, in telegrams and accounts, I think, of teletruth, they could come occasionally into phone conversations with Mr Alexander. contact with their relatives and friends. I , Mr Alexander believes that to be called a therefore, as a matter of decency and of Communist, to be associated with the Comjustice-and I think that the right honourable munist party, is slanderous. That view was gentleman would agree with this-coul d see nothing wrong with their being repatriated taken up and endorsed by the honourable to their homeland. But one of the other gentlemen said to Alexander"", one in the Actors Equity and me, "" What happens if there is some move the other who had stood as a Communist for clemency, or some move for remission candidate for Grayndler. It is true also of sentences? "" and Mr Yeo said-and I that one Mr Alexander knew that the should like the honourable member for East Actors Equity Alexander had been assoSydney to know this and to report it to ciated with Communists for a long time, and have to take "". Now, Mr Yeo, because he examination of the evidence by a justice happens for some reason or other to be of Australia. He was quite definitely assowrapped up in this political gesture, not ciated with the Communist cause. Here writing to the federal president or secretary we have the position of a man who hasof the RSL., not writing to his federal been openly associating with Communists,, branch at all, but writing to a political saying that it is a libel and a slander if leader; suggests that something different has been said. Sir, I say that when the particular question was asked, ""What will happen if there is an attempt to remit penalties, or to cancel them in some way? "" Mr Yeo, not waiting to ask for an explanation from me, said, ""That is one of the risks we will have to take "". I rose only to explain the facts and to make no comment whatsoever. I have done so because the honourable member for East Sydney has twice raised this subject. Again, I make the simple statement that I do not think this is a matter of sufficiently great importance to Warrant the attention of this House. If it had been, I am positive that the federal president of the RSL. would have taken up the problem with the Prime Minister of this country. To the best of my knowledge, the federal body of the RSL. has not taken action and therefore, sir, whilst I do not commit the federal body of the RSL. in any way, I think it is a very fair and proper deduction to make that it member for Parkes.

Repatriation General Hospital, Springbank. honourable member for Kingston( Mr wealth Statistician has advised as follows:Galvin) asked my colleague the Treasurer about a letter from the Premier of South Australia dealing with the closing of a ward at the Dawes-road General Repatriation Hospital and the general shortage of hospital accommodation in Adelaide.

How manymigrants, to: Australia have returned to their country of embarkation in each year since 1949, giving the figures for each country separately-? 3How* are these' figures, arrivedat?' able' member's questions are as follows:1. Tfiis question has been referred to. the Commonwealth Statistician, who has advised as follows:Information is not at present available as to the' numbers' of Australian nationals or citizens' migrating oversea becausetfiedocuments' completed By (or on' behalf of) oversea travellers,, and' which' areusedforcompilation' of statistics; dbnot distinguish fully between ""Australian nationals"" or '""citizens"" and persons who have, been resident in.

The"" question of obtaining fuller information as. to all oversea migration, including, that of Australian citizens, is now being considered by an inter-departmental committee concerned with facilitating oversea travel. 2. In regard to this question, the CommonThe documents available for statistical purposes do not contain enough information to show the number of migrants to Australia who have returned to their countries of embarkation, nor is there any means whereby "" returning migrants"" might be distinguished from permanent departures generally.

234,Mr Townley,"The answer to the honorassumptions, it is possible to arrive at an approximate estimate of the percentage of post-war British and non-British migrants who have returned to their countries of embarkation. It appears that about 2 or 3 per cent, of non-British migrants have returned permanently to their countries of embarkation, whilst for British migrants the corresponding figure is estimated to be about 6 or 7 per cent. 3. In view of the answers to 1 and 2 above, no answer can be given to this question. Commonwealth Scholarships. Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. How many scholars have held Commonwealth scholarships in each of the last five calendar years? 2. How many of these scholars in each of these years have received (a) no living allowances, (b) living allowances of half the maximum amount or less, (c) living allowances of more than half the maximum amount, but less than the maximum and (d) full living allowances? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The numbers of scholars who have held Commonwealth scholarships in the last five calendar years are as follows:1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 This information refers both to full-time and to part-time students and cannot be used as a basis for the consideration of the data in the answers to question 2. Part-time students, some 20 per cent, of the total, are not eligible for living iUowances. 2. (a) No living allowances1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 (b) and (c) It is not possible from statistical data, available to answer these two points separately.

The statistical returns are not in sufficient detail for answers to be given to points (b) and (c) separately: (d) Full living allowances1952 939 1953 1,026 1954 1,149 1955 1,155 1956 1,071 Living Standards. honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) asked the following question:I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that retail trade statistics reveal a fall in purchases per head of population for the second successive year, or, putting it another way, that there are more people buying fewer goods, which are costing more. If so, does the Prime Minister still persist with his denial of the claim that living standards in this country have declined? 7,372 8,407 Final figures of retail sales for the year 9,074 ended 30th lune, 1957, are not yet avail9,308 able. However, estimates of total con9,635 sumption expenditure for the year have been made, and these estimates include goods sold at retail as well as other items, such as rent, not purchased in retail stores. According to these estimates, consumption expenditure per head of population increased from £341 in 1954-55 to £357 in 1955-56 and to £370 in 1956-57, repre5,064 senting rates of increase in the past two 5,860 years of 5 per cent, and 4 per cent., 6,374 respectively.
