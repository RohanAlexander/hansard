Does he not think that this information is important and of educational value, and ought to have the fullest publicity? able member sent me notice this morning that he intended to ask this question, I have been able to prepare the following reply to it : 1. Prior to 1903 each State published separate records; in 1903 the first Commonwealth publication was issued, which included two parts, viz., trade of the Commonwealth as a whole, and trade of tbe individual States. 2. Most of the States also published separately returns of their own trade, as they did not. consider the figures given in the Commonwealth publication were sufficiently detailed. 3. For 1904 a scheme was drawn up, and has been referred to the Premiers of the several States, in which it is proposed to limit the publication of f u l l particulars, as to "" countiy whence connection with the matter are before me. imported "" or "" of destination "" of goods to some 200 items, these being selected on account of their importance; the remaining 440 to show total trade for each only.

What the High Court decided in Bond's case was that Mr Bond, who did in effect receive Â£150 a year in the Victorian service, was, under the circumstances of the case, entitled to that salary under Federation; but it expressly left untouched the question whether that salary could be lawfully reduced by any competent authority, and, if it were reducible, what was the competent authority.

So far as recent changes have had a personal bearing upon the position of honourable members, I think the matter has gone to the other tribunal, by which it can be dealt with when the first opportunity arises, and I am perfectly willing to leave the more painful matters which involve personal exchanges to another time and another place. It would, however, be impossible for me to escape from the duty which devolves upon the leader of the Opposition to put his view of public affairs plainly and clearly before the country. I am here as the leader of the Opposition, not only because of a change of Ministry, but because the honourable member for Bland and his -friends deserted their position. This is the first time. I have heard of an Opposition having, upon the change of Ministry, gone down below the gangway, instead of across to the Government benches. However. I-pass by the incident with the remark that we are indebted to the honourable member for Bland, who led the Opposition for eight or nine months against us when we were in office, and to the honourable members who with him were so vigilantly engaged in guarding the public interests for their courtesy in making room for us upon these benches. and learned member's proper place. Mr RE ID I trust that my honourable friend, instead of indulging in interjections, will honour the House with a statement of his share in recent transactions. I think that the public will probably expect it from him, as he has played a very conspicuous and important part in bringing about the serious changes which have taken place. Since the House adjourned on the motion of the Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member has put a new aspect upon our differences, to which I am bound to refer.

41,Mr Reid,"There were two events, a Not only that, but a day or two before thethan on the side of my honourable friends who differed from them on the fiscal ques1 tion. I did not hesitate at all in regard to the appointment of that Commission, because, so far as I am concerned, I do not think much of any man's opinions if he shrinks from the fullest investigation. I looked upon the Tariff Commission as likely to have one good public result-that it would inquire in a practical and thorough way into the operations of the Tariff, and, if , incidentally, its investigations showed that one or other policy was the better one, I was prepared for that result. So that with my colleagues I took the fullest responsibility for the appointment, and I submit that, so .far from acting treacherously to my protectionist allies in appointing that Commission, I was doing the very thing they wished. Yet this very act is now imputed to me as the source of all this misunderstanding. It is made the basis of the extraordinary shuffle of the political cards which took place about a month ago. sion was appointed my honourable and learned friend knew all about it, and was in personal and direct consultation with me with regard to every phase of the matter-as to the personnel and every other feature of the Commission. I had no accusation to make against the honourable and learned member. Up to the time of his speech at BallaratI distinctly acknowledged in the fullest and most handsome terms his absolute and loyal co-operation. That must never be forgotten. Any grievance I. have must date from a later pointfrom the time of that speech at Ballarat. I want to point out that there was no misunderstanding as to the meaning of the appointment of the Commission. When my honourable colleague the honourable and learned member for Balaclavaa protectionist whose name I suppose commands confidence throughout Australiadelivered his Budget speech, he distinctly announced that whatever might result from the appointment of that Commission there could be no serious alteration of the Tariff, in the sense of a change of fiscal policy, whilst this Parliament existed. Further, weeks 0 before the Commission was appointed and in the plainest possible terms, I defined the position of both parties in the Government with reference to the Commission. I am reported in Hansard as having stated to this HouseThe only arrangement under which Treetraders and protectionists can sit together on this side of the Chamber is one which, although we are prepared, even in connection with the Tariff,, to remove every sort of injustice or hardshipwhich is brought to light, is subject to the understanding that if the opening of the fiscal question is involved to any degree worthy of serious regard, it will be our duty to go to the electors of Australia upon the subject with a distinct policy. If either wing of the Government finds that a difficulty has arisen under which the loyal protectionists and the loyal free-traders find it impossible to continue together on the present basis, I think I can say, for my protectionist colleagues, as well as for my free-trade colleagues, that from that moment we part company. We can remain in office as a united party only so long as I do not call on my protectionist supporters to prove untrue to their fiscal creed, and they do not call on me to be disloyal tomine. That is the basis on which the Government rests. The moment that that basis becomes impossible, the existence of the Government becomes impossible. There were two plain straightforward statements that whilst this Commission was appointed for the purpose of obtaining information, if , in the view of the House,, its report involved any serious fiscal quesMonths before the Commistion that question must be fought out, not in this House, but before the electors of the country, and that at any rate the coalition Government could not continue toexist. But there is more than that to be said. That state of things did not rest upon an agreement between the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and' myself. Had it rested upon a mere agreement between us it could have been discarded, and torn up at any time. But it was the deliberate verdict of the people of Australiaa verdict which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat himself invited them to find. So that our agreement was not a new basis for fiscal peace, it rested upon the solid foundation of an absolute mandate from the people of Australia. That was the foundation upon which we built, and but for that our alliance was impossible. Now, Jet us take a common-sense view of these matters. There was a great demand that the Government should allow the Tariff Commission to deal with the industries in one particular spot in Australia, and submit a report as to those which were suffering hardship. The Government absolutelv refused to accede to that demand. We said that the inquiry must be thorough -that it must be Australian. Does not any common-sense man know that, if Â» Tariff were to be inquired into upon an Australian basis, it would be impossiblefor any Commission to report within a few months? There was no possibility of a report being supplied before the period at which our, fiscal attitude must have been declared-that is to say, May, 1906. the present moment.. Take the case of the iron industry in Melbourne, which was the subject of the keenest appeals. to inquire into that industry yet, although it has been appointed for eight months. Surely thar simple fact shows the length of the task upon which the Commission is engaged. some anomalies would have been brought to light which honourable members upon tot'h sides of the House might have easily remedied without the slightest infringement of the popular verdict. Now, I wish to say that there has been such an incessant attempt to depict Victorian manufacturers as suffering from Federation, and from the effects of the present Tariff, that it is time of protective duties. I. drew fhe attention of the House, and the country, and especially of the other States, to the figures relating to the Inter-State traffic in Australian manufactures since Federation was initiated. Let us see where this pinch comes in-le t us see where Federation is working unfairly to Victoria., or to any other State. I have in my hand an official document, which eliminates from the figures of our Inter-State trade all matters relating to agricultural produce, all questions connected with raw material, and with coin and bullion. What does that return show ? It shows that in the five vears, between 1899 and 1904. the consumption of Australian manufactures has worked out upon these lines: Victoria, instead of exporting Â£1.500,000 worth of manufactures to the other States, as she did in 1899. exported in 1004 ,Â£3.350.000 worth. That, represents Â£300.000 more than a doubling of the exports of Victorian manufactures to the other five States of the Commonwealth. Surely that does not suggest the wail of misery which is to be heard above the trials and troubles of the other States. the public still more. fore the public the real facts of the case. I wish to give what I think to be a solid narrative of fact and to avoid any comment. Now, New South Wales has infinitely larger resources than has Victoria. She has a much larger territory. In her case, I admit that the increase in exportssince the accomplishment of Federation has been very great. In 1899 she had only ,Â£500,000 worth, whereas in 1904 their value had increased to Â£1,700,000. The value of her exports to Take the position of affairs at the other States, in the shape of manufactures, is only half the amount of that of Victoria, notwithstanding that she has a larger population and greater resources. The Commission has not begun Now, take the case of Queensland. Whilst the Inter-State trade of Victoria, during the five years that I have mentioned, increased by 800,000, that of Queensland increased by only Â£390,000, that of Then it was quite possible that South Australia by only Â£170,000, that of Western Australia by only Â£10,000, and that of Tasmania by only Â£53,000. In other words, Victoria possesses, at the present moment, one-half of the whole of the Inter-State traffic in manufactures, as against the other five States. self to that question.' WhatI wish to say is that Victoria should not come along with its little hat asking for charity from the other States when it possesses half the trade in Australian manufactures. Surely, it should he more dignified than to take on the guise of a mendicant, appealing and whining for a little charitable assistance. It is a very keen business man who is doing well and begging at the same time. We. know what such individuals are called in the ranks of private life. They aTe called impostors behind the honourable and learned member like that? torians. Surely these high Tariff Melbourne manufacturers do not constitute the Victorian public, though some persons seem to think they do. May I suggest that the agricultural industries of this State have not asked for a sixpence? Hundreds of witnesses have appeared before the Commission in reference to manure manufactures and distilleries, but not a single witness has been placed in the box by the farming community to ask for an increase in the agricultural duties. On the contrary, the Farmers' Unions are now organizing in order to bring evidence before the Commission in opposition to any increased duties. orable member not tell us that last ses-. sion?",17,Ministerial Statement

There was an honourable alliancea frank loyal connection between the two parties-unti l the Ballarat speech was delivered. have a morbid appetite for political alliances when, whilst he is in direct alliance with one party, and when his agreement with that party has only half expired, he publicly invites another alliance with tlieir enemies.

He announced it in his Ministerial manifesto, and, having done so, went on to say, ""but we want fiscal peace for the life of the next Parliament."" With all these ruined industries staring him in the face, he accepted the situation of having a Parliament that should be in honour bound to give them no relief. That was .the position which he took up, with his eyes open. Our Liberal leagues in New South Wales naturally comprise a larger number of free-traders than of protectionists, because the free-traders are in a majority in that State. Having insulted us with this offer, the honourable and learned gentleman went on to say to the Labour PartyI f the Labour leagues desire our assistance, they will require to put protection on their programme. fused to do. able and learned gentleman giving the Labour Party adviceI f the Labour Party is to be linked together effectively, it will require to put protection in the forefront of its programme. Thus we find the honourable and learned gentleman, whilst in alliance with the late Ministry, not only offering his assistance and support to our enemies, but entreating them to accept his offer, pointing out that they are the men to accept it---that they are the men with whom he ought really to be allied. Surely, that broke the spirit of the truce-r-surely that invitation to our enemies to accept his assistance was the most direct breach of our compact that could possibly be imagined ! matter to be mentioned with reference to this point. In written agreement with me, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat registered the result of his own appeal to the people in these words:The Tariff No question about the fiscal issue; that was dealt with in a separate paragraphnot to be altered in any respect during the present Parliament without the consent of both parties in the Ministry. 1 The Tariff was not to be altered. honourable and learned gentleman had already registered the verdict of the electors in this way. the death and burial of the fiscal issue during the life of this Parliament. "" I recognise that that is the verdict of the constituencies,"" and the honourable and learned member repliedThat admission disarms me at once. . . By theverdict of the public the question has been deposed from its high place . . . and laid asidealtogether for this Parliament. It will therefore be seen that this was not a mere private arrangement between twoindividuals. It was a solemn mandate given by the whole of the electors, of Australia, on the honourable and. learned gentleman's own appeal. I come now to what is, I think, a proper question for inquiry. Whatever may be the ethics of the recent changes in the political situation, I feel that the public are entitled to know what they mean. When I approached the honorable and learned gentleman in reference to the coalition, he said in effect, "" Whatever we decide must be made knownto the whole world."" He was then resting on a high and proper foundation. "" There must be no private understandings, of which the public do not know the meaning."" He went on to say, "" WhateverI do, shall be made known to the public."" Thatbeing so, why has he not told us of the basis of the understanding that has brought the Labour Party behind him? the public press. What more does the right honourable member need? ing? member cannot convince me that he did not read the whole statement in regard to the matter that was published in the press.

The Prime Minister went to Ballarat, on 2nd August last to found a National League to oppose the Labour Party, thinking it necessary to rouse the country into opposition to He went to his constituents to found a national league. In asking the people to band together-and he spoke to all Australia-thi s is what he said of his old allies and his new allies; they are the same men. He denounced their sectional aims.

If I were saying this, the House would be in an uproar. I want to show the public of Australia that there must be something wonderful behind this new arrangement. honourable member. vicissitudes of coming into or going out of office are all in the game of politics. But when a public leader addresses the people of Australia, he is taken to be using honest coin, minted from his genuine convictions; he is not supposed to be playing with words as one plays with counters or dice. He is supposed to believe and to mean what he says.

Notwithstanding the centuries of slander which have been uttered about the prodigal son of the Scriptures, it was never said about him, as it could be said about this prodigal son, that he went about slandering his father. The Labour Party can enjoy the present situation. They have split up -a number of men who ought to be standing side by side to oppose them. Could anything exceed the absurdity of the invitation which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat addressed to the Labour Party? who to fight the Labour Party, he invited the members of that party to come and be shipwrecked on the same snag. But the Inter-State Conference knew several things better than that. When they saw our alliance fractured and destroyed, the only inducement they could have'for swallowing protection was gone. Only one thing in the world was required to give them a fair opportunity of predominance in Australia, and that was that this event should take place. Therefore, I can understand the hilarity of honourable members below the gangway. The transaction has been absolutely for their gain. It has removed one of the biggest dangers that was in their way. a public danger, and calls on the citizens to form a national league to withstand it, ought not, within six months, to be seen in alliance with the party he denounced. If he wished to go on the downward path to political servitude, as he has done, he surely should not expect the people of Australia to take him seriously when he next addresses them on the subject. That is not all. The honourable and learned gentleman went on to sav that the time would come when all men who love their country [9] "" E x t r e m e "" is a good should stand for the true institutions of Australia or perish. These words, adThe honourable and learned member dressed, not to politicians, but to the people, from a trusted and honoured leader, must have meant something. They must have meant that there were dangers embodied in this labour power, these labour methods, this labour programme, which called upon That was the proall Australian Liberals to join together against them. He summoned the people of Australia to stand behind him in such a fight; but he has deserted his army, and his league has had to pass judgment upon him. After the utterances which I have read, there could be no honourable alliance between, the honourable and learned member No ; the case is not the for Ballarat and the Labour Party of Australia.

'He may fight with you, but pretty soon after the battle he will scalp you if he gets a chance. Little did I think that a few months afterwards the honourable member would sharpen his knife to take my scalp. My honourable friends understand that, as between the honourable member for Richmond and myself, it is purely a matter of political criticism, and it always will be so. He got a good chance, and he jumped at it. The honourable member, out of the wealth of his classical lore, which sometimes bursts upon us most unexpectedly, used the following illustration:The temple of Janus contains an idol possessing a head facing both ways. One of its faces has the features of the honourable member for Bland, the other face has the features of the anarchist' and Socialist who would divide up and share the possessions of other people. That was another little pleasantry at the expense of my honourable friends below the gangway. My right honourable friend the Treasurer has expressed his sentiments with reference to the Labour Party in language whii-.h, .1 think, was sufficiently emphatic. He looked upon the Labour Mr Reid. Party as a body who were not only a menace to parliamentary government, but an obstruction in the way of a' number of honourable members. I am anxious to take advantage of the profound frankness of my right honourable friend in giving his public opinion about the Labour Party a short time ago. I must say that the heroic courage which the right honourable gentleman showed in the earlier and nobler days, when he trod the unbeaten tracks _ of the My honourable Australian desert, was as nothing to the courage 'he shows now in sounding the I rejoice that the Labour Party are on the Then he Opposition benches. I prefer to see them there rather than directing the Government from the cross benches. The right honourable gentleman now has the painful experience of finding the Labour Party directing him from that precise spot once more. I will, say this for my right honourable friend, that if he has to swallow political dirt it never agrees with him. He showed that after he had left office the last time. The right honourable gentleman stood before us and gave us an exhibition' of feeling which every one of us must have respected. For three years he was under the dominance of the Labour Party-as he is again to-day-and the moment he was free he expressed the disgust he felt at the amount of political dirt he hiad to eat. The right honourable gentleman has now acquired a fresh appetite. The honourable gentleman saidWe will not have to take physic from a third party. The physic is on hand again, and I hope it will agree with my right honourable friend. Under the ordinary conditions of public life, in any other country in the world, where such language had been used within a few months with regard to a political party, it would be inconceivable that public men who had made such declarations should occupy the position which Ministers occupy, to-day. and Lord Salisbury ? volved when the Liberal Unionists joined Lord Salisburya great principle affecting the integrity of the nation.

As honourable members know, I am personally in strong antagonism to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and I do not propose to indulge in a single word of reference to that honourable gentleman, except in the terms used regarding him by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Those two honourable members had been allies and comrades for twenty years, bound together by a great principle protection. dent of the Executive Council had advantages of close personal association with the Minister Â£>f Trade and Customs during those years that I had never had, and this is what he said only a few months agoWhen the honourable member joined us-that is the protectionists-it was like making ensilage.

It is to be hoped, if the honourable member can be induced to sit on the top of Mount Arthur, he will smash it as effectively as he_ has smashed everything else he has had to do with. I hope these friendly interchanges will promote serenity and enjoyment in this new Ministerial alliance. In the evolution of politics all sorts of changes may take place; but that all these denunciations of the iniquitous, destructive, selfish methods of the Labour Party that all these castigations should be laid across the backs of the Labour Party in the presence of the public of Australia, and that they should then constitute themselves a brigade to triumphantly march their detractors into office again is a thing almost inconceivable.

I use the term "" civil"" designedly, because the honourable member endears himself to every one, and I can never forget his marvellous display of ingenuity in helping me to shift the Labour Government. rumours-as I did some weeks before the delivery of the Ballaiat speech, and wellauthenticated rumours, too-that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was about to turn against the Government, recognising his versatility, and the slender majority which I commanded in this House, I felt that a crisis was about to arise. But I cherish no sort of unkindly feeling in reference to the Postmaster-General, or my honourable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council. They are young and ambitious politicians, and there is no reason in the world why they should not get on. NowI come to the first Ministerial statement of policy, which, for the first time in the history of parliamentary institutions in the British Empire, was made to a party in the House not in alliance with the Government. I have never heard of such a statement being made by Ministers even to their own party; but I contend that the submission of a draft Ministerial statement for the approval of a section of the House, which has no sort of political sympathy with the members of the Government, was an unprecedented step. it? think that there was no objection at all, if everything were settled in the caucus. I have no doubt that if the whole of the parliamentary work of Australia were settled down .below in the caucus room to the new development on the part of some honourable gentlemen concerned in this wonderful change, I wish to say that the Ministry have my undoubted sympathy in one -respect. I do not think that the corner party, however strong, should have turned the Ministerialist Party, however weak, out of the Ministerial .room, and set them to wander around the precincts of the House. From time immemorial that room has been labelled the "" Ministerial"" room. My friends down below are careful to say that there is no alliance between them and the remnant here. They are careful to say that there is no alliance between the two parties, and yet the gentlemen upon the cross benches have actually put the name of their party upon the Ministerial room. ThatI regard as an actual trespass. I have no When I heard sympathy with them, and I hope that they will give it up. Now, what happened upon the 5th July-the day upon which Ministers were sworn in ? I propose to read the report of an interview with the honourable member for Bland, regarding the position which his party intended to adopt towards the incoming Ministry. It reads :Following upon an interview between Mr Deakin and myself-upo n 28th JuneThat was very rapid, I think. I have no complaint to urge against the late leader of the Opposition. I think that he was absolutely justified in the course which he and his friends took in putting my Ministry out of office, because we were their open and declared opponents. Whether we were right or wrong, the honourable member knows that. He knows that we were their declared opponents, and there is a certain amount of satisfaction in fighting a fair, honest, political fight. One does not feel so wounded when he is shot from the front by his enemies j he can go down, and take the brunt of the battle. But there is an added sting when the shot comes from behind. There is an added sting when the fatal thrust comes from a friend and an ally, and I think some honourable members opis the objection to posite will sympathize with that view. The members of the Labour Party did an absolutely legitimate thing when they acted as they did. But I wish to point out that the'honourable and learned'member for Ballarat has absolutely abandoned the interests of constitutional government, and that after denouncing the Labour Party as the enemies of true party government, he has become their instrument. Therefore it is time that some other public leader took up the duty which he has deserted.

That is the extraordinary feature about the business. If eighteen measures had been submitted to the caucus, its members could exercise an intelligent judgment upon them. But is the whole field of public activity contained in these eighteen lines? And how could the caucus possibly know in what shape those measures were to be submitted ? I do not believe that the Labour Party have given their support to those Bills in blank, irrespective of whether they are right or wrong. I can understand the general support which any man might give to a Government, even if he did not belong to their party. judgment upon the particular subjects submitted mentioned are only under consideration. these sudden allies. The narrative of the interview proceedsI submitted the programme mentioned by Mr Deakin, continued Mr Watson, to the Labour Party this morning, and the following resolution was arrived at :That this party, having been informed, through Mr Watson, of the measures proposed to be submitted by Mr Deakin agrees to give his Ministry a general support during this Parliament in the transaction of public business. I take it that that is the general support which any honourable member could give a Government, without tying himself down to the details of any particular measure, because it is inconceivable that a body of intelligent men would give their support to eighteen lines involving eighteen big public questions without regard to the manner in which they were submitted to Parliament. would go without saying. the right honourable member for Swan, in describing the state of things which existed previously, said, "" The influence of the Labour Party then was not seen, but felt."" So it will be again. All sorts of Occasionally members of the resources are at hand for telepathic communications, and no doubt many a bridge will be built and many a contrivance resorted to in an attempt to keep up this very loosely-fitting alliance. There is no doubt, however, as to the duty of honourable members upon the Opposition side of the House. There is no doubt that their anxiety will be redoubled. There 'is no doubt that their duties will be pretty onerous and necessary, and I hope that they will be thoroughly discharged. There are a number of subjects in the other speech, but I desire to refer only to one. Honourable Imembers have been so good in giving me their attention that I wish to refrain from referring to a number of subjects which are mentioned in the policy submitted by the Prime Minister. I intend to refer only to one which I regard as of the greatest possible consequence. The Government have announced their intention to adopt some method of dealing with the electoral question. I wish to show the House, from the very latest returns, that every word which I uttered months ago-whe n the proposal in 1903 was subThe right to exercise his own mitted-as to thai disgraceful course which was then being adopted in regard to New South Wales was absolutely, true. honourable gentleman resigned over? matter which I do not wonder that the honourable member cannot understand, because he represents rather a big electorate. WhatI wish to point' out is that the returns which have been compiled evidence a state of things which demands the serious attention of the country. We were assured by the Minister who was then in charge of the Home Affairs Department that a series of droughts had denuded the population of the western districts of New South Wales. He mentioned three towns in the electorate of Darling which had almost been deserted, and he led the House to believe that the thousands of people who had been crowded to the cities would swarm back to the country when the drought broke up and better",27,Honourable Members Ha Ha I

We know how civil we all are to an individual elector when he comes along. I ask the honourable member to be commonly respectful to the thousands and thousands of electors who have been robbed of their proper representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. These figures show now that the increase that has taken place in the number of electors in the drought-ridden district of Riverina during the last two years-notwithstandin g that the boys and girls of nineteen jind twenty years of age who were residing In the eleccause, having obtained them from the retorate when the matter was previously before us, have since attained their majority -is only 789.

The other electorate to which I have referredthat of Darling, which covers an enormous area-ha s enjoyed a magnificent season; but notwithstanding this, as well as the fact ber of electors in rural constituthat its young men and women of two years ago have attained their majority, and have thus become entitled to be enrolled, we find from these figures that it has only 2,000 moreelectors than it had when this matter was before this House on a previous occasion. I then pointed out that in four electorates in New South Wales there were60,000 more electors than were to be found in four other electorates; but at the present is equal to nearly the whole of the electors time the difference between the two sets of electorates, instead of being 60,000, is 76,000. a shame. People talk about manhood suffrage, and womanhood suffrage, being the principle of the Constitution, and yet thousands of men and women living in the country are deprived of their rightsDo you know, Mr Speaker, that this difference of 76,000 electors represents nearly the whole of the electors of Tasmania? It is equal to 95 per cent, of the electors It of that State. as great in the case of certain Victorian constituencies. but that does not make the position better. before Parliament on a previous occasion, most of the members of the right honourable gentleman's late Ministry voted to retain the existing differences. that need not be thrown at me. My attitude on the point was absolutely clear, and I am quoting these figures only beport, I am! sure of their accuracy. I find, again, that there is a difference of 22,000 between the number of electors in Lang and Riverina. ence between the number of electors in the electorates of Yarra and Wimmera in Victoria. these discrepancies occur right through. We find, ifor instance, a difference of 24,500 between the number of electors in North S'ydney and Darling. Then the figures for the electorates of Parkes and Bland show a difference of 17,000; and those for Dalley and Canobolas a difference of 13,000, or a total of 76,000 in the one group of four electorates as compared with the other. Instead of the numencies increasing, we find that the difference between town and country divisions is greater now than it was at the time of the drought. Where are the thousands of persons who were supposed to be starving in Sydney, and waiting for the grass to grow ? Where have they gone ? The difference between the two groups of four electorates, which I have just set out, of Tasmania; to 66 per cent, of the electors of Western Australia, 46 per cent, of the electors of South Australia, and 34 per cent, of the electors of Queensland.

May I point out that at the very time these tens of thousands of electors in New South Wales were disfranchised by the refusal of the House to accept the scheme of the Commissionersa scheme which this report shows to be absolutely right-the schemes for the redistribution of South Australia and Tasmania were approved. In South Australia, where they had one city electorate, like that of Adelaide, and another like that of Flinders, or Chamberlain, covering hundreds of thousands of square miles, I find, comparing the three highest with the three lowest, that there was a difference of only 6,000 voters. I have quoted the difference between the four electorates containing, the greatest number of electors, and the four havpoint out that a most unfair attack was ing the least number in New South made upon the late 'Ministry in reference Wales, and the scheme which was to the redistribution of seats, and it is disapproved showed that it amounted about time that it was exposed.

The Constitution lays down as chised in this way are all in our electorates. a basic principle, with which even partorates in the city of Melbourne, which of representation shall be the numbers of have a far larger number of electors than the people of the Commonwealth. have some of the country electorates, are in our favour. that fact will not stimulate honourable members to respect the manhood and womanhood of Australia?

Surely when I tell the Labour Party that 20,000 men and women are deprived of their electoral rights their answer ought not to be that there are 20,000 in another place who are robbed in the same way. When such a reply is made it discloses a curious form of labour energy and zeal in defence of the men and women of Australia. So far as I am concerned, my complaint in regard to this state of affairs will not be a matter of mere indignation. If this House perpetrates the wrong which was perpetrated before it will astonish me. No drought can arise during the next two or three months. Such a thing is impossible.

In the first instance, she obtained her twenty-third representative, as I have said, by having 1,125 persons in excess of half the quota, and in the second distribution which took place in 1903, she secured her twenty-third representative, because she possessed 2,280 in excess of half the quota. census returns, or on figures supplied by the Government Statists of the several States? returns compiled by the Government Statists of the several States.

221,Mr Watson,"Quite so; then wherethe present Government are very similar to those upon which we stood with the Government of the right honourable gentleman in New South Wales. prepared to sink any idea of ourselves taking office, so long as the work of the country was carried on. Then, as now, we were anxious that the business should be proceeded with. Whenever the right honourable gentleman met with factious opposition in the New South Wales Parliament, he received every support from the members of our party in carrying on the public business, and we never asked him for anything, so far as party advantages were concerned. The right honourable gentleman is aware of these circumstances, and, thereSouth Wales. As one who voted for the fore, it seems ridiculous for him to pretend any anxiety as to any unpublished terms of alliance which he mav assume to exist. There is nothing more to be disclosed than has already been made public, and our party are merely anxious that the work should be proceeded with, that the promises that every man in this Parliament has so frequently held out to the people of Australia should be in some degree fulfilled. There is only one other point to which I should, perhaps, refer. I do not think it is necessary to say anything with regard to the criticisms so pointedly quoted by the leader of the Opposition as having been directed against the members of the Labour Party by some Ministers. In politics, one becomes accustomed to criticism of every sort,, and the fact that public duty has constrained us to work with gentlemen who, a little while ago, were profuse in their expressions of opinion as to our methods and conduct generally as public men, in order to transact the public business, should not in any way cause surprise. present association is no more surprising than that which took place when the leader of the Opposition joined hands with the present Prime Minister some little time ago. If honourable members carried their memories back to the last general election, and recollected the tirades of the right honourable to apply irrigation to a much greater exgentleman against the former Deakin Ministry, they must have felt fully as much surdistricts of New South Wales will never prise as that which has been expressed by the leader of the Opposition at the fact that it is possible for the Labour Partv to work with Ministers who had made remarks of the nature quoted. We were regaled with the criticisms which at every meeting were directed by the right honourable gentleman against the Ministry such criticisms as apparently left no possible room for a subsequent reconciliation. But, doubtless from the highest sense of public duty, the right honourable gentleman felt constrained to enter into an alliance with the present Prime Minister to accept his assistance, and depend upon his support in carrying on the government of the country, and in putting forward a programme that never got very far towards completion. The other matter to which I wish to refer, is in respect of the electoral divisions. The right honourable gentleman properly enough drew attention to the fact that his contention, some couple of years ago, has since been borne out by the movement of population in New rejection of the New South Wales scheme of re-distribution, I wish to say that I was convinced then that the drought had had the effect of denuding of population a large portion of the Western District of New South Wales. That was so, and the fact that that population has not gone back is due in part to the circumstance that the drought has not been brought to an end, so far as a part of the Western District is concerned. I do not wish to make this a reason for any subsequent action; but as a mere matter of fact, large areas of New South Wales are-o r were some few months ago-stil l suffering from drought. has not travelled"" over any of the far western districts. In the Mossgiel and Ivanhoe districts, the drought still exists, and the condition of those districts to-day-or j at least, a few months ago-wa s worse than had ever been previously known.

He is like the figure-head which is known to certain people as an ""Aunt Sally."" He has been set up for any members of the Labour Party to knock him down at the first opportunity. That is a most undignified position for a Prime Minister to occupy.

Could a more demoralizing bargain be proposed in any public body or institution ? "" Did they not see,"" added Mr Deakin, "" that in this degradatidn of principle they were destroying the life of the tree of constitutional liberty."" Now, I ask, does not the Prime Minister see that in this degradation of principle he has destroyed the tree of constitutional liberty? We have been told upon the one hand, that there is an alliance, although the statement has been denied upon the other hand. It is perfectly plain that there is an alliance between the Labour Party and the present occupants of the Ministerial benches.

In other Labour Party are still working in that subterranean manner which has characterized all their methods for bringing about certain legislation. Yet, in the face of that fact, we find that all such alliances are .condemned by the official organ of the party. I must say that that organ leaves us in no doubt whatever as to what is its opinion of the present alliance and of the Prime Minister. I am surprised to find that the honourable and learned member for Ballarata gentleman for whom I entertain the highest esteemshould contract an alliance with a party whose official organ speaks of him in such disrespectful, not to say insulting, terms. In the Queensland Worker, one of the most powerful labour organs in Australia, and a newspaper which has a large circulation, the following passage occurs, under a leader "" Here are our votes,"" it Deakin is all sand-san d without grit, quicksand.

Opposition is not in alliance with the Labour Party, and that being so, whatever this newspaper may have to say in regard to him is not in question. this article lies in the fact that the Labour Party, of which the Worker is the official organ in Queensland, is on most amicable terms with the Government, and that the two parties are in such close relationship that even the smallest item of policy cannot be put forward by the Government without consultation with its supporters in the Ministerial corner. I think the remarks of the official organ of the Labour Party in Queensland have a peculiar interest. policy. the fact that the Ministry are not keeping a House. [Quorum formed.} the official organ of the Labour Party has had to say in regard to the Prime Minister, and I propose now to quote what the Prime Minister had to say, less than a year ago, of the Labour Party, with which he is at present in allianceThose most closely allied with the Labour Party, those who make the greatest sacrifices for them, who stand closest to them, and who most wish to help them, are always the first to be sacrificed by them. One may help the Labour Party for one month, two months, three months, or four months; but the moment one stops or makes a single independent step he is treated as a bitter enemy. After having been apparently trusted, he will be treated as if suspected from the first moment; he will be condemned as if he had attacked them from the outset. That is the treatment which follows alliances with political machines. . . . When you come to deal chine, which has no loyalty, no conscience, and no judgment, and subject to rfiat 1 treatment which he has explained so lucidly as being the reward of those who are most It certainly in sympathy with the party, and do their best to assist it. I remind the Prime Minister of the fate which is in store for him at the hands of the Labour Party. He may rest assured that these words, which were perfectly true at the time they were uttered, are no less true to-day.; that when he has served the purpose of the LabourT he leader of the Party, they will forget all the assistance he has rendered them, and cast him off with as few scruples as they would cast off any one else. He correctly gauged the Labour The point of Party when he described them in these terms, hardly twelve months since; and I think it desirable to remind him of his utterances, so as to draw his attention to the fate that must sooner or later overtake him. I wish now to sav a few words as to what, by courtesy, I shall call the Ministerial programme. We were told yesterday by the Prime Minister, that "" a Com r It is for that reason that monwealth system of old-age pensions is now under inquiry."" Indeed, when we glance through the alleged programme of the Government, we find that most of the matters to which it refers are either "" under It does not give us our inquiry,"" ""under consideration."" ""under contemplation,"" or "" in hand."" The questions thaf are dealt with in this way are, I presume those which are regarded as the most contentious, so that we may I have shown what reasonably infer that they will not be pushed into the forefront of the Ministerial programme. A question which ought to have been in the very forefront of the programme, however, is that of the redistribution of seats. It has been shown by the leader of the Opposition that the present condition of the various' electorates is such as to be an absolute disgrace to the community, and should not be tolerated. wishes to wreck the Government. desire is to see them go to the country at the earliest moment, after we have provided for a redistribution of seats, so that the electors may have an opportunity to say wffether or not they enjoy their confidence.

The condition of the electorates, as revealed by the leader of the Opposition, makes it perfectly clear that we really have nothing approaching the principle of adult suffrage, or one man one vote in operation in Australia. That state of affairs has been accentuated, by the extension of the franchise to women, which makes the disparities even more glaring, and emphasizes the necessity for the immediate consideration of this question. I trust that the Ministry will show that they are prepared to deal with it at the earliest possible moment, and so give the electors an opportunity to return a Parliament in which the state of parties shall be such as to allow of an approach to our idea of what responsible government ought to be. The Government programme also promisesThe encouragement of rural pccupations in particular by means of preferential trade. Here we have a snag on which the Ministerial vessel is likely to strike, and get a very severe shaking. When we consider the-personnelof their following, and the wide divergence of opinion which prevails among them, we cannot fail to realize that the Prime Minister may have considerable difficulty in retaining at its full strength the support of those now behind him when he introduces a measure dealing ""with this question. I can promise him plenty of free criticism from this side, and I more than suspect that he will have to undergo a good deal of criticism from his own side of the House. member serious when he speaks of a dissolution ? I freely and honestly admit that I do not hanker after a dissolution as a mere matter of liking, but I do say that the condition of the electorates is so disgraceful that it is absolutely imperative that a dissolution should take place at the earliest opportunity, following a redistribution of seats, so as to afford the electors an opportunity to give legitimate expression to their views at the ballot-box, and to secure a return to something like responsible government. orable member think that an election once in three years is a little too often ? the period were extended to five years; but I contend that the House should be elected under new conditions. The present position of the electorates is such that the House does not really, represent the people; and in the face of such a situation I hold that all personal considerations should be set aside. It is mentioned in the Ministerial speech thatTo attract population, and to make provision for the appointment of a High Commissioner, are kindred ends to be achieved, together with, and in relation to, the matters just mentioned. I think we should have had some explanation of how it is proposed to attract population to our shores. to the state of the House.

At the present time, Australia occupies such an isolated position, and is so exposed to attack, that I do not think any Government which is in office ought to neglect this important question for one moment longer than is necessary. We have, contiguous to our shores, or, at all events, at but a few days' striking distance, no fewer than sixteen naval stations in the hands of foreign powers, with any one of which, or anv combination of which, we might have to grapple perhaps at a time that is nearer than many of us anticipate.

' We also find him in association with the honourable and learned members for Indi and Darling .Downs, to whom he was so lately opposed.

I refer to this matter, not to sow the seed of dissension amongst honourable members opposite, but in the public interest, because I think that those who have borne the heat and burden of the! day are not those who, have been rewarded by preferment; while, on the other hand, those who did not help the honourable and learned gentleman in his time of trouble, but sat in a corner by them'selves, have been chosen as his colleagues. It is a remarkable fact that of the four supporters of the honourable and learned member who represent New South Wales constituencies, three hold office. It is evident, however, that the Ministry was formed, not on lines of common policy, in the interests of the country, but in the interests of individuals. The honourable and learned member for Indi, when the leader of the Opposition had concluded his speech, said most indignantly that he had wasted time.

In October last, he was so anxious for practical business to be proceeded with that he moved the reduction of the Estimates by is. Of course, his motive was not economy, his object being to force the creation of a Tariff Commission, since he knew that it would be a wedge to drive in between the Deakin and Reid parties. That move effected his purpose, and in his innermost mind he knows that it commenced the destruction of the Reid-McLean Administration. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs assisted him in the work. At that time they were not anxious to facilitate the transaction of busiattention of the country to the spectacle ness, but were known as "" bridge-makers."" They were bridge-makers for the Watson Administration and Tariff destroyers for the Reid-McLean Administration. Yet they now have the indecency to accuse the leader of the Opposition of not desiring to proceed with practical business, because he has exerpicture of a different character, which is cised his right of criticism. The honourable and learned member for Indi said that he would place the public in possession of the facts; it is also our duty to do so. Then he asked his supporters to stand with the Government in oarrying out their programme. This noble array of four supporters ! The fact must be driven home to the country that the Deakin Administration faces the House with an undivided body of four supporters, whom the honourable and learned member calls upon to stand as one man against the Opposition. On each occacasion that the House has met since the present Ministry took office, the Ministerial benches have been closely packed with members, even including the! Vice-President of the Executive Council, who introduces quite a new element into the Ministerial ranks in this Chamber. I am very glad to see him there, and I regret that previous Ministries did not arrange that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should be a Minister in this Chamber. In vivid contrast to the packed Ministerial benches we find the seats immediately behind them occupied by only four supporters, whereas the crossbenches are so crowded that it has been The"" Standing room only."" The old associates of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General are so enamoured of them lhat they have seated themselves as far away from them as possible. So pleased are they with the Government programme, and sosatisfied are they with the prospects of the Government, that they have chosen this method of exhibiting their undying respect. So farl as maintaining a quorum is concerned, Ihe Government whip has a much easier task than that which fell to the honourable member who occupied a similar position under the last Government. The Government will look for their main support lo the well trained members of the Labour Party, who will take good care to keep a House for them -. not troubled, why should the honourable member worry himself? presented by the Ministry and their direct and indirect supporters. The Attorney General has endeavoured to present a picture in which we are pourtrayed as being desirous to obstruct business, and it is only right that I should direct attention to a intended to indicate to the public the true value of the Deakin Administration. The cross-benches are so crowded that I am afraid that during the summer months some of the more stalwart members of the Labour Party, and especially the honourable member for Maranoa, will find their positions very uncomfortable, and it may be perhaps necessary to enlarge the accommodation in that portion of the chamber, and give it an even more lop-sided appearance than it now presents. The political situation is already a lop-sided one. It is really most surprising to find members of the Labour Party sitting cheek-by-jowl with some of their most violent opponents. What has brought about this astounding coalition ? It is nothing but the deep and undying hatred entertained towards the leader of the Opposition. It is a personal, rather than a political, matter, and it is as well that the public should know that such is the case. is no more popular man in the House than the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney.",40,Honourable Members Ha Ha I

274,( Mr Ronald,"What nonsense; therehe is not in office. While he is content to be leader of the Opposition, he is most popular, but let him once assume the reins of office, and a certain section of the Australian press will howl him down without any pretence of justification. honourable members do not entertain personal hatred towards the right honourable gentleman, but they are certainly actuated by a strong political fear of him. The Prime Minister assigned as his reason for breaking the alliance into which he had entered with the leader of the Opposition, that the protectionist cause was in danger. He told the public that he was afraid that the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney would endeavour to forward the free-trade doctrine at the expense of protection. The protectionist press of Victoria supported him in that attitude. To-day neither the press nor Mr Deakin appears to think that there is any reason for Yet fication than there was prior to the assumption of office by the present Government. Prime Minister stated at Ballarat that he would like the Labour Party to place protection in the forefront of their programme; but since that date a Labour Convention has been held, the delegates at which definitely refused to take up the fiscal question or to make protection one of the planks of their platform. that protection is in greater danger to-day than it was at the time the Prime Minister spoke at Ballarat. ' The Labour Party have made up their minds to ignore protection, and yet we find that a Ministry composed of ardent protectionists depend on them for support. the alliance was that protection is in danger, and no greater proof could be afforded of the hollowness of any such pretext than that now presented to us. Opposition, when he was Prime Minister, said he would adhere to the lines of the alliance, and he kept his compact. appointed the Tariff Commission to inquire into alleged anomalies, and he said that he would not disturb the fiscal situation until the Commission had reported. present Government have gone no further. The Commission has not yet reported, and the Prime Minister has stated that no action will be taken until they have done so. Therefore, it does not seem to me that the cause of protection has been advanced one whit by the change of administration. The statement of the Prime Minister that protection was in danger was a mere subterfuge, and his action in deserting his old ally was prompted either by hatred or fear. I do not, however, desire honourable memPerhaps bers to accept my unsupported opinion of the Prime Minister. I would direct their attention to the opinions which have been expressed by some of his new allies. The Labour Party may, in a contemptuous manner, give him the assistance of their votes; but in return for any help that they may render, they will wring from him solid concessions. One of the most biting criticisms which has ever been directed against the Prime Minister appeared in the Brisbane Worker of ist July last. This is the most outspoken labour journal in Australia, and is regarded as the official organ of the party. The article from which I propose to quote is headed "" The Perfidious alarm with regard to protection. Deakin."" It reads as follows :there would be more justiLaugh and jeer as we may at G. H .

The article proceedsWe may take it for granted that, with the strains of the Ballarat speech ringing in his ears like a death knell, our two and a half cwt. of Prime Minister will not boast of putting on more weight for some time to come. He built his little house upon the faith of Deakin; had he read his Encyclopedia Britannica more closely, he might have been forewarned by the parable of the house built upon sand. Deakin is all sand-san d without grit, quicksand. Woe betide the political wayfarer who ventures his feet that way. There is no foot-hold in Deakin. He is true to nobody, not even to himself. He would betray himself behind his own back, if that were possible. the honourable member should read such statements. out, he would not be allowed to make them upon his own account; and that which he would not be allowed to say upon his own account, he ought not to be permitted to utter as an extract. If he feels it necessary to read such extracts, I would suggest that he should omit all objectionable epithets. tracts in question absolutely in the interests of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and with a desire to show the nature of the support that he will receive in this House. I claim that the vote which will be given to his Ministry will be contemptuously thrown at him. allege that all the statements contained in the extracts which I have read are true orable member read them? the most powerful official Labour organ in Australia. member for Indi has said, "" Let us proceed with practical business."" I wish to show the public of Australia the character of the support which the Government are receiving at the present moment. If eight months ago the Prime Minister considered his position intolerable, what can he think of it now, when the official organ of the Labour Party speaks of him in such disrespectful terms? It continuesWithin the brief space of a few months Deakin lent himself to tactics which resulted in the has "" ratted"" on everybody. troubled to do it as decently as possible; he does not pay the proprieties the compliment of covering up his tracks. Once on a time he. was considered a trustworthy, if somewhat ladylike, politician. /People talked about his beautiful voice; no one suspected it had so many falsetto notes.

During the crisis that preceded the downfall of the VVatson Ministry, Deakin was at one and the same time in secret negotiation with both Reid and Watson. According to this newspaper, the present Prime Minister is a very bad lot indeed. It declaresSo little was he concerned about the political principles at issue that he could not make up his mind whi'ch side to join. In the end he decided As I have already pointed for Reid, probably for no better reason than that it was the. course of action which enabled him to "" r a t "" upon somebody. The Labour Party had kept Deakin in office for three years; what more natural than that he should seize the first opportunity of requiting them with treachery. He betrayed the protectionist party. Three weeks ago he declared that the protectionist cause was in danger, and that he must look out for fresh supporters. But I would point out that his fresh supporters have to do exactly what the people outside telf them to do. They must do what the labour leagues say. The Inter-State Labour Conference decided not to place protection upon the forefront of their programme. I ask whether the policy of protection is more I do not in danger to-day than it was three weeks ago? danger three weeks ago than it is to-day. are endeavouring to secure the votes of both free-traders and protectionists without The honourable and learned declaring their fiscal policy. The Worker goes onThe prospect of being thus able to figure as two separate and distinct Judases in one act was more than Deakin could resist. Accordingly,, he lent his countenance and help to the shameless tactics by which the defeat of the Labour Government was compassed, and a Coalition Ministry of free-traders and protectionists was fixed 1 up. The Labour Party have declared that, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat He hasn't even destruction of the Watson Administration.",42,Honourable Members Ha Ha I

They tell us that the leader of the Opposition is a bad lot; but, whatever he may have done, he has done openly. The Brisbane Worker, however, the official organ of the Labour Party, says that the present Prime Minister compassed the death of the Labour Administration. Telegraph of Sydney say? organ of the Labour Party. That journal continuesDeakin himself did not accept office, but on his personal advice, Turner, McLean, and McCay did so, and he carried the majority of the protectionists over wfth him to sit behind Reid, the free-trade Premier. That is a sad spot in our historv. and I have no desire to dwell upon it. You, sir, only three weeks ago, were an unwilling listener to the speeches which were delivered by the right honourable member for Balaclava and the honourable and learned member for Corinella. I have no desire to dwell upon them, beyond agreeing with the honourable and learned member for Indi, that the public should be placed in possession of the facts. ber subscribe to that newspaper ? The fiscal issue had been sunk, or, as he phrased it, "" a fiscal truce"" had been proclaimed, and the daily press of both fiscal colours at one, as ever, in their common antagonism to labour, extolled his conduct as in the highest degree patriotic. Honourable members will observe that I have quoted the exact words of the article, irrespective of whether they are unfriendly to the Government or the Opposition. Here, then, we find an official admission that a fiscal truce had been brought about, and that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was a party to it. Yet to-day we are informed that the reason for his assumption of office is that that truce has been broken. The article in the Worker continuesWith the near approach of a new session of Parliament, Deakin's invincible instinct to betray somebody asserted itself. I believe that that is a correct diagnosis of the honourable and learned member's political character. He cannot long remain loyal to an alliance with anybody. Casting about for a pretext, he suddenly discovered that the "" fiscal truce"" had been broken. Deakin dearly loves a pretext. The last sentence I can most emphatically endorse. A little while back, under a pretext, he abandoned Ministerial office. He entertained the idea-a n invincible instinct -that the presence of three parties in the House was absolutely intolerable, and that no good could come of the position. Therefore, his invincible instinct made him abandon office. I find from the Worker thatWhen he joined Reid, the pretext was the utter immorality of having three parties in Parliament, and the absolute necessity of having only two. Now that he wants to "" r a t "" on Reid, he contemplates reverting to the three-party system without a blush. To-day's pretext is the breaking of a "" fiscal truce,"" and how, think you, has the fiscal truce been broken? The answer comes immediatelyBy the appointment of a Tariff Commission, to which Deakin himself consented. It is a Commission which is still in existence, which has not yet reported, and in regard to the labours of which the Prime Minister has admitted that no action can be taken until its report has'been lodged. The Worker continuesWhen the inquiry into the Tariff was arranged for, he took no exception to it. He did not say then that it was a breach of the coalition compact. That is about the most biting criticism of the conduct of the Prime Minister that I have read. When the inquiry into the Tariff was arranged for, he took no exception to it. He did not say then that it was a breach of the coalition compact. He was, at the time, in constant communication .'with his allies; he threw out no warning of any kind that the action being taken would dissolve the alliance. Nor did he, before speaking at Ballarat, convey to them the slightest hint of his intentions. The fact of the matter is, Alfred Deakin must have a pretext of some kind, and the Tariff Commission is the handiest thing around. The suggestion is that the Prime Minister was ready to avail himself of any pretext, and that he was glad to seize upon the Tariff as a pretext in this case. When he allied himself with our party it seems to me that he took the best course of his political life. To-day, by interjection, the leader of the Labour Party admitted that the late Opposition were prepared to destroy the Reid-McLean Ministry. The late Prime Minister is said to have committed political suicide, and yet we have the admission of the leader of the Labour Party that he and his followers would have taken part in an attempt to give the late . Ministry the happy despatch had they not pursued the course which they did. That being so, the late Prime Minister simplv",43,Honourable Members Ha Ha I

307,Mr Wilks',"We are told by the other by the official organs of the Labourto accept the support of a party whose oigans speak of them in that manner. One of the matters of practical legislation which the Government propose to bring forward is a Bill for tlie encouragement of the iron industry. We, on this side, however, cannot think that the Government are earnest when they say that they intend to pass this measure, because we know that its introduction will be like the throwing of a bombshell into this Chamber. The members of the Labour Party desire that the iron industry shall be controlled and managed by the State, whereas many of the members of the Government wish to provide for the granting of bonuses for the assistance of private enterprise in this matter. The Deakin Administration came into office because of the cry that the Reid Administration would destroy protection in Australia, and protectionists regard the establishment of the iron industry as the very basis of protection. Notwithstanding, we find this great diversity of opinion in regard to the Iron Bonus Bill on the part of the Ministry and their supporters. Another measure which is to be introduced is a Bill providing for the redistribution of seats. I do not wisb to repeat what has already been said on the subject this afternoon, but I should like to point out the peculiar position of the Government in regard to that measure. Neither the Attornev-General nor some of his colleagues are at all anxious that New South Wales shalt obtain an additional member. They have raised constitutional quibbles about the necessity for a Commonwealth census being taken, although Victoria obtained her twenty-three members on figures that were several years old. When last the question of redistribution was before the House,' the Minister of Trade and Customs, who was then Minister of Home Affairs, was openly active in his engineering to prevent the adoption of the Commissioners' schemes. The present inequality of electoral arrangements is one of the reasubject affecting the interests of Queensland sons why the people of New South Wales are so dissatisfied with the conduct of Federaise his voice to such a pitch that no one ral affairs that I believe that any public man of moment could obtain an overwhelming majority of the people of that State in favour of separation. strongly about the matter, because not a large number voted for the right honourable member for Efast Svdney after he had resigned his seat to give prominence to it. win hands down every time. for Barrier should be the last to resist the just rights of New South Wales. As a labour member, and an advocate of democratic principles, he should be the last to refuse to give full force to the principle of one man one vote. If the honourable member were to live for a hundred years he would not resign his seat upon a matter of principle, such as that which caused the right honourable gentleman to go before the electors. to do any such thing. gentleman gave those who were opposed to him every opportunity to contest his seat; but they knew his strength too well to avail themselves of his invitation. The indignation which was felt in Sydney at the treatment accorded to the Re-distribution of Seats Bill was sufficiently indicated by the vastness of the audience which assembled at the Town Hall to hear the right honourable member for East Sydney. That hall will hold 6,000 people, and yet the accommodation provided was not sufficient for all those who desired admission. up at the poll. for a heavy poll, because there was practicially no opposition to the right honourable gentleman. I can assure honourable members that one of the pin-pricks most keenly felt by the people of New South Wales has been the neglect of the Federal authorities to accord to their State its proper representation in this House. Another question to which I desire to refer is that of the Capital site. the people of New South Wales think that the Capital will never be established within their territory. If we were discussing any the honourable member for Maranoa would else could be heard. I have seen him stand here pale with anger when fighting in the interests of the banana industry. barking up the wrong tree.

324,Mr Wilks,"T h a t has been pretty wellwith. When the present Prime Minister appeals to the country and declares that he broke up the last alliance because he feared the destruction of protection, we must see the hollowness of his declaration. These are facts which it is just as well to present to the public. The Government have merely adopted the measures which were prepared by the ReidMcLean Administration. will sit down, he will have some Bills laid upon the table within five minutes. sures of the last Administration. measures fit to be placed"" upon the table of the House. able and learned member should be very cautious before he again lectures the House. In view of his remarks, I cannot be held answerable for the length of this debate. I have been compelled to read an article from the Brisbane Worker, which has kept me awake many nights. I regret to say that, roughly written as it is, that article iÂ« substantially true. During the past twelve months there has been an incessant and infernal grasping for office. I trust that, in future the honourable and learned member for Indi will not use his powers of language to lecture this House in the undeserved way that he'has. I have been simply compelled by his action to indulge in this criticism. that the House is to be congratulated upon having shown an early disposition to put the personal element in this debate upon one side. It is very natural that the leader of the Opposition should have felt disposed to continue in this House the differences of opinion that he has entertained with the leader of. the Government; and I should not be at all surprised if the latter by-and-by entered into something in the nature of a defence involving some personal matters. . I was inclined fo begin my speech by congratulating the leader of the Government upon the very business-like deliverance which he made in announcing the Government policy yesterday. Owing to his disposition to deal in lengthy and eloquent speeches, I could not avoid feeling that some pressure must have been applied by his colleagues in order to induce him to turn over an entirely new leaf in his mode ot addressing this House. His speech suggested to me the picture of an impressionist artist being called upon merely/ to paint a garden fence; because he not only did not indulge in lengthy rhetorical utterance such as we have usually had from him, but he read a cold-blooded statement which was in the nature of a catalogue of the measures which the Government propose to put before us. Now, I think that the public have had quite enough of the personal element. It is perfectly natural that the present leader of the Opposition, who, if I may say so, has, If the honourable member I think, suffered a little in his reputation as a parliamentary tactician, should have desired to express in this House some of the reasons which actuated him in taking the steps which led to the downfall of his Ministry, and I think it is equally natural that he and the leader of the Government should have occupied many columns of the I suggest that the honorpress in explaining their views as to the causes of the recent Ministerial trouble. I am quite sure, however, that both of them are men enough to recognise that what the country requires at the present time is not excuses or accusations but a serious attempt to transact business. I do not know that it particularly needs Acts of Parliament, because I think the public see a little more deeply than do honourable members into the real work of a Parliament. I remember the Prime Minister of the present dav boasting twenty years ago, before a public meeting, that the Government of which he was a member had passed two inches of statutes. He seemed at that timea period in his salad daysto think that the test of the value of a Government was the thicknesses of paper which they added to the statutes of the country. I. do not consider that the public test the abilitv of a Parliament by the number of Acts that it passes. I think they test Parliament by the wisdom of the measures that it enacts. Those of us who have had much experience in legislation recognise that the wisdom of a measure lies, not in the number of clauses it contains, but'rather in the way in which it has dealt a blow at some abuse without restricting the liberty of the people further than was necessary. We must never lose sight of the fact that every section in an Act of Parliament takes away a liberty. The most conservative of politicians admit that the freer we can leave the citizens the better they are. The desire nf the public is that we shall push on with business. There are a number of measures which are almost in the nature of machinery Bills that have yet to be dealt with by this Parliament; and there are a number of measures in regard to which there is no like-",48,Honourable Members Ha Ha I

The present leader of the Opposition announced some months ago that he intended to occupy the whole of this session in dealing with what he described as "" non-contentious ' ' measures; and no exception was taken to the fact that there were sumcient of such Bills to occupy the attention of this House usefully for some months. Those measures, it seems to me, require to be passed, and the statements that have been uttered by one side of the House! to the other, and by one section oT the press to the other, may now be well left alone. I am quite sure that none oT the charges that can be made in this House, from one side or the other, will alter in one iota the opinions of honourable members or change a single vote. That being so, without seeking to pose as an oracle or a peacemaker, I think I may say that we should ""let the dead past bury its dead."" The speech which the leader of the Opposition made to-night will be useful, not to the House, but to the public, because it will reveal to them, perhaps more realistically than they have understood before, to what a great extent Parliament is rather a sort of skittle alley for political ideals and political required. I venture to say that there is no ambitions than a workshop in which we debate questions for the real benefit of the public. There is too much of the personal and party element about it. I think I may make that assertion, because I have never indulged very largely in what I call party tactics or in party moves, I have generally gone my own way, considering that that is the most useful course a man can take in political life; and I do hope that as this House gets older it will incline more to work, irrespective of the opinions that honourable members entertain of one another. We have arrived at what I may describe as the top note of political demoralization with regard to party government in this country. I hope that we have reached the turning-point, and that honourable members on both sides of the House will now settle down fo something like business. After so much reviewing of the past, the observations I am about to make to-night may seem to be somewhat prosaic, because I propose to deal with some of the measures which were set out in the short speech delivered by the Prime Minister. I should like to say, in the first place, that when the Prime Minister observed that ""the Ministry adheres to the practical policy sanctioned by the country,"" he uttered an absurdity. No man, at the present time, can say what the Commonwealth has asked for, or what it wants, because it has returned to this House three distinct parties-on e party advocating what is practically a nationalisation of the whole of the industries of the country; another party, on this side of the House, whose prime aim was until recently to establish a nearer approach to free-trade; and still another party opposite, now joined for a time, and perhaps for only a very short time, with the Labour Party, whose chief aim seems to be to secure a higher protecfion for local industries. This toeing so, who can say what the Commonwealth desires at the present time? When the leader of the present Government, twelve months ago, was putting his policy before the people of Australia, he said that fiscal peace was what they needed. He also declared that it was fiscal .peace that was wanted when he combined part of his forces with those of the leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, in order to oppose socialistic measures. Next, we were told in Western Australia, and subsequently at Ballarat, that protection was what the people man who can gauge, in a corporate sense, the opinion of the people of the Commonwealth at the present time. As long as the country returns two or three parties to the House-tw o of them advocating policies diametrically opposed to one another, it will be impossible to say that it is expressing a corporate opinion upon any policy whatever. In these circumstances it struck me that when, at the very opening of his speech, the Prime Minister said that the Ministry adhered to the practical policy sanctioned by the country he was talking to the gallery. It was a sentence which, I think, need not have been put in so short and sententious an address. Then he went on to say-and I think I am entitled to criticise this verbiage-that the policy he was putting before the House was the same policy that was submitted to Parliament in 1904, and was put forward by the same party. That, again, was an unconscious misstatement of the facts. The policy is not being put forward by the same party as before. The very first matter-on e to which the Prime Minister seemed to attach quite as much importance as he did to any other-wa s the taking over and conversion of the debts of the States. If we owe the measure dealing with that question to any one, in its present embryonic condition, we owe it to the right honourable member for Balaclava. He conceived it, in the first place. it into shape, who submitted the question to the Hobart Conference, and altogether prepared the country for it, if the different States would have approved of its formulation for parliamentary treatment. And yet the right honourable gentleman is not even a member of the party introducing the programme which the Prime Minister put before the House. that does not affect the truth or otherwise of the statements put to the House, that this is the same policy and the same party that we had in 1904. The party is not the same, because four of its prominent members, in its original condition, are omitted from its ranks. the Prime Minister took credit for one of the. most important measures that was formulated by, and originated in the mind of, one of those honourable members who is now cut off from the rest of the Protectionist Party. My attention was directed a few days ago to a paragraph which appeared in the Age newspaper as far back as December, 1904. it worth reading to the House, in order to show what extraordinary changes take place in a Parliament like this in the whirligig of time. I commend this extract to members of the present Government, because it throws on them an obligation to differentiate their Ministerial action during this Parliament from the action of all the other Governments which have preceded it . In an issue of the Melbourne Age, in December, 1904, there appeared the following: We have had three Governments in power, and not one n f them has made the smallest legislative ma rk. Not one of them has promulgated even the outlines of a policy to which any section of the people would vouchsafe a second thought. Those three Governments were the Barton Government, the Deakin Government, and the Watson Government, and, therefore, it is well the House should know that no less an authority than the newspaper in question has pronounced that not one of them has "" promulgated even the outlines of a policy to which any section of. the people would vouchsafe a second thought."" Government ? with the matter historically, and now come to the Reid Government. We know that the Reid Government did very little last It was he who put session: they passed one measure which, I have no hesitation in saying, is socialistic, namely, the Sea-Carriage of Goods Act. I protested against that measure, which, I say now, has done a great deal of harm. It has interfered between the citizens of the Commonwealth and the ship-owners, who were dealing with one another in an ordinary business matter, which was entirely within their own discretion and jurisdiction. Any measure which, as it were, puts a legislative wedge between different sections of the community who are trading under the principles of freedom, which every British community is supposed to concede to them, is, in my opinion, a socialistic measure. We all know that this measure was submitted to Parliament in consequence of a rather inNothwithstanding this, fluential deputation that waited on the Prime Minister, and asked him for some such interference. We know, also, as stated by Sir William McMillan in the press, that the fruit-growers of Australia only represent one per cent, of the shippers from Australia of Australian produce. And yet at that time there were no less than thirteen shipping companies competing for The extract is very short, but I think the work provided by the producers of this country: by fewer shipping companies now. touch the-question I am putting before the House; I want to show what has been done by the Reid Government. It will be seen, therefore, that the Reid Government did practically nothing else last session. I admit that that Government had a very hard part to play. They had a majority of only one or two, and had to sail very close to the wind in order to retain office. I suppose the leader of the Opposition will justify himself to-day by saying that his object was to put on the statute-book of the country a great many of those machinery measures which he calls ""non-contentious."" If the Age newspaper, which I think is accepted as a sort of oracle by the Prime Minister of this country^ treats the Barton Government, the Deakin Government, and the Labour Government as Governments which have practically done nothing; and if it be admitted that the Reid Government had very little time in which to do anything, the present Government are now called on not only to formulate a policy, for that is I am dealing an easy matter, but to so regulate the proceed'ngs of this Hoifte that we may, between now and Christmas, place on the",49,Honourable Members Ha Ha I

I should like to draw attention to what, in this lengthy catalogue of measures, seems to me an important omission. The honourable member for Hume has, at all events, professed to take a deep interest in the Capital Site question. I see no reference to that question in the programme of measures which the Government propose to bring forward. cided. say what I have previously said in the House, and also out of the House, in the State of Victoria. I have had great fault found with me by the press of that State for constantly dwelling on this question. say that we, as a Federal Parliament, should place the settlement of this question before that of all others. It has been frequently said by the Victorian people that there is no need for a speedy settlement. But there is a broader aspect of the whole question. We meeting here as the representatives of all the six States of Australia, must recognise an obligation upon the Commonwealth to settle this question as soon as practically possible. point of view. tralian point of view. I do not care what State honourable members may represent; if I represented Western Australia, I should be just as anxious to settle the question, iind I am a little disappointed that the Government have not included it in their programme. The matter is at present hung up, and a difficulty has been created which could have been avoided. The difficulty is that this House, instead of passing a resolution, merely indicating the New South Wales territory which it desired to have ceded to it , or placed at its disposal, so that it might therein fix the Capital Site, took it upon itself to legislate in tlie most determined way in fixing on a Capital Site. I pointed out in the House at the time that that procedure was wrong. Hansard will show that I contended, in the presence of the present Prime Minister, who had charge of the Bill, that he was adopting a wrong procedure, and I also pointed out to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that a mistake was being made. Further, I drew the attention of the present Attorney-General to the mistake. I point this out, not in order to take credit to myself, but to show that there was an absolute want of care to investigate the constitutional aspect of the question. The Constitution says, in the plainest possible way, that the Commonwealth shall choose a Capital Site within territory which "" shall have been"" acquired, or granted to it, by the particular State in which it is to be placed; and I think there could be no two opinions as to what that meant. It meant that unless this House was going to arrogate to itself-and I use the word "" arrogate "" in its strictest senseunless this House was going to claim a sort I desire here to of rough and ready right to take any site it chose in New South Wales, it was going the wrong way to work. The Constitution recognises that before the Commonwealth can takes a site, the territory must be willingly I granted to, or purchased by, the Commonwealth for that purpose. What is the result? dead-lock. That is the very word I have used on more than one occasion in writing to the Victorian press, when I contended that this House of Parliament had passed a measure deliberately attempting to fix a Capital Site without consulting the wishes of New South Wales. This Parliament an Australian now finds that a constitutional difficulty stands in the way. The State of New SouthF r o m an AusWales says. "" You cannot take a Capital Site until we have ceded territory to you, or vou have acquired in some other way, a right to settle your capital within that territory."" But this measure was passed, notwithstanding that the honourable and learned member for Indi listened to what I had to say-notwithstandin g that I pointed out to the House in a public way, and afterwards privately, to the Prime Minister, that a mistake was being made in passing an Act of Parliament, instead of passing a mere resolution indicating, in a courteous way to New South Wales, the territory in which we desired to choose a Capital Site. We are now in the difficult position that we must either go back on our own Act, by repealing it, and thus admit we made a stupid blunder in our legislation; or we must bring some extraordinary influence to bear 'on New South Wales in order to get that State to cede to us the territory in which we have chosen the Capital Site. Even in the latter case, we should have to pass another Act ; because the Act must come after the ceding of the territory, in order to be within the Constitution.

I heard the Minister of Home Affairs answer a question today, to the effect that he was in communication with the New South Wales Government. That answer is just about as satisfactory as to say the matter is under consideration. We know very well that the Prime Minister of New South Wales is just as determined, and the people of New South Wales, I think, in the majority of cases, are just as determined not to have the Capital Site within the particular territory which this Parliament has chosen, as the Minister of Home Affairs may be to carry on his communications. I should like to know from the leader of the Government when he replies in this debate, what he proposes to do in the matter-whethe r it would not be better for us to take the difficulty in hand and repeal the Act which we have passed. If the Minister of Home Affairs imagines that he will convert the New South Wales Parliament into giving up the territory which this Parliament has chosen with a view to the Capital being made there, all I can say is that he misconceives the temper of New South Wales and of the New South Wales Parliament, and certainly of tbe Premier of that State at the present time. able and learned member suggesting that we should allow the New South Wales Parliament to choose the capital? to suggest.

I should like to say with regard to the States debts question that I think it is altogether premature for this Parliament to attempt to deal with it at all. We all recollect that when FederaI t serves the New tion was "" in the air "" there was every prospect of Commonwealth stock being saleable or issuable at a much lower rate of There is no interest than that paid by the States, that there was the prospect of a saving of something like ,Â£500,000 a year. Indeed, I believe the Sydney Daily Telegraph was so sanguine in its expectations as to the power of the Commonwealth to iborrow money at a lower rate than the States, that it estimated the saving at Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. But that was before the Federation was accomplished and before this House had had an opportunity of passing some of The other States cannot the measures which have brought it into such disrepute in Europe and Great Britain.

But the point to which I desire to direct the attention of honourable members is that, in the anticipations of pre-Federation days, it was urged that it would no doubt be to the interests of the whole of the Australian States that they should convert their separate debts into Commonwealth stock, and so save in interest which 1 they have to pay, from Â£ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 to Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 per year. Buti f our Commonwealth, rightly or wrongly-and I use those words advisedly, because I do not wish to go off on to a side track-if our Commonwealth has so suffered in reputation suffered in reputation that its stock would not fetch more than would State stock, there is nothing to be gained by the conversion of State stock into Commonwealth stock. debts to-dav, and by-and-by, as the honourable member for Gwydir anticipates, the Commonwealth should acquire a better reputation, so that Commonwealth stock would fetch a higher price, we should have lost our opportunity by floating our Commonwealth stock now when the CommonAvealth stands no higher in the money market than do the States. I put that contenI t is a fact that tion before the House some six months ago, when the right honourable member for Balaclava was pressing the question upon our attention. The action suggested would be like shutting the door after the horse had gone. When we have resuscitated the reputation of the Commonwealth by the wise legislation which the present Government wil] introduce, then will be the time to take action. But honourable members know very well that the reputation of a country cannot If the honorbe resuscitated more quickly than can that of an individual, and if a man acquires a bad reputation in the financial world he cannot, by suddenly announcing that he is going to be honest and wise for the future, at once reinstate himself in the good opinion of those who make up that world. States always paid the money which they owe? Mr T3RUCE SMITH It takes years to restore the lost financial reputation of an individual, and it will take years for the Commonwealth to acquire that higher financial reputation which will enable us to make this great saving of Â£ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year in the interest bill which the States have now to pay. more good seasons. member for Gwydir has not a very large grasp of national affairs if he thinks that seasons make the reputation of a country.

It is all very well to sneer at these things, but anv man who has given the most elementary study to political economy must know that it is only by these indications that you can discover the trend of credit. That the trend of credit is out of a country rather than into it may be indicated sometimes by a very few instances. The instance which I propose to give may be sneered at. but 1 give it for what it is worth. A member of a very large wool firm, buying no less than 50.000 or 60.000 bales of wool in this country and sending it to Europe and America, informed me that his firm had established a woollen mill in America, on which they had expended Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0, and in which they employed 2,000 people.

But whether we are labour members, or protectionists, or I do not wish free-traders, this is common ground-that capital belongs to somebody. The men who own it, and are clever enough to keep it, look round very carefully to see the forces that are at play in the community in which they are invited to invest it. If you have timid capitalists to deal with, it does not matter whether you legislate or not; if you merely talk about legislation of a character which is calculated to raire doubts as to the security of that capital, it quicklv flies away under the ocean, or, for that matter, above it , into other countries, where greater security, in the sense of greater freedom from restraint, is given.",55,Chapman I S The Honor Question Settled I Do Not Want Honor

393,Mr Bruce Smith,"The short speechproposal was known, it was very severely criticised in the Senate. But it was riot known until a very late stage, because the Bill with all its details was practically adopted and approved, and at the very last moment-jus t before a division was going to take place-thi s extraordinary clause was inserted. Whether that proposal is to be brought before this House again or not, I do not know. Any person with an elementary knowledge of business and of bookkeeping, will at once see that it is an absurd way of dealing with the question. I do not wish to go into detail on the subject now; but I think that every honourable member will agree with me that, now that we have so many different interests in the Commonwealth, in the shape of the Commonwealth Government itself, its different departments, and the various States, it is very necessary that all the funds of these different entities should be kept perfectly clear. Just as in a State, one department will have to pay another department in order that it may be known how each Department stands, and what its financial position is at the end of the year, so we want the States and the Commonwealth to be kept perfectly distinct. Because, although the citizens of the States are citizens of the Commonwealth, we know that the Commonwealth Treasurer has already, at times, experienced a great deal of difficulty in determining the contributions of the different States to certain forms of expenditure which may seem of a purely Federalcharacter. I think that if one State, say, New South Wales, has spent Â£1,000.000 more than a State of a moderate size, and Â£2,000,000 more than a small State, on transferred properties which are to form the security for future Commonwealth dealings, it is entitled to have the value of those properties paid to it in a business-like way, because they were part and parcel of the security which it offered to those from whom it raised loans in England. It is only fair to the debenture-holders of the States that they should see, contemporaneously with these assets being taken over by the Commonwealth from the States, that they are duly paid for, and the money which is the consideration for those properties placed in the hands of the States, for the purpose of reducing their national debts, if they choose to do so. pose to do that with the money. [10]2 Sir WILLIAM LYNE W h o is to pay that monev to New South Wales? wealth, which must, sooner or later, borrow money, as the honourable member, as an old politician, and one who has occupied the position of Treasurer and Premier in a State knows. The honourable member is now a Ministeri n a Government which is really proposing that the Western Australian Transcontinental Railway be carried out. how does the Government propose to pay for that railway but by borrowing money? The Commonwealth, sooner or later, must borrow money for its permanent purchases, and the transferred properties, which really have a market value at any moment, must be treated as permanent assets, to be paid for out of loan money. for the water it consumes, be many years before the Commonwealth starts to borrow. have rather gone to extremes in that respect. I sympathized with the Labour Party when they objected to the Barton Ministry .borrowing money to pay for electrical apparatus which they were erecting. As a former Treasurer and Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, I have had to give, as the present Minister of Trade and Customs has had to give, careful attention to the distinction which should be drawn between expenditure out of current receipts and expenditure out of loan moneys. Loan money should be spent only upon those assets whiich are of a permanent and lasting character, or are what we call revenue producing. The purchase of post-offices would unmistakably come within the latter category. Post-offices are' revenue producing, because the Commonwealth is carrying on the business of the Postal Department for the whole of Australia. Therefore, the purchase of these properties would have to be made by the Commonwealth out of loan money. Buti f the Commonwealth is taking over these assets from the States, the States having alreadv borrowed money to build them, it must compensate the States to enable them to pay off so much of their loans if they choose. I should be very glad, replying to the interjection of the honourable member for Herbert, if the Commonwealth could in some way allocate the money paid for transferred properties so",57,Chapman I S The Honor Question Settled I Do Not Want Honor

399,Mr Bruce Smith,"I think that wethat the States would be compelled to use it to pay off so much of their national debt. the principle which I am advocating. If we hand over to a State Â£1,000.000 or Â£2,000,000, and it does not care to use the money to reduce its indebtedness, the people of the State will have themselves to thank for any bad result which may follow. When we commenced to hand back to New South Wales yearly between Â£2,000,000 and Â£3,00 0 , 0 0 0 of surplus Customs revenue, it was hoped that the money would be used to reduce the national debt, and the people of that State were sorry to see that, no matter how much came from the Commonwealth, the State Government swallowed it up in current expenditure, sometimes of a very questionable character. That, however, does not touch my argument, that, in paying the States for properties taken, we should compensate them. For the Commonwealth to call on the States separately! to pay a certain amount over to it, instead of borrowing to enable it lo pay back to the States the value of their properties, would be an unbusiness-like proceeding, which no competent commercial man would approve for a moment, if in a serious frame of mind. rowed, would it not be borrowing on the security on which the States have borrowed ? should give security over the whole of out taxing powers as a Commonwealth. If the bond-holders had what is called a specific mortgage over the taxing powers of the States they could call on them to reduce their mortgage to the extent of the money realized for that security. .speech deals next with the Western Australian Railway SurveyB ill ; and I should like the Prime Minister, when he deals .by-and-by! with other matters, to give us some idea-of his attitude on this question. I voted for the Survey Bill.

But I assented to a proposal that Western Australia should be That, however, does not affect called upon to give some sort of earnest of her intention to take a large part of this expenditure on her shoulders, and it was suggested that we should call upon her to reserve the whole of the lands for twenty miles on each side of the line, and place them in trust, to be a first charge for the cost of the railway. I think that that suggestion induced me to vote for the Survey Bill. has reserved that land. aware of the history of the matter. Western Australia responded to that suggestion, made, I think, on the representation of the right honourable member for Swan. but honourable members will admit that they are speaking on hearsay evidence only. upon which I speak is that of the right honourable member for Swan. the habit in my more condemnatory moods of talking of the country as a desert; but that was in negative advocacy.

413,Mr Bruce Smith,"I am speakingPresident of the Executive Council has expressed himself in doubtful terms about this country. His opinion has been formed upon a very wide knowledge of the geography of Australia, and although he has not been over the country, I know that he considers he is able to make a very fair deduction as to its character. for the Bill which authorized the expenditure of Â£20,000 upon the survey of the line, because I felt assured that, as the Western Australian Government had reserved the whole of the land for twenty miles on each side of the proposed route, they meant business, and that when the Bill for the construction of the line came before Parliament we should be able to reconsider the whole question as to whether the Commonwealth should itself undertake the work, or impose such conditions that we could not do much harm in authorizing the survey. I felt that by that time we should be able to ascertain for ourselves whether the country was, as some people said, a mere desert over which even the water for the engines would have to be drawn from either Kalgoorlie or Port Augusta, or from the fertile tract the Treasurer dreams of. I should like to know whether the Prime Minister has really serious intentions with regard to this question. The leader of the Opposition went to Western Australia, and had no hesitation in expressing himself unconditionally in favour of the construction of the line. As a member of his party, I never heard anything of such a proposal, and I should never have approved of it, even if the right honourable gentleman had made it a part of his policy, because the question is one which needs very serious consideration. The matter has been mentioned in a short and summary way by the Prime Minister, and I think it is fair to ask him what the Government intend to do. Three or four other questions referred to in the Prime Minister's statement are of very great importance. The Prime Minister statesThe Government is of opinion that the constitutional method of determining the precise time at which tlie representation in the House of the people of the respective States shall be increased or diminished, according to their numbers, is by an Parliament by .means of an estimate made Act of the Parliament. The dangers of leaving changes of this kind in tlie hands of any Ministry, and of permitting them either to be set on foot at any moment merely by Executive order, or to be delayed at Executive will, are obvious. I contend that there is just as much danger in leaving the matter to the determination of Parliament. The fear expressed by the Prime Minister is an exaggerated one, because we know very well that if any Government were to attempt to do anything of a gerrymandering character during the recess, Parliament would quickly visit the consequence of their conduct upon them. There is just as much danger in leaving the I voted decision to Parliament. The danger the Government fear is that a Government might be influenced by party considerations; but if the House contained a large majority of honourable members in favour of any particular policy-suppose , for instance, party spirit ran so high that Parliament itself might not be in a very highly moral mood or particular as to how it accomplished its endsa Bill might be passed which would confer advantage upon one State over another with as much ease as such a result might be brought about by an Executive minute. The explanation given by the leader of the. Opposition to-night ought to have great weight with honourable members. I confess that some of the information conveved by the right honourable gentleman was new to me. So far as I could understand, the Constitution was so framed as to allow the statisticians of the Commonwealth, or the statisticians of the States at the time, to be the determining power as to whether or not the population of a State had risen or fallen. I gathered from what the right honourable gentleman said, that the Commonwealth divisions were fixed upon nine years after a census had been taken, and that, therefore, they did not depend upon the census alone: also, that even when the last redistribution was proposed, reliance was placed upon estimates made by the statisticians of the different States. If that be the oase, it does not seem to me to be very unreasonable now to trust to the statisticians of the States, who certainly go about their work without heat or emotion. I regard them as about as cold-blooded as calculating machines, and if we cannot trust their interim estimates of the population of the different States we cannot rely on them to make a census for the guidance of the public. If a statistician is so biased in favour of his own, or any other State, that he will mislead the Commonwealth for the purpose of settling the representation of the different States, he will mislead us with regard to the census. ever suggested. member will admit that if we once get",59,Chapman I S The Honor Question Settled I Do Not Want Honor

A t the last election there were on the roll for my constituency 38,000 electors against 12,000 in the Darling electorate-in fact the number of women voters in my constituency exceeded the total number of electors in the district represented by the honourable member for Darling. But I should like to mention, as bearing upon the point taken by the leader of the Even in the case of a census Opposition, that at the last general election, whilst eight Victorians who were protectionists, were elected by 160,000 voters, eight free-traders were elected by 360.000 voters. Consequently, eight free-trade I s it wiser to deal with members really entered this House, representing 200,000 more electors than did the eight protectionists members. The rotten I think that if boroughs of England are nothing to that. A good deal of State feeling has under the Reform Bill of 1832 they were pretty bad. I suppose that I need not enter into a discussion of their position at the present time. I admit that they are very bad.

We know very well that whilst the right honourable member for Swan filled, the position of Minister of Defence, the defence estimates, at the instance of the late Sir Edward Braddon, were reduced in one night by Â£160,000, and that they were still further diminished upon the initiative of the honourable member for Bland by Â£60,000. At that time, the Government of the day were so much in the hands of the Labour Party, that they accepted that alteration without demur. were "" jumped up "" in consequence of the South African war. penditure, which was not increased by the South African wary was cut down. if we have asystem of defence which .is homogeneous, which has been built up with a due sense of proportion and perspective, we cannot cut it down by Â£200,000 without placing it in the position of a ship's engines, one of the cog-wheels from which has been removed. Then what is the standard which the Minister should adopt with regard to defence? Only recently the honourable member for Melbourne wrote a letter to the press urging the people of Australia to establish a system of defence adequate to repel a Japanese invasion. I read that letter with very great pleasure, and I think that I shall be paraphrasing it fairly when I say that it ireallv represented that we could undertake the defence of Australia against Japan. We might as well try to stop the current coming into Hobson's Bay with a carpet broom. Let honourable members just imagine a nation, which has recently placed a million men in I am satisfied, the field, and which has defeated one of the greatest military nations in Europe ber would have said the same thing in regard to the Boers and the British. honourable member, however, does not think that the Australian people have been trained to the same degree of defence capability as were the Boers. Moreover, we should recollect that the Japanese occupy an infinitely I am aware that a great many better position in iregard to Australia than did the English in regard to South Africa. Naturally, each has to They are not so far away, and in many 1 ways our country offers infinitely better opportunities for attack than did the South African Republics. The idea of defending our country, as the honourable member for Melbourne suggests, is absolutely absurd. It would mean an expenditure of millions of pounds a year. I happen to be familiar with the statistics relating to Japan, and I know that the suggested defence would mean an expenditure of millions annually. Our comparatively paltry outlay of Â£r,000,000 per annum, distributed as we now expend it, simply means that \\;e are practically playing at soldiers. I do not say that} we should not defend Australia at all, but the difficulty is that we have no standard. Until we have some sort of standard-unti l we know whether Ave are preparing merely for some chance attack on the pari? of a Aery small foreign force, or to defend ourselves against the ally of England-Av e shall haA'e no definite policy on which to proceed.

I do not say that they would not come in, because a larger number of people come in than some suppose.

If we enabled any man in England to ascertain from our High Commissioner that he possessed the necessary qualifications, so that he might obtain a certificate, and then break up his home, we might induce more people to emigrate to the Commonwealth. I do not say that they would come here as rapidly as they have gone to Canada. Australia is a long way off, and, after all, Canada is the fashion just now. The people of the old country do not know of the detrimental features of its climate, and they are not aware of the favorable character of the Australian climate..

We all remember the Stelling case, which will stand to our discredit so long as Australian history lasts. A German sailor named Stelling came to this country, I do not say whether under the press of circumstances or not; but he was a healthy, strong man, and was willing, I believe, to settle here as a citizen. He offered to pass the necessary examination in German, French, or English, but was told that he must pass it in modern Greek.

It is a Portuguese settlement, although the inhabitants may be rather an intellectually degenerate portion of the Portuguese people. At all events, the man was classed as a Portuguese sailor, and he was actually sentenced to six months' imprisonment with hard labour, because he could not pass an examination in English. That is the sort of thing which frightens people abroad. The Prime Minister must know that these things are added to in a dramatic fashion when once they pass through the hands of the journalist, and. growing in importance, as they are made fo do, much harm results. the Immigration Restriction Act be merely to require that the education test shall be other reasons for refusing a man admission, let those reasons be given.

512,Mr Bruc E Smith,"Something o fwhat the honourable and learned member's opinion on trust legislation is? this: We are not within years of the stage when such legislation is necessary. trust ? trust is the result of the absurd treatment of the tobacco duties by this Parliament. If the import duties and excise had been differently regulated,, there would not have been that combination people deprecate. see it put to an end if our legislation were improved. mind-in that by the combination of the tobacco manufacturers of Australia enormous sums of money are being made. is because this House did not give sufficient consideration to the duties and to the relations between the Customs duty I can only say, as a smoker, that I do not pav any more for cigars or tobacco to-day than I did before the trust was formed. I would commend any one who cares to do so, to take the trouble to read a very able book by Carnegie, The Gospel of Wealth, in which, perhaps, the best authority in the world upon the subject, deals with the advantages and disadvantages of trusts. Mr tive and other steps to put some limitation Carnegie points out in a very convincing way that, although trusts and combinations may raise the price of an article, the condition of things which arises from the production of a much larger quantity, with a much reduced plant, more than counterbalances the increased price demanded by the combination. interested in the question might read Carnegie's book, The Gospel of Wealth. called "" The Gospel of Fraud,"" and I have read it . is an autobiographical sketch of Carnegie's life, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Carnegie is a man who has managed to put together Â£40,000,000. aged to slaughter his workers,, too. aged to do that in such a way that I have never heard of any very tienchant charge made against him as a man. He has paid good men good salaries. shoot down his workers in Pittsburg. M v opinion is member for Franklin is now talking New York evening paper gossip. l if e of that man and the use he has made man of very large and liberal ideas, and one who would not be guilty, of anything of such a reprehensible character as that laid to his charge by the honourable member for which so many Franklin. refused his money. fact, it is common knowledgePittsburg have been described as "" a hell upon earth."" But that to champion Carnegie or his book, but though I am perhaps as suspicious of motives as are most men, I read the book, and some of Carnegie's remarks and arguments and the excise upon tobacco. upon the subject of trusts were very convincing to me. I know that the practice of forming trusts has been very much abused in America, and is being very much abused there to-day, even in connection with the control of the food of the people. We can depend upon it that when a man like the present President of the United States believes it to be necessary to take legislaupon the powers of trusts, there must be something wrong at the back of them. But I say that we are puking children in our commerce as compared with the United States people.

529,Mr Bruce Smith,"The honorableuseful work we must take first that which will do most good, which is most wanted, and which is most urgent; and we have plenty of work stated on this programme, which is of a much more urgent nature than is the suggested control of trusts. But I say of that, as I have said of a number of the other proposals submitted, that we are entitled to ask the Prime Minister, in his reply, to' give us some more detailed information-som e idea of the provisions which the Government propose to introduce to deal with the question. I understand that the Government have framed a good many measures; it may be that this one is amongst them, and we are entitled to ask the Prime Minister to give us something more than a mere category of Bills-to give us some information as to details. I can only say, generally, that I am not at all anxious to see the old personal sore brought up again in this debate. It is a post-mortem. Many of us do not think one-half as much of the other side as we do of our own; but we must remember that we hare a higher duty in this House than the washing of what is called ""linen."" We have a duty to the public. We have practically done nothing Tor twelve months, and, therefore, every honourable member, no matter to what partu he belongs, should be willing to help the Government to bury the hatchet, let the dead past bury its dead, and get on with public business. It is a duty cast upon the Prime Minister to give us a clear insight into his policy, and when that is done, I , for one, shall be very glad to give him a steady and honest support, irrespective of partu. able and learned member for Parkes has told the House that the duty of members of all parties is now to settle down in a spirit of good-will and amity. He has said., in fact, that it does not matter what act of political perfidy may be perpetrated in an assembly such as this, it is the duty of all, so far as possible, to cover up the tracks of the people who have been guilty of it. I do not agree with the honourable and learned member. affair. it is to see the honourable member for Maranoa sitting behind a protectionist Ministry. There are a few other sad affairs noticeable in this Chamber. It is sad to see the right honourable member for Swan sitting, with such love and good-will, alongside of the honourable member for Hume. It is also sad to see the honourable member for Bourke at last sitting on the Treasury bench, alongside of and in amitv with the Prime Minister. However, I do not wish, any more than does the honourable and learned member for Parkes, -to touch upon these painful subiects. I wish to say that the present Government has come into office in a distinctly unusual way. It was merely appropriate that such an unusual advent should have been signalized by such an unusual speech, or, shall we say, reading, as that to which we were treated by the Prime Minister yesterday. We were told that it was an announcement of the Government policv; it was. not an announcement of a policy, but simply a list of the titles of proposed Bills. There were thirty-six measures in all mentioned. -An Honorable MEMBER -Thirty-nine . that is just nine more than the number of pieces which Judas got for a no more worthy action than that of which the Government' have been guilty. The great point about this policy speech was the frank admission by the Prime Minister, at its conclusion, that it might not be possible to complete this programme. Why put before this House a programme which it might not be possible to complete? The honourable and learned gentleman has latelv shown that he is capable of considerable deception, but we have never previously heard him own up to it, as he has done h/this statement. ciation of the ""stone-walling"" capabilities of the Opposition. able member for Bland, who is responsible for the present position of the Prime Minister, ought not to accuse me of "" stone-walling.""

It is not right that honourable members opposite should endeavour to interrupt the course of a serious speech by suggesting that I am> ""stone-walling."" We have heard the policy speech of the Government, asking, for the thirty-seven pieces of silver; but we know that the real policy of Ministers is something quite different.

What would' be useful to the Government at the present time? all things, to stay as long as possible in the position into which they have so unworthily come; and they can only stay there by the grace of Watson. Such being the case, we can only look for what the Government propose during the present session to that which the honourable member for Bland would require them to do. The first point in their declared policy, which I notice, as a matter of urgency, is the Iron BonusB ill . I think we shall find that it will be used as a bridge over which the advocates of an iron bonus to private enterprise can march into the camp of our socialistic friends, who will have nothing to do with anything but State control. The Bill, I undertake to prophesy, will lose its previous basis of a bonus to private enterprise, and provide for the establishment of a State concern. The extension of the functions of the State is what the honourable member for Bland seeks. In this measure, which we were told was going to benefit certain keen supporters of the honourable member for Hume Sir supporters of mine? Sir' WILLIAM LYNE to me last time. hope, be opposed to the honourable gentleman when we next go to the country, and I think he will, for the present object-lesson should be sufficient to range him up alongside us. This measure, which was to benefit the late supporters of the honourable member for Hume, and the late supporters of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, will now be used to extend the functions of the State, and so benefit the party which holds the Ministry in the hollow of its hand. The next measure which I conceive, will be one of urgency, is that very innocent looking measure,! the Trade Marks Bill. We all know that fhe members of the Labour Socialistic Partv in the last session introduced an amendment seeking to legalize the use of the union label. The object of that legalization is to initiate a universal boycott of goods manufactured by non-union labour, and thus to so extend the organization of the socialistic party, that in a very short time they will Therefore, we can be able to do without the figure-head support of the present Administration. That is another matter of urgency, and one which I think will be brought on soon. It will be very instructive to see how the present They want, above Administration will consider this proposal of the Labour Party. We have been told a good deal by the honourable and learned member for Parkes about a measure in which the right honourable member for Swan is keenly interested. I refer, of course, to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. We were told by the honourable and learned member for Parkes that the Western Australian' Government had given us a quid pro quo in offering us a certain strip of territory alongside the surveyed to be route. What it amounted to was made abundantly clear last session by the honourable and learned member for Wannon. A t page 7563 of Hansard, he is reported to have saidThe distance between Kalgoorlie and the border is 450 miles, and a stretch of country, 450 miles long by 50 miles wide, covers an area of 14,400,000 acres. At the. present time all this land may be taken up on lease for ios. per 1,000 acres per annum, but there are no takers. As an honourable and gallant member of another place has said, it is such confounded goat country that the State Government cannot get takers at that price. It is really not sheep, but goat country. Honourable members, who have read in Western Australia, will know that the land is of very poor character. If the whole of the 14,400,000 acres were leased at a rental of ios. He was opposed per 1,000 acres per annum, the revenue derived from it would be only ,Â£7,200 per annum. The most sanguine estimate is that, at the outset, Mr Sandford w ill ; I the loss on the running of the railway would be ^70,000 per annum, so that, even if we secured the revenue from the lease of the reservation, we should still have to face a loss of over ,Â£60,000 a year. In other words this quid pro quo about which the Western Australian Government made such a song really amounts to only one-seventh of the whole loss that the Commonwealth would be called upon to bear as the result of building the line. orable and learned member for Wannon an authority on that country? think, the right honourable gentleman, who told me that ""the rental value was ios. per 1,000 acres.

That navy is our first line of defence, and it is therefore the duty of those who deal with the defence problem to consider whether our partnership in it is constituted on a basis best calculated to serve the interests of the Commonwealth, and whether it itself is adequate for the services that we expect from it. British fleets all the world over have certain definite duties allotted to them. Each has to watch the dispersed and scattered squadrons belonging to foreign powers. In time of war the British Navy would concentrate upon the enemy's vessels wherever found, and sink or blockade them. But obviously it would be impossible to prevent the escape and roaming at large of individual cruisers. make the wide seas their own. We have been told by no less an authority than a French Minister for Marine that the duty of these roving cruisers would be in all cases to avoid giving, action to English men-of-war. sible, prey on our commerce, and harry our ports, all the time playing the part of the hunted, and keeping an eye over the shoulder for English war vessels. They would not remain long in any one place. Their raids would be fugitive, because they would have to be always on the move to evade the ships which England would send in their wake. England has made preparation for this eventuality. One has only to look at the great preponderance of cruiser strength in the Imperial navy to recognise that England has made such provision. But the danger which we have most to regard is that some of these cruisers may come along our coasts, harrying our shipping, and attacking our-ports. In Australia, considerably more (than one-third of the population is congregated in a few ports, and our cities would need protection against such raids as I have outlined. Our ports should possess up-to-date artillery of position, with highly efficient, and sufficient, gunners to work it. At present we have not the gunners, and we have not sufficient guns. One city, containing half-a-million of the four millions of people in Australia, has not sufficient gunners, militia and permanent, to give one relief for the up-to-date guns in its fortresses. This is a fact which should be seriously considered by honourable members. like to see a large standing army maintained in Australia?

562,Mr Kelly,"In-spit e of the fact thatTreaty respect it. But they have a citizen soldiery in a very high state of efficiency, and I hope that in time we shall have our field forces and citizen soldiery in the same efficient state. In the meantime, however, we are neglecting a danger to which we, in Australia^ are peculiarly exposed, and which does not exist in the case of Switzerland. The population of the four principal cities in that country numbers only about 430,000 souls, and only one is in any way possible of attack. I refer to the City of Bale. Geneva, although close to the frontier, is surrounded by mountains, and would be difficult of attack. We all know that Switzerland is a country with impassable rivers and mountains-the most impossible country to attack that it is possible to conceive-and her citizen forces are, consequently, quite adequate for its defence. . In Australia, however, we have four ports containing a third of the population of the Commonwealth, which are so vulnerable that they are liable to immediate attack by a raiding cruiser, and such an attack' is one of extreme danger. Finally, I must protest against the Prime Minister seeking at this stage to still further enlarge forces which can only be called into operation after our coastal defences and the Imperial Navy have failed to ward off an attack. The Prime Minister should have made the closest possible inquiry into our coastal defences before he proposed to further add to our field forces. fences three years ago. learned gentleman study the question of the adequacy of the forces to man the guns we have in our forts ? come to the conclusion that there was a sufficient number of gunners to constitute one relief for the purpose of manning the guns? a sufficiency of gunners."" a member of the Government whenl the Forces were still further reduced, and it is a public scandal that he should have failed to remedy the defects which lie knew to exist. reduced when I was in office as Attorney General, and not during the time that I was the leader of the Government. Proposals were then' drafted by my Government, which, unfortunately, were never submitted to the House. learned gentleman is responsible for the mistake made by me, because he referred to three years ago. 1903-4. Minister, now that he knows that we are short of gunners, will do his best to see that the forces at our disposal for manning the position artillery at our mos't vulnerable points of attack are considerably augmented. We were not really told what the Government proposed to do in the long statement of policy which they placed before the House. The measures outlined in that policy were not explained, and consequently honourable members are not in a position to know their provisions. No doubt a full explanation has .been given to members of the Labour Party, and that they are in a position to know what the Government propose, because, upon no less an authority than the Age newspaper, which occasionally tells the truth, we have been assured that the Government submitted their platform to the gentlemen who now suffer it to remain in office. That being the case, we are perfectly well aware that what the Ministry propose must be sometiling acceptable to the Labour Party. NowI wish to refer to a most important measure constitutionallyI mean the redistribution of electorates. In regard to this matter, I find that the Government may be in the position of having to consult the honourable member for Bland, almost as much as the Commissioners who have been, or are I did. to be, intrusted with the duty of mapping out the boundaries of the new divisions. For example, I find that the following letter was written by the honourable member for Bland to a gentleman who is resident upon the south coast of New South Wales, and who had asked him to contest that electorate. Like an extremely wise man. he refused to do so; but replied in the following terms :Of course, as you will have gleaned from the newspapers, the whole situation is changed by the throwing out of the Reid Government, and it is probable that quite another distribution of electorates may yet be found necessary prior to the next election. Very significantly he remarked that it might be found necessary to make quite a different distribution of seats. In other words, the present Government might, inferential])', be taken to make it a party distribution. He went on to say that if he contested a country electorate at all he would stand for one which embraced at least a portion of the present constituency of Bland.

The socialistic convention shortly afterwards met in Melbourne j but if refused in the most unmistakable terms to permit any alliance between their party and the party in office, who are now their tools. may not be in the councils of his party. I hope that' he is, because if he were not, it would be merely anticipating the next election. The position has in no way changed. The existence of three parties in the House, we were told , was destructive of represen1 tative Government. There are still three parties in this House. We have the socialistic party, the Deakin Party -the old original sin-and we have also the party on this side of the Chamber. The members of the Opposition have not departed from the principles which actuated them when sitting on the opposite side of the House. We recognise that there will be no true opportunity to settle our fiscal differences until the party which reluses to recognise the fiscal question is wiped out of existence. The fact that certain honourable members are satisfied to occupy the Treasury benches as tools of the socialistic party, and with a preference for place without responsibility, does not alter the question. men have some eighteen or nineteen members in their party. words, they are 50 per cem. in office, and 100 per cent, without chaiacter. They have only to lose some eight or nine seats at the next election-as they certainly will-and they will not have sufficient members in their party to form the very extensive Ministry which they believe Is necessary. This reversion to the third party principle is to be deplored. There is only one matter for congratulation fo be found in the whole proceedings, and that is the fact that the league which the present Prime Minister established in his own electorate to counteract machine politics and to re-estabTish responsible government, has ex. pressed its want of confidence in his recent action. That leads us reasonably to hope that after the next elections the Prime Minister will cease to trouble the political horihonorable gentleman I have the honor to zon of Australia, and once more will take his place as an ornament in private life. Who are the honourable members associated with the present Ministry? We find no less a person than the right honourable member for Swan sitting side by side with we honourable member for Hume. That right honourable gentleman, no more than two months ago, was going to wipe the Labour Party completely out of existence. He passed like the flail of the Lord over Bunbury, and compared the ramifications of the Labour Party to the tentacles of an octopus. That party still remains. It is still an octopus. It still has tentacles; and those tentacles are even now entwined so tightly about the right honourable member that he cannot even squeak when they squeeze him. It is strange to see the right honourable gentleman sitting in such an uncomfortable place. We find another honourable gentleman sitting on the Treasury bench who did much to harry the Labour Party during its term of office-a n honourable member who only a few weeks prior to the re-assembling of this Parliament, told his own constituents, in a speech of his customary eloquence, that the fiscal question was definitely sunk. He.assured them that he had it on the authority of his leader that there was no such thing as fiscalism; that the battle of the future was lo be that of Socialism and anti-Socialism. That honourable gentleman, not more than two months before that supreme treachery which has landed him in office, assured his constituents that the fiscal question was definitely sunk. These honourable gentleshortcomings. because he is a good friend, with an excellent sense of humour; but it is reasonable to remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who has received an honorary salve to his injured feelings-injure d in having to leave his old allies and friendsof what he said only a few weeks prior to attaining his present position. The late Prime Minister was at that time hand in glove with the honourable member for Richmond. The honourable member for Richmond was on the executive committee of the AntiSocialistic league. Fancy a loyal protectionist on the executive committee of the alleged Free-trade League, which his own leader denounced at Ballarat! The honourable member for Richmond addressed his : constituents at Lismore, where he heard the follow make a statement which he allowed to go unchallenged, and thereby admitted",74,William Lyne Nonsense What The Reports Issued By The Various Survey Parties

That was a statement uttered in the presence of the honourable member for Richmond only a few weeks before he decided that a promise in politics was not a matter of personal honour-wa s not binding in the least degree.

The honourable member cannot, I think, deny that he made that statement, and that the statement was true. The honourable member for Richmond is also reported as follows, on that occasion :Mr Ewing expressed the hope that the Federal Political Alliance would last. That was less than two months before he did his share in breaking up the allianceThe fiscal question ought never to have divided up the parties, and he trusted it would never again do so, andthought it was an Here is the finishing touchI say it was a free-trade separate him from men of the intellectuality, ability, integrity, and high personal character of their guest of that evening.

That is not only my own personal view. It is a -view which has been endorsed by the constituents of the honourable member, who occupies his position in this Chamber by virtue of their generosity and former folly. It is gratifying to know, however, that those electors are coming to their senses. The Northern Star newspaper, which, I think, the honourable member will recognise as a "" star "" I am glad not to be innot likely to ""set,"" saysI Mr Thomas Thomson Ewing deserves a paragraph all to himself, because, like his leader, Mr Deakin, he threw over Mr Reid and his antisocialistic principles without an instant's warning when the time appeared most ripe. There are many who expected better things from the member for tlie Richmond. Less than .1 month ago Mr Ewing joined the Council of the Anti-Socialistic League; less than a fortnight ago he was busy forming branches of the league in the northern rivers. Now he has taken office in a minority Ministry, which can only exist by, and with the co-operation of the very party he pledged himself a few weeks since to strive to exterminate. printed ?",75,William Lyne Nonsense What The Reports Issued By The Various Survey Parties

They^ say that the socialistic policy is as high above the fiscal policy as the sky is above the earth. Therefore, the honourable member for Hume and others are endeavouring to lead the protectionists, not into a protectionist alliance, but into a socialistic alliance. If those words were true at the time when the honourable and learned member for Indi and his co-conspirators were seeking to bring about an alliance with the Labour Party, they are equally true now when the honourable member for Richmond is himself associated in an effort to hoodwink the electors of Australia into the belief that he is a partner in a protectionist Government. In view of the fact that the honourable member has clearly designated the Labour Party as one which is socialistic above all things, and one which can never contract a fiscal alliance, and in view of thej fact that the socialistic party dominates the present Ministry to such an extent that all its measures have to be submitted to that party before they are submitted to this House, is it not a little strange that an honourable gentleman who was so lately a shining light in anti-socialistic circles, should now be taking a humble place as an instrument of the enemies of individualism in this Commonwealth? The honourable member for Dalley gave the House a number, of quotations from 'an important labour organ published in the Commonwealth. I have no wish to refer to those quotations, beyond saying that they have appeared in a newspaper run by the Australian Workers' Union, and describing itself correctly as ' ' The Official Journal of the, Federated Workers of Queensland."" The Australian Workers' Union, not to speak of the Federated Workers of Queensland, has sent a certain representation to this House. If my memory serve me, the honourable member for Maranoa, on a previous occasion, stated that he had been returned to this House practically by the Australian Workers' Union. honourable members have also been returned by that great organization, which pays for and runs the Brisbane Worker, the newspaper to which I refer.

[f the Prime Minister proposes to act in that way he will find that ifl is not the way to conduct the business of the House with any kind of celerity and good order. I hope he will recollect that, although we are a minority on this side, there are certain rights which are inherent in the Opposition from immemorial custom, and which, I am sure, he will be the first to respect. Why he has departed from his usual courteous conduct to-night, I am at a loss to understand. is not in his usual mood, he certainly is not in his usual courteous mood with regard to the members on this side, and the best thing we can do is to adjourn and sleep over this business.

Otherwise when that debate is finished, we could only take the formal stages, and a day would be lost.
