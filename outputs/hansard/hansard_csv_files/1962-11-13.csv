Also, to be a war-time mine was found by prawn is he aware that the value of the maternity allowance has been halved during his term of office? We all join in congratulating the right honourable gentleman on the happy event that has occurred in his family, but will he explain why the Government regards one of his grandchildren as being only one-third as valuable as is the other, and why he regards these grandchildren born in 1962 as being only half as valuable as were children born before he came to office? Will the Prime Minister also explain to his family that, but for the re-election of his Government, a payment of £30, and not £15 as at present, would be payable for the birth of the first child, rising to £35 for the fourth and subsequent children? reference to the last part of the honourable genleman's quesdon, that I doubt whether there would have been twins if there had been a change of government.

I ask: Is the right honourable gentleman aware that some wool growers are of the opinion, and are stating openly, that they have never been repaid or credited with the amount withheld from the proceeds of wool sales under the Wool Sales Deduction Act? Does he know that cases investigated reveal that repayment has been made in full? So as to dispel any doubt, will the Treasurer undertake to investigate fully any case submitted to him in this regard? the matter and see what information I can supply to the honourable gentleman. to the Minister for the Army. Is it a fact that on 31st October last what was believed fishermen in Moreton Bay, Queensland? Is it a fact that, due to the lack of man-power, the Navy has searched for the mine only spasmodically? Is it a faet that the Navy has had to engage a private underwater research group to try to locate the mine? Did the Navy state that the mine probably contains some 500 lb. of TNT.? Will the Minister undertake to have a more comprehensive search made to recover this mine in view of the danger to shipping and human life? addressed to me but it concerns the Navy.

If these forecasts have been correct, will he now predict what unemployment will be in November and December when, for seasonal reasons, the position can be expected to be less satisfactory than it has been in the past few months? "" I told you so"", but, as the honourable gendeman has raised this matter, I think I can say that the estimates of unemployment made by the Government in November last year and February this year have proved to be accurate. In February we forecast a reduction in registrants for employment for nine successive months. I have not the figures yet for last month, but I have the greatest optimism that they will show the expected fairly substantial reduction.

13,Mr Mcmahon,"I do not like sayinggentleman has given me the opportunity in answering this question to show that the Government's forecasts have proved to be correct and that the comments by Opposition members and critics of the Government have proved to be incorrect. As to the second part of his question relating to the forecast covering the period from the last week of November to the end of January, we always expect an increase in the number of registrants during those months mainly because we expect 53,000 or more school-leavers-peopl e up to the age of 21 who leave school, university or techniaction. No challenge to the validity of that cal college-to register. Consequently, we expect that by the end of January, the figures for which will be published in February, there will have been a quite substantial increase in the number of registrants. But this is quite normal and should not give rise to any criticism. In fact, the sensible person mechanical device would be installed in this will accept it as a matter of course. Trade will remember that under Article9 of the trade agreement which he signed with Great Britain in February 1957 the Australian Government undertook that, consistent with its obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, no new protective duty would be imposed and no existing protective duty would be increased on British goods in excess of the recommendation of the Tariff Board. I now ask him whether the British Government has ever contended, or the Australian Government ever conceded, that a duty recommended by Sir Frank Meere, the Special Advisory Authority, in default or excess of a duty recommended by the board would be a breach of this trade agreement. discussions to be held about the interpretation of trade agreements, and especially of this trade agreement. I refer not only to the current agreement but also to agreements between the United Kingdom and Australia going back to the 1930's. There have been many discussions about by-law entry, interpretation of availability and so on. As to the particular issue which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has raised, speaking from memory I think that there has been some challenge-no t on a government to governLabour and National Service seen a report ment level-of this Government's action in imposing temporary duties on certain commodities, but the Government has quite clear in its mind, and has so stated to the United Kingdom Government, that under Article 19 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the Australian Government, like all other signatories to the agreement, is authorized to take whatever special action is necessary to protect a domestic industry under threat from imports. That is the explanation we have given, and that is the ground on which we have justified our ground has been pressed. THE PARLIAMENT. Mr Speaker, a question.

In reply to a question on 6th November the Minister said that in the event of hostilities doctors would be either recruited or conscripted. Is it a fact that Cabinet has before it a plan for inducing or compelling medical students in Australia to serve part of their training period in two special military hospitals in order to study military medicine? When is it likely that a decision on this matter will be announced? last week, we have a very good committee which is meeting on this subject now.

Was such a campaign intended to force the hands of employers to concede three weeks' annual leave outside a court decision? Can the Minister inform the House whether the reported campaign has, or has not, been shelved, temporarily at least, by the Canberra Trades and Labour Council, following a recent decision of the Australian Council of Trade Unions that trade unions should not seek to re-open their application for three weeks' annual leave until February next year? informed me that the Trades and Labour Council of the Australian Capital Territory has decided on rolling strikes and go-slow tactics in order to push the demands of unions for three weeks' annual leave in the Australian Capital Territory for their members. The best I can say about that-o r the worse, according to how one looks at it-is that this decision by the Trades and Labour Council was made prior to the time when the Australian Council of Trade Unions decided that its constituent trade unions and trades and labour councils should not take direct action in order to enforce their demands for three weeks' leave.

I studied it. I was convincedand I am still convinced-that the "" Hansard"" proof did not record what I said.

My recollection-it is subject to check-is that a rather larger proportion of American profits has been transmitted back to the United States, but I believe that as knowledge grows of the potential of Australia and the security offered here for investment, the tendency will be to allow profits to accumulate here either by the expansion of the enterprise or by investment in some other area of Australian enterprise. We can all take some encouragement, I believe, from the fact that capital investment from all overseas sources is being maintained at a buoyant level and the tendency is for that investment to grow rather than diminish.

Debate resumed from 8th November (vide page 2283), on motion by Mr Harold HoltThat the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to authorize the borrowing of £45,900,000 to be advanced to the States for the purpose of housing. I want to make just four points in regard to this measure. First, it relates to decisions which have already been taken and implemented. Only four and a half months of the financial year have gone, but these decisions were taken in June last. As a result of them, certain programmes have been put in operation, and the whole of the money is virtually committed. So this bill relates to a thing of the past. The Parliament is being asked to approve something which has already irrevocably been done. The second point is that this measure flows from the system of the Australian Loan Council, under which this Parliament has very little say in the committing of large sums of money, is never informed about what is being done and, in point of fact, cannot find out anything more than the bare bones of what is done. It is wrong that financial responsibility in these major matters should be taken right out of the hands of this Parliament, and that members of the Parliament are not even allowed to know the truth about what is being negotiated and what is taking place. The third point I want to make is that this amount is a residue of a works and housing allocation and the decision, I understand in general, has been made by the various States as to how much they want to devote to housing and how much they want to devote to works. I shall not enter into any discussion as to whether the total amount devoted to housing and works is too great, too small or just right. AllI say is that the amount which we are voting is the residue after the States have decided how much of their total allocation should be allocated to housing. It is from this that the unfortunate fact flows that the amount made available for housing this year is not greater but rather less than it has been. My fourth point is that this allocation, large though it Is, is only a part of the housing funds which are available in the Commonwealth from both governmental and private sources. However, when looking at the building industry one must consider it as a whole and consider the governmental allocation in relation to the industry as a whole. Let us start with a review of the three years ended June, 1962. In the first of these three years 90,000 housing units, including fiats, were completed. In the next year, 1960-61, the number was 94,500 and in the last year, 1961-62, the number was much smaller, 86,200. Probably, in addition to thesefigures,6,000 or 7,000 houses are completed each year but are not recorded. However, that does not alter the fact that there has been considerable unevenness in building output over these three years. Thefiguresthemselves90,000, 94,500 and 86,200-argu e a considerable unevenness. In point of fact a good deal of our employment difliculties over the past eighteen months have been correlated with the unsatisfactory level of private building. It is also demonstrably true that in 1961-62 the number of houses completed has been considerably short of the potential, without taking any account of the need to overtake the back-lag in demand which perhaps is not as large as it was but which undeniably",21,Personal Explanation
81,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [3.29].,"still exists. The short fall in building last year was correlated with considerable under-employment in the building industry, both in direct construction and in the industries which supply materials for building. One can say, therefore, that last year's result paring for greater increases in the rate of was unsatisfactory. This is even truer from the Commonwealth's point of view when one thinks of the special need for the housing of migrants. This is a feature to which I shall return in a moment. Let me turn now from the past and say something about the future. It appears that for the year ended June, 1963, we shall complete about 96,000 or 97,000 dwellings, including unrecorded ones. But what are our needs? I do not refer to the back-lag; I do not refer to the 5,000 or 6,000 houses that we fell short last year. In estimating our needs I think we can consider the monograph on housing which was produced recently by Dr. Hall, senior fellow in economics at the Australian National University. On the basis of 80,000 migrants a year, which is the Government's basis, he believes that for this year the housing demand will be about 102,000 units and that over the years between now and 1970 it will rise to about 131,000. I shall not go into the details of the basis of these figures because they seem to me to be reasonable enough. However, it is clear from the figures that our aim should be to increase the present rate of buildingthe 1962-63 rate-by something like 7 i per cent, and thereafter at the rate of about 3 i per cent, per annum. That is a greater increase than the increase in the overall labour force, so it appears that during that period an increasing proportion of our real resources will have to be devoted to home building. One point which must be remembered in relation to this future policy is that we must avoid the past unevenness. In doing this we might have some regard to the present high rate of city building. We have seen how this is absorbing a considerable number of workers and a great amount of building materials but I think the statisticians will agree that while there may be no catastrophic decline in the rate of city building it is unlikely to continue at its present high level for more than a year or two. So, if we are to have this evenness of employment in the building industry we must consider adapting our housing policy to take up the slack. We should be making some substantial increase in the rate of home building now and we should be prehome building in the next two or three years. This is particularly so in relation to the Government's migration programme. For many reasons the Government is not finding it as easy as it was to fill the migration quotas. The same number of migrants is not offering. This is possibly the result of changed conditions in Europe, but whatever the cause at least it is clear that one of the main reasons why it is difficult to persuade migrants to come to Australia is their fear of housing difficulties when they arrive here. In other words, we need a stock of houses if we are to maintain our target of 80,000 migrants a yeur. Indeed, we hope that this target will be maintained and even increased. It is all very well to have these pious resolutions about the number of houses that we need. I do not think there is any difficulty in providing them from the physical point of view. The industry can produce them. The impediment has undoubtedly beenfinance;and here you will allow me, Sir, to quote from Dr. Hall's recent monograph on the subject. Having reviewed the present shortfall in output in relation to potential demand he has this to say. the obvious policy now, at a time when there is still considerable excess capacity in the industry, is to try to even out this expected fluctuation by taking up as much as possible of the present slack in the industry. In the unlikely event that such action would result in some excess capacity in terms of the stock of houses this should prove to be a boon two or three years hence. There are a variety of ways by which this policy objective could be achieved. Thus state housing authority allocations could be raised, especially, perhaps by tieing a proportion of their increased advances to slum clearing activity. A higher rate of public authority housing construction now might well make it much more feasible to cut it back when there are signs of boom conditions in the private sector. The obvious way to stimulate private housing activity now is to ease the terms on which housing finance is made available. This should probably take the form of still further increasing the upper limit of the permitted maximum loan for all types of major lenders. When we look at this we ask what we are going to do. What are the practical steps we could take about easing housing finance? In this debate honourable members have spoken of the need to provide second mortgages on reasonable terms-that is, at a reasonably low rate of interest. They have mentioned, with approval, the action that has been taken by the Victorian Government along those lines by giving some kind of guarantee in respect of second mortgages. This is excellent and constructive action and I notice, with some regret, that my own State of New South Wales appears to be less progressive than Victoria in this particular instance. This is a great pity, and it is no doubt due to the fact that the New South Wales Government is not as competent to defend and advance the interests of its own citizens as the Victorian Government is in respect of its citizens. As a New South WelshmanI regret this very much, and I commend to the New South Wales Government the action that has been taken in Victoria. It might be well, perhaps, if some of the Commonwealth's own instrumentalitiesthe Commonwealth Bank for examplewere to regard second mortgages in a somewhat more favorable light in order to help people to get housing finance. But, after all, are second mortgages the answer? I should think not. I should think that they are an unnecessary complication in the whole scheme of things. Second mortgages generally carry a somewhat heavy rate of interest, and we do not want to have housing loans at high interest rates. Would it not be better if the money were made available through building societies on first mortgages? It seems to me that there is no inherent difficulty here. After all, the building society, operating under government guarantee, lends up to a very high proportion of the valuation, and in those circumstances it seems to me that if building society money is available-and that is the point-o n first mortgage then there should not be any need to have recourse to a separate second mortgage. So, basically, the thing comes down to getting more money for such institutions as building societies. How can this be done? How can we channel more money into the building societies? The amount that the building societies can raise is, of course, dependent upon the lender's ability to meet them at the interest rates which they can offer and, as I said a few moments ago, I believe it is essential to keep the interest rate on housing loans down to a reasonable figure. Would it be competentI think it would be-for the Government to consider a scheme for stimulating the building industry by giving some kind of interest subvention to building societies and similar institutions? Perhaps in the second place we should have a speeial release from the special account funds of the trading banks held by the Commonwealth Bank, made on condition that this money be lent out at a low rate of interest to building societies. In the third place, if indeed we want to continue with the legislation which compels insurance companies and superannuation funds to put a certain amount of their resources into government securities in order to obtain tax rebates, perhaps we could amend the act to provide that for the purposes of that act advances for housing under guarantee of a government would count as investment in government securities. It is true, I think, that the legislation we passed in regard to these rebates has had the effect of channelling real resources away from housing, and has thus increased the overall difficulties in respect of housing finance. Those are some of the things which we might do. We might also pay more attention to the constitution of permanent, as opposed to terminating, building societies. We might make even more generous the amounts we are giving in war service homes loans, and we might adopt the suggestion which Dr. Hall made, and which I quoted a few moments ago, of raising the limits for Commonwealth Bank, building societies and war service homes advances to make them more realistic in relation to existing housing costs so that, without incurring a second mortgage, the average home purchaser would be able to go ahead with a reasonable building. I do not suggest that we should make the sky the limit, or anything like that. WhatI am suggesting, however, and what we should have done and should now be doing, is to take action which would raise the level of house building in this country by some 7 per cent, or 8 per cent., and thereafter keep it rising at a rate of 3 per cent, per annum. This should be our target. If we are exceeding that target then perhaps there is reason to cut back the finance; but if we are falling short of that target-as we have fallen short of it-the n there is reason to turn on the nnancial tap a little bit wider. We do not want to go to the point of inflation. We certainly do not want to have the position where the building industry could not meet the demands of those who want houses but are unable to finance them. We want to absorb the present slack in the building industry. We want not only to maintain but also to have a substantial increase in the rate of house building. This is needed both because it will help the employment situation and because it is necessary from a social point of view and the demand for houses, as such, justifies it. These are things which I feel we should be doing. The Commonwealth Government has a special interest in this problem, because of the necessity to keep up its migration programme. We all have an interest in maintaining high employment in the building industry and elsewhere. We all have an interest in raising living standards, including housing standards. I suggest that the time is overdue for the Government to take not a dramatically changed view but a more generous view on the question of housing finance. We must look at this problem as a whole. The bill before us is only one aspect of what goes to make up the housing problem. we are now discussing is a measure to authorize the borrowing of £45,900,000 for advances to the States in the year 1962-63 in accordance with the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Some few weeks ago, when addressing myself in this chamber to the housing situation I declared that next to unemployment the most pressing social problem facing this young and growing nation was that of housing. I firmly believe all honourable members of this House will agree fully with that statement. I further stated that the construction of new houses had been drastically cut by the recent credit squeeze and that the number of new dwellings being constructed is still falling. I declared, also, that it costs more than three times as much to build a house to-day as it did sixteen years ago. I did not think any honourable member would be prepared to challenge that statement. The timber industry is linked with housing. We cannot build homes without timber. The Australian timber industry norrxally employs 52,000 workers directly. Of these approximately 20 per cent, are engaged in milling and extracting operations whilst the remainder are engaged in the 2,800 saw mills that normally operate in Australia. Our timber export trade is worth approximately £3,000,000 a year, the bulk of these exports being shipped from New South Wales and Western Australia. All States except South Australia have large economic interests in the timber industry. The Menzies-McEwen government's credit squeeze and its adverse effect on Australian home building and on other timber-using activities had, in turn, a disastrous effect on our timber industry, causing very serious unemployment and the closing of many timber mills. The position has been accentuated by the Government's removal of import restrictions. We witnessed a sharp rise in imports of timber from overseas in 1961, as compared with 1960, as is illustrated by the fact that imports of dressed and undressed timber for the year ended June, 1960, were valued at £17,840,000, and imports for the year ended June, 1961, were valued at £20,304,000, an increased import expenditure of £2,464,000 in one year, and in a period when unemployment was rampant in the timber industry and Australia's balance of trade position was extremely adverse. A Labour government would ensure that import restrictions machinery and tariffs were used to protect the timber industry. We would vigorously stimulate Australian home building and allied indusr tries which provide the main demand for Australian timber. I agree with an article which appeared in the Melbourne "" Age"" of 8th September, 1962, which statedAustralians are the victims of a massive national confidence trick if their much vaunted high standards of living do not allow them to live high in the place where they do most of their living-thei r own homes. We are close to this situation: Too many of the benefits of wages, working hours and the welfare state are absorbed by high house",22,Personal Explanation
82,Mr Fuller (Hume) [3.52],"The billdeposits, high interest rates and high costs in putting roofs over our heads. A privileged class of Australians can finance their housing needs at the bank interest rate or less, but they represent less than 25 per cent, of the community. The other 75 per cent, buy homes with great difficulty at interest rates up to 20 per cent. The average Australian home-buyer is applying about 25 per cent, of his annual income to pay off his mortgage. In the United States of America an equivalent home-buyer need apply only 14 per cent, of his income to meet mortgage payments. The American home-buyer is also required to pay a smaller deposit. He can. in many cases, borrow more than 90 per cent, of the total value of house-plusland, whilst his Australian equivalent is struggling to borrow more than 60 per cent, pf the value involved. Therefore, it should be crystal clear to all thinking people that the high deposit policy and high interest policy of this Government must lead to a fall in the level of home building. About 75 per cent, of Australian housing loans bear interest rates of more than 5 i per cent, and 66 per cent, of those loans bear an interest rate above 6 per cent. Of those loans about 47 per cent, bear interest rates from 7 per cent, to 20 per cent, and more. This much seems certain: The existing system offinancingAustralian home ownership is not meeting the increasing demands of a growing community. The building and manufacturing industries and many disinterested authorities strongly believe that the traditional patterns of home ownership can be maintained only if we initiate new systems of home finance. I should like to quote from an article by Sir Douglas Copland, published in the ""Australian Financial Review"" of 16th August, 1962. The article is headed, "" Home Building Crisis Demands Action "", and readsSir Douglas Copland last week called for a house and land on the average in 1946 for national housing corporation to co-ordinate the war service homes was £1,261. The cost activities of all home building agencies and promote co-operation between all institutions assoto-day of a similar house and land for the ciated with home building. Sir Douglas said that such an organization deposit required is £1,506, which is 35 per should be able to encourage existing home cent, of the cost of the land and the house. finance companies and institutions to financeWhy is the deposit now 35 per cent, when on a more liberal basis and also be able to it was 10 per cent, in 1946? The deposit support them and be able itself to provide in 1946 was £126; to-day it is £1,506. finance for home building, and advise governments and industry on the likely future needs of home building. Sir Douglas put forward his proposal in his opening address to the National Housing Finance Conference in Canberra last August. He said that home-building in Australia had deteriorated in the past two years from 97,000 units in 1960 to 80,000 units in 1961, and the prospects for 1962 pointed to a home-building programme of about 85,000 units. Sir Douglas said that Dr. Hall, of the Australian National University, had provided probably the most modern estimate of the increase in the demand for new homes over the next ten years. Dr. Hall had estimated that the demand for new homes in Australia in 1962 would total about 90,000. This demand would increase, he said, to 94,000 by 1966 and 107,000 by 1970. Sir Douglas said: "" My own feeling is that these estimates are rather conservative. Probably more will be required."" I believe we all agree with that contention. If it is true, our rate of building is below what is to be regarded as the minimum demand for homes. Is there a bigger, more important, national problem in Australia to-day than the building of homes for the people who will populate Australia, make its citizens, and become the future controllers of the destiny of this country? Are we going to let them down? That is what we are doing right at this moment. Taking the four major home-building authorities in Victoria as an example, Sir Douglas compared their activity in 1961 against their activity in 1946. He said, "" We emerged from a war of great severity in which we had to average resources of great magnitude and we found on emerging that it was possible for any young man or woman to acquire a house on a very low deposit"". The deposit for war service homes was only 10 per cent, of the cost of the house and land and the cost of the average war service home is £4,256 and the The deposit now in money value is more than twelve times the deposit in 1946. Sir Douglas said that in 1946 the cooperative building societies required a deposit of 10 per cent., which by 1961 had increased to 34 per cent. The deposit required by the State Savings Bank over the same period had increased from 25 per cent, to 40 per cent. The deposit required by the Commonwealth Bank had increased from 15 per cent, to 45 per cent -the e times as high in real terms as it was in 1946. Sir Douglas saidThe fact is that in spite of growth and rise in living standards, increasing profits, increasing income, the average person on the lower income level had to find three or four times as much to establish a home as he did when we emerged from the war. He addedSurely we could unite, all of us, in industry and Government to correct this position. I believe, Sir, that it should be the fundafor the average man to build a home. Sufmental purpose of every government, irreficient finance has simply not been made spective of political colour, to shape its available to the various States. Only to-day housing policy on the basis of homeownership, and that fhe number of homes built for rental should be the lowest possible number compatible with housing only those for whom ownership is obviously impossible. The policy of the Australian Labour Party to provide cheap finance for Commonwealth Bank and who was refused houses is one that should have wide appeal point blank. Such things should not occur. to every member of this National ParliaIn New South Wales the consequences of ment and particularly to the younger the Government's policy have been that the generation. What chances have young Housing Commission has been beseiged by married couples or young people contemapplicants for accommodation. Private plating marriage, even though earning £20 enterprise has completely failed to provide a week, to get a home together or own a enough homes to meet the ever-increasing house?

Home office it has directed its efforts towards life is the core of any nation and every strangling the Commonwealth and State assistance should be given to young people Housing Agreement.

These have no chance of survival where prosperity reigns. There will not be any ruin in allowing ence of the Menzies-McEwen Government people to pay 5 per cent, deposit on a that the Commonwealth be paid cash at home, whether built by government authorithe point of sale. The Government uses its ties or building societies, which are doing secret trump card, its banking policy, against a wonderful job in providing homes. It the States. It restricts finance so that no would be a tremendous stimulus to the matter how eager a tenant may be to buy building industry. I believe that at least 100,000 families in Australia need homes to-day and to my mind that is a tragic state of affairs. I believe that the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement should be amended to require a deposit of only 5 per cent, with repayments over 45 years at 3 per cent, and interest to be computed on monthly balances. I believe further that an arrangement should be made for co-operative societies to get special advances from the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank should find the necessary money to build homes for the people. It should use its credit resources to provide adequate supplies of cheap money for industry. The policy of the Menzies-McEwen Government in relation to housing, of course, has always been destructive. Credit restrictions introduced by the Government some time ago have made it virtually impossible a gentleman who, I would say, is no more than 50 feet from me at the moment, told me of the experience of his son, who wants to get married, who had a deposit of £1,000 but could not get accommodation from the It has been stated frequently that the main obstacle to the easy purchase of homes by Housing Commission tenants is the insisthis home, he finds it impossible to obtain finance on the open market. The Menzies Government could, by means of a simple agreement, have made it easy for the States to introduce a scheme of purchase on small deposits and easy repayments. Housing Commission tenants continue to pay rent only because they have no alternative, because the Menzies-McEwen Government will not provide the initial financial cover. If the Government of New South Wales had not, after the end of the war, established the Housing Commission, only luxury homes would have been built. Everybody remembers the thousand and one efforts to defeat regulations aimed at spreading materials in short supply over as many homes as possible. The first real effort to provide homes for the people was initiated by the Chifley Government, which set up machinery under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement and implemented its part of the programme. The scheme was gaining momentum when the Chifley Government was defeated, and the Menzies Government has kept the damper on. The Opposition Whip has told me that this debate is due to conclude at 6 o'clock, and he has asked us to cut our speeches short. A good deal more could be said about the housing situation, but I shall conclude so that other members on this side of the House may have an opportunity to speak. I appeal to this Government to do the right thing. I ask it to provide a sufficient number of homes for the people it is bringing here from overseas, who are at the present time returning to their homeland in great numbers because of the shortage of homes and jobs in Australia. you will agree, Mr Speaker, that the speech we have just heard was one of the most interesting speeches ever made by Sir Douglas Copland. We also heard, of course, a number of inaccuracies contributed by the honourable member for Hume( Mr with the figure of 7 per cent, that he gave Fuller) himself. The honourable member said that the housing shortage is the sole responsibility of the Menzies-McEwen Government, as he called it, but I remind the House that the housing shortage in New South Wales, which has had a Labour Government for a considerable time, is worse than anywhere else in Australia. The honourable member also conveniently forgot that under the policy of rent control that has been followed by the New South Wales Government, nobody will invest money in housing for rental purposes. It is just not a sound proposition. Listening to the honourable member for Hume, the young people of to-day may think that Utopia is just around the corner, and that if ever a Labour government comes to power it will provide substantial numbers of delightful new homes. This, of course, is quite false, because the policy of rent control has had the result that no new homes for rental purposes have been built, other than those built by housing commissions. A similar situation existed in Victoria. When a Labour government was in power in that State it implemented a policy of rent control, and at that time no new homes for rental purposes were built. It could be said that throughout Australia home building for rental purposes is a thing of the past. No investor will take the risk that a Labour government may come to power in a particular State and introduce restrictions making unprofitable any enterprise involving home building for rental purposes. Those who suffer under rent control legislation are the people themselves, because the only houses available for rent are those that were in existence at the time of the introduction of the legislation, and those houses are old and neglected. The only other houses available are those built by the Government housing authorities, and these houses are not always of a very high quality. I have been informed-and I do not vouch for the complete accuracy of the figures-that there are 42,000 fewer homes for rental in New South Wales than there were seven years ago. I listened to the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), and I agreed with many of the statements made by him. I was not in complete agreement, however, when speaking of housing requirements, and which he took from Dr. Hall's latest book. The honourable member for Hume, and also the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) were others who quoted extensively from Dr. Hall's book. Let me say to the House that I believe Dr. Hall has done Australia a great service in",25,Personal Explanation
83,Mr Jess (La Trobe) [4.15],"I am sureconducting his research, but I remind honourable members that Dr. Hall himself admitted, in his recent publication, "" Housing DemandA Second Look "", that in the previous survey he had made, in December, 1960, he had made certain false assumptions. I do not say this in criticism of him. In any research one may make the mistake of anticipating .a situation which later does not eventuate. However, in reply to those honourable members who have made predictions about future developments, let me quote some remarks made by Dr. Hall in December, I960, in his publication, ""Housing Demand in Australia, 195974 "":This analysis clearly raises a number of important formerly expected. policy issues. To consider first the long-term position. A rapidly expanding house-building industry tends to sustain a high level of investment generally. It does this directly, and indirectly also through its various derived demands on both manufacturing output and public works (roads, water and sewerage, etc.). To that extent our analysis suggests that there may be difficulty in maintaining sufficiently high levels of investment to sustain the hoped-for rates of growth in the economy through the 1960's. But the stimulus to demand resulting from recent levels of housebuilding has probably involved undue pressure on resources, and release from this pressure may be very welcome. In either case it is clear that some reorientation in thinking is necessary about the scale and character of investment, both public and private, over the next decade. Tbe next paragraph is important because out now it is unlikely to be available for implethis is where he made a wrong assessment, mentation at that felicitous time when the requirealthough, I think, on quite reasonable coincide with those of economic expediency. grounds. As to the more immediate prospects, since it is sides of the House are in agreement with not possible to be specific about the timing of the likely decline ia house-building, it is difficult to what Dr. Hall has summed up in his latest make many precise policy recommendations. One survey. conclusion does, however, seem sufficiently firmly based, even apart from its desirability in the current over-extended state of the economy. It is in Australia, as I see it, is to a certain that it would be unwise to allow house-building extent constitutional. The States have activity to rise any higher than its present level. That is what Dr. Hall said in December, 1960. He has since admitted, in his new review, mat he had not allowed for certain factors which had arisen. Clearly it is difiicult to forecast the level of housebuilding. In his new review, "" Housing Demanda Second Look"", to which the honourable has put much money into housing. Most member for Mackellar referred, Dr. Hall of it has been made available through grants says at page 10The medium term prospects for housing demand are not ambiguous but all point to a rising trend. this has created certain problems, one of If there should have been a short-fall of effective demand in 1961-62 then with the recovery in incomes associated with the general recovery of the economy there is the likelihood that in a year or so effective demand may be above rather than below the trend. In 1960 he was saying it would be below; now he is saying that certain things have occurred and it could increase. He continuesAt the moment the most reasonable expectation about the impact of the post-war baby boom on the demand for houses is that it should begin to become influential about the middle 'sixties and should not be damped down as was expected in Housing Trends. All these factors are presumed to operate on what would otherwise be a gently rising trend. Their likely effect is to make the recovery of demand much stronger than was He then speaks of the long-term nnancial position and states what in his opinion is needed. He saysThe obvious way to stimulate private housing activity now is to ease the terms on which housing finance is made available. This should probably take the form of still further increasing the upper limit of the permitted maximum loan for all types of major lenders. From the point of view of the longer term stability of the industry this technique has the advantage tiiat it can be reversed relatively easily if subsequently general economic policy called for tightened conditions in the supply of finance for private housing. However, he concludesUnless the details of such a policy are worked ments of equity and efficient utilisation of resources I think that honourable members on both One of our great problems with housing always been regarded as the authorities responsible for housing. Since the war, with the great demands that have been put on us by the immigration policy, and with the great development that this country has had, the housing problem has now come to be, I believe, one of the major factors in the economic stability of this country.

There are been an overall review of housing on the differences in terms of lending, differences Australian scene at a national level.

85,Mr Jess,"It is the only State that hasbelieve we should consider how people and organizations can be encouraged to help themselves and to achieve their own destiny, rather than to rely on socialism or charity. The Government or governments must, however, set the climate and assist where necessary by supporting any such scheme. When one hears members of the Australian Labour Party talk of compulsion one should remember that we in Australia are a capital-hungry country, and that when we talk of spending money or forcing people to invest in certain areas, that money must come from some other sphere. If an insurance company or other such institution is not putting money into housing it could well be putting money into industry. If the flow of money into industry ceases, so do job opportunities and there is a loss of essential industries which could be vital to the country. Therefore, any plan should encourage the people themselves to put money into housing. This should be able to earn a reasonable rate of interest and should be guaranteed by the Government. If money could be obtained by the people from one legitimate source at a reasonable rate of interest for a reasonably long period it would mean that demand for housing would be maintained, the industry could be stabilized, and land prices could be reduced. Land prices represent one of the most inflationary sections of the housing industry, New South Wales that it was not until a and I think that they could be reduced very considerably. In all cases, the high interest rate which is charged on mortgages to the various people who are forced to borrow to subdivide are eventually passed on to the purchaser, and represent an additional burden to him. The price of an ordinary suburban, sub-divisional, vacant block of land is increased by the general interest charges made in excess of bank rates. These are included in the price structure, even before the purchaser starts to build. Equally, if the builder has to borrow temporaryfinancefor building operations at excessive rates of interest this is included in the eventual price paid by the purchaser. I feel that the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the State governments, has to look at housing very much more closely than it has in the past. We have been restricted because of constitutional issues. But I think that if we could co-operate with the States to work out a scheme it would be to the advantage of Australia not only by providing homes but by bringing stability to an industry which is of paramount importance to Australia. Deputy Speaker, as one of the most senior members of this Parliament, in terms both of years and experience in the House, I would earnestly suggest to one of the youngest members of our Parliament that when he makes a statement, particularly in criticism of a government or person, he should make very sure that the alleged facts that he uses are in accordance with the truth. The honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess) made some criticism of the Government of New South Wales for having allegedly hampered the construction of new homes in that State. Let me inform the honourable gentleman that since lst January, 1955, there have been no controls of any description upon new home construction and no rent control thereon in New South Wales. I feel that the honourable gentleman may wish to review the statement that he has made. I am sure that if he has made an incorrect statement on this matter he will do justice to this House and to the people whom he criticized by amending that statement. I am credibly informed by members from Labour government undertook the duty of seeing that housing was made available in country areas that anything of a substantial nature was accomplished in this regard. It is much to the credit of the Labour Government of New South Wales that this has been done. I agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, with many of the statements that have been made by honourable gentlemen from both sides of the House as to the inadequacy of the amount of £45,900,000 which it has been proposed to lend to the States for housing purposes. I find that there is an ever accumulating number of applications for housing and it would appear that the building procedures of this nation are not adequate to provide the people with the housing needed. In 1961-62 there were 47,000 applications fbr housing commission homes in Australia. In June of this year, 75,000 applications were outstanding.

I hope that honourable gentlemen will at least be prepared to examine the statistics that are available. Those statistics show that the number of houses under construction is at present lower than at any time over the last eight years. If time permitted, I would give honourable gentlemen the figures for each of the last eight years, but, unfortunately, owing to the limitation of the time available for this debate, I shall not be able to do so. However, I earnestly suggest that honourable members and those people outside this Parliament who are interested in this subject and who wish to ascertain the facts examine issue No. 58 of the "" Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics "" for the June quarter of 1962, which is published by the Bureau of Census and Statistics. The figures shown at page 3 bear out what I have just said. The matter that we are debating to-day is, with the single exception of employment, the most important of all the problems that face this country. The relief and prevention of unemployment, surely, stands first. Then, I believe, comes housing. That is the second consideration that rightly should engage our attention. linked. that the Minister for Social Services( Mr tends over some years, know that defence Roberton), who is now at the table, will convey to the Government the genuine concern of all members of this House, and particularly those on the Opposition side, that something more adequate shall be done to provide better housing for the Australian people by allocating, under the provisions of legislation such as this relating to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agree*(The text of this interjection, and the one immediately preceding it, has been corrected in conformity with the personal explanation made by Mr Turnbull on 14th November, vide page 2379.) ment, greater funds to the States, which are responsible for administering public housing policy in the main. to have been misrepresented by the honourable member for Bonython, and I wish to make a personal explanation. To my amazement, the honourable member misrepresented me when he followed me in the debate. As one of the older members of this House, he addressed himself to me as one of the younger members, and told me that the facts that I had presented were inaccurate. I had said that the problem of the lack of housing, particularly in New South Wales, had been brought about by the policy of rent control. The honourable member for Bonython stated in his speech that I had made a mistake and that there was now no rent control in New South Wales. is what I said. property that was controlled in 1945 and before in New South Wales is still controlled at 1939 levels. Deputy Speaker, before I address myself to the bill, let me refute something that was said by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) and the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin). Both honourable members said that the most important things that we in this country have to consider are, first, employment and, secondly, housing. I do not agree with that. The most important thing that we in this country have to consider is defence. Surely men of the experience of the honourable member for Bonython, who has long service in this House, and of the honourable member for Hume, whose experience in this place exis the most important thing for us in this country to consider. It does not matter what employment or housing we have; if we cannot defend this country, we are completely lost.

100,Mr Turnbull,"I am not a minoritybers would agree that what I say is correct, only they did not think about it. I know that they both regard defence as vital to this country and would agree with me now if they were given a second opportunity to say what they thought. This is a very simple bill. According to I might say, "" Talk is cheap, but it takes the Treasurer, its purpose is to authorize the money to finance a great Commonwealth borrowing of £45,900,000 for advances to like Australia and to keep the economy the States in 1962-63 in accordance with the sound "". provisions of the housing agreement. One could almost leave the matter at that, but let me emphasize this important fact£45,900,000 is the amount which the that I need not interject because the bill Premiers themselves decided upon at the contains the cold facts of the matter. I Australian Loan Council meeting after the have the bill in my hand and there are not total works and housing programme had many cold facts in it except those which been determined. We have heard all kinds I have mentioned. According to the of side issues from honourable members oc Treasurer's second-reading speech, the both sides of the House, but the point to amount being appropriated is £4,500,000 remember is that this Parliament has been less than the aggregate of £50,400,000 given legislative authority to implement the which was raised and applied for the purworks programme decided upon in Loan pose of the agreement in 1961-62-the last Council. All that remains for me to do is to try was especially advanced to the States as to reply to some of the questions which part of the Government's measures to have been raised. The honourable member stimulate economic activity. But the allofor Hume stated that Sir Douglas Copland cation for 1962-63 is £3,000,000 more than had quoted certain estimates by Dr. Hall. the basic amount made available last year, This is not a matter for Sir Douglas Copland excluding the special grant. That is the or Dr. Hall; it is a matter for this Governpoint I was trying to make in my interjecment, which has the responsibility of tion, but the honourable member for keeping the finances of this country on an Bonython, realizing the accuracy of my even keel and of spending in the best statement, merely said that I need not interinterests of the community the money which ject because the bill contains the cold facts is collected by way of taxation. It is all right for people outside to say that this or that should be done. It is not very hard for the Opposition to say the £7,500,000 made last year? It was made same thing because it has not the responto overcome what has become known as sibility to carry out the programme which the credit squeeze. it puts forward. The honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Bonython talked about housing and employment, but they did not mention other things which are vital to our economy. It is very throughout my electorate and in this House. easy to pinpoint some activity and say that I am tremendously happy to say that I more money should be spent on it, but the supported it because look how very successOpposition never tells us where the money ful it has been! It is all right for members will come from. We never have any indiof the Opposition to say that the timber cation of that. If we were to go through industry was somewhat embarrassed by the the speeches which have been made by credit squeeze, but I repeat that the primary honourable members opposite during the life producer is the very base of this country's of this Parliament and add the additional prosperity. Had we not spmehow retarded amounts which they claim should be spent the inflationary trend which was becoming by different departments or on various so noticeable, the primary producer would works, the total would be tremendous and disquieting, particularly as the Government has budgeted this year for a very substantial deficit. That kind of talk is all right, but it takes money to carry out various programmes. An Australian saying is, "" Talk is cheap, but it takes money to buy land "". During the course of his speech, the honourable member for Bonython told me financial year-including , of course, the supplementary amount of £7,500,000 which of the matter.

They believe that because the city is able to buy and sell on its own high price structure everything is all buying homes and that this Government has right; but the primary producer also must buy at that same high level and sell to countries with lower standards of living. Haworth) -Order! I remind the honourable member that we are discussing a housing bill, not primary producers. Mallee should talk about housing, not primary producers. able member for Phillip does not like me to speak about these things, so let me turn to some remarks which have been made by the honourable member for Hume. "" Hansard"" will support my statement that when he previously was a member of this Parliament he stated on perhaps 20 or 30 occasions that the yardstick of a country's prosperity is the deposits in the savings banks. Although our savings bank deposits are at a record level to-day, he claims that we are not prosperous. What is the Government's record in relation to housing? The honourable member for Hume asked what chance have young people to-day to secure a home. My reply is that to-day they have a better chance than ever before in the history of this Commonwealth. The honourable member for Bonython said that we should look at the statistics. Well, let us look at the statistics. They show that to-day more people own or are paying off their homes than ever before in our history. One cannot lease or rent a house in a town to-day because the people living in them either own them or are paying them off. I know many young couples to-day who before the war or when Labour was in office would not have had the slightest chance in the world of even beginning to own their own home. I know that and the honourable member for Bonython knows that, but he is a member of the Opposition so no matter how good or effective the Government's programme is he must oppose it. That is how There is a government and an opposition. I do not blame him for his attitude. Probably if we were in opposition we would do the same thing. But the fact is that young people all over the country are provided a record amount of money for housing. The War Service Homes Division has spent more money since the end of the last war than was spent in the period from its inception in about 1920 until the end of the war. The honourable member for Bonython mentioned the housing of migrants. Surely he knows that if you nominate a migrant you guarantee to provide accommodation for him for a certain period. As to the number of people living in huts, Opposition members forget the case which I mentioned just before Labour went out of office. The time was approaching Christmas and a man and his family who were living in a borrowed tent in Geelong had to return the tent to the owner, who wanted to go camping over the Christmas holidays. So the family was put out on the road. Labour forgets these things. In the days of the Labour Government the housing position was so serious that the members of the Labour Party want to divert attention from the better position now existing. The honourable member for Bonython, with a great wave of his hand, said that young people should be considered, and that aged people also should have some consideration. Then he went on to commend the work of churches and charitable organizations in providing homes for the aged. But he did not give any credit to the Government for its work in that regard. He gave the Government no credit for -naking the original £1 for £1 subsidy available-the subsidy has now been increased to £2 for £1-whic h made possible the building of many homes for the aged. Fancy a member of long standing in this House saying that something should be done for the aged by this Government when the Labour Government did nothing at all for the aged in the way of providing homes! The Labour Government either never thought of such a scheme as our homes for the aged scheme or, if it thought of it, did not put it into operation. This Government put it into operation originally on a £1 for £1 basis, demozratic parliaments operate. but after a relatively short time the subsidy was doubled to £2 for £1.",34,Personal Explanation

104,Mr Einfeld,The honourable member for,35,Personal Explanation
105,Mr Turnbull,"I know the honorThe Minister for Social Services( Mr do read the newspapers, and I should like to Roberton) has told me that since the inception of the scheme a total of £14,800,000 has been paid out in subsidies for the building of homes for the aged. A proportion of that amount of £14,800,000 has been matched on a £1 for £1 basis and later on a £1 for £2 basis, by the charitable organizations and churches concerned, so the total expenditure on homes for the aged would be about twice that amount. Yet we have a member of the Opposition attempting to curry favour for his partyI do not think for himself personally-by saying that something ought to be done by this Government for the aged. Only last Sunday, T was at the unveiling of two honour boards at Quambatook in the Mallee electorate to replace two boards, one of which had been destroyed by fire. At that ceremony a district councillor of the Returned Soldiers League paid a tribute for the work that had been done as a result of the Government's homes for the aged scheme in providing homes for aged ex-servicemen. But such things are not mentioned by Labour. An honourable member opposite said that he was just giving the cold facts. He could not have given a better definition of the facts during Labour's term of office, because then aged people were left out in the cold. The present Government has shown great human understanding by introducing the Aged Persons Homes Act, and by administering that legislation so that aged persons have benefited. The whole country is richer as a result of that legislation. The honourable member for Bonython said that he hoped honourable members would read the statistics that are available. I also hope they do. I have something that I want to read to honourable members. It has been said that the housing programme could be improved. I am very conscious of that, and I am also conscious of the silence of the Labour Party on the subject of unemployment during these last few weeks, although honourable members opposite made unemployment their main topic at the beginning of this session. Why have they forsaken the subject? The simple reason is that the recovery in this country under this Government recently has been amazing. I have looked at the statistics in this respect. People speakers on this side of the House. But do not read government statistics, but they quote from the Melbourne "" Sun"" of 10th November, which prints a report under ihe headline "" Employment Now at Record Level"". The report commencesEmployment in Australia reached a record level at the end of September. It goes on to sayPreliminary estimates of employment issued to-day by the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Archer, Whom the honourable member for Bonython also mentionedshowed that the number of people in jobs in September was 8,600 more than the previous record in November, 1960-the peak of the boom. So employment is back at record levels. That is the point, yet members of the Opposidon are all the time trying to divert attention in this debate to some other issue. They talk about the cold facts. The facts that I have read from that newspaper are the warming facts as far as the Australian people are concerned. remind the honourable member that we are debating the Loan (Housing) Bill. Speaker. 1 intend to link this matter up with the employment of men in the housebuilding trade. I am of the opinion that if the Government had increased its housing subsidies by another 50 per cent, the only effect would be to make necessary the adoption of restrictive methods to deal with inflation. After all, if we put more money into the housing field the cost of housing would go up. I do not find many people round the country now looking for homes. My suggestion to the States, which I must put through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that they should allocate as much money as possible for housing in country areas. This would be one of our best weapons and one of our best means to attain the objective of decentralization. honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) displayed a remarkable facility for talking about a lot of subjects, but forgot the subject of housing.

107,Mr Turnbull,"Yes, Mr Deputy",36,Personal Explanation
108,Mr Barnard (Bass) [5.5],"Th emember for Mallee for refusing to face the critical housing position to-day. I must disagree with his contention that the first consideration in this country is the defence programme. The honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin) pointed out, quite correctly in my opinion, that defence is most certainly closely related to the housing position. No successful defence policy would be possible without a housing policy capable of meeting the needs of the Australian people generally. I criticise the restrictions placed on debate by the Government at this second reading stage. It is appalling that debate on a bill whi'ch is to provide for the raising of loans amounting to £42,900,000 for expenditure by the States on housing should be restricted in the way it is being restricted now. Housing is one of the most important responsibilities of any government in Australia, and we on this side believe that the Government is vulnerable on its policy of housing. That is an opinion not confined to honourable members on this side. I am merely stating the opinion of people wifh some knowledge of the housing situation, and who are able therefore to speak with authority on it. I refer to people like Professor Copland and Dr. Hall, who have been mentioned by the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) on the Government side, and by other honourable members on this side. The statements made by these two authorities were carefully considered statements which show that there is a serious housing situation. As I said, the bill provides for the raising of loan moneys amounting to £42,900,000 to meet the needs of the State housing authorities. was available in the Labour Government's last year of office. cede that, but the honourable member should consider that in the years when Labour was in office the basic wage was only one-third of what it is to-day. In other words, the cost of housebuilding was not as high as it is. now. Costs have more than trebled. If the honourable member for Mallee is not prepared to accept my opinion in that respect I refer him to the last annual report of the Director of War Service Homes, in which he will clearly see that costs have more than trebled since the time of the Labour Government. It is obvious that this £45,900,000 would not match the amount of money made available by the Chifley Labour Government prior to the present Government being elected to the treasury bench in 1949. For years we of the Opposition have indicated during the debate on this legislation that insufficient money is being made available to the State governments to meet their housing programmes. I stress, further, that the sum being made available this year is less than that made available during last nnancial year, disregarding the fact that an additional £7,000,000 was made available earlier in 1962 for housing purposes, principally to take up the slack in employment which had then developed. The Opposition maintains that the Government has now reached the stage where it should be prepared, because of the shortage of homes in Australia, to take a more responsible attitude towards housing the people. It is now six years since the present Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement was accepted, in 1956, by the Commonwealth and the six States. The States have had six years in which to consider whether the 1956 Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement has proved successful or not. It should be pointed out that this was not an agreement in the proper sense of the term, but a statement placed before the various State Ministers for Housing, which they had to accept whether they agreed with it or not. That is the position which has obtained since 1956, with the exception of the amendment made in 1961. The 1956 agreement provided that 70 per cent, of the funds then made available under the legislation was to be made available to the State housing authorities, whilst the remaining 30 per cent, was to go to co-operative building societies and other approved lending institutions. The legislation was amended in 1958 to provide that 40 per cent, of the amount made available by the Commonwealth should go to the co-operative building societies. The fact is that although the co-operative building societies now have a greater share of the money made available each year under the 1956 Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, fewer",36,Personal Explanation
109,Mr Turnbull,"Only about £14,000,000",37,Personal Explanation
110,Mr Barnard,"I am prepared to conhomes have been provided by them and other approved lending institutions. The agreement has certainly increased the number of homes in this country and I believe it has made the homes more expensive, but it has not reduced the waiting lists of applicants for homes. The figures contained in the report of the twenty-fifth annual conference of the Association of Co-operative Building Societies of New South Wales, held in 1962, clearly indicate that home construction through building societies has been reduced rather than increased as a consequence of the increased revenue made available to them under the legislation we are debating. The figures show that, in 1953, 8,667 homes were built through co-operative building societies. Housing Commission of Victoria, issued By 1958, two years after the agreement had been amended and more money made available to building societies under the 1956 Housing Agreement Act, the number of homes built by co-operative building societies in New South Wales had fallen by almost 5,000 to 3,969. In 1961, 6,150 homes were built by approved societies. That showed a distinct improvement in the position, but in 1962 the number has again fallen to 5,950. This clearly indicates that the fact that building societies now have more funds available to them has in reality not improved the housing situation. The same position applies in regard to loan funds. In 1953 the co-operative building societies in New South Wales had available to them for the purpose of individual loans f11,730,000. By 1958-agai n two years after the agreement was ratified-that figure had fallen to £8,772,000, showing a decline in that three-year period of £3,000,000. In 1962 the figure has risen again, in three years, to £12,500,000. In my opinion this clearly indicates that the fact that money has been appropriated for the States for the purpose of building housing commission homes has merely taken money from the co-operative building societies and has not provided them with additional revenue. The traditional lenders to building societies are no longer lending, certainly not at the same rate, as they were prepared to lend to the building societies prior to the or the various co-operative building instiamendment of the act in 1958. Insurance companies now find it much more profitable to invest in investments that will return them a greater rate of interest than the cooperative building societies can. I join with other honourable members on this side of the House in pointing out that the number of homes provided under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement is falling because the State housing authorities have not had sufficient money with which to carry out their building programmes. The real test is to consider the reports made available to this Parliament by the various State Ministers for Housing. I will refer to two such reports in order to indicate that the housing commissions in the States, because of lack of funds from the Commonwealth, are not able to meet the demands now made on them for homes. I will quote first from the 23rd report of the State in 1961, which is the most recent available to me. It statesThe demand for accommodation-14,42 4 applications held at 30th June, 1961, still greatly exceeds the number of dwelling units the Commission can build with its reduced finance. Thb year 2,217 dwelling units were completed. With the steadily rising costs aggravated by the recent increase in interest rates, latest rents are ranging from £5 4s. to £6 Ss. which is beyond the means of the Commission applicants. The report continuesThe demand for the purchase of Commission houses on low deposits continues, 2,728 were sold for the year. Although good work is done by the Co-operative Building Societies and othe'r institutions to meet the requirements of families anxious to purchase their own homes, the Commission stresses that the need of the low income group is not satisfied by these institutions as the deposits required are far beyond the potential of the average low income family in Victoria whose maximum available deposit lies in the £100 to £200 bracket. That report clearly indicates that there is a lack offinancefor State housing authorities. They are not able to satisfy the number of applications being lodged with them each year. The report further stresses the fact that people in the low income bracket are not able to provide the margin of security required by the approved lending institutions. I have indicated during a similar debate in other years that it is almost impossible for any young person to secure through the Commonwealth Bank, the private banks tutions the finance necessary to purchase a home. The Commonwealth Bank to-day will advance up to £2,500 for a weatherboard home or £2,750 for a brick home. But any one who cares to study the latest report of the Director of War Service Homes will see that the average cost of a home to-day is close to £4,000. That means that a person who wishes to build a brick home must have a deposit of approximately £1,300. Quite naturally, people who want to build such a home must turn to State housing authorities for assistance. The only way that the shortage of homes can be overcome is for the Government to make more money available for housing. No one criticizes the work being done by co-operative building societies and other approved lending institutions. I have said before and I repeat now that they meet a great need in the community and have been able to assist those people who can provide the deposit required by the institutions. But the fact remains that the great majority of potential home builders can provide only a low deposit and obviously there is a great need for the Commonwealth to make more money available to the States to assist them with their housing schemes. The Commonwealth Bank and the private banks also should recognize that the deposit required to-day is beyond the resources of most people on low incomes who are potential home seekers. When1 commenced to speak on this subject. I said that the time allowed for this debate had been restricted. There are others who also want to speak and therefore I shall connne myself to reiterating what 1 have already said. As I have said in other years, the Commonwealth has refused to adopt a national plan to meet the housing needs of the people. It cannot be denied that the applications received by State housing authorities and co-operative building societies are increasing each year. Obviously, there should be a more realistic approach to the problem of housing. In the pre-war years, the backlag in housing was estimated at 100,000 homes. Despite what was said by tbe Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) in 1957, I believe the backlag is now in excess of 100,000. That is one of the reasons why Opposition members are so critical of the Government's approach to this problem. The Government has never been prepared to issue a report on the subject, other than the report issued by the Minister for National Development in 1957. Honourable members and the public generally must rely on statistics supplied to them by people such as Dr. Hall of the Australian National University and Professor Copland. Normally, the second-reading speech on the Loan (Housing) Bill is one of the shortest speeches made in the House and this debate will be one of the shortest debates on such a bill that I have known. The Government must face this problem. It has been responsible for fluctuations in the number of homes built each year. In 1957, the Minister for National Development told us that at least 77,000 homes would have to be constructed annually in the succeeding six years if we were to bridge the gap between the number of homes available and the number of homes required. The fact is that only in several years have we exceeded this figure. The number of homes erected each year has fluctuated. A more realistic approach by the Government is needed, if we are to provide homes for those who urgently need them. The honourable member for Bonython referred to the 1961 censusfiguresprovided by the Commonwealth Statistician. They show that throughout the Commonwealth 42,000 people are residing in what are described as sheds and huts. Of these, 19,000 are in New South Wales. Opposition members say at once that these conditions should not be tolerated in any enlightened community. The Government has a very grave responsibility in the field of housing. It said in 1949 that one of its principal objectives would be to ensure that the people were adequately housed. That promise was made in 1949, but it is much more difficult to-day than it was in 1949 for a young man to acquire the deposit on a home that is required by lending bodies. Housing should be made available at a reasonable rate of interest to those who need it, and the Government should do everything it can to enable this to be done. This Government undoubtedly represents the reactionary forces of this country. It stands condemned for its official decision this afternoon to curtail this debate to one of the shortest periods we have known for such a debate-that is, five and a quarter",37,Personal Explanation
111,Mr Kearney (Cunningham) [5.27],"hours. Our Whip informs me, as the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) has said, that no debate of this kind has been so curtailed previously. We are dealing with probably the second greatest problem in human relations in Australia. Despite what was said by an interloper from the Australian Country Party earlier this afternoon, the two most important problems with which the Australian people are concerned to-day are unemployment and housing. They are interrelated and the solution of one depends substantially on the activity in the other. In its legislative enactments, the Government has shown an absolute disregard for the interests of the mass of the Australian people. This has been shown in all the actions taken by the Government since its narrow, fluke win at the last election. This bill does not make any change in the destructive, bogged down conditions that have pervaded the housing industry and the provision of finance for homes since the Menzies Government came into power. Not since the Chifley housing agreement of 1945 have we had adequate Commonwealth legislation to deal with this national problem. Some 80,000 people to-day are more or less officially listed as being unemployed, but that number would have to be doubled to give a true representation of the picture. The Minister for Labour and National Serthe decrease in the number of unemployed. I personally am pleased that the number has decreased, and we of the Australian Labour Party hope that under our control there will be a complete elimination of unemployment. We will not have a pool of 60,000 unemployed, which the Government calls full employment, but we will reduce the number of unemployed to the absolute minimum. The construction of homes is not keeping pace with the needs of the community. An important ingredient in our increasing population is immigration, and I am pleased that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr numbers of immigrants who have left the Downer) is with us to-day. The pressure put upon Opposition members by the curtailment of the debate means that we cannot develop our arguments as logically as we would in a half-hour speech. My electorate contains probably the largest high-density group of immigrants in Australia, and I can say that many of these people are leaving the Cunningham electorate, which includes the steel-producing district of Wollongong and Port Kembla, in great numbers, basically because they are dissatisfied with this Government's refusal to make a reasonable effort to help them to obtain homes. We have three large immigrant hostels in the district, containing great numbers of immigrant families, many of which have reared two, three and even four children while living in those hostels. This is something that was never envisaged by the Labour Government when the great immigration scheme was inaugurated. We looked on hostels as being staging camps, places where immigrants would stay overnight, as it were. We believed that hostels should be provided only as temporary accommodation until the immigrants gravitated into the general community. But that gravitation is not taking place, and immigrants are going back to their homelands because they are dissatisfied with housing conditions in Australia. There .is work for most of them, and the other conditions of life in this country appeal to them, but they cannot accept this Government's tyrannical housing policy, as a result of which they must either remain in hostels or else assume a colossal burden of debt, which they can repay only by slaving for the rest of their lives. In the Wollongong district you cannot buy an ordinary home for less than about £6,000. Vou cannot buy a block of land for less than about £1,000, and you cannot get money from lending institutions to enable you to buy a block of land or a house. Any worker with a bank balance of £1,000 who tried to-morrow morning to get financial accommodation to buy a new home would find it impossible to do so. One result of the Government's housing policy is to be seen in widespread overcrowding and sub-standard housing conditions. The Minister has told us of the various hostels, but he did not tell us that many of them have exchanged their hostel accommodation for overcrowded and substandard conditions elsewhere. I know of cases in which beds are never cold. With",39,Personal Explanation

This Government's housing policy has this Parliament who has a group of throttled the development not only of my immigrants in his electorate knows the own district but also of practically every difficulties faced by these people. other part of Australia. Everywhere there is a keen demand for homes. To-day there are great numbers of young married couples housing agreement that it negotiated, proseeking to embark upon family life who duced a proper plan to cover a period of ten cannot obtain homes to enable them to do years.

Every member of The Chifley Labour Government, in the to provide a home for his family. This Government should examine its conscience, Earlier in this debate the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess), in his customary brazen and brash fashion, made a statement that cannot be borne out by any facts. He said that rent control in New South Wales had prevented private enterprise from entering the building trade and proceeding to build houses and flats, because rents of the edifices and buildings that might be erected would be controlled by State laws. The honourable member was taken to task by the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin), one of the most honoured and most honourable members in this House, who obviously was upset because the honourable member for La Trobe had made untrue statements. Then we heard the honourable member for La Trobe, after having said that new buildings are not being erected in New South Wales because of rent control, declaring that he had been misreported. I advise him to take care that he does not alter ""Hansard"", which will have a true record of what he said. Then the honourable member for Mallee to take up any lag. In fact, as I pointed ( Mr Turnbull) made one of the most out, the number of outstanding applications remarkable speeches that he has ever made grew during that year. In 1960-61 the in this Parliament, because he dealt with Commonwealth provided under the Comeverything except housing. Still, he made monwealth and State Housing Agreement, one remarkable statement. He said, "" I do plus the emergency allocation, £17,000,000 not find many people round the country looking for homes now "". That remarkable statement is proof that the honourable memis providing £15,000,000; last year it prober for Mallee either closes his eyes as he vided £13,527,000 for Victoria, but this travels about the country or visits only those year it is providing £12,600,000; the areas inhabited by rich graziers and farmers £4,200,000 made available to Queensland or other wealthy men of this country. I interpret the Commonwealth and State £9,036,000 last year, this year it will get Housing Agreement, as I think anybody £9,000,000; the amount for Western Auswould, as an agreement to help solve the tralia great housing shortage of this country.

But if for housing? Will it reduce the amount one examines the situation one finds that again next year? If so, what hope will that does not apply at all, because during there be for all those people on low incomes the year 1961-62 the applications lodged who need houses so desperately and who, throughout the States of Australia with the housing authorities only, that is, housing trusts and housing commissions, totalled 47,022. In New South Wales in that period there were 18,192-mor e than 300 a week -and in Victoria there were 9,699; in Queensland there were 2,502, in South Australia 8,161, in Western Australia 6,701 and in Tasmania 1,767, making a total of 47,022. At 30th June, 1962, 36,322 applications were outstanding in New South Wales, 13,147 in Victoria, 4,166 in Queensland, 12,000 in South Australia, 7,658 in Western Australia and 1,652 in Tasmania, a total of 74,945. This means that 74,94-5 families in the low income group, because they are the ones who make applications to housing commissions, do not have a home, yet need one desperately and urgently. Let us look at how the legislation we are discussing at the moment will correct this situation. The money to be made available by the Commonwealth in 1962-63 is less than the expenditure in 1961-62, despite the fact that the amount made available last year was not nearly sufficient for New South Wales, whereas this year it last year becomes £3,800,000 this year, whereas South Australia received last year was £3,706,000, Tasmania last year it was",40,Personal Explanation
113,Mr Einfeld (Phillip) [5.39],"year by year, make applications to the housing commissions? Let us examine the 18,000 applications lodged in New South Wales. Of that number, 17.9 per cent, are from people in receipt of incomes of less than £12 a week; 3.75 per cent, receive an income between £12 and £15 a week; 19.7 receive between £15 and £18 a week; 18.78 per cent, receive between £18 and £20 a week; 26.21 per cent, receive between £20 and £25 a week; and 13.59 per cent, receive £25 a week, or a little more. What chance have the low income earners of getting houses if the housing commissions of the States cannot provide them, and are unable to do so because the Commonwealth Government will not face up to the situation and make available more money in a way that will satisfy the circumstances in which these people find themselves? In the year 1961-62 the housing commissions of the States completed 11,019 houses. In New South Wales, 4,286 houses were completed; in Victoria the number was 2,400; in Queensland, 1,152; in South Australia, 1,846; in Western Australia, 843; and in Tasmania, 492. Despite the fact that by 30th June, 1962, there were 74,945 applications lodged and pending with the housing commissions, during that year only 11,019 homes were built by the housing commissions or housing trusts, as they are called in some States. That is a most remarkable situation. This Government in providing this money must know full well that not only will it not satisfy the needs for South Australian Housing Trust shows that one year, but it cannot possibly take up the lag. Indeed, not only can it not take up the lag, but even with private enterprise and State governments building as many houses as they can with the money provided, the lag will continue to increase. Despite the number of people in the low income group who are in a hopeless situation and unable to find housing for themselves, the honourable member for Mallee and his colleagues cannot find people in the country who are looking for houses. This Government and its supporters are for ever telling us of Labour's poor record, but let us look at the situation under a Labour Government in New South Wales. In 1961-62 the New South Wales Housing Commission broke all previous records and completed 4,700 homes and had a further 3,995 under construction. Despite that tremendous effort, the housing shortage in that State is still acute, with about 36,000 families still requiring houses. In 1960-61, despite the disastrous economic policies of the Commonwealth Government, the joint efforts of government and private enterprise in New South Wales established an all-time high in home building by erecting 36,397 units. More than 38 per cent, of total completions throughout the Commonwealth were in New South Wales, although only 33! per cent, of the building workers live within New South Wales. There is still an acute housing shortage in New South Wales as there is all over Australia. In 1961-62 government and private enterprise in New South Wales completed 32,349 houses and flats, which was 37.5 per cent, of the national completions. But there are still 18,000 applications coming in each year to the Housing Commission alone. In 1961-62 New South Wales built, through its governmental agencies, a total of 12,700 homes, 4,700 of which were built through the Housing Commission, approximately 2,500 were subsidized with funds provided by the Government and the Rural Bank and the balance through co-operative building societies. The New South Wales Government, while charged all the time with not putting in its own funds, provided more than £20,000,000 of its own funds for the building of houses. Yet New South Wales, like other States, is in serious financial difficulty. The 1960-61 annual report of the during the year 9,099 new applications were received under all schemes-31 3 more than in the previous year-bu t that only 3,314 homes were completed. That is, 6,000 less than the number of applications received. In the two years ended 30th June, 1961, the trust received more than 17,000 applications but completed only 6,488 homes, leaving an outstanding balance of more than 10,000 applications just for these two years. In Victoria, the Housing Commission's applications at June, 1961, were 14,424 and, according to the commission, greatly exceeded the number of houses that the commission could build. In that year the commission built only 2,217 units, while there were 2,300 applications for home units for aged persons. The New South Wales figure for 1961-62 of 32,349 houses and flats completed was more than three times the completion total of South Australia, which was 9,729, and almost equal to the combined totals of the main Liberal States-Victoria, 23,039, and South Australia, 9,729. The South Australian Housing Trust's report for 1960-61 saidThe Trust is only too well aware that the position, as regards the availability of reasonable, adequate accommodation for the less fortunate section of the community is far from satisfactory. Applications for rental houses, especially in the metropolitan area, continued to pour in to the Trust's office and the waiting period for applicants is still quite considerable. All State governments need more money for housing. The New South Wales allocation for 1962-63 is £15,000,000, which is £2,000,000 less than that for the previous year. The lag is increasing every day. In New South Wales it is increasing at the rate of 300 a week, and in other States it is increasing proportionately. In any case, it will take many years to overtake the shortage, wipe out the slums and provide proper accommodation for people generally, and for aged people in particular. With restricted funds it is quite impossible to do this. If applications continue to be received faster than housing units can be built, what will be the position next year, and the next year, and the next year? The position will become more desperate. The Government is not facing up to this tremendously important problem. Yet the honourable member for Mallee continues to go around the country and find that there are no people in need of houses. Mr Harold Holt -There were 25,000 approvals in the December quarter. approvals. Everybody admits that houses are being built. New South Wales has received £15,000,000 for this purpose, and this bill will provide a little more than £40,000,000. But what is the sense of providing insufficient money to do the task? Of course units are being approved. But there were 18,000 applications in New South Wales. In two years, about 9,000 houses have been built. As I have mentioned, the number of applications received exceeded by 10,000 the number of units F.9893/62 -Ji -[84 ] built. The honourable member for MaUee might think that defence is the important thing because he does not mind people needing houses; but 75,000 families have lodged applications for housing commission homes and have not been able to get them. Now, less money is to be allocated this year than was allocated last year, because members on the Government side are not prepared to face up to this very serious situation.

Speaker, on 17th October, the Minister for House, and explained to us, a bill designed to amend the Tariff Board Act 1921-1960, as amended by the Tariff Board Act 1962. In discussing this bill, one should point out, I think, that Australia has had a Tariff Board for 41 years, since 1921. Over that period, this instrumentality has served every Commonwealth Government well, I would say. The personnel of the board has produced hundreds upon hundreds of reports over the years, some of them pleasing to manufacturers, some of them, no doubt, pleasing to importers, some of them pleasing to the government of the day and some of them not so pleasing to the government of the day. I think it can be said that, traditionally, the Tariff Board has been looked upon by governments and by the people generally as a completely impartial authority. Indeed, it has become usual to say that the board is an independent and impartial authority. The end result has been that governments, although they have not always accepted the board's reports, publicly have treated them with respect, regardless of what the same governments may have said about the chairman and memCalwell, A. A. bers of the board to their faces or behind their backs. Mclvor, H. J. Over the 41 years of the Tariff Board's existence, the complexion of Australian industry has changed greatly. In the initial stages, I think it would be correct to say, the operations of the board dealt in the main with very small industries indeed-indus tries employing a mere 200 or 300 men, or even fewer. In those days, an industry employing 200 or 300 men would have been, by Australian standards, a relatively large industrial concern. With the passage of time, there has come a transformation in Australian industry. Enterprises have expanded and vast sums of capital have been invested. There has been a tendency for large industries to swallow smaller industries, and, as the smaller industries have been swallowed, there has developed in our midst a variety of monopolies each of which exclusively controls a whole production unit. So this evolutionary process has gone on. Yet, with the exception of some alterations to the Tariff Board Act made earlier this year and some proposed now, in the charter which the original act gave to the first members appointed to the board. Perhaps it is natural that, with the passage of the years and the ever-growing complexity of modern industry and the impact of vast international combines and organizations in Europe and in other parts of the world, tbe problem of protecting Australian industry has become more and more complex and increasingly difficult. It is natural, Mr Speaker, that, if a government is incompetent and does not know how to tackle a job, the complexities of dealing with these problems become more and more evident and trouble looms up. We note particularly the effect of the rapidly deteriorating economic situation in Australia, especially in 1960, and the impact of this Government's economic policy on Australian industry. This has been accentuated -w e want to be factual and impartial and impartial always.

120,Mr Pollard,"We want to be factualsubstantial falls in the prices received for Australia's exports. The decline in the prices received for our exports has been so great that, if we take 1953 as the base year and put the index of our terms of trade in that year at 100, the index of our terms of trade at present stands at 66. This means that, compared with the prices paid for our imports, the prices received for our exports are only 66 per cent, of what they were in 1953. Inevitably, Australian industry and those who have any desire to see this country members of the Commonwealth Public properly developed, and to provide adequate opportunities of employment for our people, are concerned when the protective devices available to a government are not used properly for the prevention of unemployment and the adequate protection of our local industries against being submerged by cheap imports. So long as a government fails to take adequate steps, so long does the crisis continue. The present situation has been brought to a climax by an event which, in the existing circumstances, has attracted more public and press attention than would otherwise have been the case. Let us have a look at the climax which has been reached with the very recent resignation of Sir Leslie Melville kind. In fact, in some respects his authority from the position of chairman of the Tariff Board. I do not know why Sir Leslie resigned-whethe r for purely personal reasons, because of disagreement with the Government's policy or perhaps because of resentment at being frankly informed by the Minister for Trade-the Minister is a pretty frank gentleman-that in his opinion the board was not giving effect to the Government's policy. We are left completely in the dark about the reasons for Sir Leslie's resignation from the board. not the one last suggested by the honourable member. Minister produce the facts? In some respects, a development like the recent one may do some good. I have no doubt that, because of it, members of this House will examine the Tariff Board Act more thoroughly than otherwise would have been the case. Let us see how the Tariff Board operates. To what extent is it free and independent of government restrictions and instructions, and exactly what are the Minister's powers? I find, putting the situation briefly, that the board comprises eight members. Under the terms of the principal act, two of those members must be officers of the Commonwealth Public Service at the time of their appointment, and, if the Governor General -in other words, the Cabinet-so desires, three of those eight members may be men who, at the time of their appointment, were Service. According to the discretion of the Minister-the Governor General is specified in the act but in reality the authority lies with the Minister-the other five may come from various walks of life including primary or secondary industry, academic pursuits, &c. By that method of appointment we get what is considered generally to be a fairly well balanced board. Then we must ask ourselves what is the charter of this board. If we examine the act we find that apart from the Minister's right to do certain things in relation to appointments, the granting of leave and a variety of other relatively unimportant matters, he has very little authority of any is curtailed substantially. Let us consider what authority he has. First of all, before the board can consider certain matters those matters must be referred to it for inquiry and report. In that respect it is the Minister who determines, on behalf of the Government, whether an Australian industrialist or a captain of industry will get a hearing before the board. The particular matters which the Minister may refer to the board are mentioned in the principal act. Section 15 is in these terms15 -(1. ) The Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report the following matters:(d) the necessity for new, increased, or reduced duties, and the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties; (e) the necessity for granting bounties for the encouragement of any primary or secondary industry in Australia; (f) the effect of existing bounties or of bounties subsequently granted; Oi) any question whether a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the Tariff, and in particular in regard to his(i) charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; or",45,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962

In those March and April members on both sides circumstances the industry concerned, in of the House suggested that the power given the absence of any power in the Minister to the Special Advisory Authority to impose who is prohibited from taking any action quantitative restrictions should be given also at that stage, may go to the Wall.

129,Mr Pollard,"That is right. Thea Minister has said that the Government believes in the independence of the Tariff Board, and then you find something going on that savours of interference or dissatisfaction, and you cannot get to the bottom of it, you are entitled to start asking questions. In the Senate recently a senator directed a question regarding this matter to the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner), who represents in that chamber the Minister for Trade. In reply Senator Spooner said order. here. Senator Spooner replied. I should have thought that Senator Wright would need no assurance from me or any other Minister about the Government's desire It is only a desire, you seeto maintain the independence of the Tariff Board. Unless we can look to an independent authority to give us answers to these great questions that come before us, we shall be in difficulties. To my knowledge, there is no substance in the allegations that there has been a difference between the Minister for Trade and the Tariff Board and that there is an attempt to undermine the independence of the board. So there was a Minister of this Government saying that there has been no attempt to undermine the traditional independence of the board. But the strangest thing of all-and this follows the introduction of this bill and will not be very palatable to honourable members opposite who are interjecting-is that although we are told by a Minister of this Government that there is no interference with the independence of the board, if you look at the last page of the Minister's second-reading speech delivered on 17th October you will find the following statement:The Tariff Board, for its part, has a vital and important role in advising the Government in this direction. Along the lines that he had designatedObviously the board in effectively carrying out its advisory duties must keep within its sights the objectives of Government policy . . . You know what you do when you keep a thing in your sights. You shoot it down. You have a good look at it and make sure you have drawn a bead on it. I shall repeat that sentenceObviously the board in effectively carrying out its advisory duties must keep within its sights the objectives of Government policy-the objectives I have outlined in my remarks to-day and as given in Government statements from time to time. What a nice state of affairs! In effect, the Minister says in his speech that this board, this authority which his own representative in the Senate says has a traditional independence and has not been interfered with, must keep Government policy within its sights. Then we have the statements that the Minister makes from time to time on the same matter. What all that means is this: For the first time in history we have a Government that has said in a public statement in this Parliament that the Tariff Board has to keep within its sights the objectives of Government policy and, in effect, give effect to them. We have this extraordinary situation now: The moment the Labour Party comes to office it will have had this precedent set for it. If we see fit, when we are in government, we can say: "" The Tariff Board must keep within its sights Labour's traditional policy in regard to protection of Australian industry "". Do not worry. We will do it. If it is good for you it is good for us. Undoubtedly the situation has arisen where the charter of the Tariff Board as laid down in the act is affected. The Minister, as everybody knows, makes many public statements, and it appears that the objectives of Government policy mentioned in these statements must be kept in the Tariff Board's sights. The public statements made by the Labour Party, the Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party in this Parliament are entirely different from one another. So there will be various policies, and the traditional charter of freedom of the Tariff Board apparently goes by the board. Let us look at another side of the problem. Honourable members will see what, as a result of the neglect and ineptitude of the Government, has happened in relation to an authority that has always given reasonable satisfaction to every government prior to this one. Here is the shocking state of affairs that may be behind Sir Leslie Melville's resignation. The Tariff Board's report for 1960-61, referring to the legislation to which effect was given during the year saidBriefly, the legislation provides for(a) tariff changes to be effected by notice in the "" Gazette"" when Parliament is not in session; (b) the imposition of temporary duties following inquiry and report by a Deputy Chairman of the Tariff Board",48,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962

The position outlined in what I have just read is that obtaining twelve months after the board's critical staff position was called to the notice of the Government. Surely it was incumbent on the Government in those circumstances to have taken more effective measures to deal with this critical situation. How can the Tariff Board adequately perform its task with limited staff? How could it be a happy board when more than twelve months have elapsed since it brought its staff difficulties to the notice of the Government, but the Government, with all the resources of Australia at its disposal, has not remedied those difficulties? The board then refers to other important matters. The honourable member for Commonwealth Public Service. I have not been able to discover by what means the supply of staff has dried up.

If the Tariff Board is being subjected to pressure by the Government, if the words uttered by the Minister in the concluding paragraph of his second-reading speech on 17th October with rtespect to the board being required to observe government policy are correct, then the board's statements are true.

134,Mr Buchanan (Mcmillan) [8.40],"We have to thank that tariff policy for providing the solid foundation of many of our large industrial concerns to-day. Factories that play a major role in the Australian economy, giving employment on the grand scale, providing a wide range of consumer goods and now reaching out to export markets, owe their initial kick along to the encouragement they received from the tariff policy of that time. The war years were the making of many of our factories and, of course, a large number of new enterprises were established to fill defence requirements. Since the war, a major feature of our it slowed down the regular inquiries in economy has been the development of Auswhich the board was engaged.

They know that Because this Government has been doing the out-dated technique of tariff protection just that, it has been necessary to introduce adjustments to tariff-making procedures in the past year or two. The first step was to try to adapt the rigid processes of the Tariif Board, with its longdrawn-out and painstaking inquiries, to the speed with which changes can occur in modern merchandizing. By enabling a deputy chairman to make temporary arrangements for tariff protection against a rapid increase in imports, it was hoped that serious damage to specific industries would be averted. It became apparent that this was not a flexible enough arrangement and proposed to give the special authority the right to impose quantitative restrictions on The present bill is a further adjustment practice of imposing a duty.

But for any major easy to see why so many people have been industry to remain economic and efficient, asking for an inquiry into the tariff and the it must be allowed to supply the major operations of the Tariff Board, why there is portion of the base load of local demand. a pressing need for an inquiry into its purWhere industry cannot supply a particular poses and the extent to which it should requirement, imports should be freely availprobe into figures in an attempt to make able.

It is easy to see why there are our major worry in dealing with the demands for an inquiry, not only into the European Common MarketI suggest that actual machinery of operation of the board, certain changes should be made at the but also into the principles on which it earliest possible moment. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has taken into the economy as a whole, including such interesting aspects of it as availI sincerely hope, will be selected on busiThe Government has said its intention is remains economic and efficient it has an assurance that where necessary it will First, the Tariff Board should be transferred to a more appropriate setting as part of the Department of Customs and Excise. The calm atmosphere of a department, concerned only with carrying out decisions and not initiating policy, would suit it much better. It is essential that, whatever the board's role may be, it should be completely independent in its approach to the inquiries it undertakes, and should be influenced only by government policy, not departmental pressures. I agree with it is right for staff to have the rights and privileges of the Public Service, but clearly staff should not be recruited mainly from, or associated with, officers of the Department of Trade whose contacts with industry are made on an entirely different basis. Secondly, the board should be enlarged to cope with the complexity of Australian secondary industry, so that in no case should it take more than three or four months for the board to arrive at its conclusions. It is said that delays occur because of the diffiexamination of every inquiry. There is culty of obtaining authentic figures from overseas competitors. This is one of the weaknesses of the system that must be overcome. In business to-day the meticulous efforts made to obtain such information are nullified before they get a chance to bear fruit, if competitors really want the business. A small cut in prices can make all the difference between an Australian industry operating satisfactorily, and imported goods capturing the market. Too often we find an import price being reduced by the exact amount of some new duty. In place of the long-drawn-out, painstaking collection of detail, which is then carefully considered, at such intervals as industries find it necessary to request a specific tariff inquiry, the board, which has access to continuing sources of information, through statistical authorities, should maintain a continuing watch on all industries seeking its protection. It should also initiate to put forward a practical plan for changes in protection, if warranted. Thirdly, I suggest that we need an enthe world. In agriculture and grazing we tirely new department of secondary indushave an enormous capacity to expand protry, to function along similar lines to those duction, providing we can find markets for of the Department of Primary Industry, that our grains, dairy produce, meat and wool. is, to act for or control every aspect of But increased production does not mean any secondary industry within the bounds of great increase in employment in the prithe Australian scene. This would leave the mary sector. It does help employment in Department of Trade free to do an even secondary and tertiary industries, and better job on a task that it is already doing extremely well, that is, the promotion of Australian interests in all matters affecting both primary and secondary industries in overseas markets. This is a task that will grow even more in importance in the future. It would also leave the Department of Trade free to promote export trade, and to arrange trade agreements covering twoway trade where desirable. That department could be the mouthpiece through which overseas suppliers could seek opportunities for trade. It could also inform the Tariff Board on commodity prices and trends in overseas markets. Fourthly, the Government should declare a tariff policy. It is time we defined this phrase "" economic and efficient"". Interpretation of it has been a constant bone of contention. The Tariff Board is required to make a judgment on the varying degrees of efficiency inevitable in the many factories that may be covered by one inquiry. It has no standard of efficiency for its own often a great deal of difference in the amount of evidence available, as between one commodity and another. Too often results must be dependent on assumptions of what is likely to happen if something else happens. The element of guess mars the exercise of judgment. Instead of relying on a decision whether an industry is ""economic and efficient"", without laying down any degree of economy and efficiency, the Government should, through the Department of Trade, say how Australia's interests would be served by having particular goods manufactured locally or by depending on imports. Whether an industry is worthwhile must be decided by some one. The Tariff Board has to collect the facts, but this decision, I believe, should be a matter of Government policy. In making these suggestions I have tried strengthening the economy and improving our position on the list of trading nations of",51,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962

But if we are to fulfil our destiny and populate this country as it should be populated, if we are to tackle the job of developing our north, for instance, and acting as leader for our Asian neighbours, we must use every means to strengthen our manufacturing industries.

136,Mr Peters (Scullin) [9.3],"The right to the plaudits of members on the Opposiof the House are a party of free trade"". That occurred within the last twelve years. In 1951 another deputy Prime Minister, leader of the Country Party, and Treasurer of Australia, said that there existed in this country inessential industries that had grown up during a period of war, that had secured protection to which they were not entitled, and that were utilizing in this country resources of man-power and material that should be diverted to the use of primary industry or to basic industry. That right honourable gentleman said in his speech on the Budget in 1951 that this Government could use all the powers it had over banking and credit in order to encourage the flow of imports into this country to do the dual service first of reducing prices tries, boot factories, light machinery indusand seeking to cure inflation and, secondly, relieving the pressure upon goods and materials that were being used in those less essential secondary industries. In his opinion, those materials should have been diverted to primary production or to basic industries. Does any one deny that that was the policy of the Government or that that was the enunciation of the Treasurer and leader of the Country Party of those days? Of course not. That was in 1951. In 1952, within a short period, the restriction of Australian industry by this Government had been so successful that 100,000 Australians were out of work and Australia's overseas funds were in danger of being dissipated to such an extent that the Prime Minister of this country declared the nation to be in danger of international insolindustries on the one hand, or of import vency. He then introduced measures designed to restrict or to control the flow of imports into this country. To do this he went outside the tariff machinery of this country. Just as the Treasurer had gone outside the tariff machinery of this country in order to increase the flow of goods within Australia, so the Prime Minister went outside the Australian tariff legislation in order to restrict the flow of goods into this country. He introduced import licensing and savage restrictions on imports into this community in order to redress the evil that his Government had created. Ultimately, the restrictive measures were partially successful. At that stage this Government was not so firmly convinced of the virtues of tariff protection, or of increasing the powers of the Tariff Board so that it could become an efficient and rapid weapon to defend Australian industries, as to cause it to introduce legislation to do those things. On this side of the House, we pointed out that it took up to two years to determine an application to the Tariff Board and that in that interval the industry that had applied for protection was so damaged that the belated protection given to it did not adequately restore it to its former position. In many cases, such industries had been destroyed beyond all redemption. During the war, industries were promoted in this country by the Labour Government. They were decentralized throughout the length and breadth of the nation. Textile industries, clothing and other industries were diffused throughout the country areas. At Bridgewater, Portland and other places factories were constructed to produce textiles, clothing, rugs, druggets and other manufactured things. During the debacle between 1951 and 1952 not one but dozens of those industries in country towns closed their doors. They have never opened therr since. At that time, had the Government adopted the Labour Party's policy for the protection of Australian industries, those industries would have been protected. As a result, factories which do not now exist would have continued to grow in strength and magnitude. We would not have been seeking frantically the creation of export replacement industries on the other hand. The import replacement industries that we seek now to create are industries which yesterday this Government destroyed. First it destroys them; then it says that we have to replace them. First it says that there are not sufficient imports coming into Australia; then it says that too many imports are coming in. The Government pretends to be making both those statements in the interests of our economy. To-day, it is pretending to the people that it has introduced amendments to the tariff legislation at this late stage in order to re-create the non-essential industries that it destroyed from 1951 onwards, or to create new industries the existence of which was prevented by the goods that the Government induced importers to bring into Australia. The issue that has moved the Government at present is not the issue of protection for Australian industries against importations. This is not a question of free trade as against protection. Honourable members on this side of the House stand for the protection of Australian industry in order to maintain conditions and pay wages which are greater than those payable overseas, and which have been built up over the years. We believe that Australian industry should not be destroyed or damaged by imports from countries such as Japan, mainland China or Russia-countrie s with planned economies-o r from countries in Europe or elsewhere which produce goods under conditions which do not operate in Australia. The honourable member for St. George( Mr Clay) as well as other honourable members proposed legislation that would make more effective and rapid the operation of our tariff. It was Opposition members who, for the first time in this Parliament, said that we required quantitative restrictions. We suggested the adoption of a course which the Government now proposes to follow. Because of that, we do not oppose this legislation. But we do say that, because of the delay that has occurred, the remedy which was suggested by Labour is now inadequate. Whilst it will prevent conditions from deteriorating as rapidly as they goods-in goods, mark you-£95,000,00 0 otherwise would have done, it will not reverse the trend and rapidly improve conditions. Why has the Government introduced these amendments? merely because it is faced with economic difficulty in connection with our overseas funds and overseas trading.

This morning the Treasurer said, in answer to a question from the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Whittorn), that the Government was encouraging capital investment to come to this country from overseas to help in our development. Of course the Liberal Party is doing this. Liberal Premiers, Liberal members of this Parliament and members of the Government have gone around the world in order to induce capitalists from other countries to invest their money in Australia. There is no limit to the overseas loans that the Treasurer would secure if he could. AmI right? There is not a word of denial from the Government side of the House. How are we receiving the proceeds of these loans raised in New York-in dollars or in goods? How are we receiving the proceeds of the loans raised in London-in £1 notes or in goods? How is the overseas capital invested in this country coming to Australia-in money or in goods? All this must come in goods. During the last quarter, we have had a deficit on overseas account of more than £95,000,000. We have received in worth more than we have exported. We have raised £12,000,000 of loan money overseas and £83,000,000 of investment capital has come into this country during It has introduced them the last quarter. This information appears in the financial statements issued by the Treasury just the other day. In three months, £95,000,000 has come into this country from overseas in the form of goods, financed by investment capital and by loans raised overseas. It should be obvious, then, that, if the Government seeks loans investment capital from overseas wherever obtainable, our tariffs will be impotent to Not long ago, the Government raised in",55,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962

Everybody knows that the proceeds of that loan came to this country in the form of manufactured brummagem jewellery and, perhaps, even some jewellery that was not brummagem. The proceeds of overseas loans come to this country in the form of goods of all descriptions. This Government, having encouraged by raising loans and seeking investment capital abroad a flood of these goods on to the Australian market, now has the audacity to claim that it is now worried about our industries and that it will protect them by tariffs. We need more than tariffs to protect Australian industries. I have pointed out before, and I point out again, what is happening. The Myer Emporium Limited, in Melbourne, recently declared a dividend of 16J per cent., after making a profit of more than 33 per cent. David Jones Limited recently declared a dividend of 12i per cent., which was covered more than twice by its profits. How have these high profits been made? They have been made by the sale of goods from overseas, such as ties, manufactured clothing of all kinds, foodstuffs such as canned chickens and fruits many other kinds. But let us mark this, for this is where the unethical element appears: The Australian manufactured article could probably sell as cheaply as can an article manufactured in Japan, England or Italy, but there is a bigger margin of profit on the imported goods than on those made in Australia. Naturally, no man will be so much an infidel as not to believe in what makes for his own profit, and imported goods are pushed for sale and goods manufactured in Australian factories by Australian workmen are kept under the counter. The output of goods made in Australian factories by Australian workmen could be increased, because there is hardly a manufacturing industry in this country that has not idle productive capacity to-day. That excess capacity would enable us to produce a vast additional volume of goods. But producing those goods is of no use if they cannot be sold, and they decided to make an investigation of the cannot be sold because goods imported from overseas give a margin of profit of 25, 30 or respect of the Tariff Board Act, proposals 50 per cent., compared with a margin of 10 or 12 per cent, on goods made in Australia. Because of the high margin of profit on imported goods, those goods are pushed by the retailers and the wholesalers to the disadvantage of Australian products. This Government could prevent the retailers of this country from making immense profits while they destroy Australian industries. But it just will not act. Instead, it produces a measure of this kind, allegedly to protect Australia's industries. In 1953, 1958, in 1960 and twice in 1962-thi s being the second occasion this year-the present Government has tinkered at the Tariff Board. The Government is content to tinker at the board, but it cannot radically alter the Australian economy merely by interfering with the board. A lot more is needed. The Government should have done earlier some of the things that it now proposes to do. As I have pointed out, if these things had been done earlier, they would have been of much greater advantage than they will be now. All that the things now being done will do, as I have already said, is to prevent the situation from getting worse as rapidly as it otherwise would have done. The Government is on the horns of a dilemma. It can reduce unemployment by dissipating our overseas funds and increasing our overseas indebtedness, or it can increase unemployment by safeguarding our overseas funds and reducing our demand for overseas loans and overseas capital. But, unless the Government radically alters other phases of its economic policy, our economy will continually seesaw between unemployment and the dissipation of overseas funds. The Government has either continually to increase our overseas indebtedness or to increase unemployment. No third choice is available unless the Government radically alters the economic policy that it has been pursuing up to date. The Australian Labour Party, not once, but a dozen times, has advanced the proposition that there ought to be a radical investigation of economic policy and of the effects of the inflow of overseas funds on the Australian economy.

The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), for at least the last six we kept our balance of payments within or seven years to my knowledge, has been advancing the proposals which are now to be given effect to by this latest measure to amend the Tariff Board Act. However, because we have suggested them in the past we support them. But we do not want the people of this country to be deluded into thinking that the Country Party leopard has changed its spots and that it now is a highly protectionist tariff party whereas once it was November, 1960, measures took their a free trade party. We do not want the people of this country to be deluded into thinking that the remedies which we said ten or twelve years ago should be applied will be as effective to-day as they would have plainly in the trend offiguresover the last been then. 1 am afraid that I must return this debate to a less passionate plane, and I hope that I can keep it on a more logical one than has the honourable member for Scullin( Mr As I have said, we were unwise in 1958 Peters). At the outset let me say that I declare myself to be an unashamed protectionist in favour of the protection of efficient Australian industries. Therefore, I support this measure. I believe it to be a necessary measure. I ask the House to consider a little of the history which lies behind it. Honourable members will remember that in 1951-52 we had an unexampled trade deficit on current account amounting to about £550,000,000. As a result of that we introduced, as we were bound to do, a system of import licensing which remained with us, with some ups and downs and with some modifications, until recent years. Finally we decided to get rid of it. I believe that we got rid of it very largely because the confusion and corruption which were inherent in it became too great a weight for the economy to bear. However, when we got rid of it we unwisely did not put anything in its place and, as a result, our balance of payments started to run adversely again. Let me state the position broadly and consider first the ten years from 1947 to 1957. ordinary year of 1951-52 to which I have referred, during that time our debits and credits on current account came out about even. Sometimes they were favorable; sometimes they were unfavourable. Naturally one expects these things to veer from year to year, but generally speaking reasonable bounds. But what has happened since 1957? I ask the House to consider the figures. For the year ended June, 1958, we had a deficit of £152,000,000. For the year ended June, 1959, the deficit was £181,000,000, for the year ended June, 1960, it was £224,000,000 and for the year ended June, 1961, it was £369,000,000. Then the effect. For the year ended June, 1962, we had a deficit of £8,000,000 but for this current year the deficit will run at over £300,000,000. This can be seen quite five or six months. This is a serious situation. Australia has never had a run of deficits like these at any previous time in its history. The Government has to do something about it. and 1959 to remove import restrictions without putting anything corresponding to them in their place. I agreed with the Government's assessment that the system of import licensing was becoming unmanageable and had to go, but I did not agree with the Government's assessment that the system could be eliminated in a flash. I said so at the time and the Government's assesment proved to be wrong because we had this deficit of £369,000,000 in 1960-61. The November, 1960, measures were introduced and the Government took the futile course of endeavouring to repress the level of internal activity to redress the deficit in the external balance of payments. This was a wrongful course. I am glad that the Government has realized this and is now back-tracking and going about the matter in a more sensible way. Those of us who warned the Government at that time of the consequences of its action have received scant credit from the Government, yet we were right and the Government was wrong as is shown by the If one excepts the single extrafigures, as is shown by the results and as is shown by what is happening to-day because the fundamental imbalance has not been corrected. The run of deficits which was interrupted temporarily last year reasserted itself as soon as internal prosperity returned and as soon as the stocks that had",58,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962
145,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [9.31].,"been built up were dissipated. So the Government is facing up to the reality of the position. We cannot afford to allow our foreign trade to remain in the kind of imbalance which it bas shown since 1958. As I have said before, a deficit in one year or two years does not mean very much, but a run of deficits such as we have had in the past few years and have never had before in Australia's history means a very great deal. Therefore, the Government, quite rightly, is taking steps to undo its past policy. I am afraid that it may have to go a little further in this direction than it has yet admitted to itself that it will have to go. A deficit of £300,000,000-plus, which will be registered on current account this year shows no short-term prospect of correcting itself. It is true that in years to come oil will redress a part of our import excess because we shall be producing own own oil. Several exports, particularly minerals and partly manufactured minerals, looks like coming good in a few years. But they will not come good in 1962-63 or 1963-64. Something bas to be done in the meantime. Hence we have this policy of new protection to which the Government has been converted, and which the Government should perhaps have seen much earlier as a necessity of our economic life. Therefore I support this measure. Let me say that I think we want to have a look at a few details of it. If honourable members will study the principal act-the Tariff Board Act 1921-1960-the y will see that section 15 (1.) reads15 -(1. ) The Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report the following matters:(h) any question whether a manufacturer is taking undue ^vantage of the protection afforded him by the Tariff, and in particular in regard to his(i) charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; or (ii) acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public; or (iii) acting in a manner which results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to the consumer for his goods, This is an excellent provision which has not been activated by any government, Labour or Liberal, to any great extent, and which I hoped would be invokec! a little more, particularly since the Attorney General( Sir Garfield Barwick) has told the House that he intends in the near future to make a statement in regard to restrictive trade practices. Section 17 of the original act provides as follows:The Board may on its own initiative inquire into and report on any of the matters referred to in sub-section (2.) of section fifteen of this Act. I am therefore considering whether it might not be a good thing, while this bill is before us, to remove from section 17 of the principal act those few words, ""sub-section (2.) of"", so that the board will be t-ble to act on its own initiative in respect of overcharging in the way I have referred to. I say that because one of the things you have to possess concurrently with a policy of high protection is some protection for the consumer. I am all for a policy of high protection, giving to Australian industry the power to use its resources to the full and to produce high employment. It seems to me-the Attorney-General has already said in this House that it appeals to him in the same vay-that the functions given to the Tariff. Board under paragraph (h) of sub-section (1.) of section 15 might be more generally availed of. That is one matter. The other matter which worries me in regard to quantitative restrictions is: Who gets the licences? If you are going to have quantitative restrictions, you must say that licences to import will be given to Mr A, Mr B, MrC or Company D. This is, in the nature of things, unavoidable. In the past the system of import licensing broke down because of the confusion and corruption that were inherent in the giving of monetary advantages by administrative action. allow that? that applies to both sides of politics, so do not kid yourself on that. It seems to me it would be a good thing to put into this act a section to say that when quantitative restrictions are in operation the details of any import licences granted shall be published in the "" Gazette"" so that we would know exactly where and to whom these licences were going. This would, I think, remove one of the inherent difficulties which proved",59,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962
146,Mr Armitage,Did your Government,60,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962
147,Mr Wentworth,"This is somethinga stumbling block in the previous system of import licensing and caused that system to break down and, very properly, to be rejected by the Government. These are two minor matters. May I now mention one major matter? I am by no means certain that we could not alleviatenot remove, but alleviate-the pressure of imports by raising significantly the exchange of the position. If we have that we can rate, and quickly. To raise the exchange rate discourages imports. It also has the effect of encouraging exports, so you reach a balance from either side. You do not do all the adjusting on one side. I do not for one moment think that even if and when you raised the exchange rate you would be able to do without tariffs. I agree with the view of the Government that some kind of emergency tariff power which can be operated quickly and effectively is necessary. But I believe you would reduce significantly the number of occasions on which you would have to invoke this power if you did something quick and substantial in regard to the exchange rate. It is no good raising the exchange rate by a few points. That is futile. It is as futile as trying to turn a mob of sheep by following them, because the closer you come to the sheep the more they move ahead of you. If you raise the exchange rate by a few pointsfrom, say, 125 to 127 on London-al l that happens is a necessity to move the rate further, because the mob of sheep, so to speak, runs further and further in front of you and you never reach stability. If you are going to touch the exchange rate at all you must move it drastically in the first move and then come back against the pressure. You must get in front of the mob of sheep and turn it. That means that your first correction must be an over-correction, and then you come back against the pressure. This is a sensible and a reasonable thing to do. I am not suggesting that even if you did this thing you could do without tariffs. I believe that tariffs are very necessary and criticism voiced by Labour in February, that the Government must have power, in the interests of the overall economy and in the interests of full employment, to act suddenly and as an emergency measure. But the problem has to be looked at as a whole. It has to be looked at from the larger point of view. It sometimes seems to me that the Government is failing to look at it from the larger point of view, is failing to see the problem as a whole and is driven, therefore, into changes of course from dme to time. However well you judge events you still need to keep in hand the power to make minor adjustments and changes of course. We need a better overall view keep these minor emergency adjustments within reasonable bounds, and the operation of this and the other parts of the tariff legislation will be less arbitrary and less productive of economic disturbance. do not propose to argue with the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) the pros and cons of variations in exchange rates, whether free or otherwise. I think one would need the whole time allowed in this debate to consider fully a problem such as that. Suffice it, on that question, to say I believe that if the exchange rate today were to be varied by way of depreciation as the honourable member mentioned we could have a position which would create a lot of disruption in our economy and affect exports along the lines which the honourable member mentioned but would not necessarily overcome any balance of payment problems which might exist. But that is a broader question. I was rather surprised at the honourable member's admission that under this Government which he supports there have been irregularities in the administration of import licences. Any qualified person with a knowledge of this problem will advise the honourable member that any irregularities that might have existed could easily have been clarified and overcome by efficient administration. I am also surprised that the honourable member agrees with large elements of Labour policy regarding the protection of Australian industry. The honourable member says he agreed, at that time, with the 1960, when the Government decided no longer to limit imports by quantitative restrictions. As he agreed with Labour policy at that time, I find it hard to understand how he can in conscience refuse to cross the floor of the House and vote with",60,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962
148,Mr Armitage (Mitchell) [9.51],"ILabour on matters such as this. I find it impossible to understand how a man on the Government side of the House can advocate policies which are being advocated by this side of the House and then vote the opposite way on them. To-day there is a great deal of division in the Government's forces. On the one hand members of the Country Party are violently opposed to any form of protection for Australian industry unless it involves protection against imports of a rural nature. Among members of the Liberal Party there is a complete division between protectionists, free traders and those trying to sit on the fence. We have, for example, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr volved here is that the final decision on any Kelly), who is a very strong free trader. Then we have the Minister for Trade( Mr ment. It is the responsibility of the ParMcEwen) who, being a Country Party member, tries carefully to balance on the fence between Country Party free trading and his own conscience when he realizes that there must be protection for Australian industry. Then we have the Labour Party which has consistently advocated the protection of Australian industry and the maintenance of our overseas reserves. That is Labour's history in this regard. We, on this side of the House, have a long history and tradition behind us and are united on this policy. The Opposition is the only party in this House which is united on this question. We can go back to the days of federation, when we advocated the protection of Australian industry. We realize and are fully aware of the vital necessity, if we are to become an industrial arsenal on the edge of Asia, for Australian industry to be nurtured and looked after so that, finally, some industries which may not be fully effective early in their existence may become stronger and ultimately help us achieve our destiny as a fully industrialized nation. We should consider also the question of Sir Leslie Melville's resignation. I do not think anybody in the House will deny that he is a man of great personal integrity. I do not think many would disagree that he is a man whose policies tend towards the support of free trade as against protection. hood? course, came from the Government. It is important for us to remember-thi s is the principle which is at stake-that Sir Leslie Melville believes that when experts are appointed by the Government to make inquiries into the tariff and the necessity or otherwise for protection to industry, they should be allowed to bring in recommendations which are in accord with what they believe to be correct and in accordance with their conscience and should not be subject to pressure by the Ministry to bring in recommendations in which they do not believe but which the Ministry may want to rubber-stamp. The other vital principle insuch questions must rest with the Parlialiament to make a determination on the question of protection, the limitation of imports or any other matter of that nature. ment. with the Parliament. The Labour Party supports this legislation, because it goes a little of the way towards the achievement of Labour policy. But we make the point very clearly that we believe effective protection of Australian industries and of our reserves can only be finally achieved by quantitative import restrictions. Tariff provision does not necessarily overcome the problem. There could be a situation in which a duty is placed on an article and shipping freights from the exporting country are immediately reduced in order to enable the product to compete against the Australian product. We could have a situation where imports into Australia could be subsidized by the exporting country, once again shortcircuiting the duties imposed by the Australian Government. That is the basic reason why we say that the only effective and long-term method by which this problem can be overcome is by means of quantitative import restrictions. We have a good example in my own electorate in respect of citrus fruit of the need for this type of restriction. I will read out the text of a telegram recently sent '-\ to the Minister by the Arcadian Galston",61,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962

It readsStatewide conference of citrus growers to-day has expressed deep disappointment at the absence of recognition of Sir Frank Meere and your Government with the continuance of an inadequate tariff on citrus juices and resultant continued intermittent imports seriously prejudices any possibility of stabilized marketing conditions for power of the public to solve this problem. the Australian citrus growing industry. Further that is considered redundant to suggest the industry re-present its case to the Tariff Board with inevitable delay and requests that your Government itself reviews its adoption of the Tariff Board report of March 1961 rejecting same in the light of subsequent development and immediately applying the tariffs then sought by the citrus growing industry. This branch of the Agricultural Bureau makes the point that it is almost impossible to stabilize the citrus juice industry from the point of view of the growers because the processors can use the threat of imports to reduce the price paid for fruit and are reducing the quantity processed this season because of the fear of a repetition of last season's imports. The citrus industry adopts the same policy and the same approach to this problem as does the Australian Labour Party-that is, that the problem can be finally overcome only by the introduction of quantitative restrictions against the import of citrus juices or citrus products. It is important for us to remember that Labour's policy on the introduction of quantitative restrictions is based on two points-first , the protection and assistance towards the growth of Australian industry and, secondly, the protection of our balanceof-payments position. We should look back at this stage at the history of the recent Government-created recession. It is now just on two years since the Government deliberately created a recession and large scale unemployment. I think we should look at history to learn how that recession came about. It was in February, 1960, that the Government aboUshed import restrictions. As the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) mentioned to-night, in no time our balance-of-payments position was serious. Reserves were shrinking rapidly and imports were growing rapidly. The Government had then to make a decision as to the action it would take to correct the position. It had to decide whether to admit its mistake of February, 1960, and adopt Labour's policy on import restrictions or alternatively to adopt the indirect method of trying to limit imports by reducing the demand for imports by the creation of unemployment and by the reduction of the spending power of the public. The Government adopted the blunt and cruel method of reducing the spending It is important for us to remember that little piece of history, because I do not think there is any doubt that there is evidence of a further crisis developing in our balance of payments position in the next twelve months. We should ask ourselves what policies the Government will adopt to meet this position. Only recently the press carried the headUne, ""Increased Demand for Imports. Fourth Month of Deficit In Overseas Trade."" I think we should examine the growth of our imports. The latest issue of the "" Treasury Information Bulletin"" shows that imports in the September quarter of 1961 were £211,000,000, in the December quarter £195,000,000, in the March quarter a rise to £220,000,000, in the June quarter £233,000,000 and in the September quarter of this year £263,000,000. Our imports have increased from £195,000,000 in the December quarter last year to £263,000,000 in the September quarter of this year. That surely shows that there is a very great danger of a further balance of payments crisis developing in this country. We should also look at the balance on current account. In the September quarter of 1961, this was down by £18,000,000; in the December quarter it was up by £27,000,000; in the March quarter it was down by £3,000,000 and was then down by £96,000,000 in the September quarter of 1962. So from being £27,000,000 ahead in the December quarter of 1961, we were minus £96,000,000 in the September quarter of 1962. This has been financed by a complete dependence of the Government on the induction of capital and particularly of private capital. Official transactions and loans and private capital movements have increased from £1,000,000 in the December quarter of 1961 to £95,000,000 in the September quarter of 1962. That is surely an indication that the Government is more and more depending on the induction of capital to meet a serious trade balance deficit. We cannot depend on this in the long term. In the December quarter of 1961, capital increased by only £1,000,000 as compared with £95,000,000 in the latest period. Accordingly, we are depending more and more on this capital which could, through movements overseas or domestically in Australia, be cut off at any particular be brought to this country and our industry time. For this reason, I make the point that the Government is sitting on the edge of a razor on this question of the balance of payments. There is very little doubt that in the next twelve months it will once again have a balance of payments crisis and will then have to make a decision. It will have to decide whether to rely on import controls -that is the only basis on which it can meet the situation, apart from the other policies it previously introduced-and so admit its previous mistakes and agree with Labour's policy, or whether to use the blunt edge that it used in November, 1960, and introduce another credit squeeze in order to limit imports by reducing the demand for imports. Those are the alternatives. The Government must adopt one of them. There is little doubt that its tariff policy would be virtually useless against the flood of imports. I believe that the public to-day wants the Government to adopt sound policies. Business people and wage and salary earners alike are fed up with the Government's switches of policy. To-day they want a stable policy not only for the protection of Australian industry but also to ensure that our overseas reserves are protected in such a way as to obviate a balance of payments crisis with a consequent introduction by the Government of another credit squeeze. We make the point that this can be obviated, and that a stable policy can be introduced, only if the Government is once again prepared to impose quantitative import restrictions, not only to protect Australia's industries but also to protect our overseas reserves and to prevent a balance-of-payments crisis. That is the only policy that can finally solve the problem. In conclusion, let me say that I believe the Government is going to have to admit its mistake of February, I960. Obviously, the honourable member for Mackellar has much the same idea in his mind. The sooner the Government is prepared to produce a plan for the future development of Australian industry, and the sooner it is prepared to admit its mistakes of the past and bring down a suitable policy, the sooner will Australian industry grow at a faster rate, and the sooner will economic recovery protected. sonal explanation, Mr Deputy Speaker. I claim that I have been grossly misrepresented. The honourable member for Mitchell said I was following the policy of the Labour Party enunciated in February, 1960. The opposite is the case. I made my views known-and in this House -lon g before February, 1960, and Labour adopted the views I had put forward in this chamber. -Order! The honourable member for Mackellar will resume his seat. He is now debating the matter. [10.12] I shall refer, in opening, to the speech made by the Minister for Trade( Mr McEwen) in introducing the measure now before the House. He said that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) had announced in February last that a certain series of economic measures would be taken to remedy a position that had developed in this country, and that these measures included certain proposals designed to strengthen and speed up the operation of our machinery for assisting local industry and meeting competition from imports. He went on to saySpecial Advisory Authorities are now provided to advise the Minister for Trade on the need for temporary protection of Australian industriesprimary and secondary-agains t serious damage from import competition, pending review by the Tarifl Board of normal protective requirements. . . . The power of the Government to apply quantitative restrictions, as was explained at the time, was not something new. I have sat here this evening with feelings akin to those I experienced when, as a small boy, I looked up and saw a man whose name was, I think, Blondin, walking a tightrope, and wondered how long it would be before he would fall either to the right or to the left.

They have tried to attack the Government by all sorts of means, in an endeavour to create the impression, somehow or other, that the Minister is wrong, that the Government is wrong and that the bill is wrong whilst still maintaining that they will vote for the bill because it is going to protect Australian industry. They do not want to come out in the open and say that they are opposed to protection. They are not quite sure how they can get their message across and, like Blondin, they have been walking the tightrope, airily suspended and always close to an impending crash. I heard the spokesman for the Opposition, the honourable member for Lalor( Mr amendment which will enable this GovernPollard), tearing a passion to tatters over the resignation of a fine public servant. I know Sir Leslie Melville very well. I have known him for years. I have a great admiration for his ability. The honourable member for Lalor, in his endeavour to avoid the thorny patch into which he might fall if he were not careful, devoted much of his speech to a discussion of the resignation of this gentleman. Then we heard a succession of speakers, one of whom was the honourable member for Scullin( Mr 1945. At any time during the intervening Peters), who traversed a complete circle and finally arrived back at his starting point, may have been under fire. This has been still not quite sure whether he had fallen off his tightrope or whether he was still balancing fairly successfully in mid-air. Let me say to the House at the outset that a government obtains information from various sources and not from any one particular source, and that its decision as to the wisest policy to pursue, having considered all the information available, may cause it to reject, in part or in whole, a particular proposal that is put forward. That is a prerogative and a responsibility of a government, which must, in the final analysis, make the decision. Then the Parliament determines whether the Government has made a wise decision, and later, of course, the people give their verdict. If an authority makes a report-and the Tariff Board has made many reports since I have been in this House-and the Government thinks it wise not to accept that report, that is the Government's responsibility. It is the responsibility of the Tariff Board, of course, to present a completely impartial and balanced report, based on all the information at its disposal. The national government, which must deal with international matters and give attention to the interplay of forces overseas, the inflow and outflow of capital and so on, may find reason to differ from the report presented by the board. In the present situation, the fact that a senior and very able public servant has resigned and taken up another position is no reason why his name should be continually dragged in the dust, or why the Government or the be accused of some heinous crime that was never committed. What we are discussing at present is an ment to move, with statutory authority, much more quickly, and with greater security in its decisions, than it can under the existing legislation. In a theatre of war, when you are faced with certain economic circumstances, you have to act in a certain, way. In matters affecting trade you must adopt a similar approach because, after all, whether we like it or not we have been engaged in a cold war. This war has been waged ever since the shooting war ended in period the economy of a particuar country particularly true of Australia, because of its association with many different countries. In circumstances such as have existed in recent years, a country may find that even those it has deemed to be friendly will try to gain some temporary advantage by making a raid on that country's economy. Your government has to have the means to act swiftly. Consequently, the Government set up the Special Advisory Authority to review quickly claims that Australian industries were suffering to such an extent that unemployment was rising. Surely if anything were to appeal to the Opposition it would be action to enable the Government to prevent unemployment from mounting. It was to avoid this eventuality that provision for the appointing of special advisory authorities was introduced. I know that some honourable members on my side of the House incline to the view that this action should not have been taken, but I entirely disagree with them. I disagree with them in perfect good",64,Tariff Board Bill No 2 1962
156,Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen) Should,"humour, but I want to point out to them that I , as a representative of a great counwas 15 per cent, or more. The interest on try electorate, have had primary producers' organizations come to mc and ask me, more than once or twice, to put before the Minister a reason why their particular industry should not be jeopardized by the inflow of imports. They have claimed that swift protection was needed. I remember one honourable member on this side of the House producing a piece of chain. I am not sure whether his purpose was to show that tariff protection was hitting the primary again wanted to see Australia placed in producers, but I could have produced pieces of ham, soya beans and quite a number of other things to support the argument that the Government should have power to grant swift protection to certain sections of primary industry. For the same purpose the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Armitage) might have produced a bottle of orange juice. But I think those things are beside the point. What we are really considering is the overall policy and the basic philosophy behind it. NowI will state my own position. I came into politics a confirmed free trader. Subsequently, I supported the Australian Country Party's view that it would be an excellent thing if we had subsidies to encourage the local manufacturer and to enable him to compete with overseas manufacturers. We all know that, over the years, subsidies have not afforded protection, for the simple reason that overseas exporters will still undercut our price and pour their goods in. Very often, when imported goods hold an established market, it is very hard for Australian manufacturers to break in. So, I became convinced that subsidies were not the answer, although in a limited sphere they might have succeeded. With subsidies only, Australian industries would not have got far. Then we had the experience of the 1914-18 war, followed by the depression of the 1930's. What did we find then? We found that Australia, because our secondary industries were not effectively developed beyond a certain point, was fair game. IfI remember rightly, I think we owed £520,000,000 in London at about 5 per cent. But although the interest rate was normally 5 per cent., that money was owed at a time when the price of wool was down to 8d. a lb. and wheat was selling at ls. 3d. a bushel, so the effective rate New York borrowings was even higher. The lesson burned into my consciousness was that Australia would always be vulnerable unless we could have a policy which recognized that the primary and secondary industries were inter-related and that if one sagged the other fell; that if one was not there we paid far too much for what we had to buy overseas. I never that dependent positiona position in which, unfortunately, it appears there is a danger of New Zealand being placed as a result of the Common Market proposals. I do not wish to talk of my own part, but after discussions with the various leaders of primary producers' groups and others, I introduced into a Country Party conference a resolution, which was carried unanimously, that we appoint a committee to approach the manufacturers of this country and try to get a reconciliation of interests under a common secretariat to watch the effects of the ebb and flow of the economy on both sections upon the nation. Although that was not achieved, there was a great deal more understanding, and I think there is to-day a very considerable recognition of the fact that, unless the primary industries are properous, the secondary industries begin to feel the impact. Apart from fhe fact that the primary industries have to pay overwhelmingly for our imports, the money earned in those industries flows out through so many avenues that the benefit to the economy as a whole is far greater than the immediate effect on those engaged in primary production. I have in my possession a most interesting commentary, dated March, 1962. It is in a review by the Bank of New South Wales, and I think it is worthwhile quoting. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion, despite the fact that we had a record export income of £1,080,000,000 last year, for which the primary producers were largely responsible, the position of the primary producer in this economy has materially gone down hill as compared with other sectors. This responsible review, which I know was drawn up by first-class economists, said that although some primary producers experienced a brief period of high returns during the Korean war boom, the rural industries as a whole have failed to match the growth and prosperity of other sectors of the Australian economy in the period since 1948-49. The review then goes on to say that, according to the official national estimates, net farm income in 1960-61 was only 40 per cent, larger than it had been twelve years earlier, while the income of wage and salary earners had risen by 240 per cent, and company incomes had increased at a similar rate. I ask honourable members to note that although the farm income was only 40 per cent, higher than in 1948-49, wages and salaries had risen by 240 per cent, and the income of companies had risen by about the same proportion. As a proportion of net national income, farm income has declined from 17 per cent, in 1948-49 to about 8 per cent, in the past four years, which is a decline of more than 50 per cent. Yet these were the industries which produced, as I have said, the overwhelming part of our export income, which rose to £1,080,000,000 last year! I suggest, Mr of the economy against the farmer. When Deputy Speaker, that this places clearly before us a lesson that we should assimilate. We shall be playing with fire if we continue to ignore the impact on the primary producing industries of costs and returns in other sections of the economy. The report continuesNet farm income in 1960-61 was little more than two-thirds of what it was in 1948-49, despite The right way to proceed is not to complain a 50 per cent, increase in the volume of rural output. I think those words ought to be repeated again and again. I am sick and tired of hearing people talk about the inefficiency of rural industries. I have seen people in other walks of life who were looked upon asfinancialwizards go down in some spectacular crashes. It has not been said that this was due to inefficiency. Primary producers have increased their output by 50 per cent., yet there is a downward trend in their returns. If there is any charge that can be laid against the primary producers, I think it is that they have not put up the fight that was put up when I was a younger man. We said then that we were sick and tired of the argument that the payment of lower wages in our industry would enable us to remain solvent. We demanded returns similar to those enjoyed by other industries so that we could pay comparable wages and give comparable conditions to workers on the Iand. We said that otherwise the only employees we would get would be people who were of no use to other industries. It is time that the primary producers took that line.again and said to the other people in the community, ""We do not object to your getting good wages and conditions but we demand returns which will make it possible for us to give equivalent wages and conditions to those who work in our industry"". If there is any failure on the part of the rural community beyond that, it is a failure due to the slide in the returns that they get, despite the extra work that they do. To use the rather graphic words of the report to which I have referred, the farmer is running harder and harder to try to catch up with losses which are growing greater and greater. Those losses are not due to inefficiency. They are due to the loading we face up to the real problem we find that the primary industries have been exposed to intense competition in the world's markets-in many instances from the subsidized exports of other producers. I believe that we may have to come back to the idea that to give high protection to secondary industries and tertiary industries is, in effect, to subsidize those industries. about that but to face up to a fact to which I drew attention in a little booklet in 1955, when I said that the day might come when we would have to subsidize the food which we sell to our own people and pay the primary producer a return which would enable him to be on balance with the rest of the community. By that means we could stabilize wages and living standards. We could maintain a good standard of living with basic foods and, at the same time, give the producer a fair deal. The real trouble to-day is that, in spite of all his efforts, costs and values are running against the farmer. The position cannot be adjusted by free trade. This would just allow our industries to be destroyed. It would show that we had forgotten the lessons of the 1930's, when we were held for ransom because we did not have highly developed secondary and tertiary industries in this country. We have not yet gone as far as we can go. There are people who say that we should produce only those things which we can produce economically and that we should let other countries do the rest. The answer to them has been provided by Sir George Stapleton, the great oecologist of Great Britain. He said that it is a futile policy. He said that you will never have a nation of well-developed people unless you have a policy which enables them to exert all their talents in every possible field of human endeavour. I thoroughly agree with that statement. I feel that excessive protection might not be necessary for luxury industries, but I think we would be wrong in trying to curb the natural inventive, experimental and constructive abilities of our people. I agree wholeheartedly with the measure before the House. I believe it represents a practical recognition of the fact that when you are engaged in war, whether economic cold war or any other form of war, you have to be able to change your tactics quickly, although your all-round strategy may not be altered. One of the ways to enable you to alter your tactics is to provide a means for industries to obtain aida means which does not leave them struggling for two years while awaiting a reply from the Tariff Board. It is necessary to speed the process of handling applications for protection by giving a ready assistance when a prima facie case is made out and subsequently letting the Tariff Board review the case and make a final decision. Tf the European Common Market idea develops, we will need to be able to take swift action. That swift action will be possible with the machinery now proposed. Failure to use such machinery would be equivalent to saying to a drowning man, "" Wait until I fashion this surfboard. That will take about 24 hours, but I will then throw it out to you and you will be able to save yourself."" That does not appeal to me as a means of meeting the economic requirements of the nation. We must be able to think fast and act fast in order to save our people. There may be theoretical objections to this should not be regarded as iron ore.

If so, what are the (a) quantity and (b) value of ore exported? 3. To what country were exports made? 4. From which State was the ore exported? National Development has supplied the following information:The year 1960 was the year in which the Commonwealth Government decided to permit the export of iron ore from Australia on a carefully controlled and limited basis that would ensure that iron ore reserves considered essential for Australia's industrial future were conserved. Since the relaxation of the export policy there has been a tremendous amount of activity in exploration for new deposits and in investigation of existing deposits. This has resulted in tbe discovery of new reserves and a substantial increase in Australia's resources of iron ore. As yet, there have been no commercial exports of iron ore made from Australia, although, since I960, three approvals for the export of iron ore have been granted. Approval has been granted to Western Mining Corporation Limited for the export of 3,600,000 tons from four deposits in the Tallering Peak area, 40 miles north of Mullewa, Western Australia, and 1,300,000 tons from the Koolanooka Hills area, about 12 miles east of Morowa, Western Australia. There have been two approvals for the export of 200,000 tons each from small deposits at Fineflower Creek, near Grafton, New South Wales, and at Kangaroo Hills, near Townsville, Queensland. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Government has indicated to the Western Australian Government that it will favourably consider an application for the export of 15,000,000 tons of iron ore from the Mount Goldsworthy deposit, about 60 miles east of Port Hedland, when suoh application is made by the companies now investigating the deposit.

Have the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the six nations comprising the European Economic Community all declared in favour of international commodity agreements in respect of the marketing of primary products? 2. What nation, group of nations, or international organization is to take the initiative in convening conferences for this purpose? 3. Have any steps yet been taken? 4. In what year is it expected that such agreements will become operative? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The British Government with other Commonwealth countries, agreed at Montreal in 1958 to seek greater stability for trade in primary products through international commodity agreements. At the recent Prime Minister' Conference all Commonwealth countries including Britain agreed to support a fresh and vigorous approach to the negotiation of international commodity agreements. Since the advent of the present administration the United States Government has also declared its support for such agreements. In the context of the British negotiations for entry into the Common market, the Six have expressed a willingness, upon the accession of Britain, to make a declaration affirming their intention to seek solutions for the problem of trade in temperate agricultural products by way of international commodity agreements. 2.

Australia has bilateral trade agreements with the following countries in what is sometimes referred to as the Afro-Asian grouping:-Japan (6th July, 1957), Malaya (26th August, 1958) and Indonesia (17th December, 1959). As distinct from these bilateral agreements the honourable member will be aware that Australia is also a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and therefore has a multilateral trade agreement relationship with the following countries:-Burma, Ceylon, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Malaya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Tunisia and Uganda. Civil Aviation. Mr Ward asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. Did the Ansett group of companies last year declare a net result of £1,000,528 after providing £11,351 for taxation, and this year a net profit of £1,066,056 after providing an amount of £8,537 for taxation? 2. Has his attention been drawn to the explanation by Mr Reg Ansett, the principal of these companies, that the small provision for taxation in relation to net profits, was due to the advantage obtained from the accumulated losses of companies acquired by the group in recent years? 3. Will he explain how losses incurred by acquired companies are turned to the substantial financial advantage of the acquiring company or group through a reduction in its own taxation liability? Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes, so far as concerns the year ended 30th June, 1961. I have seen press reports relating to the company's profit for the year ended 30th June, 1962, but I understand that the annual report and nnancial accounts for that year are not yet available. 2. I have been unable to find in the company's annual report for 1960-61 an explanation of the tax provision referring to losses. Reports of the two preceding years indicated that the income tax provided for that purpose out of the profits of 1960-61 year was £200,000. I have seen reports that a provision of £250,000 is being made 3. A company (whether or not a member of a group of companies) is entitled under the income tax law, to deduct a loss incurred by that comincome year not later than seven years after the of income in which the loss was incurred.

Mr Ward asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice1. Has his attention been drawn to a recent statement by Mr R. Burn, manager of George Shirley Proprietary Limited, fertilizer manufacturers, that the Australian-Malayan Shipping Conference had quoted a freight rate of £25 per ton for fertilizer shipped from Australia to Singapore? 2. Is Japanese manufactured fertilizer being landed in Singapore at a total cost, including freight, of £28 per ton? 3. Did Mr Burn also state that the cost of manufacturing fertilizer in Austraha was competitive with Japanese costs but that freight rates charged by the shippers were effectively keeping Australian exporters out of important South-East Asian markets? 4. If the position is as stated, what action does the Government propose taking to correct a situation which is seriously retarding the development of Australian export industries? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The report I saw referred to sulphuric acid and not to fertilizer. 2. I am not aware of the position so far as fertilizer is concerned, but I am informed that the landed price in Singapore of sulphuric acid from Japan ranges between 8 and 10 Malayan cents per lb. In Australian currency this represents a price range from £26 6s. per ton to £32 18s. per ton. Both figures include a freight component of £15 12s. 6d. (Australian). 3.

164,Mr Mcewen,"The answers to thethat the freight rate on sulphuric acid from Australia to Singapore is £15 (Aust.) per ton, i.e. 12/6 per ton below the freight rate from Japan to Singapore. However, the Japanese acid is supplied in disposable containers while the Australian acid is supplied in cylinders which are returned to Australia and re-used. The freight on the empty cylinders is £10 per cylinder. If the Australian industry adopted the Japanese practice of exporting in disposable containers it would be favourably placed, so far as freight rates are concerned, to compete in Singapore with the Japanese product.

The United States Air Force with the approval of the Government of Australia has in its past temporary operations from East Sale, Victoria and now its permanent operations from Avalon/Laverton, Victoria, conducted, as part of its world wide sampling operations, upper air sampling between latitude 40 degrees south and 60 degrees south. Present operations require this same type operation to continue between 40 degrees south and 60 degrees south with one flight per month originating from Avalon/Laverton, Victoria and proceeding north to Cooktown entirely over the Australian mainland for the purposes of upper air sampling operations between latitude 37 degrees south and 15 degrees south. This extension to the original arrangement was announced recently by Mr Townley. 2. The reason for conducting upper air sampling at any latitude in the world is to determine the extent of radio activity in the atmosphere. The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, with the approval of the U.SA.F. sampling operations conducts investigations on stratospheric dust and its effect upon the formation of rain.
