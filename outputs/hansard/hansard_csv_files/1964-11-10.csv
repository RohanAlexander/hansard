3,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Leade r ofSenator Seddon Vincent did his best for his own State and he did his best for Australia. We mourn his loss and regret his passing. He was a man who, in the course of his duties as a senator, helped very unobtrusively and always sincerely in causes in which he became interested. A recitation of the committees of the Senate and the joint committees of the Parliament on which he served is impressive. He was the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television. I saw him when he appeared on television. At that time he knew full well that his days were numbered, but he defended his Committee's recommendation and answered criticisms with great ability, all the time hiding the fact that he was mortally ill. He was a man who faced death very gamely, very courageously. As I saw him on television on that occasion I said to myself that I hoped that if I had to die of the disease from which he has died I would be able to face death with the same fortitude as he exhibited. On behalf of the Opposition I subscribe to the resolution moved by the Prime Minister in which we express our sympathy to his devoted wife of yesterday and his bereaved widow of today. Trade and Industry) I wish to associate the members of the Australian Country Party with the resolution proposed to the House by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). Senator Vincent, as we knew him, was a typical Australian of a kind that I think everyone would admire. He was a really good Australian type who served his State and his country well. He served in the Senate with great distinction, and at every opportunity to participate, at whatever level and in whatever committees, Senator Vincent was there. He took a leading part as Chairman in the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television. For this he will be long remembered. He had a great interest in the theatre, but his service ranged over a wider field. I had the privilege on one occasion during a Senate election of travelling quite widely about Western Australia with the late senator and I came to learn of tbe breadth of his interests. He served with the Royal Australian Air Force and gained the rank of wing commander. This is a quite high rank and, I think, one of the highest to be gained by those who joined the RAAF. after the outbreak of war. So his service with that branch of the forces was quite distinguished. I know that Senator Vincent -thi s is characteristic of Western Australians-ha d a tremendous interest in Western Australian wild flowers. This was one of his great hobbies, and in his spare time he engaged actively in it. He had been chairman of the Kalgoorlie Chamber of Commerce, and I know that, as a man from Kalgoorlie, he had a great interest in goldmining, the industry that is so vital to Western Australia. He was an untiring protagonist of all that served the interests of the industry, and he unceasingly advocated an increase in the price of gold. To this extent, he worked for the advancement of his own State and of the Australian economy generally. We all regret the passing of Senator Vincent and we all join in extending the deepest sympathy to his widow. Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) Mr Speaker, I should like to mention the work of Senator Vincent on the Joint Committee for the Australian Capital Territory. As the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) has said, the senator was a member of this Committee from its inception in 1957. He was its chairman for, I think, 16 or 17 months during the life of the Twenty-fourth Parliament. He participated in the work of the Committee over the years and gave very valuable assistance in inquiries that were conducted under the chairmanship of bis predecessor in that office. He brought to the work of the Committee not only a keen and inquiring mind but also tremendous enthusiasm for the development of the National Capital. That enthusiasm was backed by wide experience and deep knowledge. Senator Vincent was determined that what was done in the development of the National Capital by the present generation would be worthy of the generations yet to come. He had strong views about the value of the Committee itself and about the scope that it should be permitted in the conduct of its inquiries. He put those views forcefully on behalf of the Committee. His work has been extremely valuable to the Committee and I know that",13,Death Of Senator Victor Seddon Vincent

Will he take urgent steps before the end of the present parliamentary session to have credit unions treated as accredited savings institutions after 31st December 1964 for the purposes of the Homes Savings Grant Act? recognise that one of the big problems which faces us is that of obtaining sufficient long term finance at reasonable rates of interest to meet the housing requirements of our growing population and the increasing rate of family formation. The Homes Savings Grant Act is designed-to increase the flow of long term funds into housing and to assist young people to acquire homes. The scheme entails a reward for saving for a home. There are, broadly, three ways in which these savings can be made-first , by opening a home savings account in a bank, particularly a savings bank; secondly, by investing in land on which a home is to be built; and thirdly, by putting funds into a housing society or a building society. These societies, of course, provide long term finance, in addition to helping young people to acquire homes. Credit unions do not provide a means for dump in Australia excess stocks which saving for long term finance for housing. could result from this recent imposition I think the maximum loan that is by Great Britain? made in New South Wales is £1,000.

The main reasons which governed) Cabinet's decision at that time are set out on page 2095 of "" Hansard"" of 19th May 1964. The Leader of the Opposition referred to a pile of telegrams that he has received. By comparison with the telegrams that I have received, his pile appears very small. Many members on both sides of the House have also had the treatment. Credit unions are not alone in making representations that savings deposited with them should count in this scheme. I have had representations from superannuation funds, various savings institutions and other bodies all over the country. These, of course, will be examined sympathetically, and from the angle of whether they will provide additional long term housing funds. for Trade and Industry say how the 15 per cent, charge on imports which has been imposed by Great Britain will affect her position in relation to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade?

I cannot anticipate the conclusion that may come from that examination. I come now to the latter part of the honourable member's question. It may well be that countries which have less easy access for their goods to the United Kingdom than other countries may seek other markets. Of course, very seldom are goods sent to a country; they are generally imported on the initiative of merchants within the country. To the extent that increasing quantities of goods may tend to be diverted to this country in such a volume or at such a level of prices as to be damaging, or thought to be seriously damaging, to Australian industry, then the quite adequate apparatus that the Australian Government has establishedeither the Tariff Board or the Special Advisory Authority-coul d be invoked to protect Australian industry, if that should be necessary.

Has the period of qualifying service for the award of the Efficiency Decoration to Citizen Military Forces officers been reduced from 20 years to 12 years? If so, what is the reason which prompted the reduction? Is it correct that whereas the Efficiency Decoration and Efficiency Medal may be awarded to officers and other ranks respectively in the C.M.F., and the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal may be awarded to other ranks in the Regular Army, there is no appropriate award outside of the Queen's Honours Lists which can be made to officers of the Regular Army for long and meritorious service to the Commonwealth? Will the Minister look at this matter with a view to re-assessing awards available. period of service to qualify for the Efficiency Decoration has been reduced from 20 years to 12 years. This was done at the request of the C.M.F. itself so as to ensure greater availability of the award to serving members of the C.M.F. It is also true that there is no long service award for officers in the Regular Army. This matter has been examined from time to time, but such an award has not been thought appropriate, primarily on the ground that officers of the Regular Army a locally manufactured item.

Will the Minister say whether the statement is correct? answering a similar question asked by a member of another place.

I assure the honourable member that no Australian contractor has fallen down on his contract and failed to deliver what he has contracted to deliver. the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise. Will the honourable gentleman inform the House of the progress made by the Commonwealth and the States towards uniform censorship laws and practices? ber, I think, I answered a question in which J gave details of the progress to that date. I noted at the time that the last conference of Commonwealth and State officers on this matter was held in April this year. The matter referred to by the honourable member was then under consideration. I have recently checked with the Minister for Cusresignations from the Citizen Military toms and Excise and although further work has been done on the subject, there are no specific developments to report. Acting Minister for Health. Do some vitamins deteriorate after a certain period of whether such goods sold in a deteriorated condition are harmful if taken? To prevent deteriorated goods being sold to the public, with consequent risk, will the Minister induce suppliers to print on the container in which the product is marketed the date on which the vitamin ceases to be effective? vitamin preparations tend to become unstable if exposed to light and air. Under the Therapeutic Standards Act we use as books of standard reference the British Pharmacopoeia and the British Pharmaceutical Codex. These lay down standards prescribing that vitamin preparations must be packed in airtight containers and that the containers must be made of amber coloured glass. These precautions prevent exposure of the contents to air or light. Those standards have been adhered to in Australia, but, of course, there has been no requirement under them for an expiry date to be placed on the label. However, special standards committees have been set up under the Act, and the situation is being examined at the present time. A number of experiments have already been carried out and certain additional tests have to be made. Resulting from those experiments, advice will be given as to whether or not it is thought necessary in the future to include on labels expiry dates for these preparations. The only other point I wish to make is that vitamin preparations which are included on the pharmaceutical benefits list are subject to regular tests and examination by the National Biological Standards Laboratory. for the Army in a position to indicate to the House whether there has been any evidence of a significant number of Forces as a result of the requirement that C.M.F. members should sign on for service overseas?",18,Aborigines

The honourable member in his enthusiasm has rather cast adrift from the facts. The last major review was announced in May 1963. That was not just before the last election. That election was held in December of last year. The programme that I intend to announce tonight, and which I thought was being clamoured for by honourable members opposite, began with a review that went into operation four or five months ago. Are honourable members opposite, suggesting that, the Government having made this examination and having come to conclusions, I should conceal the results until after the Senate election?

As to Alice Springs, there appears to be a section of the community in that centre the members of which are habitual offenders in this direction. But to suggest that all members of the Aboriginal community drink to excess is a definite insult to these people.

Mr L. R. JOHNSON I ask the Minister for Supply a question. Is the failure rate of ammunition supplied by the Department of Supply to the Department of the Army as high as 124per cent.? What is the estimated value of all faulty ammunition provided by the Department of Supply to the three Services? Why is the wastage rate so high and what steps are being taken to minimise it? ber appears to presume that the wastage rate is indeed high. The fact of the matter is that ammunition produced by the Department of Supply would be tested and inspected before acceptance by the Department of the Army. To that extent one can say that the Army does not accept defective ammunition. The rate of rejection of ammunition produced by the Department of Supply certainly does not run as high as 124 per cent.

How can a draftsman prepare legislation when the Government cannot make up its mind? The Government has made up its mind only this week on very important legislation, some of which was not forecast in the Governor General's Speech or in the Budget speech and some of it comes to us as a complete surprise. According to the blue sheet which has been circulated to honourable members the Minister proposes-and he wants our co-operation in order to do this-that two important measures, the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Bill and the Seamen's Compensation Bill, shall be disposed of in one hour tonight. The Minister does not state the time but he does say Mr Harold suggested. sheet. The Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) tonight will make a most important speech on defence preparedness. The right honourable gentleman has already told me that it will be a 6,000 word document and that means that it will take over an hour to read. After that is completed we are to discuss these two Bills. The Opposition has about 22 amendments that we wish to move and they are important amendments. We might cut down the number of our amendments but every one we move will deal with the rights of some person on the Commonwealth payroll-somebod y in some Commonwealth instrumentality who happens to be injured in the course of his employment. Why can we not have adequate time to discuss a measure of that type? longer. Why have the second reading debate and all the Committee stages to be completed longer but the Australian Labour Party was in about an hour? Mr Harold Holt -Would the honourable days during the war period and I cannot member like us to leave it till the autumn? remember telling Parliament: "" Well, you We want the Government to give us adeSenate election and then for a recess.""

Why should gender a lot of discussion, and all will invite not the Government give Parliament time amendment. Then, with that pious simplicity for which he is so notorious, the Treasurer suggests, as the Leader of the House, that other orders of the day may be taken as time permits. What time? At5 o'clock tomorrow morning or when? It is all nonsense to ask honourable members to agree to this motion to enable the Government to bring on new business after 11 o'clock. We have no assurance from the Government that it will not abuse the authority of the House if the resolution is passed. The Opposition is always prepared to co-operate with the Government. The Minister never found me difficult to cooperate with when I was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and represented the Australian Labour Party in any negotiations that I had with him. I do not think he has found the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Holt -That was never Whitlam) very difficult. I will pay the Minister this tribute-and not a grudging one either, particularly when he pats himself on the back-that he is a vast improvement on his predecessor. But still, the Opposition wants co-operation both ways. We do not want the Minister to say: ""Well, you cooperate with us and everything will be all right"". We want the Government to give us adequate facilities to debate these measures which affect the well-being of quite a number of Australian citizens. That is a fair request and the Government should accede to it. The Minister says: "" Labour Governments did certain things"".

It is in the course of debate, from one side to the things happened in the past, when a Labour other, that we hope we make some progress for the good of this country. I oppose the resolution and I ask the Treasurer at least to make a reasonable arrangement with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, if he is going to bludgeon his motion through with his abject, subject majority, so that no legislation will come on late at night, either tonight or any other night. We have until Friday to discuss the business of the nation. That is too short a time in any case but at least honourable members will be better fitted to make decisions if they do not have to wear themselves out with lengthy sittings because the Government has other engagements or wants to do other things. always opposed late sittings.

Why did he put up with late sittings when Labour and if necessary, Friday, on which to sit. was in office? As I have said so often in this Parliament on similar occasions when speeches of the kind we have just heard have been made, when I first entered the Parliament the breakfast beil at the Hotel Kurrajong used to ring at 7.30 in the morning. BeforeI reached the Hotel Kurrajong, after coming from a late sitting, I heard the breakfast bell ringing. That is how government was in office. Honourable members opposite say that there was a war on. There was not a war on then. I came into this Parliament after I returned from overseas after the war. The Leader of the Opposition said that in those days we were facing impending disaster. The only impending disaster Labour was facing was the 1949 election. | I do not think we should have late sittings and I make the suggestion to the Treasurer that we sit on Friday of this week and, if necessary, on Saturday as well. Anyone who is listening to the debate this afternoon might think that this Government was having very late sittings and that when Labour was in office there were no late sittings at all.

The public is inclined to think that to suspend the 11 o'clock rule is merely to allow the Parliament to sit after 11 o'clock at night, but the Parliament usually sits after 11 o'clock at night. Since the Treasurer introduced his Budget three months ago the Parliament has sat on 22 days, and on 15 of those days it has sat after 11 o'clock at night. It is not necessary to susthe RSL. did not squeak when the amendpend the 11 o'clock rule in order to permit the Parliament to debate matters after 11 o'clock. We usually do that even with this rule in operation. On two of the seven occasions when Parliament rose before 11 o'clock, one was the afternoon when Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, was to attend a reception at night, and the other was on a Friday. That means that on the ordinary sitting days the Parliament has in fact sat after 11 o'clock on 15 out of 20 days. All that we do by suspending the 11 o'clock rule is to permit the Government to bring in new business for initial debate after 11 o'clock at night. That is no way to deal with Government may be right, but I still hope legislation. We were sufficiently rushed at our party meetings this morning in dealing with 21 new bills. It is not fair to expect honourable members to commence to deal with complex legislation after 11 o'clock. We did so a couple of months ago with the Repatriation Bills and we did so with the Repatriation Bills last year. It was a disgrace. Only a supine body such as the Returned Servicemen's League would stand for such a practice. The amendments that were sought to be introduced into the legislation were all moved by the Labour Party in this Parliament, and they were all debated after 11 o'clock at night. Tonight it is proposed, after 11 o'clock, to bring in amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act, which deals with all public servants, and with all serving soldiers. The hundreds of thousands of people concerned will have their rights debated in this House-for the first time since the last amendments were brought in by the Government five years ago-afte r 11 o'clock at night, and after Parliament is off the air. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the Returned Servicemen's League as a supine body. That is personally remark be withdrawn. substance in the point of order. the RSL. does not stand up to its protestations when legislation in this Parliament is involved. This year and last year ments it sought in its national pension plan were railroaded unanimously by the Government Parties after midnight. The League had waited for two years, but it did not protest. In my State the branch of the RSL. has a journal called "" Reveille"" which means "" wake up"". I have never known a journal which lives up to its title so little. The journal never reports the debates in Parliament. Fortified by this experience, the Government thinks that public servants will stand for legislation, dealing with employee's compensation, being railroaded through the Parliament in the small hours of tomorrow morning. The that the public servants will stand up for their rights. The Opposition will certainly express itself on their behalf in this House. It is true, as the Treasurer says, that more bills are going through the Parliament. The way to cater for this situation is not to sit later each day, but to sit on more days. We may have to sit longer, but that does not mean that we have to sit later. All legislatures are sitting for more hours, but our legislature is getting into the habit of sitting later. It is true that the House of Commons at Westminster and the House of Representatives in Washington both are sitting for more hours in the year, but they are sitting for more weeks in the year, and sometimes for more days in the week. We must reconcile ourselves to this procedure. It is very proper that legislation should be debated in the Parliament instead of being left to delegated legislation, but Parliament ought to do this by sitting at proper hours. The way to go about this is not to suspend the 11 o'clock rule. If any of the remaining 21 bills were introduced at half a minute to 11 o'clock the debate on the Bill could proceed without suspending the 11 o'clock rule.

If something was wrong when we were in office and he said from time to time that it was wrong, why does he now sit silently or rise apologetically and refuse to support speeches such as those he used to make in the interests of democracy. Let me quote from a speech made by the honourable member on a motion similar to the one now before us. My memory is still reasonably good. As he was speaking today, I almost remembered the exact words that he used at that time. As reported at page 1429 of ""Hansard"" of 13th October 1949, he saidI, too, place on record my objection to the proposal to limit the discussion . . . My objection is based on the fact that although the time proposed to be allotted is extremely limited, honourable members on this side of the House will not be allowed a fair share of the allotted time. Only one and a half hours are allotted . . . My point is that Ministers will be given unlimited and great defence issues are to be disscope and may well occupy almost the whole of the time allotted. The Government will thus be placed in a distinctly advantageous position. In other words, the limitation of time helps the Government; but today the honourable member for Mallee is prepared to give the Government that advantageous position, particularly on repatriation and television matters on which the Government is vulnerable. continuedApart, perhaps, from the initial speaker honourable members on this side of the House That was the Opposition side. . . will be given little or no opportunity to voice their objections or otherwise to the proposals placed before them. Honourable members opposite smile at such a suggestion! He was talking about members on the government side at that time. He went on to sayThey regard the move to limit the discussion as smart political tactics. These are the words of the honourable member who spoke in such a high vein a moment ago. He continuedHonorable members on both sides of the House should be given equal opportunities to present their case. That will be done from about 10 or 11 o'clock tonight until 5 o'clock tomorrow morning, and the honourable member for Mallee supports that. He went on to sayThe Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) is normally a fair-minded man. That was a reasonable part of his speech. He saidI used the qualifying word "" normally"". On this occasion the right honourable gentleman is acting abnormally. I object to the motion because it will give to Ministers opportunities that will be denied to Opposition members. Will the honourable member rise in his place when I have finished my speech and tell us why in 1949 he stood for justice and democracy in this Parliament whereas now, simply because he is on the other side of the chamber, he thinks that it is right for the Government to do anything at all? In other words, when he gets on to the Government side we have the law of the jungle or the rule of numbers, although servicemen are suffering, television is becoming a public scandal, seamen require increased pensions cussed by the Prime Minister tonight in a 6,000 word statement. Those are matters on which the honourable member changes bis principles and supports the Government's refusal to give adequate and proper time for discussion. The Government will compel us to sit late at night to discuss these issues. Why should not we discuss defence and other The honourable member important matters in the day time or shortly after dinner, when the people can listen to the debates? Why should not the people of this country, who are paying for the broadcasting of the proceedings of this Parliament, be entitled to listen to our deliberations instead of being dependent on the capitalist Press which will not print criticisms from the Opposition side of the Parliament of the proposals that are brought down by the Government? Now we see the sinister implications behind the move to suspend the 11 o'clock rule. A Senate election and a House of Representatives by-election are coming up, and the great issues that are to be discussed under the legislation that will be before us tonight will make first class propaganda against the Government. So what is the thing to do? The thing *o do is to get a member such as the honourable member for Mallee to stand up and talk about justice and to get the Treasurer to make a statement about how good he is. He is like Cassius Clay when he proclaims: "" I am the greatest. I arrange things. Look what I have done. Look at the legislation that has been passed"". But behind that facade, the Government presents to the Parliament legislation which it does not want the people to know much about. I suggest to the honourable members that, no matter on what side of the Parliament they sit, they have a responsibility to ensure that we do not have to discuss in the dead of night legislation which should be available for all to study and the discussion of which all should be able to hear. The legislation which the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) will handle for the Opposition deals with compensation matters and is one of the most complicated measures to come before the Parliament. The Opposition proposes to move 22 amendments. If anyone wanders into this chamber at about 2 o'clock tomorrow morning, he will see hardly one honourable member on the Government side awake. I would not blame them if they were not awake because not only have they been told nothing about the legislation but they have been instructed not to discuss it because the tired and worn out old Ministers want to get to bed early. That is the real situation. The Ministers will back in employment. A great programme not let other members of the Government parties talk because the Ministers are tired. operation. In those days we were dealing The fact of the matter is that things are being put over the Australian people. There is no reason why the Parliament should not have sat more during the year. There is no reason why sitting an extra day or two in the weeks gone by would not have solved many of the problems. No matter how urgent the demand may be and no matter what may be pending, there is no reason at all for stifling discussion by members of the Opposition of issues that are of vital importance. I congratulate the honourable member for between 8 o'clock and 11 o'clock we Franklin on presenting to the Parliament inaugurated the great Snowy Mountains the point of view which he presented in a Hydro Electric Scheme and the great immifew words, but very effectively, on what gration scheme. Those are projects which ought to be done. I believe that the Parthis Government has adopted. I excuse the liament should never sit after 11 o'clock honourable member for Mallee because he at night, even if it means extended sittings has a false sense of loyalty to the Governof the Parliament. I pay the Treasurer this ment. He believes that he must say anything compliment: He is a pretty intelligent the Government wants him to say, no matter fellow, but at 3 o'clock in the morning he what is not worth listening to, even on matters "" Hansard"" is studded with speeches made of high finance. The faculties of the best by the Treasurer, by other members of the and the worse of usI do not place him in the worse category-d o not function as they ought to function at that hour of the morning. Yet the Government expects us to know all about great issues and to deliberate on them at all hours of the day and night, including the early hours of the morning, when we know full well that we cannot do justice to the legislation before us or to the people who sent us here. I place on record my disgust at the attitude of the Government in this matter, and I support my colleagues in asking the Government to consider the suggestion made by the honourable member for Franklin. As I have said, the Treasurer believes that he is like Cassius Clay, the greatest of them all. Let him ensure that legislation is brought into the Parliament in time to give us adequate opportunities to discuss it. He should not rush legislation in at the end of a session, as he is doing now. 1 am not at all influenced by the honourable member for Mallee asking what the Labour Government did. Let me tell him that when the Labour Government was in office, it was dealing with great post-war problems. It was demobilising men and women from the Services and placing them of post-war reconstruction had to be put into with legislation that was urgent and demanding because of the need to put men and women back into industry. We are now living in what the Government tells us is an affluent society, in days when all is well with the world, but the Government will not give the Parliament time to discuss legislation. The period from 1945 to 1949, to which the honourable member for Mallee has referred, was a time when great deeds were being done. Even though we sat at night only principle might be involved. present Ministry and by the honourable member for Mallee to the effect that new legislation should not be introduced after 11 p.m. I record my opposition to this motion. I have a record of the occasions when the Treasurer has kept this House sitting until the dead of night, not even putting on a supper for members, in an endeavour to starve and tire them out and make it impossible for them to do their jobs properly. The Treasurer's idea is that if supper is not put on, members will become tired and go home comparatively early.

Unfortunately, he did not add the final chapter. When the people were able to express an opinion of the results of that Government's labours, they put the Labour Party out of office. They have kept it out of office for the last 15 years. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr was a member of the Labour Government of that time and he has some awareness of the problems of a government.

Do not forget that this is the Budget session-the session in which the Parliament, very properly, requires most of the early part of the sittings for a general debate on the Budget as a whole. It then moves to a discussion of the Estimates. It is not surprising that in a year in which the Government has tried valiantly and with as much energy as it can bring to the task to give effect to undertakings which it gave at election time, there should be the largest legislative programme in the history of the country. Some of the proposed legislation could have been left until the autumn session. The Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Bill is one matter that could have been left, but to do so would have been to deny monetary benefits to those who will be affected by the legislation. I think they would prefer that we suffer a little personal inconvenience, if that is the Fraser, Malcolm price to be paid for carrying through the legislation which could be of such benefit to them.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented by Mr Fairbairn, and read a first time. Second Reading. National Development) [5.38] 1 move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill concerns financial grants to the States over this and the succeeding two financial years to accelerate the measurement of the flow of rivers and the investigation and measurement of underground water resources. The Government's decision in this matter was announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) in his recent Budget Speech. The Treasurer also said that it was expected that legislation would be introduced during the current parliamentary session and that provision had been made for payments to the States of £402,000 in the 1964-65 Budget. The importance of this measure will be readily recognised by the Parliament. Our decision to assist the States with water resources measurements is consistent with our policy of assessing and making available the basic information on Australia's natural resources required for the planning of projects based on their development. It is becoming increasingly recognised Harding, E. W. that the work being undertaken by my James, A . W. Department through the Division of National Mapping and the Bureau of Mclvor, H . J. Mineral Resources and by other CommonMortimer, J. wealth agencies such as the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the CommonPeters, E.

The value of sound comprehensive basic data can often not be set down on paper in quantitative terms; Tellers: but we do not need a benefit/cost analysis in pounds, shillings and pence to appreciate and accept that the value of reliable basic Calwell, A. A. information usually far outweighs the cost Courts, W. C. of obtaining it. In each State and in the Northern Territory there is one principal Griffiths, C. E. authority concerned with the measurement of stream flow, although several agencies Hayden, W. G. may carry out stream gauging for special Cairns, J. F. purposes or in special areas. There is also generally one authority in each State which undertakes the investigation and assessment of underground water resources. However, because water is used for many purposes ranging from municipal and industrial use to irrigation and the generation of hydro-electricity there are many agencies and individuals vitally interested in records of river flow and underground resources. The diversity of use of water, a common interest in the accumulation of data and the relatively small water resources of the Australian continent have given rise over the years to ideas about collaboration between the States and between the States and the Commonwealth in water resources matters. The Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) announced in bis policy speech in November 1961 that he intended to take up with the Premiers and with the territorial authorities the idea of establishing a Water Resources Council so that the highest level of basic information could be secured and made available. The result of this undertaking was that the Prime Minister announced in November 1962 that all governments had agreed to the formation of an Australian Water Resources Council comprising the Minister for National Development as Chairman, the Minister for Territories and the Minister in charge of water supplies for each State with provision to co-opt Ministers responsible for closely",32,Business Of The House
105,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer,"Minister forrelated activities when problems of particular concern to them are under discussion. The Council was to be assisted by a standing committee of Commonwealth and State officers. I have referred briefly to the way in which the Australian Water Resources Council was formed and its quite short period of existence-it is just two years old-becaus e the Council has been instrumental, first, in bringing together all water resources interests throughout Australia to assess the need for water resources measurements and, secondly, in formulating recommendations to governments which have provided the basis for this Bill. 1 do not propose to elaborate on the objectives and functions of the Council, but I mention the principal objective because it indicates the basic manner in which all Australian Governments are approaching water resources assessments. The principal objective isThe provision of a comprehensive assessment on a continuing basis of Australia's water resources and the extension of measurement and research so that future planning may be carried out on a sound and scientific basis. The first official assessment of Australia's water resources will be published by the Council in the next few months. It will show that the average annual discharge of Australia's rivers is about 280 million acre feet, of which about 38 million acre feet arc in Tasmania. The average water depth, if spread over the area of the mainland, would be only 1.6 inches compared with 9 inches for the United States of America with a similar area of land. The Commonwealth Government's policy in the matter of the Council and its objectives is indicated by what the Prime Minister had to say in his policy speech last November. He saidThe Water Resources Council, which in our 1961 policy speech we undertook to establish, is now functioning and has taken for its first task the measurement and assessment of Australia's water resources. We will support the Council vigorments, particularly those covering periods ously,financiallyand otherwise. The result of all this has been, as I have said, that the Water Resources Council has made recommendations on surface water measurements and on underground water investigations. I am gratified to be able to say that the Commonwealth has substantially accepted the recommendations of the Council and has agreed to make available the considerable finance on a long terra basis which is provided for by this Bill. I should not leave the subject of the Water Resources Council without paying tribute to my predecessor, Sir William Spooner, who was the Council's first Chairman. The most difficult time with most organisations is in the formative period and I am sure that the Bill before us now is a testimony to the success of this new organisation, and to Sir William's hard work and to his belief in the policy offindingout more and more about our natural resources. I pay tribute also to the Minister for Territories ( Mr Barnes) and to the State Government Ministers for the great amount of co-operation which has prevailed in these vital water resources matters and for the vigorous way in which they have been tackling the problem. The very existence of this Council and its quiet but practical progress instils in me, as its very new Chairman, considerable confidence that we have the machinery to ensure an understanding of our water resources and an understanding of where we are going in their conservation and development. I do not overlook by any means the officers who, at all levels, have assisted the Council. Of particular note are the six Commonwealth and six State members of the Standing Committee which, under the chairmanship of Sir Harold Raggatt, bring together the knowledge and experience of the State and Commonwealth water conservation authorities. Something should be said about the physical side of water resources measurements before outlining the provisions of the Bill. Water storages for municipal and industrial supplies or for irrigation and hydro-electric schemes depend for their dimensions and their cost and reliability on studies of samples of stream flow records, precipitation records and evaporation measurements. Stream flow measure of drought, are most important. For flood mitigation works and the design of bridges and culverts similar measurements are necessary with the accent on periods of high stream flow. Measurements of a different type, but also aimed at assessing quantity, variability and cost, must be made to assess the artesian and sub-artesian water supplies used over a large area of Australia for domestic, industrial and stock-watering purposes. A long period of stream flow measurement is desirable if the chances of catastrophic water shortages or costly, overdesigned structures are to be avoided. In south eastern Australia the 18 year period since 1946 has been relatively wet, whereas the 10 years prior to 1946 covered a period of severe drought. The last 18 years would therefore provide a misleading sample of stream flowa sample in fact which, taken on its own, would make insufficient allowance for drought conditions. The advantages of a long sample of measurements, preferably 50 years and moTe, taken at key positions on representative streams, will be almost self-evident to those at all familiar with the vagaries of Australian rainfall and run-off. The investigation of underground water is quite different and more complex. Underground water moves extremely slowly and there are enormous areas of land to be investigated. Here again the earlier the investigation starts the sooner will a proper knowledge of the resource be available for developmental purposes. Stream flow is measured by gauging stations which usually record automatically on a chart the variation in water level. Gauging sites often need to be specially prepared by building concrete weirs and installing permanent cableways and recording houses. There are about 1,300 stream gauging stations in Australia at present and it is proposed through this legislation to commence a programme to increase these by 1,500 and provide a basic stream gauging network within the next ten years. The recording of water levels is the first but most important step. Other procedures and equipment are required to calculate the relationship between water levels and river discharge at gauging sites and to convert the water levels to usable form. The Bill will provide for the necessary equipment to be purchased and for staff to be employed to carry out these procedures and to record and publish results. Underground water investigations involve geological and geophysical exploration, the drilling of bores and the recording of water levels, yields and water qualities. These procedures and the determination of the rate of recharge and the reliability of an underground resource often require considerable resources of staff, funds and time. The provisions of this Bill make separate reference to the measurements of the discharge of rivers and to the measurement and investigation of underground water resources. The current legislation does not, of course, cover the Northern Territory. The acceleration of the measurement of river discharges and underground water resources in the Northern Territory has been taken up by my colleague, the Minister for Territories ( Mr Barnes), and an expedited programme paralleling that in the States is to be undertaken. The Government has accepted that there should be a 10 year accelerated programme of stream gauging throughout Australia and this legislation is to ratify the provision offinancefor the first three years. I want to say that the Commonwealth, in adopting in principle the recommendations of the Australian Water Resources Council concerning finance for water resources measurements, has endeavoured to ensure a fair Australia-wide allocation of funds based on the needs for stream gauging as assessed by each State. In the more complex case of underground water investigations an overall amount has been arrived at and this has been allocated between the States on a uniform basis using area and population as the yardsticks. The Premier of South Australia is not completely satisfied with the allocation among the States of the funds made available for underground water. While five States have agreed to the proposals as they stand in the Bill, South Australia would like to see undertaken a review of the distribution of underground water assistance for the second and third years. The Water Resources Council of Commonwealth and State Ministers is scheduled to meet in Hobart on 22nd January next and I intend to have this matter discussed and reviewed by the Council, after which I would be in a position to refer the matter to the Government again if that is called for. Each State has submitted its estimates of the capital cost of establishing within 10 years a basic network of stream gauging sites fully equipped and with all the associated equipment, facilities and staff required to operate the stations and compute and record the discharge of streams. Each State has also provided estimates of the annual cost of operating and maintaining the network. The upper limit to the Commonwealth financial assistance grants has been determined from these State estimates of annual operational and capital expenditure requirements. Provision for grants in respect of expenditure by the States on stream gauging is contained in clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill. Clause4 provides for capital expenditure and clause 5 for operational expenditure. Commonwealth grants will be provided, in accordance with the details specified in the First and Second Schedules, to assist the States to attain the programme of expenditure necessary for the establishment of the basic network of gauging stations. In respect of each State, the ComTerritories) [5.57] Mr Deputy Speaker, I monwealth grant will be the amount by which the expenditure by the State, up to the ceiling of the agreed programme of expenditure, exceeds the base year figure. The grant, however, will be limited to 50 per cent, of the total expenditure. These provisions for the measurement of river dispuisne judge on the Supreme Court of charges could involve the Commonwealth in a contribution of £767,476 over the three year period. Financial assistance for underground water investigations and measurements is provided for in clause 6 of the Bill. In this and appointment, to act as Chief Justice case capital and operational expenditure are aggregated and there is payable a Commonwealth grant of £2 for each £1 of expenditure by a State over and above the base year figure. The total Commonwealth grants for underground water investigations available to the States in respect of each year's expenditure by the States are as follows: 1964-65, £240,000; 1965-66, £195,000; and 1966-67, £175,000. The Commonwealth totals have been allocated between the States on the basis of the States' respective areas and populations, equally weighted. The percentages applicable to each State are the followingNew South Wales. . Victoria Queensland Western Australia . . South Australia Tasmania. . The States' shares derived from these percentages are set out in the Third Schedule to the Bill. The Bill also contains a number of machinery provisions of the kind normally incorporated in measures providing for financial assistance to the States. These Full Supreme Court of the Territory would include provision for approval by the Minister of programmes of works, provision for the making of advance payments to the States, and provision for the submission of progress reports. I have much pleasure in commending the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Luchetti) adjourned. Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Barnes and read a first time. Second Reading. move That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Papua and New Guinea Act 1949-1963 to make provision for the office of a senior Papua and New Guinea. It is considered desirable, having regard to the special conditions of the Territory and possible future developments in its judicial system, to provide in the Act for the appointment of one judge, who is clearly distinguished by rank where necessary. The Supreme Court Bench at present consists of the Chief Justice and three judges. The Chief Justice and the judges are on circuit for a considerable part of each year and it is the practice of the Court to sit without the usual recesses for law vacations. Judges receive the usual leave entitlements for Territory service so that the occasions on which the Chief Justice is absent from duty are more frequent than we might expect in the Australian courts which sit during regular law terms, at the end of which members of the judiciary normally take their vacations.

An alternative chairman to the Chief Justice would therefore have to be available to sit on these appeals and other appeals where the Chief Justice is unable to sit. I refer briefly to the provisions of the Bill. Honourable members will note that the only amendment proposed is contained in clause 3, which provides for the insertion of a new subsection in section 58 to provide position and about our defence requirements that the Governor General may appoint a puisne judge to be the senior puisne judge, with seniority next after the Chief Justice. 1 commend the Bill to the House. Leave granted for the debate to continue. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill provides for a complete and self-contained judical system in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. It is a step towards the hearing of appeals within the Territory by the judges appointed to the Supreme Court of the Territory. The judges in the Territory adjudicate without the assistance of a legal profession with numerous members. They are required to adjudicate on matters which are quite novel and in circumstances in which Australia's judicial system is, more than usually, under the scrutiny of other countries and in which, more than usually, it will form a model for the future. The Opposition appreciates the reasons for the introduction of this measure and supports it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Barnes) read a third time. Sitting suspended from 6.2 to 8 p.m. Ministerial Statement. Prime Minister) -by leave-Fo r some months the Department of Defence and the Service and Supply Departments, in close collaboration with the Chiefs of Staff Committee, have been making a complete reassessment of our defence needs and programme. Their labours have been conducted against the background of affairs overseas, and particularly in and around South East Asia. The Government has exhaustively studied the reports placed before it, and has consulted closely with its professional military advisers. In the result, we have formed certain views about our strategic which I will now proceed to state as clearly as I can. I refer, first, to our strategic position. This requires an examination of our position in relation to our neighbours and our international associates. Since the Second World War and increasingly in the last decade, the struggle against aggressive Communism coupled with other developments in Asia has forced us to recognise that we are in a new situation. General or global war-that is, unrestricted conflict between the major world powers-ha s receded in probability because of the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons, and we continue to believe that it is unlikely except as a result of miscalculation. But armed conflicts short of general war could develop at any time in areas of tension throughout the world. Communist powers will continue to press their aims through all the varied cold war techniques of subversion and insurgency and other threats to the integrity of States which they wish lo bring under their domination. At present, important questions arise which require frank answers. They will, I regret to say, indicate that there has been a deterioration in our strategic position since the review which I presented to Parliament last year. The range of likely military situations we must be prepared to face has increased as a result of recent Indonesian policies and actions and the growth of Communist influence and armed activity in Laos and South Vietnam. If these countries collapsed, there would be a grave threat to Thailand and the whole of South East Asia would be put at risk. The effectiveness of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation as a guarantee of mutual security would be seriously jeopardised. In particular, in South Vietnam the continued instability of government has made the task of resistance more difficult and to some extent frustrates the massive efforts of",36,Papua And New Guinea Bill 1964
107,Mr Whitla1vi (Werriwa) [5.59],,37,Defence Review
108,Sir Robert Menzies (Kooyong,"the United States and our own necessarily small contributions. The aggressive attitude of North Vietnam towards South Vietnam is demonstrated by continued political and ideological support given to the military insurgents, and the infiltration of thousands of trained men. There was the Tonkin Gulf attack on United States warships; Communist China has ignored the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. These are sinister and significant developments. In Malaysia, to which we have given the specific assurances which I announced in this House, Australian troops have for the first time been in combat with Indonesian forces. True, in international opinion, Malaysia has been strengthened by the vote in the Security Council, the meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London, and the relative failure of President Sukarno to gather support at the Cairo conference of unaligned nations. But, though it is now clear that, for all practical purposes, no impartial person doubts that Indonesia is carrying on active and entirely unjustified armed aggression against her neighbour, the fact is that Indonesia still goes on her unlawful way, seeking to undermine Malaysian morale, to cause the disintegration of Malaysia, and no doubt to dominate the Borneo territories if and when they can be detached from Malaysia. If Indonesian attacks continue, Malaysia may find it intolerable to confine defensive measures to the guarding of Malaysia's shores and jungles against Indonesian intrusion. These Indonesian attacks may create a real risk of war. a war so hopelessly unprofitable to Indonesia that it is hard to understand how any leader concerned with the well-being of the ordinary men and women of his country could seriously be prepared to provoke it. Indeed we must prepare for all eventualities including the control and, if necessary, defence of the frontier between West New Guinea and the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Meanwhile, by his cultivation of the Communist powers, President Sukarno is exercising an influence in South East Asia which could weaken resistance to Communism. It must be conceded, therefore, that the risks of our situation in this corner of the world have increased. This does not mean that we suffer from fatalism or defeatism; there is not the slightest occasion for either. who would get advantage from it would be But it docs mean that we must do more, and pay more, as our contribution to our national security. This is, of course, to be done having in mind, and indeed never fogetting, that in the South West Pacific Australia and New Zealand have allies, including Great Britain and the United States, who are rich in power and goodwill. Without thorn. Australia's task in defending so vast a territory with so few people would be a fearful one. But Australian defence cannot be considered in isolation, any more than the forces we possess should be regarded as garrison forces. Placed as we are, our defence, if it is to be successful, must be beyond our shores, and in depth. Hence S.E.A.T.O., and ANZUS. We are in S.E.A.T.O. not only because we have a goodwill towards the nations concerned and would wish to help to protect them against Communist aggression, but also because the further Communist powers are kept away from us, the more secure we will feel. Thus, in S.E.A.T.O. a high common interest is rendered stronger, not weaker, by the individual national interest each of us has. Again, we are with Malaysia for several good reasons. Malaysia is a well governed and friendly Commonwealth country, and as such is entitled to our support. Malaysia is a non-Communist nation, and is willing at all times to resist the Reds; it is monstrous that she should be the subject of unprovoked aggression from the south. But again, we in Australia also want Malaysia preserved because we want the Communist powers as far away as possible. It should not be forgotten that one of the aims of what Indonesia calls its "" confrontation "" of Malaysia is the removal of the Commonwealth presence, including the bases. We are advised that so long as the bases are available and Commonwealth forces support Malaysia, there is little prospect of a defeat of Malaysia by Indonesian military action. In short, Malaysia and Australia have a common interest and an individual interest, and they coincide. In the same way, it is tremendously important for us that Indonesia should not become Communist, but retain its independence under a Government serving only the good of the Indonesian people. It is very much to be feared that if Indonesia provoked a war, the only people in Indonesia the Communists, ever ready to thrive on disorder and defeat. Thus, Indonesia and Australia have vital interests in common. the Navy and Air Force will require a conThe recent actions of the Indonesian siderable increase in manpower to corresGovernment are therefore all the more pond with the planned expansion of these deplorable.

I now turn to the concrete decisions is essential in present circumstances that this which have led to these financial concapacity and quality be retained to the greatclusions. Because of the central importance est possible extent. of manpower to the whole of our defence preparations I shall deal first with this careful consideration to the means by which question. At present the regular forces number just achieved. It seems clear, on our military over 52,000 including 22,750 in the Regular advice and our own carefully formed judgArmy, 16,600 in the Air Force and 12,900 ment, that we cannot expect by voluntary in the Navy.

The Government has therefore decided that there is no alternative to the introduction of selective compulsory service. We know that this presents difficult personal, social, economic, and perhaps political problems. Our decision has been taken only because of the paramount needs of defence and, in the difficult circumstances 1 have described, the preservation of our security. May I return at this point to the observastances. Civil employment rights of those tions I made earlier in reference to the demands of our deteriorating strategic situation? We expect a continuing requirement to make forces available for cold war and anti-insurgency tasks. We must have forces ready as an immediate contribution should wider hostilities occur. We must at all times retain adequate forces against any more direct threat which might develop to our own security. Because of our geographic position we have the most compelling reasons to take those steps which will put us in a position to meet these various demands. The necessary units cannot be provided with a lesser effective strength than joined one or other of those Services. 33,000, yet this number cannot in present circumstances and in proper time be obtained by voluntary means. It follows also that, to enable the Regular You must not repeat other people's lies. Army to achieve the required degree of operational readiness, selective servicemen must serve in regular units on a full time basis. If the scheme is to be effective, those called up must therefore be under an obligation to serve overseas as necessary and must be available to go with the regular unit in which they are serving. In assessing the length of service required, an average of six months must be allowed for recruit and corps training. Provision must also be made for leave, movement and acclimatisation should the national servicemen be sent to an overseas theatre. In order to permit a period of at least twelve months effective service in a unit a total period of two years full-time duty is required and this will be the basis of the Government's scheme. This will be followed by a period of three years on the Reserve. Briefly, we have decided that young men will be required to register in the calendar year in which they reach the age of 20 years. The first actual call-up will take place about the middle of next year. During the enrolment will be commencing almost second half of 1965 a total of about 4,200 immediately, will provide a ready means of will be required. Thereafter there will be 1 annual call-ups of about 6,900. This will, by December 1966, give an Army of a total strength of about 37,500-thi s is the Regular Army-whic h will mean an effective force of 33,000. Detailed consideration is being given to the conditions of service and the question of exemptions and deferments to meet particular circumcalled up will be appropriately protected. I hasten to say that the introduction of selective compulsory service does not in any way detract from the importance of volunteers for the Regular Army, the Emergency Reserve or the Citizen Military Forces. On the contrary, we would wish the volunteer spirit, which has meant so much to Australia in the past, to continue. Both the Government and the nation would urge that as high a percentage as possible of those in our armed services should be those who, of their own choice, and in the spirit of a great national tradition, have Mr Clyde CameronI know one who dodged it in 1914. Mr Clyde Cameron -Well, 1915. bad habit, Clyde, and I advise you against it. Indeed, so far as the Regular Army is concerned, volunteers will continue to be of fundamental importance to the effectiveness of the force. Volunteers on longer terms of engagement will reach the highest standards of training and will give greater flexibility in the organisation and deployment of our forces. A selective service scheme does not give sufficient time to train highly qualified specialists and technicians and we must continue to look to volunteers to provide these. The Government has already reviewed and improved conditions of service to make a career in the Permanent Forces as attractive as possible. With this in mind and in the light of the strategic situation which I have outlined, we would ask the young men and women of Australia to consider carefully a permanent career in the armed forces.

It has a most important place in the full concept of our defence forces. The role of the Citizen Military Forces-to provide in war or defence emergency the follow-up forces and the expansion of our military effort-'remain s unchanged, and indeed assumes even greater importance following the passage of the legislation to make these forces available in a defence emergency. I seek the co-operation not only of our young men, but also of their employers and others to ensure that the Citizen Military Forces target of 35,000 is achieved over the period of the new defence programme. The detailed organisation of the Army will be further reviewed to provide for an expansion in the field force with particular emphasis on a substantial increase in the combat element and high priority logistic units. Two additional battalions will be raised making a total of six including the two battalions in our first two battle groups and the battalion already deployed in Malaysia. In addition, the organisation will provide adequate backing, not only to maintain and support the expanded field force, C.M.F. and cadets, but also to provide a sound basis for further expansion and mobilisation. There is, for a variety of good reasons, some concentration of military provision and organisation in the south-eastern areas of the continent. We feel, however, that, in the overall interests of rapid mobility, this should not be carried too far. We have, therefore, after careful consideration, decided that a new battle group will be established in north Queensland, probably in the Townsville area. The Special Air Service Regiment already established at Perth will be more than doubled in size to provide a head-quarters squadron and four squadrons. The Government has decided on a substantial change in the organisation of the Citizen Military Forces designed to create additional battalions, give greater flexibility and increased opportunities for service, particularly in country areas. The target strength for the cadets is being inequipment purchases. Expenditure will be creased from 40,000 to 45,000. In the 1963 Defence Review, I announced that it was intended to double as soon as possible the strength of the Pacific Islands Regiment, which at that time was of the order of 700, and I also indicated that further developments in relation to the force were under consideration. Recruitment to the P.I.R. has increased steadily, and the target strength we envisaged in our previous plans will be attained earlier than we had expected. In the present strategic situation the Government continues to attach high priority to the strengthening of the P.I.R. The detailed investigations have now been completed, and the Government will proceed with the plan to increase the force to three battalions and supporting units with a total strength approaching 3,500 by June 1968. Tenders closing on 30th November this year have been called for necessary Army works for Papua and New Guinea which could cost about £12 million. An honourable member opposite asked me today whether there was any difficulty about this, having regard to the fact that it was a Trust Territory. Part of the answer is that there is not. These include additional barrack buildings, workshops and engineering services, and housing for native married members of the force. The provision of equipment for the Army must match the improvements in the strength and availability of units. In the Defence Review 6f May 1963, expenditure on Army equipment was raised from the rate of £10 million per annum to the muoh higher level of £17.5 million. In the light of the deterioration of our strategic position there is a need to accelerate the rate of progress towards achievement of the approved objective of providing modern equipment for one division. Provision is also required for the expanded forces in Papua-New Guinea. Provision must be made for the replacement of out-moded equipment as new items become available from research and development for introduction into service. Sufficient additional equipment must be provided to ensure that C.M.F. training is realistic and effective. For all these purposes, and in line with the expansion in other elements of our defence preparations, the Government has approved a major acceleration in Army increased to £20 million in 1965-66-the first year of the new defence programme -to £25 million in the following year, and to £30 miHioo in 1967-68. The equipment to be purchased will include the whole range of modern conventional weapons, ammunition, vehicles, light aircraft, engineering and submarine role with the acquisition of 27 signals stores and so on. Items of new equipment which the Army is investigating include low level anti-aircraft weapons, air-portable armoured fighting vehicles, new artillery weapons, combat surveillance equipment and various other items. Emphasis will continue to be placed on air-portable equipment and those items which will improve Army mobility. The general effect of this approval is that as ithe strength of our forces is built up the weapons and equipment which they require, and of the most modern types, will be available to them. The increase in the Army strength from under 23,000 to some 37,500 by the end of 1966 means that accommodation for an additional 15,000 men has to be provided. This is additional to the large works programme for the Pacific Islands Regiment which I have already mentioned. This will mean a greatly increased Army works programme which will be carried out with the highest priority. I turn now to our proposals for an expanded Navy and Air Force as part of an overall programme for strengthening the Australian military effort. Before the defence review undertaken by Cabinet last week, the Naval programme provided for a Fleet comprising the following main units: One aircraft carrier, operating anti-submarine helicopters and also fixed wing aircraft for their remaining service life; two Daring class destroyers; three Charles F. Adams destroyers-D.D.G.'s ; six type-12 frigates; four Oberon class submarines; six ""Ton"" class minesweepers; one escort maintenance ship-bein g constructed in Australia; one fast transport; one fleet tanker; and one Battle class destroyer for use as a training ship. This programme involves the construction of ten new ships, including three Charles F. Adams destroyers which rank among the world's finest guided missile ships; four Oberon class submarines; and two type-12 anti-submarine frigates and an escort maintenance ship being constructed in our own shipyards in Australia. These additions in themselves would provide a significant increase in the capability of the R.A.N. to fulfil its increasing operational commitments. Careful consideration has been given to the future of the Fleet Air Arm which is a complex field of defence and could involve very large expenditures. HMAS. "" Melbourne"" was converted to the antimodern Wessex helicopters in 1963, and a number of Gannet and Sea Venom aircraft were also retained. A number of possibilities as to the continued operation of the ""Melbourne"" have been considered, having regard to the remaining life of the ship, the general cost of naval aviation, and other defence considerations. Tne Government has now made two important decisionsFirst, as the Gannet and Sea Venom aircraft are approaching the end of their service life and becoming difficult and uneconomical to maintain, it has been decided to replace these aircraft with 14 S2E Tracker anti-submarine aircraft. This aircraft, which is in service with the United States Navy-as members of the House who visited recently the US.S. "" Enterprise "" will recall-is a twin piston-engined aircraft with good endurance and well equipped for all-weather operations. The anti-submarine equipment it carries includes the latest electronic devices, and it also has the capacity for carrying a good weapon load. Its inclusion in the "" Melbourne's"" equipment will improve considerably the ship's anti-submarine capability. IfI remember accurately, the cost of this item is about £16 million or £17 million. Secondly, the Government has also approved an extensive modernisation of the "" Melbourne "" going much beyond that approved in the 1963 review. This modernisation will cost nearly £10 million. The main functions in which modernisation is required are the operation of antisubmarine aircraft in all weather by day and night; long range detection and height finding radar; improved close range air defence by mounting Seacat missile systems; and improved habitability. Those proposals will add substantially to the anti-submarine capability of the Royal Australian Navy. In the 1963 review the Government authorised modernisation of our Daring class destroyers directed mainly towards improving their anti-submarine capability. This plan has been reviewed in the light of the Navy's tactical requirements and the needs of our strategic situation. It has now been decided to modernise the Darings by providing them with lkara, which, as honourable members are already aware, is a guided anti-submarine weapons system developed in our own research and production establishments. The estimated cost of modernising the two Darings is in excess of £13 million. With a view to enhancing the Navy's mobility, a fast fleet replenishment ship with the FIIIA aircraft, which is expected to fly some provision for the carrying of oil fuel is to be acquired. It is expected that the ship will come into commission in 1970. The question of local construction-whic h we would prefer-o r purchase from overseas will be determined at a very early date. It has been decided to add two minesweepers to the present force of six vessels which were obtained in 1962. The additional minesweepers will be introduced into service in 1968. Concurrently with the planning of the expansion of the Pacific Islands Regiment, investigations have been proceeding into the formation of a coastal security force in Papua-New Guinea. It has now been decided that five patrol craft of a type suitby our professional military advisers on the able for local manning and maintenance will be obtained. These will contribute substantially to the general surveillance of the shores and rivers of the Territory. Nine all purpose patrol craft to replace vessels in use by the R.A.N., which are now approaching the end of their useful life, will also be this requirement is the C130E, a greatly obtained. These vessels will be suited for patrol duties such as those being carried out at the present moment by our minesweepers in Borneo waters. In addition to the above proposals, Cabinet has approved a wide range of naval projects designed to support objectives which have already been approved, including support facilities for the Charles F. Adams destroyers, a missile firing range, development of a submarine base and support facilities and provision for a submarine rescue vessel, replacement of harbour support craft and fleet boats, modernisation of Wesscx helicopters, and rehabilitation of Manus Island oil fuel installations. In recent defence programmes, the Government has approved the substantial re-armament of the fighter and strikereconnaissance elements of the RAAF. with modern aircraft of advanced performance. The order which has been placed for 100 Mirage supersonic fighter aircraft will provide for the re-equipment of the four Sabre fighter squadrons. Deliveries of these aircraft from local production to the RAAF. are continuing. The 24 FIIIA aircraft which have been ordered from the United States will add powerfully to the deterrent and strike capability of the RAAF. The Government is confident that before the end of this year, will amply fulfil its promise as an outstanding military aircraft. In this programme the Government has given particular attention to the transport, maritime and training requirements of the RAAF. and to the continued development of our airfields. The existing squadron of 12 Hercules C130A aircraft with which the RAAF. was equipped in 1958 has considerably improved the air strategic mobility of the Australian forces. The development of plans associated with our S.E.A.T.O. and other commitments has, however, shown clearly that our present air strategic movement facilities fall short of those required to meet likely military situations. A study strategic mobility requirements of the Australian services indicates that in addition to the aircraft which would be provided from civil resources, the services require an additional squadron of medium range transport aircraft. The aircraft selected to meet improved version of the C130A at present in service in the RAAF. For operational and maintenance purposes these aircraft are compatible with the C130A. They provide an increased strategic lift capacity and they possess the short field characteristics which enable them to carry out intra-theatre operations as well as inter-theatre tasks. .Approval has been given to acquire 12 C130E aircraft. This will mean an increase in the order of battle of the transport element of the RAAF. from two to three squadrons. The existing squadron of Hercules C130A aircraft will, of course, continue in service, together with the squadron of Caribou aircraft which has recently been acquired. The detachment of Caribou aircraft in South Vietnam has already given notable service in operations against the Communist Vietcong. The maritime element of the Royal Australian Air Force, working closely with the carrier "" Melbourne "" and with the escorts of the Royal Australian Navy, provides maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine protection for our forces. At present there are two maritime squadrons in the RAAF. No. 10 Squadron is equipped with Neptune SP2H aircraft embodying modern surface and underwater submarine detection equipment. No. 11 Squadron stationed at Richmond is, however, equipped with an older version of the Neptune aircraft, the P2E, containing submarine detection and tracking equipment, which is now coming to the end of its useful operational life. mobility of our forces. The continued It is accordingly necessary to re-equip this squadron so that it will be fully effective against modern submarines. It has been decided to re-arm the squadron in 1968 with Lockheed Orion aircraft which have outstanding performance in the location and destruction of enemy submairines. The Orion is the best maritime aircraft available in the world today. Ten of these aircraft will be obtained. The current flying training aircraft in the was approved in the last programme, is RAAF. are the Winjeel in the basic and the Vampire in the advanced stages. The introduction of high performance aircraft of the Mirage and FIIIA types will require new types of training aircraft and new techniques in training. In major air forces operating supersonic aircraft the use of a jet aircraft from tbe commencement of training has proved to be necessary to achieve the required standard quickly. The Government has accordingly approved the purchase of an all-through jet trainer of suitable performance to replace the Winjeel and the Vampire, thereby enabling the training organisation to advance in parallel with the re-equipment of operational squadrons. Seventy-five of the new aircraft will be obtained. At present navigators and signallers of the RAAF. are trained in Dakota aircraft modified in 1952 for this purpose. In a few more years these aircraft will be inadequate to train navigators and signallers, having regard to the latest training techniques, the type of training equipment required and the modern operational aircraft being obtained for the RAAF. The Government has approved the acquisition of eight replacement trainer aircraft of a suitable type. Experience gained by the members of the RAAF. Mirage instructional team in France, coupled with the experience of other air forces operating supersonic aircraft, indicates that a dual Mirage aircraft is necessary to provide safe, efficient and fast conversion of both experienced and less experienced pilots. The Government has approved the acquisition of ten dual Mirage aircraft. These will be additional to the 100 operational Mirage aircraft already on order. 1 have referred already fo the additional equipment which we are providing to improve the essential strategic and tactical development of airfields to permit the rapid deployment and effective operational use of our forces both strategically and tactically is a complementary measure to which the Government continues to attach the highest importance. In earlier years we have carried out an extensive programme of airfield works and development in such places as Darwin, Townsville, Amberley and Williamtown. The construction of a second airfield in the Northern Territory at Tindal, which proceeding satisfactorily and will be completed in 1966. Detailed investigations and technical planning for the new airfield at Boram near Wewak in New Guinea have now been completed and construction will proceed without delay. This airfield will be built to standards which will permit its use by all aircraft now in service or to be acquired by the RAAF. We have now approved the further development of airfields in New Guinea. The existing airfield at Nadzab will be rehabilitated and extended for ferrying purposes to standards permitting its use by Mirage and other aircraft. The airfield at Daru in the south west of Papua-New Guinea will be extended and developed and smaller airstrips between Daru and Boram will be brought to a higher standard. This will add to the flexibility of our forces and improve the effectiveness of the patrols now carried out by the Pacific Islands Regiment. On the mainland the existing airfield at Learmonth, near North West Cape, will be further developed by the provision of taxiways, hardstandings and other essential services. Improvements are also to be made to the airfield at Cocos to increase its capability. The Government has previously announced the acquisition of two new control and reporting units, one of which will be installed at Williamtown and one at Amberley. Both these equipments will be mobile. Provision is made in the new programme for the modernisation of the control and reporting unit already installed at Darwin. Adequate provision will be made for new capital construction and modernisation of existing facilities in our production and research establishment so that they may continue to meet the demands of our expanded forces. A major expansion'of the nature which I have outlined must inevitably bring a substantial increase in expenditure. Briefly, we estimate that defence votes in the three years of the programme will be: 1965-66, £370,000,000; 1966-67, £421,700,000; and 1967-68, £429,100,000. In our defence review of 22nd May 1963, we contemplated expenditure allotments as under£ra Navy A""-niy Ai Su >ly and 80.1 26.5 84.9 26.7 87.9 27.7 [her Departments 237.

We consider that they are warranted having regard to the situation which we now face. Although decisions which we have now Since May 1963 these allotments have been increased by Cabinet approvals of new projects, of which the main items arePurchase of 24 FIIIA strike-reconnaissance aircraft; construction of two additional frigates to replace HMAS. ""Voyager""; increased costs for the fleet fitting of Ikara; expansion of the Pacific Islands Regiment in Papua and New Guinea; replacement of VIP. aircraft; purchase of seven additional Caribou aircraft; a housing programme; and defence aid for Malaysia. The total estimated cost of these approvals is £118 million. In addition to these specific projects, 1963-64 1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 additional costs have also been incurred with the introduction of new Service pay £m £m £m £m scales, improved conditions of service, basic 53.3 54.3 63.3 65.2 59.7 wage increases and margins adjustments. 77.6 87.5 90.7 94.0 97.2 89.1 28.7 82.6 30.0 The addition of the expenditure flowing from all these decisions has involved an increase in the planning allotments of the 253.4 269.6 277.0 269.5 May 1963 review to the following1963-64 1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 (Actual) (Estimates) £m £m £m fm fm 55.6 69.2 80.1 81.3 76.9 79.0 94.2 106.5 109.4 111.2 89.2 90.0 99.6 108.1 105.3 29.3 33.0 34.0 33.2 34.6 7.4 10.4 10.2 9.0 9.8 260.5 296.8 330.4 341.0 337.8 made will mean an increased allocation over the three years commencing 1965-66 of some £212 million, we are certain that the people of Australia will also recognise the need for us to continue to maintain 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 adequate defence forces capable of meeting our obligations to make a great Aus£m £m tralian defence effort, and also those 105.3 138.0 98.5 150.1 obligations which we have assumed with 107.8 130.3 131.5 our allies. No one can doubt that the 38.4 39.0 39.1 increase in defence expenditure arising from 10.5 9.1 9.9 the decisions which I have announced, with their added demands for manpower and 421.7 429.1 material resources, will have very significant economic andfinancialeffects. In the present financial year, the direct budgetary effects will be limited. There will be a spurt between now and the end of the financial year in accommodation and other works expenditure necessary to the commencement of the selective service scheme in July. And here and there, there will be a need to make small initial payments this financial year towards new equipment which is the subject of the new three year programme. However, in 1965-66 and later years, the impact will be large. In the first place, it will present a formidable budgetary problem. On top of that, the additions to expenditure at home will add to the call on the resources of the economy, which are already under 6ome strain, and the additions to expenditure abroad will increase whatever drawings would otherwise be made on our external reserves. There are thus involved obvious problems for the national economy. These must and will be faced and solved. AllI need say at present is that, as a Government, we have acted under a sense of national duty. We believe that we will have wide public support in whatever tasks may lie ahead. I present the following paperDefence Review-Ministeria l November 1964and move That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Calwell) adjourned. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 29th October (vide page 2469), on motion by Mr Britain and be applied in Australia with McEwenThat the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, the Opposition does not intend to oppose the measure before the House which makes certain amendments to the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act. This is an act which has been in force now for some eight years and was passed in order to assist the sellers of goods in Australia to places overseas. The Export Payments Insurance Corporation was set up as a Government agency and in its eight years has established quite an estimable record of performances. According to the latest report which is available which is for the year ended June 1964, the corporation had in that period policies of a face value of about £64 million and it had 436 policies. To begin with, this indicates that the numbers availing themselves of this field of insurance are relatively scarce and in terms of Australia's export trade the field is still not as significant as it ought to be. I would draw the attention of honourable members to the circumstances of a similar body in Great Britain known as the Export Credits Guarantee Department, a similar Government undertaking. This Department has a longer history than ours and it is much more significant in the export trade of GTeat Britain than is the Export Payments Insurance Corporation in ours. Whereas the policies of the E.P.I.C. have a current value of some £63 million or £64 million the latest report that 1 have from the British body indicates that the face value of policies in Great Britain is in the region of £1,000 million, which represents something like one-quarter of the total export activity in Great Britain in a year. I would think, off hand, that £64 million would represent about one-sixteenth of the value of our annual export trade which Statement, 10th now is somewhere in the region of £1,000 million a year. To reach the relative performance of the British model we have quite a long way to go yet. We have proportionately to quadruple the activities of the E.P.I.C. for it to be as significant in the terms of export trade to Australia as the other body is to Great Britain. Whether the type of trade has been directly comparable is perhaps open to argument. Nevertheless, I think that some lessons can be learned from the experience of Great some value. In fact, the main amendment that is being encompassed in this particular legislation-wha t the Minister for Trade and most important of these amendmentswould provide the E.P.I.C. with the power to issue guarantees of payment to banks and other lending institutions, which provide finance for certain types of export transactions. Later in his speech the Minister stated that the British experience had provided the model which Australia has followed on this occasion. It seems that there are one or two other forms of activity in which the United Kingdom Department engages and in which we in Australia might engage with",40,Defence Review

112,Industry ( Mr Mcewen) Described As The,"some profit. I direct the attention of honourable members to the foUowing passage in a booklet about the Department, under the heading "" Financial Guarantees ""A special form of cover offered on the specific principle is the Financial Guarantee facility, already mentioned briefly. Such a guarantee is only suitable for extremely large development projects, costing several million pounds, usually in the maturing nations of Africa, the East, and South America. Since this type of guarantee involves special legal arrangements providing for a United Kingdom bank to make a loan to an overseas buyer to enable his United Kingdom supplier to be paid cash, a very great deal of expert negotiation is necess:try before these guarantees, which are in every respect tailor-rrmde arc complete. Since their introduction in 1961, many applications have been received for Financial Guarantees, and up to end of 1963 10 guarantees had been issued under which E.C.G.D. is guaranteeing a maximum loan value plus interest totalling £81.6 million. In addition, a further 61 cases involving a total contract value of £362 million had been approved in principle and were in various stages of negotiation amongst supplier, lender and borrower. Of course, both of those figures are sterling. When we get down to tin tacks in these It seems that the British people are apprised matters we realise that the poorer countries of the obligations which the developed can impove their positions relative to the countries have towards the undeveloped rest of the world only if systematic procountries. particular areas such as Africa, the East taken. It is in this respect that Australia still and South America. It is interesting lo look at the pattern of Australia's trade. The following table is contained in a document called "" Australia and the World Today "", which was issued by the Commonwealth Banking Corporation under the authority of the Chairman of the Commonwealth Board, Sir Warren McDonaldAverage of three years ended June. 1956 £ mill. Cent. United Kingdom European Community North America Japan Asia-excludin g Japan.. Middle East and Africa.. 79 19 10 2 Pacific Islands and New Zealand Central America Other 795 The significant point is the fall that has taken place, proportionately and to some extent also in aggregate, in our trade with what might be called our traditional markets, namely the United Kingdom and the countries of the European Economic Community. The other significant fact is the growth in our trade with North American countries-United States and Canada-and above all the growth in our trade with Japan. But where our trade figures are unspectacular and disappointing is in other parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand and South America. Those are all areas with which Australia ought to have better trade relations but in which one problem is still economic poverty and the other problem is that the populations are increasing more quickly than resources are being developed. In 1964 we hear a lot about the "" decade of development"" and the obligations that the wealthier nations have to the poorer nations. That document mentions grammes of capital development are underseems to be falling down on the job. What is being done in this amending legislation bridges, to some extent, some of the deficiencies that have existed in the past. But I suggest that, as the Government has chosen to copy the British model of what are called the guarantees of payment Banking Corporation to banks, it might also have a look at the financial guarantees which are aimed at assisting some of the undeveloped areas of the world. Insofar as we work within the machinery of these export credit organisa1963 tions, this assistance has to be given on the basis of trade as distinct from aid. Australia is a member of what is known as the Berne per £mill. per Union of export insurance organisations. Cent. Nevertheless, we ought to realise that we have significant social and economic obliga281 35 213 20 tions lo areas in our part of the world which Economic 177 22 166 16 economically are far less fortunate than 65 8 123 12 we are and whose position can be improved 67 8 174 17 157 41 15 4 only by systematic programmes of develop61 8 96 9 ment. and South5 1 7 1 This morning or yesterday morning I 41 6 64 6 read, as I suppose other honourable members 100 1,041 100 did, about the appalling situation that exists in India at the moment. Apparently, people are starving in the inner parts of that country because wheat cannot be unloaded at the wharfs. Surely, in a country with the great abundance of labour power that India obviously has, all that is needed is simple stevedoring equipment; and surely that is a situation in which a country like Australia can assist. I have believed for a good number of years now that Australia has to begin to diversify its economic pattern and has to be realistic about its obligations in this part of the world. Within the last few minutes we have listened to a statement suggesting what Australia's defence liabilities are likely to be in future. I believe that our defence liabilities will continue to increase unless we do something to remove this fundamental problem of inequalities between the haves and the have-nots. I hope that just as Australia seems to be becoming suddenly conscious of its defence problems it will also become more critically conscious of what its trade relations are with other parts of the world. I think the document from which I have already quoted .points to this sort of problem. I refer to ""Australia and the World Today"", published by the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, in whioh, in the section headed "" Finance "", the author points to inadequacies in the Australian financial setup and the sorts of deficiencies to which I have referred. The report statesWhile there are logical reasons from the insurer's viewpoint for limitation of cover to something less than the full value of contracts, this can reduce the attractiveness of the insurance cover as a prime security assignment to banks. It is relevant, perhaps, that this problem is overcome in the United Kingdom by the provision of unconditional guarantees to financing institutions. It seems that at last the Government has recognised what is stated in that extract, and the legislation now before the House does something to bridge the deficiency. For instance, the Bill will allow an exporter in Australia to engage in trying to sell his goods in certain areas, provided that the goods are specified as capital goods and the value of each individual contract is in excess of £100,000. The Bill specifies that it must be an individual contract and not a series of small contracts. Where there is a capital export of a value in excess of £100,000 the guarantee may extend over a period of several years. For most Australian industries the problem is that the exporter cannot always afford to wait three, four, or five years for progressive payments and sometimes somebody has to assist the seller in Australia financially until the buyer in the foreign country is able to make good his payments. In Britain there is another organisation altogether. Apart from the export payments scheme there is an export guarantee scheme which finances transactions of this kind. Perhaps Australia also should broaden its concepts in these directions. It seems that now, with one part of the world competing with the other in respect of undeveloped areas, the tendency is that, in order to have contracts fulfilled, it is necessary to offer longer and longer terms of credit. In the past Australia has been deficient in this respect because itsfinancialorganisation has not allowed the provision of long term credit in considerable' amounts for transactions of this kind. If, as some people envisage, we are to increase the volume of our exports within the next five to ten years by about another £300 millionI think the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann), who is ait the table, is well aware that that has to be the order of our performance in the years ahead-and if we are to continue to import consonant with our growth in population the volume of goods that we would like to have, there will have to be considerable increases in our total export trade. So far, the main burden of our increase in exports has been met by the primary producers and, I suggest, has been met with considerable success. Nevertheless, there is probably still a large potential in other parts of the world for Australia to develop its exports of manufactured goods. It is primarily for that sort of activity that organisations such as the Corporation are envisaged. It is a pretty futile exercise to sell wheat on long term credit. For the most part, payments for wheat must be made within a calendar year or not much beyond that time. However, if the payment is for earthmoving equipment or to provide the necessary capital assistance to build dams or railways, or to engage in large scale capital developments required to improve standards in the poorer countries which are our immediate neighbours, we are in a much more significant position to fulfil those needs than our present channels of credit so far provide. Whether the sorts of things that I have described ought to be done by expanding the Export Payments Insurance Corporation arrangement is probably a matter open lo debate because that was designed for a certain purpose. When the legislation establishing E.P.I.C. was before the Parliament in 1956 honourable members on this side of the chamber offered the criticism that its provisions did not go far enough, that the Corporation's initial capitalisation was not sufficient and that its overall maximum level of business as envisaged was not high enough. The measure now before the House represents the third or fourth set of amendments needed to increase the capital and increase the Corporation's powers of borrowing. It is worthy of commendation that the volume of business has risen over that period of less than 10 years from about £10 million to the present £64 million. The Minister said that the proposed amendments have been modelled on the British experience, but if honourable members compare the Australian example with that of the corresponding body in Great Britain, which now takes under its wings about one quarter of Britain's export trade, we are still a long way behind. Our total is of the order of one sixteenth. On occasions like this it is timely to conpeople in Australia we could achieve a lot template some of these problems, to realise lhat there may be deficiences in our financial machinery and to do something to try to bridge them. The Opposition supports the amendments proposed by the bill because they do something to fill a very necessary gap in the provision of credit for activities of the type to which I have referred. Nevertheless, there are still gaps, one of which 1 have already pointed to and which, in Britain, it has been sought to encompass within the field of export credit. 1 refer to the one described as the financial guarantee. I believe that Australia is well placed to assist countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and India in the provision of what, in economics, is sometimes called infrastructure. Someone in Australia was suggesting recently the formation of a cooperative company to produce fertilisers. It may well be that the export of fertilisers to India will, in the years ahead, be just as significant as the export of wheat is now. I believe that we must have sufficient vision to see far enough ahead in these matters. Yesterday I received from the Department of External Affairs a document containing a comprehensive statement on Australia's economic aid to other parts of the world. Although the aid given this year is commendable when compared with aid given in previous years we are still a long way off what has been described as our objective of providing aid to tbe extent of 1 per cent. of our gross national product. There is sometimes a fair amount of loose thinking as to how this 1 per cent, is to be achieved. If we extended aid equivalent to 1 per cent, of our gross national product, this would mean that, in terms of goods and services, whether capital or consumer goods, Australia would have to export another £40 million or £50 million a year. It would be a good thing for the economies of both the country receiving aid and the country giving it if there could be better integration of the needs of the developing areas in terms of the capacity of the more developed economics. When my colleague, the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), and I were in India recently, we both felt that if the right people in India talked to the right of useful economic development that would be advantageous to both countries. By"" the right people"" I mean those who are in charge of strategic sections of industry in India and comparable groups in Australia. I hope that, in the future, this sort of development may occur. We in Australia certainly have a better Trade Commissioner Service now than we had a few years ago, but our trade commissioners are still not numerous enough and often they are not sufficiently trained, in some respects, to deal adequately with these great problems that have to be faced in the next 10 years. I believe that peaceful co-operation represents a better pattern of world development than anything else and that trade and aid, with sensible industrial and financial integration, can do a lot to bridge the gap and solve problems of this kind. So we on this side of the House at least commend the Government for extending the scope of the export payments insurance scheme. We hope that, since the Government has looked at British experience, it will further examine the system of financial guarantees for what are really long term capital programmes. Under that system, which I described earlier, the recipient often is the government of the country concerned, whereas the provider here may still be a private enterprise of some kind. That is a development that is at least worthy of contemplation. I hope that the Government, having taken this step, will, in the months ahead, move in the direction that I have indicated and not wait for years to take action. Deputy Speaker, I do not think that I should let this measure pass without seeking further information from the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann), who is at the table. It must be admitted that this Bill is of substantial importance. The measure that originally constituted the Export Payments Insurance Corporation received ardent support and fulsome praise from the Opposition. Fortunately, this institution has been a great success. It is providing for the exporters of this country facilities which have not been in the past, and which are not likely to be in the future, business, too. As the balance sheets of provided by private enterprise insurance companies in Australia. Exporters have availed themselves of the facilities provided by the Corporation. At this stage, I ask the Minister: What profits, if any, have accrued to the Corporation, including both profits that have been transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and profits that, perhaps, have been absorbed into the capital structure of the Corporation? I consider that the country and the Parliament should have this information, and I believe that substantial profits have been made. I have not had time to give the Bill extensive study. It will extend the insurance cover that may be given to exporters. The Opposition supports this proposal. But I point out that the guarantor is really the taxpayers of Australia, acting through the Corporation and the banking system. Any exporter may receive a substantial insurance cover through the Corporation. He may then present his insurance document to a bank and, if the bank is willing, of course, obtain a further substantial advance from the bank. We on this side of the chamber do not disagree with that. The point that I want to emphasise is this: Private enterprise, on the one hand, is only too ready to avail itself of these facilities, which are annual report of the Export Payments backed by the taxpayers of Australia through the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the security of this great Commonwealth. I do not blame private enterprise for taking advantage of the facilities available. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, is ready-and rightly so-to provide these facilities. This being the case, why cannot the Government adopt a broad approach and adapt its policies so as to empower the Export Payments Insurance Corporation to undertake export insurance of every companies since this kind of business was first transacted between this country and another, well over 100 years ago? Export insurance on a safe basis has been conducted throughout the years by the great profit making insurance institutions of this country. Surely we in Australia have now reached a sufficiently advanced stage in economic thinking for the Government to be broad enough in its approach to allow the Corporation to engage in this kind of safe private enterprise insurance companies will show, they have taken no risk to speak of in extending insurance cover to safe exports. If it is good enough for private enterprise to have the advantage of this sort of business over a long period, especially since the Corporation has demonstrated that what used to be regarded as risky business can be undertaken with relative safety, surely it is now good enough for the Corporation to engage in the safe and mighty profitable business that is carried on by the private insurance companies that extend insurance cover to exports. If one examines the background of the private insurance companies that engage an this sort of business, it becomes perfectly obvious that the major shareholders and investors in these great insurance companies and corporations are resident in other parts of the world. Surely we have grown up enough, economically and politically, at this stage, to do something about that aspect of export insurance. I leave the matter there, and ask the Minister to give me any information he has on the subject. I shall thank him for it. My colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), has the latest Insurance Corporation in his hand. The Minister will confirm that this institution.",46,Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill 1964

Such a policy may be of a broad character and may be open to one interpretation by the Minister and an entirely different interpretation by the Corporation.

He gave the Bill his blessing, but suggested that we look at the possibility of expanding the activities of the the Minister cannot determine a policy Corporation. Obviously, the Government always has this possibility in mind and I assure the honourable member that, as we have expanded the activities of the Corporation with the introduction of this Bill, so we will continue to expand its activities when circumstances permit us to do so. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr moved forthwith. Pollard) referred to the accrued profits of the Corporation. I understood that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports gave a figure, but it is not the figure that has been given to me. Accrued profits, as distinct from capital funds, amount to £376,000. These are the accrued profits from premium and investment income. The honourable member is under a misapprehension in regard to the salaries provision. The salaries It may seem to be a Bill of minor importhat could be fixed by the Corporation for its employees were previously limited to £2,500. The Corporation can now offer a salary of £3,500 to anyone it employs without referring to higher authority. one receiving a salary of £2,500 could be given an increase of £1,000, does it not? member has suggested that the purpose of this provision is merely to increase salaries by £1,000, but it really means that employees in receipt of salaries of £3,500 or less are dealt with by the Corporation without any reference to the Minister.

Debate resumed from 29th October (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. measure now before the House provides for arrangements with the States and State meat authorities with respect to meat inspection. tance, but it is really of very substantial importance. Statistics are always tedious, perhaps, but I will give a few figures to show the magnitude of the subject with which we are dealing. For the year ended 30th June 1963, 41,700,000 cattle, sheep, lambs, pigs and livestock were slaughtered in Australia. We find that these slaughterings produced, in round figures, 1,500,000 tons of meat of which approximately 367,000 tons were exported to the world markets. In other words the cattle, sheep, pigs and other livestock slaughtered and exported in that year accounted for approximately 25 per cent, of the total slaughterings; the remaining 75 per cent, was for home consumption. That is the livestock or animal side of the story. It illustrates the magnitude of the subject matter of this Bill. As a people we believe in hygiene and for many years have realised that disease can ultimately lead to death-diseas e arising from a lack of hygiene. For many years the State Governments have in their respective legislative enactments provided for authorities to employ trained personnel to inspect slaughtered livestock to ensure that it is wholesome, free of disease and fit for human consumption. This has been a mighty wise precaution indeed. In some vise this type of work. In other States the",51,Destination Of Australia S Exports

In many instances State meat not be forced to become an officer of the inspectors were authorised by the Commonwealth authorities to inspect meat intended Commonwealth subject to the provisions of for export.

This is the situation a meat inspector of the Commonwealth. that has grown up, but it has been badly This is the position relating to permanent organised, has not been economic and has officers. By the same token, it becomes been wasteful in operation.

This is one side vides for an officer to make an election on a Officers of the Department of Primary Industry, under instructions from the Minister, have endeavoured to make arrangements better description since nowadays there is no such thing as a servant-of the respecIn order to give honourable members an prescribed form, and if the election is made within 21 days the officer is accepted into the Commonwealth Public Service. This all seems very simple, but it does not ensure that every meat inspector in South Australia will elect to come over to the Commonwealth Public Service. This has necessitated the inclusion in this Bill of a provision to enable those who elect to come into the Commonwealth Public Service to preserve their eligibility for accrued recreation leave up to 30 days and also their total credit of sick leave and furlough credits. This raises some problems. What happens to an officer who has more than 30 days accrued leave to his credit? The Bill provides that the superannuation rights of a State officer are to be merged into the provisions of the Commonwealth Superannuation Act, without loss of benefits to the officer, but it will not be easy to give effect to that provision. I understand that in South Australia some meat inspectors are not covered by superannuation but by a private insurance scheme. Where do they stand? There will be difficulties so far as the 700-odd Commonwealth meat inspectors are concerned. Take the case of, say, 20 meat inspectors from South Australia, enjoying certain leave rights and covered by a private insurance scheme, electing to come over to the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances of their employment in South Australia their travelling is confined to within the borders of that State, but when they come over to the Commonwealth they may be required to work part of the season at Gepps Cross in South Australia and part of the season in Townsville. These are men who, when they were working in South Australia, lived mostly in the vicinity of the meat works. Then we have the situation of a man in a small service of about 20 officers. He is fairly senior in rank. When he comes over to the Commonwealth he joins a service where there are 690 officers, about 100 of whom are temporary. Where do you fit him in? The same thing applies to temporary officers from South Australia or other States who may elect to join the Commonwealth service. Where do they fit in? If they fit in at all they are hedged in between the permanent Commonwealth meat inspector and the temporary employees. Does such a man head the list of temporaries and take precedence for the next appointment to a permanent position or does he go to the bottom of the seniority list for appointment as a permanent meat inspector in the Commonwealth service? Then there .is the problem of the men who work for a State abattoira semi-government institution who, before they became meat inspectors, worked for perhaps seven years in some other capacity in the abattoir. Suppose they then qualify to be meat inspectors. They have a total service with the abattoir of nine years. When they join the Commonwealth service are they given credit for their nine years service with the State abattoir or are they given credit for only two years service as meat inspectors? I hope that the Minister has the solution to the problems I have posed because the Opposition will not meekly allow the Bill to pass unless we have satisfactory assurances that justice will be done to these men. It is of no use the Minister saying that this legislation is essential because the American authorities require that the Commonwealth itself should be responsible for inspections. All that the Americans require is that inspections be carried out under the supervision and administration of Commonwealth authorities. Although the Commonwealth has reached agreement with South Australia for a uniform meat inspection service to meet the requirements of the American authorities, meat will continue to be exported to America from other States where no arrangements of this kind have so far been made. The only thing required will be that a veterinary officer will supervise a team of State meat inspectors. This will meet the requirements of the Americans. So the American export market as a motivating proposition for this measure is rather remote, although it is not unimportant. I make that point in case the argument is used as an excuse for this legislation, because such an argument will not hold water. It is true that it is better to have a uniform inspection service, but the Opposition will not easily let this measure through unless we receive assurances that the rights of the State officers will be protected, just as the rights of the 700-odd Commonwealth employees will be protected if there is an influx from South Australia of 30 or 40 men and 90 to 100 men from Victoria. This is a complex situation. The Minister may handle the problem by saying that it will be passed to the Public Service Board and that under the Public Service Act a man may appeal on his seniority listing. It is surely a strange and anomalous position to find in the Commonwealth service that of 690-odd men, 100 are temporary employees. That is a bad situation in all conscience. Why does the Public Service Board discriminate against these men because they are meat inspectors and outdoor workers while at the same time permitting clerical workers and men in other classifications to enter the service at an early age as permanent employees? There does not appear to be any answer to that. When I was a Minister the argument was used that exports might decline and you might have a surplus of officers on your hands. The obvious answer to that claim is that in a semi-developed country like Australia it is more likely that meat exports will increase. This has happened in the last 15 years. When1 was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture there were about 300 temporary meat inspectors in the Commonwealth service. I battled for about three months with the Public Service Board before it agreed to make 140 or 150 of those men permanent employees. I say these things not bitterly but in order to awaken the conscience of officers of the Department of Primary Industry. I know that the Minister is not supposed to attempt to influence the Public Service Board, but he can whisper a little and make so many inquiries that eventually the Public Service Board will decide that he is becoming a bit of a nuisance. It might feel inclined to yield a little. After all, treacle is always more effective than vinegar and if tbe Minister adopted that policy and carried it out courteously he might be successful in having another 60 or 70 of these temporary meat inspectors accepted as permanent officers. This would help overcome the absorption problem and might do much to assist in obtaining agreement to the adoption of this type of scheme by Western Australia, Queensland, and the other States. Those are the problems that I think should be tackled. After all, if a man is accepted as a permanent officer, he has some feeling of security and is more likely to establish a homeIt must not be forgotten that these P.13904/64 -sR -[100 ] men are engaged in work that requires a very high degree of integrity indeed. I have never yet heard of one meat inspector who has succumbed to corruption, and passed stock that should not have been passed. Because of that wonderful record I suggest that after having proved their trustworthiness, within 12 months or less they should be appointed as permanent officers. Finally, we of the Opposition wish this measure success but we want more assurances from the Minister as to what will happen to these 1,000 men before we will support it without asking for a division. The matters which I have raised are important. I suggest that it is not necessary to introduce this scheme in order to appease the Americans because they can be appeased by a continuation of some of the existing practices. If this step is necessary in the interests of economy, then it is also necessary that justice be done to the State and Commonwealth personnel involved. I leave it at that. We may discuss the matter further when the Bill is being considered in Committee. sure the House is indebted to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) for the historical and statistical background of the livestock slaughtering industry as related to both local and export markets. The Bill relates primarily to meat inspectors now working under the State authority in South Australia. These men are to be transferred to positions with the Department of Primary Industry as Commonwealth meat inspectors and are to have the right of entry to the Commonwealth Public Service as permanent officers. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) has pointed out that while this Bill has application to South Australia it is so designed as to enable other States to take action similar to that which has been taken by the South Australian Government and the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board in South Australia. One of the weaknesses of the scheme seems to me to lie in the fact that it poses questions as to the extent to which the claimed advantages will actually accrue in view of the fact that the proposal applies to only one State. It seems to me desirable that if the scheme is to be fully effective it should have Australia-wide application. The admission by the Minister that the Australian Agricultural Council has failed",52,Destination Of Australia S Exports
125,Mr Sexton (Adelaide) [10.2],"I amto find a solution to the problem is a matter for concern. Surely this body, which specialises in agricultural matters, should be their case and in seeking clarification of the able to evolve a plan or formula which could have general application to all States. No doubt problems relating to State rights and other related matters have played a considerable part in the failure to evolve a plan which is acceptable to all States. This Government must take some responsibility for the protracted discussions that have been going on for a number of years. Since 1961, I have been trying on behalf of the South Australian meat inspectors to get some clarification of what was intended in the proposed changeover and, in particular, to ensure that the rights and conditions of the inspectors who would be affected were safeguarded. I regret to say that the South Australian meat inspectors are not happy at this juncture, largely because they have been kept in ignorance as to what has been going on. Their attempts to get a clear picture of the proposed changeover have always been met with a promise to be consulted before finality was reached. Last week, Senator Drury and I were asked to receive a deputation from the meat inspectors who are still not satisfied. That deputation submitted its case in writing and supplemented it verbally. Its members claimed that they had tried during the past four years to obtain a clear picture of what was involved. The usual reply to their inquiries was that the matter was still under consideration and that they would be fully informed when finality was reached. That is why those State meat inspectors are still apprehensive about their position today. I would strongly urge the Minister to authorise the issuing of an explanatory document setting out tbe conditions of employment of State inspectors, together with those of Commonwealth inspectors, because Ifirmlybelieve that such a document, by enabling the State employees to study the overall position, would be of material assistance to them in arriving at a decision as to their future. The decision which they are required make is a most important one and it is our duty to make as much information possible available to them to assist them to arrive at a decision. Because of the widespread nature of their employment, meat inspectors are not as well organised as are the members of most trade unions. Consequently, they have to rely largely on the efforts of individual members in presenting many points involved. The Minister would be doing these men a signal service if he issued an explanatory document for the benefit of all inspectors. Such action would also do much to allay the fears now held by many inspectors, both State and Commonwealth. It is well known that there is a fear complex in the minds of the two classes of employees. The State officers fear the consequences of being integrated with the Commonwealth inspectors, and the Commonwealth inspectors fear the intrustion of State inspectors into their realm. Therefore I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to taking what steps he can to break down that unhappy feeling and to dissolve the fear complex amongst these men. It is probably that in most cases this fear is unjustified but, when the men do not know what the exact position is, it is only natural for them to have some fears of the consequences. It is not good for the industry that there should be disputation among the inspectors who carry a great responsibility in assisting to maintain good health in the community. I now wish to examine some of the objections and fears in the minds of inspectors employed at the Gepps Cross Metropolitan Abattoir in South Australia. In a letter written to me on behalf of the meat inspectors, this statement is madeAbout two months ago we met a Committee from the Abattoir Board and asked them to give us in writing the text of this transfer as well as requesting a written reply re our service, superannuation, accumulated sick leave, accrued sick leave, etc. but no reply as yet. In those circumstances, the apprehension felt by these people is understandable. They say that one of their objections is that they could be sent on temporary transfer at very short notice to any part of the Commonwealth to work. They say that they object to that part strongly because they have their homes established near their places of employment and many of them have other commitments in varying degrees. I discussed that very point with officers of the Department as far back as some time prior to September 1961. As a result of that discussion, I wrote to the representative of the meat inspectors in South Australia on 1st September 1961. Amongst other things, I saidThe Commonwealth employees would have the annuation schemes it would be far too costly, right to volunteer for seasonal employment in especially for the inspector over 45 years of age, other States and in the event of non-sufficient it could cost them something like £5 or £6 per volunteers some employees may be required to week, or we would have to let our present scheme go interstate for these seasonal duties involving lapse. export killings, &c.

Example, if an inspector should after one month's They have raised other matters. There is, Minister could give some assurances with regard to promotion. Perhaps he can tell Australian inspectors entertain certain fears, and I suppose the present Commonwealth employees do too, in respect of seniority. If the Minister can give us some assurance in this connection it would be appreciated. The men also refer to overtime. At present they are paid double time for all overtime worked. When they join the Department of Primary Industry they will have to go back to time and a half for the first three hours, with double time thereafter. This is one of the ""minuses"" that the present State employees will have to endure after they transfer. Another question has been asked concerning permanent employment. I think this is provided for in the Bill, and I think that the Minister also indicated that permanency will be transferred intact when the men join the Federal organisation. I want to raise one other matter concerning an individual inspector. In his case this matter and has discussed it with me on a most unfortunate set of circumstances has arisen. I refer to the Assistant Chief Inmeat inspectors is natural. The honourable spector in South Australia. Normally the Assistant Chief Inspector is promoted to the position of Chief Inspector when the person holding that position retires. The Chief Inspector in South Australia should have retired 15 to 18 months ago, but because of the impending changeover the Abattoirs Board kept him in office beyond his normal retiring date, thus depriving the Assistant Chief Inspector of his promotion. Where will this man fit into the new scheme of things? He has lost his opportunity in South Australia of becoming the Chief Inspector. This was no fault of his own, and he was simply a victim of circumstances arising from the impending changeover. The delay in thefinalisationof the changeover will mean a possible huge financial loss in the case of this officer. The difference between his present salary and that of the Chief Inspector would amount to £7,000 or £8,000 over the remainder of his working life, a period of about 14 years. I hope the Department will look at the position of this officer and see How would you maintain that seniority in whether it can mete out some justice to him. At present he appears to have a forlorn future. No doubt the circumstances are unfortunate, but they have arisen and the problem must be resolved. I ask the Minister and the Department to see whether they can place this man in a position similar to the one which he should now be enjoying. Those are my observations on behalf of the South Australian meat inspectors. They are not adopting a negative attitude in this matter, but simply want to have justice done. They have asked us to make representations through the proper channels. I appeal to the Minister to consider the points I have raised and see whether the men's requirements can be fully met. If they can be fully met I am sure that the South Australian meat inspectors will be happy with the changeover as outlined in the Bill. Primary Industry) [10.19] -in replyI appreciate the tone of the debate, which has centred on a genuine inquiry into conditions. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Sexton) has always shown interest in previous occasions. His concern for the member has indicated-and I repeat itthat all State inspectors transferred from either the Department of Agriculture or from the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board will be transferred as permanent employees in the Public Service. Secondly, those people carry their seniority with them. Regarding the individual case mentioned, I cannot say that I can do anything particularly for that person. However, I do want to say this: I cannot see any State transferee being penalised because there is a significant rise in salary for every State inspector who transfers to the Commonwealth. The difference in salary is quite significant. be as good. meat inspector is maintained. had certain seniority with the State service. the more heavily staffed Commonwealth service without detriment to Commonwealth officers? that there is no surplus of inspectors.

130,Mr Adermann,"Al l I can say isleaves room for the man entitled to promotion to be so promoted. There should be no danger of tbe man being penalised. I will try to answer the questions that have been put to me by honourable members. The total service of the inspector transferred is taken into consideration in regard to his furlough and long service leave. Commonwealth officers can accumulate only 30 days' recreation leave under the Public Service Act and I take it that this will apply to State inspectors who transfer. Should there be any State inspectors with leave credits over 30 days surely that will be adjusted by the State before they transfer. That would be a fair expectation and I think that would be done. Inspectors who are in an insurance fund must, if they come to the Commonwealth, join the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. If those inspectors who are employees of the M.E.A.B. contribute to a private fund, that will not be taken over. I do not want to mislead honourable members on that point. Those inspectors will need to come into the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund as they transfer. The inspectors at present employed has risen to 717. It was not very long ago that honourable ditions that go with Commonwealth service members probably heard me say publicly that I had about 560 inspectors in my Department. The number has risen rapidly because of the need for a greater number of inspectors as meat has been exported in boned out form instead of carcass form. This requires more inspection and hence we have had to enlarge the number of the inspectors. Of course there has been a gradual increase, year by year, in the tonnage of meat made available for both export and home consumption. All the South Australian inspectors transferring to the Commonwealth will be permanent officers. temporary employees to transfer? them all over-thos e now being employed by the Department of Agriculture and the M.E.A.B. Out of the 717 inspectors in the Commonwealth now there are at present 300 temporary employees but the inspectors have a case before the Public Service Board at present seeking a greater percentage of employees. What the honourable member must remember is that a lot of these men have joined quite recently as there has been a rapid increase in the staff. My advice is that all South Australian inspectors in both the Department of Agriculture and the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board will be taken over as permanent employees. South Australian inspectors work under a condition that they be paid for sick leave not taken up to a specified amount. No such scheme applies in the Commonwealth. Inspectors with the M.E.A.B. have an insurance policy instead of a superannuation scheme. I explained that point. We have no control over that situation. I think that is the only point mentioned by Opposition speakers in respect of which we cannot accommodate them. So far as transfers are concerned, if the State inspectors become Commonwealth inspectors they must, of course, accept transfers the same as any other Commonwealth inspector. I would say that a human approach is adopted to these things and it is necessarily an economic one. You do not pay for the transfer of an inspector when his services can be used at home. He is left at home. That is the obvious approach number of Commonwealth to these things. However, if an inspector accepts the increased salary and the conthen he must expect to take transfers as any other Commonwealth inspector does. I hope that this will prove a successful experiment because it is the first experiment. The Government will take particular notice of it. If any anomalies are revealed I will certainly look into the matter and try to correct them. be coming over from South Australia? inspectors coming from the Department of Agriculture and 25 from the M.E.A.B -2 8 in all. My Department is happy to get them. We are actually short of inspectors. Referring to Tasmania, we have not this same type of agreement with that State. The Commonwealth does all the inspection there. Tasmania has no inspectors of its own but pays the Commonwealth for any work that affects the domestic market, as, of course, the Commonwealth will be paid tor domestic inspection in this case.

134,Mr Adermann,"There are threewhen discussing this Bill. I have tried lo answer the queries put to me and I assure honourable members that, to my mind, the State inspectors will benefit if they choose to transfer to the Commonwealth. It is their choice of course. If they choose to transfer they will receive a significant rise in salary, their rights and seniority will be protected and they will be taken over as permanent public servants. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee. Clauses1 to 5-by leave-take n together, ter can give a satisfactory answer to it. l t and agreed to. Clause6 agreed to.

Does that mean that a South Australian meat inspector is certain to be appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service? If an inspector elects to transfer to the Commonwealth Service, the Minister for Primary Industry or the chief veterinary officer who is administering the legislation may determine that that inspector will be accepted. Once an inspector makes that election, is Commonwealth officer who may be hurt? he sure to be accepted? assurance publicly. Clause agreed to. Clause8 agreed to. Clause9 (Accrued recreation and sick leave). may not be the appropriate clause under that. which to raise this matter, but it will do. The Minister, in the course of his speech in say. reply to the second reading debate, referred to South Australian officers transferring to the Commonwealth Service and preserving assume that a very senior officer in South their seniority. His statement does not quite satisfy me that substantial damage could not be done to a Commonwealth meat inspector. The Minister said that if a very senior officer transfers from the South Australian Service to the Commonwealth Service his seniority will be preserved. What does that mean exactly? Will he be given seniority in the Commonwealth Service exactly relative to the seniority that he had in the South Australian Service? If he is given that seniority, how is injury to an officer in a corresponding position in the Commonwealth Service to be avoided? That is the question that I pose. I hope that the Miniscould apply to officers right down the line. Primary Industry) [10.32] -The number of inspectors to be transferred is not so great that very much damage could be done. I explained to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) before that the service as a meat inspector will be taken into conState and Commonwealth inspectors have equal seniority, they may not all be wanted or it may be necessary to transfer one of the position concerned. That is only natural. We could not have a surplus of senior men. AllI can do is repeat that an inspector's seniority as a meat inspector is preserved and, if a State inspector with a certain seniority chooses to transfer to the Commonwealth Service, he will enter the Commonwealth Service at an increased salary. able member that it will.

What happens when he gets into the Commonwealth Service? Does he go into the No. 3 position in that Service? I i he does, he may do a substantial injury to somebody who is already in the Commonwealth Service. That is the point that I would like to have clarified. that the Minister, in the remarks that he made a few moments ago, implied that if the No. 3 inspector in the South Australian Service transferred to the Commonwealth Service and clashed with the No. 3 inspector in the Commonwealth Service, and if one job was available in Melbourne and another job was available in Sydney, one inspector might be appointed to the job in Sydney and the other appointed to the job in Melbourne. Is that the implication in the honourable members who have received remarks that the Minister made? Primary Industry) [10.36] -The informaable members from South Australia tion supplied to me is a repetition of what have a close interest in and knowledge I have already told honourable members. In of this matter-that the South Australian terms of length of service as a meat inspectors, whom this legislation affects inspector in the State Service, the inspector's directly, and inspectors in other States, who seniority is provided for and protected. The could come under this legislation eventually number of inspectors who have been if their respective State Governments agree, employed in South Australia by the Comhave a big decision to make.

I again give an assurance that tunity by letter, as I understand the Bill proseniority as a meat inspector will be provides, to elect to become a member of the tected in the Commonwealth Service if men Commonwealth Public Service, will the desire to transfer. Clause9 deals with accrued recreation and Service in which he now serves as a permasick leave. I want to know from the Minister nent or a temporary officer with conditions whether the South Australian Government in the Commonwealth Public Service, which has given an assurance that persons who elect to transfer to the Commonwealth Service and who have to their credit accrued recreation leave in excess of 30 days will receive their recreation leave prior to their transfer or will receive payment in lieu of that leave. That is one question that 1 would like to have answered. I realise that this matter does not come within the Minister's jurisdiction because obviously the officers will not come under his jurisdiction until they become members of the Commonwealth Public Service and he would not have control over anything that happened prior to that time. However, I would like to know whether the South Australian Government has given an assurance that officers who transfer will not lose their accrued recreation and sick leave. It is quite apparent to me and to all other representations on this matterI know that the honourable member for Adeis in his forties or even in his fifties.

151,Mr Beaton (Bendigo) [10.37],"he will join as either a permanent or a temporary officer? I believe that it is most important that in the few weeks that the meat inspector has in which to decide he be given every opportunity to weigh the pros and cons of joining the Commonwealth Public Service. I ask that the matter be cleared up for the inspectors in the two ways that I have suggested. It is most important that this information Initially be conveyed to the meat inspectors privately so that there will be no discord or trouble among them. If the transfer in South Australia proceeds smoothly it could have an effect on the transition in other States. Information could be provided to meat inspectors by making available to them a Commonwealth officer who could explain the conditions of service. Alternatively, he could provide that information to the meat inspectors' associations. 1 believe that if a clear statement comparing conditions in the State and Commonwealth Public Services were made available to the individuals it would clear the way for them to make the very important decisions that they have to make. make the point that has been raised by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr to their service. Some may have been in Beaton), but I believe that the Minister was conferring with one of his officers when 1 began my remarks on that point, and may have missed what 1 said. I do not think he replied to the point in answering the other matters that I raised. Primary Industry) [10.43] I thought I had answered the point earlier. The full details of all the arrangements of transfer have been made available to the Department of Agriculture in South Australia for the benefit of all meat inspectors. A representative of the Commonwealth Meat Inspectors Association stated in a letter dated 26th July 1962 that, as a result of a meeting of the Association, the Association had agreed to the arrangement. In his letter he referred to the meeting and saidI have been empowered to accept the package deal on behalf of my associationThat is the Commonwealth Associationnamely, M.E.A.B./State inspectors having their seniority assessed from the time they were appointed as meat inspectors only, and tlie members of my association to be given permanencies equivalent in number to the number of M.E.A.B./State inspectors being taken over by the Department of Primary Industry. All the details have been given to the State Department of Agriculture, but in addition all the information will be contained in the Act. The rights of the inspectors will be protected. I can say no more than that. If the inspectors choose to join the Commonwealth Public Service their recreation leave will be protected to the extent of 30 days, because that is the maximum amount of leave that Commonwealth inspectors may accrue. We expect that the officers will have been paid by the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board or the State Department of Agriculture for any additional leave that they have accrued. It is only right that the leave should be paid for by those bodies. The Commonwealth will accept no responsibility for leave in excess of 30 days. agreed to pay it? still want to make the point that many people are involved. They are individuals who have different circumstances applying the industry for only two or three years, but others may have been meat inspectors for 20 years. Their ages would differ and they would have a big problem in deciding whether or not they should transfer to the Commonwealth Public Service. I believe that it would help considerably if an officer of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry were to visit South Australia and were available to inform the meat inspectors. An inspector would be able to say to that officer: ""These are my circumstances. I have been a meat inspector for 20 years. I have paid so much in superannuation and have accumulated so much leave. What would I be paid by the Commonwealth, what are the rates for overtime, and what are the conditions of service if I do transfer? "" There is nothing like being able to obtain such information personally. The Minister says that the information will be contained in the Act, but an act does not mean very much to people outside.

Again the gross revenue of the four stations in Sydney and Melbourne rose to about £11.2 million in 1962-63 with profits, before tax and licence fees, of £2.3 million approximately, representing an overall profit margin of 20 per cent. The overall return on issued capital of these four stations,, before tax and licence fees, was of the order of 48 per cent, while, after tax and licence fees, it was of the order of 28 per cent.

As I have said, despite the spectacular increase in the earnings of commercial television stations, the licence fees have remained unchanged.

173,Mr Allan Fraser,"I repeat whatmillion is that the country stations, all of which have revenue of less than £1 million, are all at present still losing money. I think and abilities that they possess. I could name that last year they lost a total of £450,000 or thereabouts. While their prospects are improving, they are not at present receiving great benefits from their possession of licences. When their revenues and profits increase, they will go into the higher category and will have to pay the higher licence fee. At present, we feel that they should be encouraged, while they are making losses, to plough back into the provision of services and programmes the maximum amount of money available to them. There is no reason, therefore, why the Government should seek a larger contribution from them. In fact, the independent television stations in country centres throughout Australia deserve every protection and assistance that this country can give them against the television monopolists who are so powerful in the capital cities and who are so eager and ready to stretch out their hands and grasp control of further television stations. I am dealing almost entirely with television stations because although the position of broadcasting stations is similar, their increase in profit rate has not been nearly so great. I think that in 1956 the profits of all commercial broadcasting stations totalled £7,500,000 and today they are about £12 million. I think that only one or two commercial broadcasting stations will have to pay an increased licence fee under this legislation. The revenue of individual broadcasting stations does not reach into the higher brackets that the television stations have attained. The second part of the Opposition's amendment deserves the utmost support from the House; I am sure it has the utmost support of the Australian public. This is the proposal by the Opposition that provision should be made to pay all the revenue from the licence fees into a special fund and to use it solely to assist the production of Australian television programmes. Australian dramatists, authors, actors, dancers, musicians and artists of all kinds deserve and need ample opportunity to develop and exercise their own talents in their own country. At present many of them are being deprived of that opportunity. Names would spring to the mind of every honourable member of distinguished men and women in these fields who have been compelled to go abroad in order to receive a satisfactory return for the talents many of them. We need such people as much as they need us. They are part of the nation and no nation is complete without them. In fact, we are not a nation, unless we have sufficient of these people and unless they have, inside our territory, the full opportunity to develop their talents. They are certainly not attaining their proper place today in Australian television. Similarly, every country needs its own film industry and practically every civilised country in the world has recognised the need to have a film industry of its own and has taken steps to assist and encourage such an industry. Australia is no exception in needing a film industry, but Australia is an exception in that it has no film industry today except a film industry which makes a few advertising programmes and a few documentaries. Its film industry has been crippled by imports, and the Government does nothing to remedy the position. The question is largely financial. Other factors enter into it, but we will not be able to have a satisfactory film industry in Australia without assistance to enable the industry to overcome the tremendous handicaps it suffers at present from the import of films which have already paid all of their costs in other countries and which can be sold to this country at a cheap price. We should look around to see what other countries are doing to promote their own cultural, artistic and dramatic expression, and we should do the same. At present there is a requirement by the Minister that television stations should provide 45 per cent, of Australian content in their programmes. Tell us about it. but I am dealing with a bill relating to commercial television stations and I had better get on with my discussion of it. I could say a lot of things about the A.B.C. and I will be delighted to have an opportunity of saying them in the House later, because my comments will be strongly critical. On the matter of Australian programmes it is unfortunate that while the majority of the commercial television",65,Television Stations Licence

I quote a sentence or two from the Broadcasting Control Board's report where, referring to the Australian programming by commercial stations, in paragraph 212 at page 69, the following appearsThe Board is not yet convinced that the basis Of calculating the amount of Australian programmes is completely satisfactory. When the current definition of an Australian programme, for Statistical purposes, was adopted in 1957 . . . there Was good reason for accepting, as Australian, all programmes which involved the use of the station's cameras either in the studios or at outside broadcasts, as well as programmes specially made in The Committee mentioned a series of deAustralia for the station's use. At that time the tailed considerations for overcoming these creation of programmes was a novel procedure, disadvantages. It dealt also with the position whatever form they might take.

In this respect I think the Minister might very well have another look at the way in which he is trying to close the loopholes that exist in the present legislation. ber want to re-open it? think this Is a very serious matter, but I may be mistaken in my interpretation of what this means.

Sitting suspended from 11.30 p.m. to 12 midnight. ' Wednesday, 11th November 1964. seconded? second the amendment. Its intention is to ensure that something is done to increase the employment of Australian artists and expand (be Australian content of television programmes. This topic has been discussed in this House on a number of occasions. We of the Opposition take this opportunity to seek to amend the Bill to provide that a fund to assist in the production of Australian television programmes shall be established from moneys to be obtained by increasing the licence fees paid by commercial television stations. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board has emphasised in a number of its reports that it is dissatisfied with the Ausgrammes of the two Sydney stations as 38 tralian content of programmes. As far back as 1958, the Board laid down in its 10th annual report the standard for determining what was an Australian programme. Stated shortly, the Board said that such a programme was one for the production of which the cameras of the television stations were used. On page 37 of that report, the Board statedThe proportion of AustraUan programmes is illustrated in the accompanying graph which covers the period from June 19S7 to June 1958. It also stated that the amount of Australian material being used was still very substantial. Perusal of the graph disclosed that the Australian content of the programmes of Station ATN in Sydney was 68 per cent, in about June 1957. That percentage was maintained until about September 1957. By December of that year the Australian content had dropped suddenly to 50 per cent. It decreased gradually to June 1958. and then took a sudden drop to about 43 per cent, by September 1958. The Australian content of the programmes of the other Sydney station-TCN-wa s about 45 per cent, in June 1957. By September, it had increased to 52 per cent, but it dropped suddenly to 38 per cent, in March 1958. In September 1958 it was still at about the same level. The report also discloses that in a sample week taken in the winter of 1958, the proportion of items of Australian origin on the Sydney stations was 41.18 per cent, and on the Melbourne stations 42.43 per cent. ber is assisting me considerably with the point I am about to make. That was six, years ago, and the percentage is still the same. The point we are trying to establish is that in the initial stages the Australian content of programmes was much higher than it is now. By September 1958, the proportion of items of Australian origin had dropped back to about 42 per cent, both on the Sydney stations and the Melbourne stations, and it is still at about that level. It its 15th annual report the Board sets our a table showing the programmes of Australian origin on commercial stations for the year 1962-63. That table states the proportion of Australian content of the proper cent, for ATN and 39 per cent, for TON.

183,Mr Stewart,"The honourable memprogrammes at least one hour per week in peak viewing periods. When we look at the sixteenth annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for the year ending 30th June 1964, we find again, that the Board speaks about the need to increase the Australian content of programmes. In September 1963 the Minister told the stations that they were to increase their Australian content from 40 per cent, to 45 per cent, and they were to televise two hours of Australian programmes in the peak period from 7.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. When we turn to the table on page 68 of the Board's report we find that no fewer than five stations-AT N Sydney, TCN Sydney, GTV Melbourne, QTQ Brisbane and TVW Perth-faile d to act on the instruction, or the request, of the Minister to televise two hours of Australian programmes in the peak viewing period. In its report the Board saidFive stations failed to comply with the Minister's requirement to televise at least two hours of distinctively Australian programmes in the peak viewing period between 7.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. This has been taken up with each of the stations concerned, l t is a matter of some concern to the Board, especially in view of the discussions to which reference is made in the next two paragraphs. But that is all the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, and apparently the Minister, intends to do about the infringement of the instructions that have been issued to the television stations. Certainly a little bit further on in its report, on page 69, the Board again referred to the matter. The passage has already been quoted by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr programmes of Australian origin. It shows Allan Fraser) so I will not quote it again. The Board suggested that it is now time that the stations had a look at the standards they use to judge the Australian television content of their programmes. But surely all of the commercial television stations have had ample opportunity, since they commenced in 1956, to increase the Australian content of their programmes. They have failed to do so for a large number of reasons. Amongst these is the fact that they would lose some of their profit if they were to spend it on the production of Australian programmes. In the same report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board there is a table at page 103 headed ""Television Programmes of Australian Origin-Analysis by Categories Metropolitan Stations (52 weeks) and Country Commercial Stations (13 weeks)"". The table shows the following positionMetropolitan Commercial Programme Category. Stations. Per cent. DramaSerious .. ,. 0.0 Adventure . .

If he cares to get a copy of this report he can see them for himself. Page 103 of the sixteenth annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board gives a table showing the proportion of viewing time devoted to that in the case of, for instance, serious drama, while the commercial stations devote no time at all to Australian programmes in this category, the A.B.C. stations devote .4 per cent, of viewing time to such programmes. For domestic and comedy drama the figure for commercial stations is .4 per cent., while for A.B.C. stations it is 1.1 per cent. Then if we look at current affairs, for instance, we find that the A.B.C. stations give 2 per cent, of viewing time to Australian activities under this heading. They give 4.1 per cent, to religious matter and 4.7 per cent, to social and controversial matter. In all these categories the A.B.C. stations devote a good deal more time to Australian programmes than the commercial stations do.",69,Television Stations Licence

The A.B.C. is left to carry the burden of Australian presentation in all these categories because in respect of at least some categories of programmes the viewing public generally prefer the imported programmes from the United States or the United Kingdom. member is answering his own argument. tralian Broadcasting Commission is prepared to encourage Australian artists, writers and producers, in order to help in developing some sort of a film and television industry in Australia. I can quite appreciate the outlook of members of the Country Party. They get up in this House and talk about Communism and about not recognising Red China, but when it comes to selling their wheat they are prepared to sell their principles down the river. When the defence estimates or defence bills are being debated the members of the Country Party say that Australia needs to be defended. They tell us about the dreadful menace of Communism at our very door. But when it comes to selling Australian primary products they will sell them to anybody on any terms and on any conditions. Their attitude is likewise reflected in their comments about the development of an Australian television industry and employment opportunities for artists, writers and producers. It does not surprise me at all to hear members of the Country Party interjecting and asking what the Australian Broadcasting Commission does, and suggesting that the programmes that are shown with Australian content are not up to the standard of United States or British programmes. The film and television industries in those countries have been in existence for a much longer time than those in Australia. You must craw] before you can walk. I think it is up to commercial stations, and it is up to every member in this House, to give encouragement to our Australian industry even though the programmes on occasions might be a little inferior to imported programmes. There are other comments in the report of the Board dealing with commercial stations that I think should be stressed tonight. 1 refer, for instance, to the volume of advertising on commercial stations, which is supposed to be restricted within limits laid down by the Board. By various devices and subterfuges many of the commercial stations are flouting the standards that have been laid down. A station might put on three spot advertisements one after the other and then break in with a station identification followed by another couple of advertisements. It might give two spot advertisements and then show a long trailer of one of its forthcoming programmes, followed immediately by a couple of advertisements. I know that this is strictly within the standards laid down. Station identifications and trailers of coming programmes are not regarded as advertisements, but the stations adopt these devices simply to increase the volume of their advertising. On page 70 of the report from which I have been quoting there is a table headed "" Percentage of Time Occupied by Advertisements in an Average Week"". Figures are given for 1963 and 1964. A break-up is given for the various days of the week, and the table shows that the proportion of time taken up by advertisements on Sunday was 10.3 per cent, in 1963 and 9 per cent, in 1964. Thefiguresfor Friday are given, showing 8.9 per cent, in 1963 and 8.1 per cent, in 1964. The percentage of time occupied by advertisements in an average week in 1963 was 9.1 and in 1964 it was 8.9. One might say that there is a decline in the amount of advertising that is appearing on television, but if one looks at a further table on page 72 of the report onefindsthat that is not the case. The table shows the weekly hours of transmission to the nearest quarter hour. I refer to only a few stations. The weekly hours of transmission for ATN Sydney for the quarter ended March 1964 were 92i hours, and 72 hours for the quarter ended June 1964. For TCN Sydney the weekly hours of transmission for the quarter ended March 1964 were 85i, and 73 for the quarter ended June 1964. For ADS Adelaide, in the quarter ended March 1964, the weekly hours of transmission were 76, and they were 60i for the quarter ended June 1964. For TVW Perth the weekly hours of transmission were 78i for the quarter ended March 1964 and 69 for the quarter ended June 1964.

189,Mr Stewart,"A t least the Ausquarterly periods shows that they are not year, that is an investment that the Minister nearly as good as they might be. I feel that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board should have a look at the bitter and continuous complaints that are made, not only by members in this House, but by people outside, about the interruptions to programmes by advertisements. I understand that later in this debate the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will move an amendment to obtain stricter policing of certain television advertisements. I wonder whether the fact is that the commercial television stations are now so powerful that they can almost tell the Government what to do. As an example, I refer to the request of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) to be granted time on commercial television stations in order to give what he calls a "" report to the nation "". It would have been, undoubtedly, the opening speech in the forthcoming Senate election campaign. It is not yet known whether or not the commercial television stations intend to give the time. Apparently some are kicking over the traces. I wonder whether they are kicking over the traces and refusing to give the time-unles s it is paid for-becaus e they want to show the Government that if television licence fees are increased they will take retalitory action against it; or is it because if the Prime Minister is given time on the commercial television stations they will have to give some time to the Opposition in order that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) can give his report to the nation and make his criticisms of the Government policy? I feel that the Postmaster-General, his predecessor and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board have all along been much too lenient with the commercial television stations. For far too long have television station licence fees remained at too low a level. I, at least, congratulate the Minister for raising the licence fees for commercial television stations. I still feel that this is not grammes, let alone those of commercial nearly sufficient. The Minister referred in his second reading speech to tbe turnover of capital and the gross profit on capital of the commercial television stations. As an accountant he would know that commercial television is a worthwhile investment. If a person can receive between 20 per cent, and 28 per cent, net profit on his turnover per wouid advise any of his clients to make. There is no reason why the Government should allow this state of affairs to continue. There is certainly no reason why the commercial television stations should be allowed to use imported programmes and not give encouragement to the Australian artists, writers and producers. The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro deserves the consideration of the Minister and of the House. Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to make one further comment. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is criticised fairly regularly for the fact that it presents controversial programmes, generally on ""Four Corners "". Criticism is directed at the Commission by members of the Government if they happen to believe that a programme is slanted against them, by members of the Opposition if they believe it is slanted against them, by the people associated with the Australian Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament if they believe it is slanted against them, or by members of the Returned Servicemen's League if they believe it is slanted against them. The Commission is inclined to listen to this criticism and to make staff movements and alterations in the programmes that are presented. I do not think that the Commission should take much notice of such criticism. I believe that we in this country are big enough and adult enough to watch controversial programmes so long as they present fairly and justly both sides of the argument. But at least the Commission makes some attempt to present controversial programmes in order to exercise the minds of the viewers. Rarely do we find a controversial programme of any moment on any of the commercial television stations-and I restrict my reference to the commercial stations in Sydney. I rarely watch their prostations in other States. It is time that commercial television stations also showed programmes that are of interest to the adujkt members of the community and to people who like to see matters of moment and controversy discussed. I congratulate the Australian Broadcasting Commission for at least attempting to do this. I would like the Postmaster-General to ensure that not only is the Australian content of commercial television programmes increased but also that the stations present enjoyable programmes that are of interest and educational value to the adult members of the community. I commend to all honourable members the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. Any honourable member who desires to see Australia develop in all its aspects must support the amendment. a.m.] I will not detain honourable members for long. I am sorry I will not be able to support the amendment moved by the Opposition. The speakers for the Opposition have been, perhaps, a little out of touch with reality. They spoke of the great profits that had been made by commercial television stations, but they failed to mention that the stations, when they were formed, were pioneering and risk ventures. In point of fact, during the early stages it was hard to get capital. It is true that there was a period during which commercial television licences were very valuable but this period seems to have passed. Apparently this fact has escaped the attention of members of the Opposition. The increase in the number of stations has had the double effect of reducing the revenue available and increasing the cost of imported programmes. Because of this, the stations are considerably less profitable, I think, than they were. The Opposition is perhaps a little out of date in its approach to these matters. I would not support at the present time afiercerimposition by way of tax than the Government now suggests. With regard to the second point that the Opposition makes, again I feel that it is a little ill advised. The Opposition seeks the establishment of a large fund but it docs not say how the money is to be used. I would not like to see a large fund just kicking around without there being any set way in which it was to be used or applied. I do not think this is a well advised amendment although I think there is some kind of merit in the motives behind it. I-lik e nearly everybody else in this House, I think-woul d like to see a proper increase in the Australian content of television and broadcasting programmes. ] do believe that, not only in drama but particularly in drama, we should have a greater Australian content. I am all for this. I think I can say that I have had a consistent record in this regard. For example, I can remember the question of the Macquarie broadcasting network, which I raised in this House-abou t 10 or 12 years ago. I was sorry at that stage that the Opposition did not see fit to support the proposal put forward, but the Government did see fit to support it. Let me ask why it is that we are not getting more Australian content into our programmes. I think that there are two reasons. First, the Australian programmes do not seem to command the same audiences as the imported programmes. This is something which I for one very much regret. I feel that the blame lies with us in Australia. It does not lie with anybody else except the viewers, who apparently prefer what I can only describe as the alien corn to the local productions, but this is a matter of the preference which the Australian public by its listening and viewing habits has expressed. I regret this state of affairs and I think honourable members on both sides of the House would join me in regretting it. The Australian programmes may not in themselves be sufficiently mature. Here is a matter in which I think we have to assist. I would join with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro in regretting that in some respects, particularly in regard to our film industry, we have gone backward and not forward, but I do not think this can be cured by Government subsidy in the way that he suggested. I do not for one moment say that we should not try to cure it. Let me just point out one other matter to the House. One of the reasons, I think, why Australian programmes are not getting the support that they should get is that in some respects they are not sufficiently Australian, and the respect in which they are not Australian is one which I regret very much. Honourable members know very well that foreign influences, and particularly the organised Communist Party, which is a foreign and anti-Australian influence, have been successful in taking some of the Australian content out of the programmes. The way in which this organisation-thi s un-Australian, anti-Australian organisationhas succeeded in contaminating the stream",71,Television Stations Licence
190,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [12.23,"of Australian drama and Australian activity in this regard is notorious. There has been an organised attempt by a foreign organisation to corrupt the Australian content of our drama. This is regrettable, and I hope that honourable members of the Opposition join me in regretting it. However, Sir, I shall not take up the time of the House any further. I hope to move an amendment later in the proceedings which will have the effect of encouraging the stations to put on more Australian literary, dramatic and artistic works. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to the motion for the second reading of the Bill seems to me to be ill advised. I desire to address a few remarks to the debate on the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill. It is interesting to discover that at the witching hour of 12.30 a.m. the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr licences are granted, the control of this Wentworth) has found some Communists on the television screens. At this hour of the night, apart from the reality of the situation, it is almost frightening. I never thought that the honourable member, no matter where he may find Communists, would have considered that they were responsible for most of the bad material on television. I want to address a few broad comments to the measure that is under discussion and then to deal with one aspect of political advertising on television screens. First, let me say that I believe that the television stations can well afford to pay any costs involved in the additional charges that are being imposed. I dismiss completely any criticism of the increases that are being imposed, except that I say that they are not nearly enough compared with the profit and turnoverfiguresthat were given by the Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) in his second Ireading speech. I will not repeat those figures. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) restated them. A good comparison of the activities of the teleback to Australia highly talented and display vision stations was made by the Minister in his speech. Undoubtedly television licences are almost a gilt edged investment for the people who have control of them under grant from the Government. Anyone who thinks that a television grammes ought to have the best Australian licence is not a good proposition has only artists. But that is no excuse for the fact to look at the line-up of lawyers and highly skilled and highly paid advisers that applicants have at the hearing of applications for television licences. When applications were being heard in Melbourne recently, it was difficult to get on an aircraft to or from Melbourne because of the bookings by the legal fraternity and other people who were engaged in putting the cases for people who desired to serve the nation by being granted a television licence. I believe that there ought to be a full inquiry into this matter. I do not like the method of granting television licences or the results that have come out of that method. If one thing is crystal clear in Australia today it is that practically every television station worth mentioning is biased against the Labour Party politically because of the method of granting licences. That applies from one end of this continent to the other. Because of the method by which television great medium of propaganda by supporters of the Government is such that only one side of politics is being put on the screens. I suggest that there is not much excuse for any criticism of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I support that amendment for the reasons which are incorporated in it. I believe that a number of criticisms can be made in the field of television. I would like to see more Australian content in our television programmes. I am inclined to agree with the honourable member for Mackellar to some extent on this aspect of the matter. I cannot work out some of the weird noises made by some of the modern teenage artists, whether they are Australians or Americans. I cannot see that much of the noise is music. I am inclined to think that some of the best Australian artists are not getting an opportunity to appear on television. The records show that Australian artists go abroad and some of them, when they come their arts on television, can be understood. I believe that an inquiry might well be made into why some inferior Australian artists seem to have priority on the very limited local programmes. These pro-",73,Television Stations Licence
191,Mr Daily (Grayndler) [12.30 A.m.],"that there is not nearly enough Australian content in television programmes. We cannot develop a film industry, our own form of culture or our own approach to entertainment unless an incentive is given to Australian productions. When this matter was raised recently, some of the leading men who have been granted television licences, such as Sir Frank Packer, complained about the cost of Australian productions and said that they would continue to import programmes. I believe that people of that mind should be brought to book and forced to devote a predominant part of their programmes to the encouragement of Australian artists. That is one reason why this amendment has been moved. I believe that the advertising charges that are made by the television stations are extremely high and out of all proportion to the entertainment provided. The profits derived from television need to be investigated. I have mentioned already and particularly Very few, if any, of the stations are on the breadline. That was mentioned by the Postmaster-General in his second reading speech. The profits that they are making show that they are overcharging in many respects and are not giving live artists, particularly AusAustralian people. Many Australian teletralian artists, the opportunities that they should be given. The Minister has never satisfactorily answered in this Parliament questions that have been raised on the trafficking that takes place in television shares and on how people who have been refused a licence by the board have been able to buy into a station and practically to obtain control of a licence for which they were unable to obtain approval following the original inquiry. Taking television quiz shows as an example, I make these broad comments: People being interviewed on a station are asked simple questions that comply with the policy of the newspaper which controls the station, whether it be Channel9 or Channel7 in Sydney, but any person who does not accept the station's policy has to bear the full brunt of the interviewer's questions and remarks, whoever he might be. In other words, the interviews are readied. Television interviews in Australia should follow the pattern adopted in many American programmes. It is an all in go. No warning is given. In Australia, questions should be fired by the interviewer without fear or favour. If that were done we would get an impartial presentation of a point of view. I have seen people interviewed on television being asked simple questions which suit the station's policy, while other people receive completely different treatment. The Minister should look at all these aspects. It is interesting to note that the Senate Select Committee criticised the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for its administration of television in Australia. In paragraph 27 on page 5 of its report the Select Committee statedNevertheless, the Committee considers that the Board, particularly in recent years, during which time commercial television has become established upon a sound economic basis, could have discharged its obligations more adequately and effectively. That applies generally to the matters that to a matter which I shall touch on now. During the last Federal election campaign some of the most vile propaganda that has ever been shown on a television screen anywhere in the world was presented to the vision stations televised this propaganda to the great detriment of the party to which I belong. An objection to these programmes was lodged with the Australian Broadcasting Control Board but at no stage did the Board even bother to reply. I believe that the Select Committee's findings were justified. IfI only had the time to read the remainder of the report, I believe it would be found that thefindingswere more extensive that I have indicated. I will show honourable members how the Government, by granting television licences to its supporters all over the country, has prevented the point of view of 50 per cent, of the Australian people being presented fairly on television screens anywhere in Australia at any time during any election campaign. The public must face up to this fact: In this country under a Liberal Government, so called, only one point of view can be expressed on our television screens because of the cost involved and because of the influence of the interests behind the television stations. This influence has been built up by the Government over a period of years in an endeavour to see that only its point of view is expressed. On 22nd April 1964a very recent date -the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked the Postmaster-General the following questionHow much (a) free and (b) paid time was Party from being presented to the Australian occupied by each political party on each compeople fairly and impartially. mercial television station at the last Federal elections? This is the reply that the Minister gave(a) Free time occupied by each political party for the televising of party leaders' initial speeches was There follows a very extensive list but I shall mention only a few of the figures to show the trend. In the Australian Capital Territory the Australian Labour Party received 60 minutes free time, the Country Party 15 minutes, the Democratic Labour Party 13 minutes and the Liberal Party 53 minutes. Of the total 141 minutes, the three parties that are opposed to the Labour Party-the three enemies of the Labour movement-receive d 81 minutes free time. In New South Wales Channel ATN Sydney gave the Labour Party 45 minutes and the other three parties 75 minutes. Channel TCN Sydney gave the Labour Party 60 minutes and the other three parties. 90 minutes. Channel CBN Orange gave the Labour Party 45 minutes and the other three parties 75 minutes. Channel WIN Wollongong gave the Labour Party 45 minutes and the other three parties 70 minutes. In Victoria, 45 minutes was the maximum time allotted to the Labour Party whereas the other three parties received a minimum of 70 minutes free time. Party did not have anything to say. we had to say. Listen to this: The maximum time allotted to the Australian Labour Party was 60 minutes-thi s occurred on only one Sydney channel, in Perth and in the Australian Capital Territory-wherea s the time allotted to our opponents aggregated more than two and a half times that. This was at a time when the Labour Party had polled 370,000 more votes throughout Australia than the Government parties and when the Labour Party had only one seat less than the Government parties in this House. Yet when the parties which are the enemies of the Labour Party in this country went to the Australian people, the television stations allowed them, on an average, two and a half times as much free time as they allowed the Labour Party. That is the pattern followed by this Government. It has given television licences to people who will use the power that television can give them in order to prevent the point of view of the Labour When we come to the second part of the answer, we find the paid time occupied by each political party. In the Australian Capital Territory the Labour Party could afford to pay for only 60 minutes whereas the total time occupied by all parties was 201 minutes. Everybody knows that the programmes presented by the other three parties were paid for from Liberal and Country Party funds. If honourable members look through the figures they will find that on one station-TC N Sydney-the Labour Party had only one hour of the 283 minutes paid time. The huge charges made by television stations make it impossible for parties such as the Australian Labour Party, without huge resources behind them, to mcrft the challenge of the interests represented by Government supporters. In Lismore, for Instance, the Labour Party had only 72 minutes out of a total of 204 minutes paid time. In Melbourne, on Station GTV, the Labour Party had only 75 minutes out of a total of 227 minutes. If honourable members look through the figures they will find that the time that could be paid for by the three parties which support the Government was almost two and a half to three times as great as the time that the Labour Party could afford, despite the fact that Labour received a majority of the votes. I shall tell the House why the Labour Party cannot afford more television time. A one minute announcement on even a country station costs in the vicinity of £100. I know that because I have inquired recently. If honourable members consider the amount of television time paid for by the three enemies of the Labour movement they will see how this medium of propaganda is being used in Australia, from Cape York to Albany, against the interests of the Labour Party and against the interests of half of the Australian population. I do not want to cite all thesefigures-that would not be necessary-bu t I shall refer to the figures for Western Australia, where the Labour Party had 84 minutes out of a total of 240 minutes paid time, and for Launceston, where the Labour Party had 62 minutes",74,Television Stations Licence

I also hope that some of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television will be put into effect sociated with it, the Australian people have so that we will see justice and impartiality in presentations on television and radio. I support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Eden Monaro and hope that it will be carried in the interests of Australian artists and producers. I wish to refer to one or two points that have been mentioned by the honourable transferred to other duties. member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). First, the honourable member made an accusation that there was some sort of Communist influence within the A.B.C. and -the Minister will be aware of this from in a certain programme or programmes letters that have been published in the presented by the Commission. It was Press-that there is afield some sort of typical of the honourable member that he political influence. It certainly seems like it, did not name specifically the programmes although the Minister says that no such which he considered were affected by this influence has been exercised by him or Communist influence. This is a serious directly by any member of the Government accusation, but although several honourable Parties. It appears to me that influence may members on the Opposition side asked the have been exercised indirectly. There is no honourable member for Mackellar to name proof of any influence having been exerthe programmes specifically, he did not cised, but the A.B.C. has become-no t do so. I am led to understand that the procriticism when controversial matters are gramme about which he expressed concern featured on the "" Four Corners"" is ""The Yarns of Billy Borker"". I have programme. seen this programme, which lasts for five or ten minutes, and it seems to me to be concerned only with typical Australian yarns. Certainly it is a harmless type of gramme should be continued on national programme. It is true that the yarns might television. Indeed, I hope that some of the be stretched a little, but that can be said commercial stations will copy the Comalso of the imagination of the honourable mission in presenting programmes of this member for Mackellar. Certainly so far as type. ""Four Corners"" has been objective I can see these yarns would not taint the on the occasions on which I have watched minds of Australians, and the honourable it. Whenever it has featured a subject of member's argument seems to be quite political controversy, both sides have been ridiculous. I raised the matter of "" Four Corners"" is important. Quite apart from political yesterday at question time. The Postmasterissues, "" Four Corners"" digs into many General( Mr Hulme) said in reply to my of the controversial issues that confront the question that there had been no political people of Australia.

Having regard to tbe aotions of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the last week or so concerning "" Four Corners"" and those asbeen led to believe that some sort of influence is operating in respect of television programmes. According to the Minister in answering my question yesterday, the whole affair developed after a protest in Western Australia about an intended programme featuring a hanging. Suddenly, some members of the ""Four Corners"" staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission were It seems to me, and it would appear to many people in the Australian community suddenly, because this has happened before a little sensitive about the possibility of I have viewed this programme a number of times, and I believe that such a progiven an opportunity to argue their views before a great number of Australians. This",77,Television Stations Licence
201,Mr Beaton (Bendigo) [12.47 A.m.],"or the other. It is most important that there should be no political directive to, or political control over, the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I hope that at some time the Commission, in both its radio and television activities, will be completely free, as is the British Broadcasting Corporation, to discharge its functions in every respect without interference. In the years to come, I should like to see in every capital city, perhaps controlled by the Commission, a national newspaper completely free of outside influence and able to present objective views and to report objectively all that goes on in this country and throughout the world. The honourable member for Mackellar said that the views of the Opposition on television licence fees are out of date. In the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser), we embody a proposal substantially to increase licence fees assessed on gross earnings from advertising receipts of television stations. The honourable member said that the sort of excessive profits that we have in mind are no longer made. member now? view is more elevated than that of the in Australia and that company is now earnhonorable member for Wilmot, and I can ing in excess of 400 per cent, of its capital see the honourable member for Mackellar. per annum. Surely this is excessive. The The plain fact, Mr Speaker, is that if the honourable member for Mackellar did not Opposition is out of date, the Minister is have an argument when he said that the out of date. In his second reading speech, contention of the Opposition was out of he saidDespite the spectacular increase in the earnings of both television and broadcasting stations, lite rales of licence fees have remained unchanged since 1956. There we have it. There have been specand I want to mention specifically, because tacular increases in earnings. The MinisterI know personally of some of its difficulties, later said. . . the four metropolitan television stations in television station serving central and Sydney and Melbourne earn in excess of £2 northern Victoria. This station is a local million. . . . These are stations which, supposedly, people and it has had difficulties with which according to the honourable member for to contend since it started. Some time next Mackellar, are a lot poorer these days than month, it will have been in existence for they used to be. The Minister then statedAll of the other metropolitan stations except operating at a small profit, but it is equally Hobart are earning either a little more or a little true that it has a long way to go before it less than £1 million. . . . There are two things in this respect that it provides adequately for the needs of the I wish to point out. First of all, it is claimed population in the area it covers. that because their profits have fallen away the operation of television stations is not such a good thing financially. This statement does not hold water, because we have only to turn to the financial page of any daily newspaper to find, on the stock market, the evidence of the inflated value of shares in television companies. This fact, of course, completely wipes out the argument put forward by the honourable member for Mackellar. Secondly, the plain fact is that the amendment is designed to apply only to television stations which earn in excess of £1 million per year. I suppose that, because there are varying amounts of money involved in their capital, the profits of television companies cannot be measured acurately in this respect. But the average earnings per annum of metropolitan television stations, perhaps with the exception of the Hobart television station, are in excess of 25 per cent, of their capital. These are their net earnings after allowing for depreciation, taxation and other charges. I cannot accept the argument that television stations are doing poor business. The companies are earning substantial amounts ber for Mackellar said, that they took the risk in the first place. Yet General Motorsdate. We are completely up with the times. There is one further point with which I wish to deal. I want to talk briefly about the position of country television stations BCV8, Bendigo, which is the commercial enterprise.

They have been commensurate with its equipment, its capital and the opportunities it has had to provide its service. But for several years after commencing transmission it was short of small things such as tables and chairs that were needed for' its purposes. If a local personality -for instance, the president of the local agricultural society-o r some notable visitor to the town was to be interviewed, it was very difficult for BCV8 to obtain even a table and chairs for the occasion. This was because of lack of capital. It takes a great deal of money to set up a television station. WhatI am objecting to is the fact that while, undoubtedly, the new licence fee for this type of television station will be the lowest fee, and only up to 1 per cent, of the gross earnings of the station, I feel that because of the difficulties that country television stations face and because of the wide and sparsely populated areas which they cover, they should be given some sort of concession in this respect. A country television station which makes bad but all providing a service to the comIn its third year of operation a profit of a munity-the Government should consider few thousand pounds and which has proswaiving these fees. pects of making in each successive year further profits of a few thousand pounds, is not a station which I feel should contribute glad that the Postmaster-General( Mr a great deal by way of licence fees.

The Commonwealth Government would give material help to television stations in country areas if it waived the licence fees for such stations until they found their feet. I do not say that when these stations are adequately equipped and are making substantial profits, even if this takes 10, 15 or 20 years, they should not pay the same fees as other stations pay. They should. But they should at least be given time to get on their feet and to obtain the equipment they need to provide a service to the community.

"" Australia is full of wonderful, dramatic and exciting history. We could have a series of films on other facets of Australian life, if local actors were given a chance to produce them. The television stations are only playing with Australian talent. They are trying to build up the average number of hours that they are supposed to devote to Australian content by employing the methods that were mentioned earlier by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). They are televising cooking lessons, gardening lessons, baby sitting lessons and a host of other things to try to build tip the hours or the minutes that they are obliged to devote to programmes of so-called Australian content.

The Opposition's amendment is designed to use all the money that is raised from licence fees for encouraging the production of Australian programmes for television. Just recently a new company was formed to produce Australian biographies. Every Sunday night Channel9 in Launceston televises the programme "" Biography "". That is an outstanding programme which deals with leading world figures. It is dramatic, interesting, informative and educational. I said a moment ago that a company had been formed to produce Australian biographies. Why should we not produce such programmes? We have just as great men and women in this country as are to be found in other parts of the world. The company I mentioned will have to spend a lot of money. The fund that we want to establish from licence fees could help to encourage that company to produce a series of 20 or even 40 biographies. This company deserves every success. I was thrilled to learn that somebody has had the courage to launch it. Keith Smith, a most entertaining character who has produced some remarkable shows for television, is a dinkum Aussie. His interviewing of people in all walks of life on all subjects is an education in itself. He plays his part so well that no American could do better. While these cheap and old American programmes are being poured into our television system to build up the profits of wasting.

I want to say clearly that the Government rejects the amendment which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) has proposed. It seems to me that members of the Opposition are trying to create the impression that they are the only people who are interested in the problems which affect actors, script writers and others assowhich could be followed to improve Ausciated with the building up of Australian programmes. The members of the Opposition do not understand the real problems associated with this matter. Perhaps it is sufficient for me to say that one of the larger television companies has on the shelf a great number of Australian programmes which no other station is prepared to purchase. Even though the programmes have been discounted well below the cost of production, they are not wanted by other stations, because the advertisers know that the viewers will not watch them. It is the right of every Australian to make his own determination of the programmes he will view. If he does not want to see an Australian programme, we cannot force an advertiser to pay for that programme. standards for television. that members of the Opposition do not understand the problems. When the amendment comes before the Committee, I will deal with this matter much more broadly than I intend to deal with it at this moment. I do not want to have to repeat myself. If we look at the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, we will see that it merely gives lip service to be brought about. (Petrie PostmasterMr Allan Fraser -The Minister knows perfectly well that the Standing Orders preincrease. ment is phrased so indefinitely because the Opposition does not understand the problem. The second part of the proposed amendment states that the licence fees should be paid into a special fund and used solely to assist the production of Australian television programmes. In what way does the Opposition intend to assist? I believe that those who move an amendment of this type should set out a programme tralian productions and the lot of persons participating in those productions. But that has not been done, and the onus has been placed on the Government to work out the details. I am as interested in the development of Australian programmes as is anybody else. In effect, the Opposition, on top of moving its amendment, says: ""We do not want to defeat the Bill. We will go along with it, but the Government ought to do something"". The Opposition is very indefinite on this point. It says: "" We do not want to solve the problem. We want you to find the answers.""

215,Mr Hulme,"I believe that the amendFor station TVW Perth the time of one hour 12 minutes was shown instead of two hours 12 minutes. That station did Include in its programme the required Australian content. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro described as an anomaly the basis on which the licence fees are charged . The Govern1 ment has been charging the licence fees on advertising receipts, but has been advised that the present wording of the Act requires that the licence fee be calculated on the total receipts; that is, on the advertising receipts and programme receipts. The Government has been out of order in its method of calculation of licence fees. The Government has left it to the television stations to advise the Board of the apportionment of their receipts between advertising and programmes. The Board has had no other way of obtaining this information. Since the licence fees to date have been calculated only in relation to advertising receipts, some stations have loaded their programme receipts and the calculation of the licence fee has been made on the reduced advertising receipts. The net result has been that one station has been paying a licence fee on 60 per cent, of its total receipts, as the amount applicable to advertising, while another station has been paying a licence fee on 30 per cent, of its total receipts, as the amount applicable to advertising. Surely this must be regarded as an unfair basis upon which to collect the licence fees. I know of no way in which the problem can be resolved without changing the method of calculation. In the circumstances, the Government has decided that the licence fees should be calculated on the gross revenue, both from programmes and from advertising. The position is not quite as bad as might at first appear, because sponsored programmes represent only about 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, of television programmes at present, and during such programmes only six minutes is provided in each hour for advertising purposes. On the other hand the spot advertising programme-the programme in which the advertiser pays for a spot advertisement-provide s for 12 minutes of advertising per hour. Such programmes comprise 85 per cent, to 90 per cent, of television programmes. I think honourable members will agree that when we talk in terms of charging against advertising receipts compared with charging against programmes, and bringing all the revenue into account, the situation is not as bad as it might appear on the surface. The Bill certainly corrects an injustice that is being done to some stations compared with other stations. The honourable member for Eden Monaro referred also to the situation in the United Kingdom. I think it is almost impossible to compare the Australian situation as far as commercial television stations are concerned with the system which operates in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, apart from the British Broadcasting Corporation there is an independent television authority. It is a statutory authority. It does not produce programmes; it merely erects transmitters and leases or hires them to what are known in the United Kingdom as programme contractors. There are two bases on which the contractor pays rent to the independent television authority. The first is primarily according to the relative economic capacity of areas. It must be remembered that there is only one such television station in an area in the United Kingdom. There is only one comparable commercial station in the whole of London, and that station probably has more viewers that have all television stations in Australia at present. Rental is paid secondly on the basis of advertising receipts. The programme contractors in the old country earn a profit of 45 per cent, on their total revenue as against a margin in Australia of 20 per cent. Mr Allan Fraser -It is 48 per cent. per cent. Mr Allan Fraser -Both figures are gross. It would be entirely wrong for us to think that the same situation applies in Australia as applies in the United Kingdom. I commend the Bill to the House without the amendment because I believe that at this point of time the Bill represents a reasonable approach to the problem of providing finance sufficient to cover the operations of the authority of the Government which in",82,Television Stations Licence

A record could be a musical production on which a television station need only have paid the Australian Performing Right Association's copyright fee. A dramatic production could be a piece of elocution costing only a few shillings, performed by a station announcer. Artistic material could be a lecture by a young lady on flower arrangement. This would be the kind of device similar, unfortunately, to those which are used by television stations now to boost their Australian content, without genuinely assisting Australian television production.

Why should it not also be adopted in relation to radio broadcasting? There is an inconsistency here which is not explained by the honourable member who proposed the amendment. I think these are good reasons why the amendment should be rejected. I said earlier that I would say a few words in relation to this problem of Australian production. I believe that the principal problem is the shortage of scriptwriters. I do not think we have many good scriptwriters in Australia nor do I believe that we have people in Australia who can teach others to be good scriptwriters. We have not many good actors in Australia. You do not find people who will practice, practice, practice to become good actors to solve problems of this kind.

He has risen tonight and cried stinking fish and that is all he has done to help the Australian television industry. a.m.] I still intend to press the amendment. I do not think the reasons given for the rejection by the Minister are sound. In the first place, I do not accept his figures. I do not think they are correct. When a programme is produced it would be shown, not only once, but on a number of stations. In any case, few programmes cost £4,000. I agree with the Minister that my amendment does not do everything necessary, but at least it does something. It should be an encouragement to the State to do something about putting more Australian programmes on the air. I agree with the Minister that other things have to be done, and I hope that when the time comes they will be done. But the fact that other things have to be done is no reason for not doing this concrete thing now. There is not really very much trouble about the definition because if one looks at the amendment one sees that it says ""the commercial television station satisfies the Minister"". The matter is left in his hands in order to get a determination on a fair and equitable basis.

[1.54 a.m.] -This Bill contains a number of innocuous and, in fact, quite useful provisions, on which I will make no further comment than that the Opposition accepts them. In Committee I will move an amendment which I hope the Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) will find himself able as readily to accept. My main purpose in rising is to point out that the Bill does not contain the fulfilment of a promise given to the House by the Minister on 5th May last, when he foreshadowed legislation to strengthen the Government's control of the transfer of shares in commercial television stations. The House will recall that when the third television licence was granted in Brisbane the Broadcasting Conrtol Board rejected Mr Ansett's application and statedIt would, however, seem to us that there are strong reasons in principle why licences for two capital city commercial television stations should not be granted by the Minister to what is, in effect, the same company, and for a discussion of this principle we adopt here, without repeating, the reasoning in our first Report on Brisbane and Adelaide Licences. . . . F.13904/64 -R -[101 ] Secondly, the Board gave the following as a reason for granting the licence to Universal Telecasters Queensland Ltd No licensee of a commercial television station holds any interest in Universal Telecasters Qld. claimed in the course of the inquiry would establish a station that would be "" run by Queenslanders for Queensland "", and that this was the basis of tbe application. Subsequently, Mr Ansett acquired 49 per cent, of the shares in Universal Telecasters Queensland Ltd. The Postmaster-General withheld the licence. Subsequently, he showed that what Mr Ansett did was not opposed to the letter of the legislation but certainly was opposed to the spirit of it that. not. The Minister showed that what Mr Ansett did was also completely opposed to the reasoning of the Broadcasting Control Board in recommending that the licence be granted to Universal Telecasters Queensland Ltd. What the Minister now says by way of interjection is true. What Mr Ansett did it was opposed to the spirit of the law. The Minister now says, "" But you cannot win on that"". not win on that. But the Minister went further. He gave the House an assurance that he would study this matter with a view to bringing down legislation to ensure that that situation did not recur. He gave that assurance on 5th May last. The legislation which is now before the House is the second Broadcasting and Television Bill to be brought before the House this year, and it contains no provision of that kind. The situation, which is against the spirit of the law and which nullifies the whole intention of the recommendations of the Broadcasting Control Board with respect to this licence, is still allowed to exist. When will the Postmaster-General do something about that situation? When he gave his assurance he said that he would consider an amendment of the Broadcasting and Television Act and that the proposed legislation should be ready soon. Why then has he not brought the legislation to the House? Will he now give the House a definite",86,Pairs

The Deputy Leader asked me a question about that. says that he answered that question today. I would like him to answer it here and now, in the course of this debate, because this is the bill on which this matter should be dealt with. I refer him and the House to a statement which was made in a journal of great reliability-the journal "" Inside Canberra "", which is produced by Mr Don Whitington and his staff. The Sth September issue of that journal stated that an effort, made by the Postmaster-General in Cabinet and supported by the Attorney-General( Mr that he will make clear what is to be done Snedden), to place a restriction of 5 per cent, on the ownership of shares in other television stations by the owners of existing stations was defeated in Cabinet and that the Postmaster-General was instructed to allow the situation to remain as it is at present. If that is not so, I would like an assurance from the Postmaster-General that he is preparing such legislation and that it will be brought down. I hope that he will give us the date on which it will be brought down and an assurance that it will cure the situation which was allowed to exist in Brisbane in which Mr Ansett, in defying the recommendation of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and in defying the intentions and desires of the Government, acquired practical control of the third commercial television station in Brisbane by acquiring 49 per cent, of the shares in the company, although theoretically, in accordance with the articles of association of the company, he is prevented from exercising more than a IS per cent, shareholding vote. want to make a few observations which when the remaining period is substantial have no connection with what the honorthe holder should be entitled to some comable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan pensation.

Regulations will made by the Department where there is a moral be made under this legislation and, of or implied legal obligation to do so; for example, where a licence has been taken out unnecessarily or a person eligible for a reduced rate licence pays the full fee. In explanation of this clause, I would mention that there are occasions when a wife, not knowing that her husband has taken out a licence, also takes one out. Under the present provisions of the Act, there is no authority to make a refund. It is interesting to learn that the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs or the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department have found that they have some moral or implied obligations to do certain things. Apparently the consciences of certain officials have been worrying them for a very long time in connection with refunds that should have been paid to certain licence holders. I have in mind particular cases which I shall mention to the Minister in the hope in the future. Let us consider the case of a person who, after paying the television licence fee, moves either to an area where there is no television reception or leaves the country. In the past that person has received no refund of any part of the licence fee irrespective of the length of time that he had held the licence. I believe that there is very definitely a moral obligation-in fact, an implied legal obligationon the Department to refund at least a portion of the licence fee in such a case. If a person surrenders a telephone service for which he has paid the rental in advance, he receives a refund. I want to make sure that this clause covers cases such as I have mentioned because certain of my constituents have paid their television licence fee, have left Australia or have moved to an area where there is no television reception and have not received a refund of any part of the fee. I can quite understand that if the licence had only a short time to run before (Petrie-Postmaster -",87,Broadcasting And Television

My colleague informed me that whilst he was not, at that time, prepared to endorse the council recommendation that section 100 of the Broadcasting and Televison Act should be amended, he felt mendation that an Australian national advertising code should be drawn up for tlie guidance of the advertisers of patent medicines and appliances. I am informed that considerable progress has been made in this direction, with the support of the matters.

Attempts have been made in the past, under section 100 of the principal Act, to deal with such matters. The word "" medicine "" is used, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has suggested that it should be replaced by the wordsa substance or appliance for which a theraputic set down in July 1956. They have been use is claimed Medical Research Council has suggested it. these matters-decide d that what was being the television programme standards. The that point of view. Australian Broadcasting Control Board is charged with the responsibility of maintaining standards in relation to television. At ignorant as the honourable member for pages 25 and 26 of the publication containEden-Monaro appears to be of the existence ing these standards there is a virtual of these standards. direction that a licensee shall not televise an advertisement relating to a medicine unless the text has been approved by the ignorant of the existence of these standards Director-General of Health or a medical although I certainly was not aware that they officer in a State to whom the Directorwere eight years old. However, the fact General has delegated this power. The is that they are eight years old and that four honourable member for Eden-Monaro may years after they were issued the National not be aware of this publication. I suggest Health and Medical Research Council was that this matter would have to be examined insisting that advertising injurious to the closely before the Government would be public was being broadcast by television prepared to accept the amendment. The philosophy of the Government, is the protection that is sought by the Council that it should work in co-operation with and is contained in this amendment. those who have responsibility at particular levels within the community. I am not prepared to accept an indication from one body as necessarily the guiding factor in a whole, and agreed to. reaching a decision. I think we should take into consideration the views of the people who are responsible for advertising and, adopted. in this case, for the television industry generally. Perhaps we might develop a code of ethics in relation to television advertising such as there is in the newspaper world. If such a code can be applied to -rea d a third time. newspapers, I see no reason why something similar should not be possible in the field of television. I do not think there is any CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION need for me to go into more detail. For those reasons, and also to avoid a prospective administrative nightmare, I suggest amendment. that the Committee should reject the amendment. I will undertake to have a look at the House adjourned at 2.17 a.m. (Wednesday). proposition that has been put forward by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. [2.14 a.m.] -The Postmaster-General has produced the Australian Broadcasting Control Board's television programme standards and has suggested that this is an effective instrument to deal with the matters covered by the Opposition's amendment. I point out to the Minister that these standards were in operation for eight years, but four years ago the National Health and Medical done in this field was entirely unsatisfactory. stations.

Mr Whitlam asked the Attorney-General, upon notice1. Did Archbishop Alexci, who has been refused a visa, visit the United States of America last year? 2. If so-(a ) what facts have become known to the Archbishop's discredit since he visited the United States or (b) which of his characteristics arc regarded as injurious here but not there? able member's questions is as f o l l o w s : I have been informed that the Archbishop Alexei who is Vice-President of the External Relations Department of the Russian Orthodox Church did visit the United States of America last year. Archbishop Alexei applied for a visa as one of a group of six (Professor N . V. Matkovsky, Secretary of World Peace Council; V. M . Chkhikvadzc, Professor of Academy of Sciences; V. Y. Isaev, President of Leningrad Council of Workers' Deputies; O. S. Kharkhardin, Journalist, as escort to Isaev; B. Y. Shnyakin, Interpreter, as escort to the Archbishop), so that the question of the issue of a visa was considered in the context of the purpose of the visit, namely, to attend, at the invitation of its organizers, the A.C.l.C.D. at Sydney. The Government's policy in relation to this Congress is to refuse applications for visas which originate from countries within the Communist blocs. The Archbishop's application was accordingly refused. If Archbishop Alexci applies for a visa to come to Australia for a different purpose, the question of his admission will be an entirely different matter.

Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Territories, upon notice1. Was the then Minister for Territories correct when he told the House on 30th August 1962 that the minimum wage rate that was then paid to indigenous workers employed by Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers Ltd. was 8s. 9d. per week? 2. If so, why was the minimum wage rate reduced to the current figure of 7s. 6d. per week, as disclosed by him to the House on 29th September 1964?",90,Broadcasting And Television
243,Mr Snedden,The answer to the honor,96,Numbers Of Full Blood Aboriginals Enumerated In Each Census Divi
244,Mr Barnes,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsOn 30th August 1962, in reply to a question by the honourable member as to the number of Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers Ltd. employees who were employed on the minimum cash rates of 7s. 6d. per week and 8s. 9d. per week prescribed under the Native Employment Ordinance, my predecessor stated that nil and 203 employees respectively were employed on these rates. He also mentioned that, at that time, 189 indigenous employees of the company were on rates higher than the above, according to their skills. On 29th September 1964, I informed the honourable member that the company currently employs 196 indigenous workers at £19 10s. per year (7s. 6d. per week) and 20 at £22 15s. per year (8s. 9d. per week). I also indicated that the remaining 164 indigenous workers are engaged on higher rates than these. Section 87(1) of the Native Employment Ordinance 1958-1963 provides that the minimum cash wage payable to an employee shall be at the rate of(a) in the case of an employee, who has had more than one year's continuous service with an employer-455s . per year (£22 15s.); and, (b) in the case of any other employee-390s . per year (£15 10s.). (The minimum cash wages are, of course, additional to the provision of food, clothing, accommodation, medical attention, cooking and eating utensils, towels, soap and other articles at prescribed standards to an employee and his accompanying dependants.) The two sets of figures above, given at different that most engineers prefer to establish their own points of time, in no way imply a reduction in the rate of pay for any particular employee or any general reduction in the rates paid by the company. The differences are accounted for by staff turnover and termination of agreements at the end of the prescribed periods. Railway Level Crossings: Uniform Legislation. (Question No. 683.) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Technical College are available, but most engineers Shipping and Transport, upon notice1. What steps have been taken to secure uniform college. Engineers of the Australian National Line State and Territory laws with respect to railway are given fully paid study leave to attend college level crossings? 2. Which State railway systems comply with the according to the certificate being attempted. In suggested standards? 3. Do the Commonwealth Railways comply with pleted their apprenticeship and who wish to become the suggested standards? able member's questions are as follows1. The National Road Traffic Code, produced by the Australian Road Traffic Code Committee (a standing committee of the Australian Transport Advisory Council) contains provisions dealing with the obligations of drivers crossing railway level crossings. This code is intended as a model for legislation in the State and Commonwealth Territories. The Standards Association of Australia has produced an Australian standards code for road signs, which includes a section on signs for various types of railway level crossings. 2. My Department understands that State railway systems conform with the Standards Association's standards for railway level crossing signs wherever practicable, or they are in the process of installing signs to such standards. 3. Signs in use on Commonwealth railways are being brought into line with the Standards Association code when replacements, or the erection of new signs, are required. Australian National Line Engineers. (Question No. 738.) Mr Hansen asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice1. What encouragement is given, by way of bonus or supply of textbooks, to Australian National Line engineers to enable them to study for higher grade certificates? 2. Are correspondence courses available to these engineers, or must they leave their ships to study at technical colleges at their own expense? 3. Does the absence of engineers on study courses at technical colleges create a shortage of engineers on the Australian National Line ships? able member's questions are as follows1. Text books are not provided by the Australian National Line. It has been found from experience personal library of technical books which are thus available to them for reference purposes in respect of employment in any company. The line does however circulate technical magazines around its fleet to enable engineers to keep abreast of modern developments. Since the acquisition of a higher certificate carries its own reward in the shape of promotion, bonuses for this purpose are not considered necessary. 2. Correspondence courses from the Sydney find that shipboard study without expert tuition is no substitute for full time study at a technical in addition to their normal recreation leave. The length of study leave varies from three to ten weeks addition selected young engineers who have commarine engineers are offered the following financial while studying for the qualifying examination for entry into the industry. If not residing at home(a) Payment of board and lodgings at an approved residence plus an allowance of £1 per day. (b) Payment of fares from home to place where course is held, and return.

(Question No. 672.) Mr L. R. Johnson asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice1. How many beneficiary organisations under the provisions of the Aged Persons Homes Act require persons being accommodated to contribute (a) all and (b) part of the capital cost of a living unit other than the amount represented by the Government grant? 2. How many persons and what percentage of persons being accommodated in homes subsidised under the provisions of the Aged Persons Homes Act have been required to lodge non-returnable deposits in excess of (a) £500, (b) £750, (c) £1.000, (d) £1,500 and (e) £2,0007 are available. Homes for the Aged. (Question No. 674.) Mr L. R. Johnson asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice1. On how many occasions in the last three years have Aged Persons Homes been opened by (a) the Minister for Social Services, (b) a Government member of the House of Representatives or a Government senator and (c) an Opposition member of the House of Representative's or an Opposition senator? 2. On how many occasions in the same years has (a) a Government member and (b) an Opposition member opened establishments located within the member's electorate? able member's questions is as follows1 and 2. The official opening of aged persons homes is a matter which is decided and arranged by the organisations conducting the homes. On some occasions Ministers, senators or members of the House of Representatives have been invited to open homes while in other cases they have been noticeinvited to attend openings performed by some other person. Records of the number of instances amounts in excess of those which are annually where official openings have been performed or assessed when income tax returns are made? attended by members of the Commonwealth Parliament are not kept by my Department. Homes for the Aged. (Question No. 711.) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for honourable Social Services, upon notice1. How many organisations have received grants under the . Aged Persons Homes Act? 2. How many of them (a) require, (b) encourage or (c) permit applicants for accommodation to make gifts or loans lo them before receiving accommodation? honourable member's questions are as follows1. 308. 2. No details are available. Pensions. (Question No. 727.) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice1. What additional sum is being paid in age pensions as a result of the reduction in the residential qualification from twenty to ten years? 2. What additional stun would have to be paid if the residential qualification were reduced lo five years? honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w s1. Information is not readily available on cither the number of age pensioners who are now in receipt of pension solely because of the reduction in the residence qualification, or the amount of pension being paid to those pensioners. This information could not be obtained without an unreasonable amount of work. 2. Information is not available on the number of persons who would be eligible if the residtr.ee qualification were further reduced from ten to five years. The data required would include the number of persons of pensionable age who have been in Australia from five to ten years, and this number would have to be adjusted to take account of persons ineligible on grounds of nationality end means, including those of the spouse in the case of married persons. Any estimate of the number likely to qualify for pensions would involve the making of certain assumptions which would affect the reliability of such an estimate. The information cannot therefore be supplied. Taxation. (Question No. 562.) Mr Dcvine asked the Treasurer, upon 1. Do taxpayers contribute to the Commonwealth 2. If so, what is the total sum refundable to taxpayers for the financial year 1963-64, and what amount of interest was earned on money paid by taxpayers in excess of ultimate assessments?

251,Mr Roberton,"The answers to theexceed the amount of tax ultimately assessed. Salary and wage earners are provided with forms on which they may show the allowance to be made for tax instalment purposes in respect of dependants. A corresponding adjustment of instalment deductions is not, however, practicable in relation to other concessional deductions based on actual expenditure for such items as medical expenses, education expenses, etc. This factor is one of the reasons why a balance between instalment deductions and ultimate liability is not achieved. A further obstacle to such a balance is that many employees refrain from claiming for the adjustment of instalment deductions in respect of some or all of their dependants. This practice is probably followed because these employees find it convenient to receive an annual refund of instalment deductions. 2. Refunds of instalment deductions during the 1963-64 year approximated £100 million. Instalment deductions received are paid into Consolidated Revenue. Insofar as the excess deductions reduce the Treasury Bill issue below the level that would otherwise be necessity, there is a saving in interest to the Commonwealth. As the rate of interest on Treasury Bills is 1 per cent, per annum the saving on this account would have been about £0.5 million in 1963-64. Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. case of a member who is 37 years of age, or more, (Question No. 666.) Mr Gray asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. What is the scale of contributions required from Army officers and other ranks in connection with their pension fund and does the scale of conupon noticetributions vary in any way in relation to (a) rank, (b) age or (c) length of service? 2. Is there any upward limit placed upon the (b) the airline subsidiaries of Ansett Transport percentage of total income that a contributor may Industries Ltd. in each of the past five years for be called upon to pay into the fund? Mr Harold Holt -The answer to the honourable member's followsContributions to the Defence Forces Retirement the past five financial years to Trans-Australia AirBenefits Fund vary according to whether the lines and to each of the companies in which Ansett member commenced contributions to the Fund Transport Industries Ltd. has a controlling interest before or after the 1959 Act. Trans-Australia Airlines Ansett-A.N.A. Airlines of New South Wales Queensland Airlines Ansett Flying Boat Service. MacRobcrtson Miller Airiines(a) Total Ansett Group (a) Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. announced having acquired a controlling interest in MacRobertson MUler Airline* Ltd. in April 1963. The subsidy paid to this airline in the years prior to and including the year of transfer of ownership were1959-60 £112,680, 1960-61 £127,856, 1961-62 £146,196, and 1962-63 £97,430. The variance between the amounts of £97,430 paid in 1962-63 and £128,339 paid in 1963-64 takes into account retrospective adjustments of subsidy: the amounts paid in respect of the two years were £121,000 for 1962-63 and £121,500 for 1963-64. For those who commenced to contribute prior to the 1959 Act, contributions are in two parts. The first in respect of pre 1959 Act entitlements is a continuation of the rate being paid according to the scale set out in the 1948-1958 legislation and is based on the age at which each portion of the entitlement accrued. The second Dart of the contribution, which is provided for in current legislation, is obtained by establishing the amount of the member's share of increased pension appropriate to his change of category (as defined) and , the contribution which would be necessary to obtain this entitlement(a) in the case of officers, over the period from the date of entitlement until his retiring age; (b) in the case of other ranks, over the period from the date of entitlement to the completion of twenty years service or later engagement as appropriate. There is no upper limit to such members' contributions in terms of a percentage of salary. Post 1959 Act entrants, in general, pay a contribution of 5 per cent, per annum of salary. There are some exceptions to this general principle; e.g., entrants at higher than normal ages and officers with early retirement ages who have, as a result, a shorter period over which to contribute for their share of the pension. The maximum contribution payable is 12 per cent, of salary in the on entry to the Fund. Civil Aviation. (Question No. 668.)

Can he provide an answer to this question before the debate on the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Bill? Mr Harold Holt -The answer to the honourable member's questions is as followsThe liability incurred by the Commonwealth in the lust five years amounted to £3,046. Transfer of Funds. Mr Harold Holt -On 30th September, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr engage in purely portfolio investment Killen) asked me a question without notice concerning the regulation and supervision of the transfer of funds from Australia. As promised at the time, I have now obtained a detailed reply for the honourable member. All remittances abroad from Australia require approval under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations, which are administered by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The purpose of the. control is at present limited to the prevention of unauthorised capital transfers. Under existing policy, therefore, there are no restrictions on remittances by Australian residents for current (i.e. noncapital) purposes, including payments for imports, or on the remittance of current net income (after taxation) accruing to firms or individuals resident overseas. The Australian trading banks have been authorised to deal with the great majority of current transactions as agents of the Reserve Bank, the main exception being that the Reserve Bank's approval must be obtained to remittances for travel and sustenance purposes in excess of certain limits. Applications by Australian residents (including companies) for the transfer of capital for investment overseas are considered on their merits. Exchange control approval may be given, for example, in cases where the investment would assist with the establishment or expansion of a market for Australian exports, would serve to protect an existing Australian investment overseas or would enable Australian residents to take up any rights they might have acquired to new issues in overseas companies. Other cases may be approved if special circumstances exist. However, ihe transfer of funds by Australian residents to overseas would not normally qualify for exchange control approval. In the case of applications by overseas residents (including companies) for the repatriation of capital investment in Australia, such applications are normally approved but no advance commitments for the repatriation of capital are given. Persons applying to banks for foreign currency are required to state the purpose for which the foreign currency is required and to furnish the information requested in connection with the relevant transaction. The Reserve Bank or agent bank would not in all cases know in advance the ultimate destination of the funds as in certain instances, such as overseas travel, the relevant banking instruments may be issued on the basis of being negotiable throughout the world.",98,Numbers Of Full Blood Aboriginals Enumerated In Each Census Divi
