I understand that in such cases it is intended hot to give to the importers at the first port of call an advantage over their fellows at the other ports. I have received a letter from Mr W. R. Anderson, of Geelong, who says that he has goods on board tbe steam-ship Kent, which reached Adelaide last Monday week, and on board the steam-ship Narrung, which reached that port last Tuesday. He points out that the Adelaide importers .by those vessels will obtain an advantage over him unless he is allowed to land his goods at the rates provided for in the old Tariff. I have also had a similar request fiom Messrs. Bright and Hitchcock, importers, Geelong. given, should it not apply to Sydney, as well as to Geelong? the Minister will make a statement covering the whole ground. telegram in which reference is made to the case of four or. five steamers. think that, unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary, consideration should be. given to importers whose goods are in vessels which had touched at an Australian port before the new Tariff was imposed, although they may not have put out their cargo at all their Australian ports of call.' Those importers, are in a position very different from that of merchants who, on 13 August, 1007. If any concession is to be I have received a",14,Setup

6,Sir William Lyne,"Personally , IThursday last, had goods in bond, because bonded goods can be cleared at any 'time, and those who kept their goods in bond until after the new Tariff came into operation did so on their' own responsibility. If a vessel had touched at Fremantle, or any other Australian port, before the new Tariff came into operation, but had not visited all her Australian ports of call, the consignees of goods at the ports which she had not' visited would not have had an opportunity to take possession, of them on paying the old rates of duty. member is saying now contrary to what he said on .Friday last ? peating my statement of Friday last, and am not in the habit of saying one thing and meaning another. The matter is one for the Minister of Trade and Customs to deal with; but, as I have been asked a question with regard to it, my reply is that I do not think it fair to differentiate between shippers by any vessel which had touched at one Australian port before the coming into operation of the new Tariff, but had not visited all her Australian ports of call. ' If means can be devised for treating all such shippers alike, I hope they will be adopted: Of course, I ' leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs; but I should advise him to try to meet consignees at ports other than the first port of call, who could not land their ^oods before the introduction of the new thing to do. allowed to land their goods onpayment of the old rates of duty, will the Government see that the goods are ear-marked, so that the public shall not be called upon to pav"" more for them ? Sir. WILLIAM LYNE -When the last Tariff was being discussed in this Chamber, it was found that it would be difficult to return over-payments of duty in cases: in which packages had been broken, although it is possible where packages have not been broken. If repayments were made .in' the first case, importers would obtain a double profit. be given. Sir WILLIAM LYNE a general rule, refund's should not be given; but the position of consignees circumstanced like the gentleman mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Corio is distinct from that of other' shippers. ' Once a vessel has called at any port of Australia, she must be regarded as having entered the Commonwealth, and ought to be able 'to ' land her goods at all her. Australian ports if payment is made on them in accordance with the Tariff rates prevailing at the time of her first reaching Australia. Therefore I think that the position of importers by any vessel that had touched at one Australian port at the date of the introduction of the new Tariff,, should be taken into consideration. expedite tbe decision of this matter as much as possible? ' ' Sif WILLIAM LYNE I shall do nothing without consulting the Minister, of Trade and Customs; but I have a'dvised him on this subject, and I hope that, if he can, he will act on my advice. Minister of Trade and Customsi f he is prepared to admit, under the old Tariff, all goods which, on the day on which the new Tariff was imposed, were in vessels then off the coast, or sighted? touched at one Australian port? allow the goods in all such vessels to be landed on payment of tbe old rates of duty? difference between the position of vessels It is a very dangerous which weresighted or off the coast on the day when the Tariff was imposed, and that of vessels which' had touched at one port, and landed part of their cargo; they do not come within the same category. I have advised the Minister of Trade and Customs to place in the. same position all importers by vessels which, on'the day of the introduction of the new Tariff, Had touched at an Australian port', and landed cargo there; but I have nothing to say in regard to goods in vessels which had been . sighted or were off the coast on that date,* because no part of those cargoes could be landed under the old Tariff, and all -who were shippers by such vessels are in the same position: tion is directed to the Minister of TradeI th'ink.that, as and Customs.

17,Mr Wilks,"I point out that' my questhe importance of the question, and, if the honourable member will give notice of it, I shall be pleased to answer it at a later date. when the Tariff was brought into operation, on Thursday last, no copy of it was available in Tasmania, so that the Customs authorities there were in complete ignorance as to the rates of duties to be levied next day. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am informed by the Minister of Trade and Customs that that is not correct; that the Tasmanian Customs officers were informed of the proposed changes. given by telegram on the night on which the new Tariff was brought down. attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the observation of the manager of the Denton Hat Mills in regard to the proposed new rates of duties on hats and caps, reported in Saturday's Melbourne Agethat competition is very keen, and that a higher duty than that previously ruling was essential.. "" We expected a great deal more,"" he said. The proposed duty on hats, caps .and bonnets has been fixed at 35 per cent., and at 30 per cent., against Great Britain. Mr Geo. Bruce, chairman of the Denton Hat Mills, observed that a duty of 30 per cent, barely covered the difference between wages here and in competing countries-if it did cover it. In some cases the proposed duty was not sufficient. In considering those statements will he bear in mind the following extract from the report of the Chairman at the last annual meeting of the Denton Hat Mills CompanyThe year had been more successful than he had anticipated. Tariff, as regarded hats, was a reduction, but the effect of this was more in shifting trade from one source to another than towards any diminution. Trade had really been better. member has asked rather a long question, but I happen to know a good deal about its subject-matter. I am rather pleased than otherwise, in view of all the statements which have been made, to find that the Tariff has not given satisfaction to some manufacturers. Though we received some communications from persons as to what they thought the duty on hats, caps, and other articles should be, the Minister of Trade and Customs and myself adopted the duty which we thought should be im[ 6 l ] -2 posed, and if it has not given satisfaction to the manufacturers we are very sorry. At the same time, I have nothing whatever to do with their profits or their losses, and I think that the honourable member cannot reasonably accuse me of putting on duties in the interests of any particular manufacturers. the Acting Prime Minister whether it is a fact that goods of British manufacture which are passing through the Customs House are charged at the rates specified for foreign goods? Sir WILLIA M LYNE I do not know. If the honourable member will give notice of This information was the question to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I dare say that he will receive an answer. Air.

Prime Minister whether he will have the return referred to compiled so as to show, in separate columns, the old Tariff, the new Tariff, the recommendations of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission, and also those of the free-trade membess of that body, so that we can have all the information in a compact form?

It would have been useless for I desire to ask the me to bring in the Excise principle in regard to harvesters, strippers, and other articles if I am to deal with the whole of the Tariff under the system referred to, afterwards ignoring what I had proposed in the Tariff in the first instance.

Since notice was given of these questions, my attention has been directed to the action referred to. 2. I am aware that in the order published in the New Zealand Gazette, most of the firms against whom the order has been made are said to have their offices or places of business in Sydney, and in three cases, in Melbourne. 3. I have given instructions that inquiries are to be made into the nature of the business of those persons or firms against whom the order referred to has been made, that I may satisfy myself whether similar action should be taken here. FOR HONOURS. of External Affairs, upon notice1. Whether the recent grant of Knighthoods and Orders to Australian citizens was made on the recommendation of the Governor General and his Advisers? 2. Were they consulted at all in this matter? the honourable member's questions are:r. Ministers are aware that recommendations for the honours mentioned are made through the State Governors, but have no knowledge of their number or nature. For this reason, among others, it is impossible for me to reply further to the first question. 2. Any suggestions for the conferring of honours made directly from the public to the Governor General, are referred by him to the Prime Minister. It may be added that the general method of dealing with recommendations for honours employed by the Colonial Office, has been the subject of several express protests from this Government. During the recent Conference in London, the Prime Minister, after consulting his fellow representatives, personally pointed out some serious defects of the existing method to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies. So far, there has been no promise of any amendment.

Trade and Customs, upon notice-Whether he will take steps so that, when the Tariff is before the House, information may be available to members, approximately, as to1. The quantity consumed in Australia of the goods on which the proposed duty is to be levied, as compared with the quantity of such goods produced or manufactured in Australia, as the case may be? 2. Whether the production or manufacture of such goods is being carried on at a profit or otherwise, and to what extent? answers' to the honourable member's questions are as follow 1. The approximate quantities or values of imported goods consumed in Australia are set out in the Trade Statistical Return, published by the Commonwealth Statistician. It is not practicable to"" readily ascertain the quantities of such goods produced or manufactured in Australia. 2. This cannot be stated without a knowledge of the financial affairs of the producers and manufacturers, but it is presumed that the industries are not generally carried on at a loss. of Defence, upon noticer. Why has Lieut. Russell, of the Perth Highlanders, not been charged before a military tribunal with conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman, he having been expelled from the Perth Stock Exchange, of which he was a member, after being charged by the Stock Exchange Committee with dishonourable conduct, in that he, when sued for balances due by him to H . L . Conran, a member of the Adelaide Stock Ex1905, make oath and say that "" the transactions between him and the said H . L . Conran were gambling transactions, and were illegal by section 12 of the Police Act Amendment Act of 1893 (No. 1),"" although the transactions between H . L . Conran and Lieut. Russell were ordinary ""bear"" or other share transactions, so that he was unanimously expelled from the Stock Exchange at a special meeting held on 22nd May, 1906? 2. As the military regulations provide that ""every officer whose character or ""conduct as an officer and gentleman has been impugned, must submit the case within a reasonable time to hisCommanding Officer or other competent military authority for investigation, and officers of all ranks will so act as not only to insure respect for authority, but also to foster feelings of selfrespect and personal honour so essential for military efficiency,"" have the regulations beec ignored or suspended in Lieut. Russell's case. If not, why has he not been dealt with under same? 3. Is the standard of personal honour for commissioned officers of the Australian Military Forces such that an officer who has been expelled from a Stock Exchange for dishonourable conduct, is nevertheless deemed by the military authorities worthy to wear His Majesty's uniform. If not, why is Lieut. Russell permitted to wear that uniform and retain his commission? orable member's questions are as followIn March last a Military Board of Inquiry, the members of which were militia officers who are also members of the legal profession, was assembled at Perth to investigate the case of Lieut. Russell, whose character had been impugned. The Commandant reported that, after perusal, the evidence taken, the accusations against Lieut. Russell had not, in his opinion, been substantiated, but recommended that the papers be referred to the Crown Solicitor for his 1 opinion on certain legal technicalities. The whole of the papers were then referred to the Crown Solicitor for advice, as to whether any charge lies against Lieut. Russell under M i l i tary Regulations, and, if so, what.

I 'am of opinion that the Regulation was not intended to include any act unbecoming a gentleman, such as evading a debt of honour by pleading the Gaming Act; but something that is, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, behaving in a scandalous. manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman. The Crown Solicitor was then asked whether -the Department had any power under.the Defence Act to. take further action, and his reply was that any further action could not be taken under the Act or Regulations, because Lieutenant Russell had not committed any breach of same; and, further, that, in his opinion, evading the payment of a debt by pleading the Gaming Act is not an offence against the Regulation quoted, although no gentleman would be likely to do it. The question of -amending the Regulations with a view of providing for cases similar to that under notice is now under consideration. the Minister of Defence, upon notice1.

The Committee has been assured that every effort will be made to secure the appointment of qualified men for all these positions, but it was pointed out that there is not in every State machinery provided for the training of qualified veterinary surgeons. obtained. is also to be considered the injustice which the amendment might involve to existing States officers, many of whom are thoroughly competent men. It would probably lead to the exclusion of some officers in the States services at tbe present time who, as a result of their experience in quarantine work, have become thoroughly competent for the purpose. fied veterinary surgeon is employed for this work. competent officers performing work of this nature, but they are not all legally qualified veterinary surgeons. Victoria. Queensland, New South Wales, and Souths t rill 1 ^ In some of the States there is no means of obtaining a certificate as a legally qualified veterinary surgeon. I would ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. The question has already been fought out. Every time that a Department is taken over by the Commonwealth, we are urged not to do an injustice to States officers. The amendment, however, would probably, have the effect of excluding competent men. would have that effect, and I therefore ask the honourable member not to press it . When this question was previously under -consideration, I took up the position that it was properly one of Executive responsibility. Having closely examined sub-clause 2 of clause 53, however, I find that, in the light of that provisort, there is much to be said for the amendment. In the first place, that sub-clause provides that if the imported animals are accompanied by a certificate of "" an approved veterinary surgeon"" at the port of shipment, a certain procedure shall be adopted. Why should we apply to the port of shipment certain essentials which the Minister says we are incapable of applying to the port of landing? The Minister tells us that in some of the ports the services of a legally qualified veterinary surgeon could not be obtained. was not aware that there was in all the States a means of providing for the registration of a legally qualified veterinary surgeon. ME . KELLY -Then the sooner there is the better. I admit the justice of the Minister's contention that there are States officers who are as competent as are veterinary surgeons to examine stock; but the In every State a qualihonorable gentleman's wish to safeguard the rights of those officers can be very easily observed, whilst at the same time we agree to the spirit of this amendment. All that is required is a slight verbal alteration, or the granting of a reserve power to the Minister, if he wished it , to keep in employment States officers possessing "" approved "" qualifications. In reply to the honourable member for Corangamite, the Minister laboured the injustice which he said would be done to It is also the case in States officers if the amendment were inserted. I should be very sorry to think that we should be so sensitive to the rights of States officers as to expose to the risk of infection the now healthy flocks of Australia. This amendment is really a safeguard against the introduction of disease which might prove absolutely destructive to the numerous stock upon which the prosperity of the country depends. If we are to consider existing rights, let us, at any rate, give first attention to the right of the people of Australia to keep their stock as free as pos sible from disease. If the amendment!, r haying that object in view, is sound in No t at all. principle, a consideration for the rights of this or that officer should' not weigh for a moment with the Committee as against a desire to insure the safety of the stock of the continent. In the light of sub-clause 2 of clause 53, I shall have to review the decision at which I arrived at an earlier stage, when I took the view that the appointment of officers was properly a question of Executive responsibility. In. view of the provisions of that sub-clause, and for other reasons that have been submitted! I think it might be wise to insert the",22,Quarantine Bill

We modified clause 57, by providing that the quarantine officer therein named should be one prescribed by the regulations, and, -as the officer under this clause will have a similar duty devolving upon him, I should like to know whether the honourable member for Corangamite would not be satisfied with a like amendment. the amendment providing that qualified veterinary surgeons are prescribed. selection of the officer to the Minister. We amended clause 57 by inserting the words "" as prescribed,"" thus indicating the view of the Committee that it was desirable to have appointed officers possessing qualifications as experts. Under clause 57, as amended, the officer must be of sufficient competency. He might not be a veterinary suigeon, although, perhaps, in most cases he ought to be. I have not such a high opinion of the qualifications of some veterinary surgeons that I should like to put a ban on the employment of other competent persons available. accept an amendment similar to that made in clause 57. ence between providing that the officer examining stock at the port of shipment shall be a veterinary surgeon and leaving to the Minister the option of determining the capacity of the person appointed for such a purpose at the port of entry.

If the amendment be carried, the inspectors of stock in Tasmania will be shut out; we shall not be able to take them. I therefore earnestly suggest over. Such officers as Mr Tabart, whose certificate will be accepted in«any port of Australia, as well as Mr Curtin, the inspector at Launceston, and others, who are not veterinary surgeons, but know as much about stock as some of those who are, would be excluded. The Minister is anxious to work in harmony with the States, but the amendment would not permit him to do so. Tasmania is quite satisfied to have as inspectors of stock the men to whom I have referred, and I hope that the amendment will be rejected. not think that the proposal of the honourable member for Corangamite is necessary. He is naturally anxious, as every one of us must be, that competent men shall be I should be satisfied with appointed to make the necessary inspections under this B ill . I gather that what is in his mind is that there is a possibility of officers being deputed for work of this kind who may not have the qualifications essential to enable them to express an authoritative opinion upon the soundness or otherwise of animals which they are called upon to examine. But when he proposes that a duly qualified veterinary surgeon shall be appointed for the work, I can appreciate the difficulty with which the Minister may be faced in not being able, at a moment's notice, to secure the services of a' duly qualified veterinary surgeon for the purpose. appointing a man at a moment's notice. culties in the country districts. the honourable member .should withdraw his amendment, with a view to substitute the words "" duly qualified"" after the word "" A .

I take it that the desire is that an officer appointed for work of this kind should have the qualifications which would enable him to express an authoritative opinion, but, as has been pointed out, there are many men acting as stock inspectors who have not qualified as veterinary surgeons, but who, nevertheless, have all the qualifications necessary f o i discharging their duties.

108,Mr Johnson,"I would suggest thatThe point that is novy under review was threshed out last week,' whilst the honourable member for Corangamite was absent. I proposed that the officer should be a duly qualified veterinary surgeon, and a compromise was arrived at to the effect that the officer should be "" duly prescribed."" the words "" as prescribed. "" would be a regulation prescribing the qualifications of the officers. As representing a good many stock-owners, I naturally feel responsible for safeguarding their interests. I consider, however, that if the officer had to be duly prescribed for the particular work by regulation, it would be as great a safeguard as is really required for efficiency's sake. I suggest to the honourable member that he should amend his amendment to make it read that the officer must be specially prescribed for the particular work of inspecting stock. is an unfortunate fact that throughout Australia we are at present behind the times with regard to veterinary work. Let me quote my own experience. had eight years of close study in London hospitals, devoting myself during that time to pathology, I came out to Australia and went in for farming. my knowledge of pathology might be of some advantage to me in working amongst animals. But I felt that it was necessary to get further instruction in veterinary work. I therefore came to Melbourne, and went through a course of instruction at the Veterinary College, under Mr should be done by men who know someKendall. I devoted myself to a special class of study designedfor farmers, and passed through that course. Since then I have had hundreds of horses and cattle, thousands of sheep, and a great number of pigs through my hands. But notwithstanding all the experience I have had in one way and another, publicly and privately, I always call in a qualified veterinary surgeon when any difficulty arises in connection with my own stock. As that is what I do in private life, surely I am only faithfu l to my trust to the people when, in dealing with a matter of great public importance, I insist that the Government shall avail itself of the assistance of properly qualified veterinary surgeons for work of the kind contemplated under this B ill . Australia has been, is, and will be, so long as the temper of honourable members and of mem2 bers of the States Parliaments throughout Australia remains as it is with regard toveterinary science, behind the times. But the question is of very great moment to the country. The honourable member for Bass has lectured the Committee, as he usually does, for differing from him, and from the Minister. opinions.. of a little lecture, which we all enjoyed. Buti f Tasmania has been behind the times in the matter of veterinary science, she w i ll continue to be so unless she recognises that to become an efficient veterinary surgeon a man must be qualified not only by practica? experience, but also by a course of study. Without both study and experience a man cannot undertake veterinary work to the satisfaction of the public, and the advantage of the country. It is unfortunately the case that in some States, Victoria being one of them, some inspectors of stock have been appointed who know nothing whatever about stock diseases. AfterI had no Victoria except for Tasmania sending over sheep and cattle in the early days. mania also sent over fathers and mothers I considered that for. our people. We are grateful to Tasmania for many things, though we are not always grateful to the honourable member for his lectures. The point at issue is that my amendment simply asks the Government to say that at all times, when imported animals have to be inspected, the work thing about the diseases of stock, and about' the business of examination, and who do not proceed merely by rule of thumb. Take the case of a man who is qualified as a veterinary surgeon, and who is a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons of London. Such a man is a scientist. A man who has gone through the course of instruction that is prescribed at the present day, and who is finally turned out as a M.R.C.V.S., commands respect on account of his science in any part of the world. I am well aware that we cannot' get a sufficient number of members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to carry out the work under this B ill. But, nevertheless, there are sufficient men in Australia, some of them excellent veterinary surgeons, who have had practical experience, and who have gone through a",24,Quarantine Bill

What is required in Australia is that when such men have qualified themselves they shall have a chance of employment in this class of work No man, no matter what his experience with stock may have been, is qualified to discharge functions under this ""Bill unless he has studied the diseases of stock pretty deeply. lected that the quarantine officers who will have to examine stock will require a knowledge, not only of the ordinary diseases of animals which occur from dav to clay on a farm, but also of the diseases of imported stock, some of them of an obscure character. Unless a man has studied veterinary science he is not qualified, and any certificate that he may give is not worth the paper upon which it .is written. A veterinary surgeon need not be always employed, but may be paid a retaining fee, so that he may be called in at any time to make an inspection. tine officer. am suggesting is that a qualified man should be paid a. retaining fee to examine imported animals. There would then be security throughout Australia that all imported animals had been examined, and that, so far as up-to-date veterinary science was concerned, pronounced would we permitted the present position in regard to veterinary science in Australia to continue. This is the national Parliament, and we ought to do something to encourage the States Parliaments to take some steps in the direction I have indicated. It would never do to permit, on sentimental considerations, unqualified men to continue to examine stock; we ought to be brave enough to say that qualified men must be employed upon such work. human beings, we regard all unqualified men as "" quacks "" ; and, in my opinion, unqualified inspectors, in the case of stock, are ""quacks,"" and, therefore, a danger. For example, the other day, in a case quoted in the newspapers, an inspector declared an animal to-be suffering from the bot fly, whereas, on examination, the animal's liver was found to be disintegrated, and it was shown to be suffering from pleurisy. There was a beautiful diagnosis ! They command respect surgeons make quite as ibig a mistake. tioners, too. mistakes are made by both veterinarysurgeons and medical practitioners; but the chances are always that, in 90 per cent, of the cases the medical man is right, whereas, in an equal percentage of cases, It has to be recolthe "" quack "" is wrong. would not surely say that competent State officers are "" quacks,"" because they are not veterinary surgeons? spectors who are not qualified in the category of ""quacks,"" if they undertake to examine an animal and give a certificate as to its freedom from disease. Why, we have known of State school teachers being appointed stock inspectors. What sort of live stock could' they have examined previously ? Then we have known of butchers being given similar positions. What knowledge can a butcher have of the diseases of stock? He may occasionally have come across a cow or other animal with tuberculosis, and may have acouired a knowledge of the appearance of diseased lungs after death; but the Bill deals with diseases before death. We want to safeguard a great and important industry, which can be safeguarded only in the way I have suggested. I have no other desire those animals were than to serve the best interests of the free from disease. It people. Many of the diseases introduced be a standing disgrace if in animals are communicable to man-; and many of those diseases have never been seen by our stock inspectors, because, fortunately, the diseases have not been introduced, or, in any case, only in very rare instances. Any carelessness on our part might result in the introduction of a disease communicable to man, and its ravages might be widespread. And the blame for any such outbreak would f a l l on us who are responsible; for that and the other In the case of reasons I have mentioned. I submit the amendment. If the amendment be carried, we shall lose the services of all our Chief Inspectors of Stock. the services of these gentlemen for many years; and Australia is to-day freer from disease than is any country in the world.

I hope the honourable member will not press his amendment unduly. order that honourable members might satisfactorily discuss this Bill, the Attorney General was good enough to place in our hands certain papers, which I understand he has collected for our inspection. One of these papers is a communication from Mr S. W. Moore, Minister of Mines and Agriculture, New South Wales, and in it there is the followingFurther, there is no provision in the B i ll as to the status of the quarantine officer to carry out the inspection of imported animals. Ob-' viouslv this officer must necessarily be a qualified veterinary surgeon, but, evidently, so far as the provisions of the B ill go, a Customs House officer could legally carry out the inspection if authorized. The absence of any reference to the veterinary staff which will necessarily be employed for the satisfactory administration of the provisions of the B ill , detracts from its are handed over to the importer, and left value, as the manner in which the provisions of the Bill are given effect to becomes optional, and is, therefore, an unsatisfactory substitute for the excellent system which has been so successfully adopted in this State for some considerable period. I point out to the Attorney-General, who has had a legal education, much in the same way as the honourable member for Corangamite had had. a medical education, that all legislation of this kind should be guided by scientific principles. One of the first questions which a. medical man is asked when he enters the witness-box is, "" Are you a qualified medical practitioner ? "" If the answer is in the affirmative, the evidence ' of such a witness carries considerable weight. And we would apply the same principle to the administration of this law. Enormous responsibilities will be placed in our hands if this Bill is passed. We propose to take from the States certain of their responsibilities, and necessarily it behoves us to discharge them satisfactorily. If an imported beast were condemned and killed, and action brought against the Commonwealth for damages, and if the Minister had to tell the Court, "" This man, who is an excellent officer, has been looking after cattle, sheep, and pigs,"" he would I do not know that be asked, ""Is he a legally qualified man?"" He would have to reply, "" No ; he is not."" The Court would say, "" Oh! then oh his evidence you destroyed the beast?"" In such circumstances, any jury would, without hesitation, give a verdict for the plaintiff. On that ground, I suggest to the Minister that he should adopt the amendment of the honourable member for Corangamite. should like to supplement what I have already said on this subject on one point. The Minister appears to consider that we are now rediscussing a matter which was settled in Committee some days ago. He evidently thinks the same principle is at stake, but he will find it is not so if he looks at this and the adjoining clauses. The last time the question was touched upon, the honourable member for Corangamite sought to provide that every quarantine officer who might be called upon to perform any of the duties under this Bill must be a duly qualified. veterinary surgeon, but he was beaten. A majority of honourable members thought it would be tying the hands of the Executive too much to take such a step. The Minister will find that the present proposal applies only to this clause. It declares that before animals free to mingle with the herds of Australia, they shall be declared clean from disease. Surely that is a very fair safeguard. Had it related to the previous clause, which makes it necessary that a quarantine officer should order stock into quarantine, I should have regarded it as unnecessary. The question before us is not that of ordering stock into quarantine as in clause 52, or of examining and ordering into quarantine as in clause 55, but is a question of allowing stock out of quarantine, and the least we can do, having due regard to our responsibilities, is to impose some such safeguard",26,Quarantine Bill

If there are State officers who are admittedly competent, why should not their services be retained for the purpose?

Corangamite regards, as the only evidence of competency, the possession of a veterinary surgeon's diploma; but if that were insisted on, men like Mr Tabart, and others who are admittedly competent, would be excluded. The appointments to positions of this kind must in future be made more and more from men who have had a scientific training; but we ought not to do an injustice to State officers, or make the measure practically' unworkable'by providing only one or two ports for the landing of stock, which would be the effect of requiring the appointment of veterinary surgeons at all such ports. To require the appointment of veterinary surgeons at such ports as Townsville and Rockhampton, behind which there is country carrying a large number of stock, might unduly hamper the working of -the measure. has not been complained during the debate that diseases of stock have been admitted into Australia under the present system, which is evidence that the work of the existing quarantine officers has been satisfactory.

We have a number of stock inspectors who would not find it difficult to pass as veterinary surgeons. Chief do so? the inducement. I know one inspector who is a very capable man in regard to diseases of horses, cattle, and sheep, and an excellent bacteriologist.

I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that we should have the best officers obtainable; but we can get efficient officers without insisting on the appointment of veterinary surgeons. If we The honourable member for require that only veterinary surgeons shall be appointed for this work, we shall be making positions for persons who have only just passed their examinations, and who, although theoretically qualified, have little practical experience. I prefer the man of much experience to the man who has only just passed his examinations. When we imagine that we are ill , we go, not to the young doctor, however brilliant his university career may have been, but to the practitioner of experience.

I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that it is highly desirable that we should, where possible, employ veterinary surgeons. much in the contention that, if veterinary surgeons were* employed, the present State officers would lose their positions; because the only occasions upon which veterinary surgeons will be absolutely necessary will be when certain beasts have to be examined. have a veterinary surgeon always on the spot at every port of landing; such men would not be always available at places like Normanton and other ports of large stock districts.

I should be very loath to indict the latter's engineering capacity, but I cannot see that his bridge provides a safe passage for quarantined animals into There is not Australia. To provide, as the Minister desires, that the animals have to be passed by a quarantine officer as "" prescribed "" merely inserts the intention of ' the Committee in the B ill , and that ' is that the Government shall have power to prescribe who is to do all these things.

With these unknown and uninvestigated diseases in contiguity to Australia, it becomes a matter of the highest moment that the duly qualified officers under this Bill shall be officers who are certified as possessing the requisite knowledge and skill to perform the duties which it assigns to them. I hope that the Minister will consent to waive his amendment in favour of the course which has been suggested by the honourable member for Capricornia, and which provides the requisite variation in practice by the insertion of the words ""where available."" Of course, if there-is none of this skill available, then the next best skill must be obtained. Everything is provided for. But, so far as the main ports of Australia are concerned, I think that, in spite of the Bill, it ought to 'be a very solemn obligation on the Government to see that no one but a duly qualified veterinary surgeon shall take the oversight of the importation of stock. We cannot be too careful in our efforts to keep out diseases. There are some diseases which have not been introduced yet. When diseases are introduced, it seems to me that they thrive.here in a way in which, perhaps, they do not thrive in any other country. One reason why we ought to have prohibition of diseases as far as possible is to be found in the ravages which they make, and in the facility with which they seem to spread and multiply once they get through the quarantine which we impose. With regard to the necessity of having the requisite skill for investigating these matters at the port of entry, we ought to 'remember that very often diseases are latent for a great length of time. I quoted here the other day the case of a dog which developed hydrophobia seven months after the time when it was proved that he took the disease into his system. disease that we want to keep out of Australia if possible. That case, I think, occurred in the Island of Corfu, off the coast of Greece. One cannot imagine what would be the result to our stock if a disease like that broke out amongst our dogs. would not have discovered that the dog was diseased at the moment of entrv. who discovered the disease in the dog, but it does not take much to discover it after it has broken out. When once disease breaks out in that way, it does not require any "" discovering,"" but we do need; the requisite skill to detect, these diseases ire their latent forms, and to prevent the possibility of their gaining a foothold in Australia. Therefore, we should leave something to the discretion of the Minister in regard to Inter-State quarantine, whilst 'rigidly insisting upon the maintenance of a proper standard of skill and ability, so far as the main ports of Australia are concerned. wish to endorse all that has been said by the honourable member for Capricornia. I think that quarantine officers should be qualified veterinary surgeons where the latter are available. Such a provision would meet the objections which have been raised in regard to our northern ports.

The honourable gentleman agrees that it is necessary to have our veterinary science brought up to date. The work of examining imported animals for blood diseases is of a special character.

Amendment agreed to. [5.3] -This clause gives rise to the whole question of whether or not quarantine should be imposed in respect of all stock entering Australia, and whether or not it should be conditioned. The provision as it stands will, if passed, mean a very radical departure from the practice hitherto adopted in New South Wales. Camels, horses, dogs-in short, stock of every kind-o n entering New South Wales, must undergo six months quarantine irrespective of whether or not they are free from disease. There is a long standing grievance among the people there regarding the way in which quarantine is evaded by resorting to practices obtaining in some of the other States. When we were last discussing this matter, I pointed out the difference between the treatment of dogs entering New South Wales, and that of dogs entering this State. Here, there used to be private quarantine, and I am assured that dogs intended to be imported into New South Wales were often put ashore at Melbourne, where they went into private quarantine, and were subsequently taken quietly across the border. If the clause be passed, it will mean, to say the least, a very radical departure from the quarantine system in force in New South Wales. There we do hot accept, any one's certificate as to the health of an imported animal. It is put into quarantine the moment it arrives, and has to remain there for six months, so that any latent disease may have time to develop. I do not discuss for the moment the question of whether such a system is, in its entirety, a wise one. Perhaps it is a little severe, but, at any rate, it is safe, and our first obligation, with regard to the quarantining of animals is to insure security from disease. Shall we have sufficient security under the Bill as proposed by the Minister? We are told that it will be within the discretion of the Minister to permit imported stock to forego quarantine. lowed only in the case of -animals that had complied with the provisions of sub-clause 2. say that it would be conditioned. In the fiist place there is to be a certificate of an approved veterinary surgeon at the port of ment, and' that they then were in good health and free from disease. How can a veterinary surgeon, at the port of embarkation, certify that when they land they will not have in their system the latent germs of some epidemical disease ? that animals so treated must have been imported from a country declared to be free from disease. material and necessary condition. I confess candidly that I should prefer some automatic quarantine of all stock entering Australia. Let it be a short period, if honourable members desire it. South Australia, where the period of quarantine is prescribed, and in some cases is very short. this measure, and it probably will be done. be. It is of the very gravest importance that we should prevent the introduction of new, and, indeed, old diseases, so far as lies within our power.

After sufficient time has elapsed to prove beyond possibility of cavil that there is no danger of any latent disease breaking out, then, and only then, should they be admitted into the interior of Australia. Had such precautions been taken years ago, Australia would have avoided losses amounting to millions of money in respect of stock that have fallen victim to various fel l diseases.

Our intention is that it shall be used only in very exceptional cases.

That, in itself, 'will necessitate an investigation. there must be a certificate by a veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment that the animals are in good health, and free from disease, whilst on arrival here they are to be subjected to a further examination by an officer, who must report to the Minister.

[.f.io] -The more I examine this clause the more I am satisfied that it is contemplated under it to allow some imported stock to be admitted without going into -quarantine.

It is an exceptional provision, and these officers are very much afraid that animal diseases will be allowed to creep in under it. cessity for it? clause was inserted at all. I do not think that it is really necessary, because without it the period of quarantine in regard to any particular animal could be prescribed. Where there is very little danger, of course the regulations could prescribe the shortest period possible. Buti f there were such a likelihood the quarantine could by regulation be extended. The Bill will work automatically in the ratio of the increasing fear. But unless the Minister is very cautious, and provides for regulations to neutralize the clause in respect Then of some animals, it may very well be that diseases will be imported which will be disastrous to our flocks and. herds. In Western Australia camels have been allowed to land which are spreading one of the direst diseases to stock. I dare say that the Minister over there would have said beforehand' that there was not the slightest danger. But it has occurred, and it behoves us to be very careful that fresh diseases are not introduced. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [5.12]. I think it is very necessary that stock .from abroad should be put into quarantine until in the opinion of officers of the Quarantine Department it may safely be withdrawn.

I agree that the clause is not required at all. Every provision has been made for the free interchange of stock between States, and we do want if we can to stop the importation of diseases such as that which the honourable and learned member for Angas has indicated as having been introduced by camels into Western Australia. I fear that if the clause remains in the Bill it will be a distinct source of weakness, and may have a serious effect. It is most important to keep out stock diseases of every sort. Considering our vast interests in stock, the. utmost precautions should be used. The Minister should be very careful indeed, even when the country from which stock is imported is supposed to be clean, to quarantine imported animals until all possibility of danger is removed. The honourable and learned member for Angas has mentioned the mischief occasioned by the introduction of disease in Western Australia through the medium of camels. I urge the Minister to take the most ample precautions to insure that our large Commonwealth interests in this respect are safeguarded to the utmost extent.

Where plants or animals are being introduced into a State, and the regulations of that State, which are in whole or in part unnecessary for the purpose of preventing the introduction of disease, have the effect of interfering with the freedom of If this precaution be not trade and commerce amongst the States, the Governor General is given power by proclamation to direct that those regulations shall cease to apply; or, if they do apply, he may direct that they shall apply with such restrictions, limitations, or modifications as he may direct. The object is to prevent the unreasonable use of such powers by a State. They may be used not merely to prevent the spread of diseases, but practically to stop trade. The honourable member for Brisbane submitted an amendment, which honourable members opposite preferred at the time, in which he endeavoured to provide that certain powers should not be exercised unless the Governor General certified that the execution of such powers by a State operated in a manner prejudicial to the interests of any other State of the Commonwealth. What we have done, in this case, is to confine ourselves .to matters with which we have power to deal. The power now sought has already been exercised in the case of the Post and Telegraph and the Defence Acts. on that point;' and there was a strong opinion against allowing the States laws to be neutralized at the discretion of the Minister. the Government are only creating a row. doing is with the object of preventing a row. For instance, if one State were exercising powers, as against the other five States, so as to exclude the goods of those five States, the Commonwealth would have power to make regulations.

The Defence Act and the Post and Telegraph Act contain sections setting forth when the States Acts shall cease to apply; and the power sought is a necessary power, which, however, will not be exercised unless the necessity arises. gerous power. dangerous power. It will be a power exercised only in such cases in which the Governor General is satisfied that there is an undue interference with trade and commerce between the States.

No doubt the Minister -will have power, from time to time, to suspend the operation of a State law if he so pleases; and he may do that in the case of one State, and not of the five other States. If trouble arose, after a time, on pressure being brought to bear, the Minister might settle the question by stating that the particular law of' the State had-obstructed the passage of animals from one State to another. This is not saying that the Federal law should be substituted for a State law. That question has already been dealt with; and we twve settled how our regulation shall be substituted for those of the States. While not forgetting States laws, we are taking power from time to time, as occasion requires, to suspend the operation of the laws of a particular State in relation, not only to animals-the . dealing with which has been left to the Federation-bu t in relation to plants, the dealing with which has not been left to the Federation. In clause 13, we have recognised a desire that, for the present, we should not altogether supersede the laws of the States in respect to plants; and we declare that our regulations shall not be called into operation except in the case of a State not exercising the power which it possesses. But we are now interfering with a State by 'declaring that, not only in regard to animals, but also in regard to plants, the law of that State shall-not operate any longer. In the first place, is this expedient ? I do not think so, because it means the suspension of the law of a particular State for a particular purpose. That may place the Commonwealth in rather an invidious position. For those who do not wish to go the full length of throwing out the whole clause, it might be as well to start with Minister the an amendment to strike out the words "" or plants,"" so as to make the clause consistent with the Bill. The object of that would be to prevent this interference taking place with the fruit regulations of the States. I received a letter last Friday on this point from South Australia, expressing the opinions of the Fruit-growers' Association, which is a very representative body there. They particularly asked that for the present, at all events, the State laws should be left absolutely unfettered as regards plants. This is a very wide power of interference. ourselves in connection with this clause, as we did.with a previous one? it is not so easy to condition the exercise of a discretion by the Governor General. to put a limitation upon the operation of the law. We said it was not to come into force until the Governor General dida certain thing. What the honourable member suggests in this case is to impose a condition on the exercise of the power given by the clause to the Governor General. In the other case, power was given to. the Governor General to condition the operation of the Federal law. . It really was to the effect that the Federal law was not to supersede the State law, except in a certain event, to be declared by proclamation. This clause says that when a proclamation is issued, the State law is to go. The honourable member for. Parramatta asks whether we'cannot insert the qualification that the power of the Governor General to issue the proclamation should itself be conditional. That could be done, but it would be somewhat anomalous. I would prefer to test the feeling of the Committee towards the clause by an amendment to strike out the words "" or plants,"" so as to limit it to that extent at any rate. Very likely, however, if that were done, the dlause would not be supported by those who wish it to be passed, because it seems to be directed chiefly against the plant laws of the States.",36,Pairs

This clause is not directed against that at all. Its object is to enable the Governor General to say that the State, laws are not required for the purpose of preventing disease, that they are causing friction between State and State, or that they are unnecessary. In clause 13 we put the words in for greater caution, so that if pealed an Act of a State. the State laws were inefficacious, for quarantine purposes, to prevent disease, we could then bring in the necessary provision to render the law effective. This, however, is for quite a different purpose; that if a State law, although considered by the State to be required for local purposes, is working so as to promote dissent on the part of another State, the Minister may step in and suspend its operation, thus settling a dispute between two States by suspending the operation of the law of one. If that is done it will lead to a good deal of friction. I do not know that we have power to do what is proposed. When the Defence Bill was before the House in 1903, it was questioned whether we could, expressly repeal the laws of the States. There was a fairly long debate on the point, and, as usual, some sort of working compromise of opinion was come to, under which power was taken to declare that at a particular time, or for particular purposes, the Defence law of a State was not to operate. In that case the question of the validity of that reservation would -never be tested, because ou'f power of legislation as regards defence was practically exclusive, and the States had, therefore, no need for any of their local laws. The administration of the local law passed holus-bolus to us on the transfer of the Department to the Federation. All that was said by that Act was that the law that we, as a Federal Parliament, wanted to apply for the future, was the law as it existed upon the statute-book of the Federation, or on the statute-books of the States until the date when we had determined that the State laws should no longer apply. That was a matter purely concerning ourselves, but' this is quite' different, because, in this case, we shall be modifying, or attempting to some extent to repeal, the operation of the State laws, which, otherwise, would be concurrent with the law of the Federation. An attempted repeal, -pro .tanto, in the Defence Act-and the same applies to the Post Office Act-is therefore essentially different from the position we are now asked to take up in attempting to repeal the State laws, instead of allowing the repeal to be brought about through the principle of inconsistency. Whether we have that power, I do not presume to say. Some very competent authorities thought that there was an exceedingly great doubt as to its existence. Consequently, I do not think that 'from the very start we have ever expressly rethat they shall cease to apply. ticular cases mentioned, but we know that they are not at all analogous to this. In those instances the law of the future wasto be purely a Federal law, and all-that we did was-instea d of administering the laws as passed by the States, which stood without any provision in them inconsistent with the Federal Act-to declare the particular time at which those laws would no longer apply. That, however, would be purely for Federal purposes, because the administration for the future would also be purely Federal. The clause says that if the Governor General is satisfiedThat any laws or regulations of a State (b) have the effect of interfering with freedom of trade or commerce among the Stateshe may, by proclamation, direct that those laws or regulations shall cease to apply, or shall apply only subject to such restrictions, limitations, or modifications as he directs. If the State law or regulation does interfere with trade and commerce, it is bad under section 92 of the Constitution, and this express provision is not required to declare it so. The Minister says that it is intended to enable a litigant to rely upon the express declaration of a Federal Act-whic h he thinks would be conclusive, and probably it would-instea d of challenging the interference on the ground that it was against section 92 of the",37,Pairs

In the latter event, the litiis unnecessary to insert in it a provision such gant's proof, instead of being a Federal Act, would be simplyfacts showing that there was such an interference, and that procedure, of course, might be more expensive for him. That is the only possible difsecure a fair acceptance for the measure ference that can be made if paragraph b is passed. It may perhaps facilitate the proof of an offence against section 92 of the Constitution by having the fact that it did occur evidenced by a proclamation, althe. past, been well exercised by State though, of course, that it actually did occur authorities, common sense should teach us would be no more sure' because the Governor General had said so. There might be no offence at all. The Courts might, if this clause were passed, have to take our fiat upon the matter as conclusive in a case where no jury would accept it or. the evidence. That possibility might perhaps outweigh the advantage of the greater facility given to a litigant to assert with conclusiveness that such an interference did exist. I prefer to leave section 92 of the Constitution-whic h is exceptional here, and is not in the American Constitutionunfettered in its operation, without having it safeguarded by the power we possess under paragraph 1. of section '51 of the Constitution to make this further provision under the trade and commerce clause. On these grounds, I have great doubt as to the desirableness of passing the clause. At all events, I am inclined to vote against it, and, before doing so, to test to what extent it should be applied by moving the excision of the words "" or plants."" For the present, however, I merely indicate the possibility that I may move in that direction. -The amendment inserted by the Minister the other day gave general satisfaction, both to the Committee and those particularly interested. It enabled them to retain all the power they require, and it allowed us to exercise especially the power we desire to prevent the importation of diseases into Australia. This clause gives the Government power to lift any local quarantine. State regulation is unduly interfering with freedom of trade. monwealth Government power to lift a quarantine in defiance of a State law or regulation.

[5.44] -It is difficult to know what it is best to do in this matter. I should prefer to deal with an extreme case under the provisions of clause 13.

If the clause is passed in its present form, it will be an unrestricted clause.. ject to none of the limitations which are now imposed by clause 13. It will be remembered that in clause 13 we put in an amendment to the effect that paragraphs g, h, and i shall be put in operation only as a reserve act. In that clause we take the power, if necessary, -to step in and reinforce the quarantine which may be imposed by a State. Originally, clause 13, in paragraphs g, h, and i , provided that in certain cases the Governor General may prohibit and declare. Then we passed an amendment which provides that the Governor General shall prohibit and declare only in extreme and urgent cases. In other words, where the States are not doing their duty' in the way of repressing certain' diseases we shall have power, under that amendment, to step in and do the work for them. This new clause, I take it, is one which will enable the Federal Government to step in and give the States relief from each other. The normal condition of the Bill is that it ' is to leave in operation the State inspection laws as regards plants and animals. In that respect we do not contemplate interfering with the powers which the States exercise to-day. It is only in respect of the prohibition of diseases and the prevention of their spread from State to State that we take power, if necessary, tp step in and reinforce their quarantine. The Attorney-General .submits to-day a new clause, providing that in cases where the Governor General has satisfied himself that the State quarantine is harsh, he shall have the option of stepping in to relieve thatquarantine. My trouble is that it is not conditioned in the same way as was the repressive amendment which we passed last T h is provision was week. If the Attorney-General can put ir> a condition which will make it clear that the clause is only to be used as a reserve power, and not under the ordinary operation of the States Acts, I shall be very glad. really does say that in paragraph a. reading of the provision seems to contemplate an interference at any time when the Governor General shall deem it necessary to step in.

So far as I can understand the new clause,' it seems a new method of annulling State inspection laws. In section 112 of the Constitution there is provided a distinct method of dealing with such laws. It says. Any 'such inspection laws may be annulled by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. , The' new clause seems to be so designed as to empower the Governor General to repeal State inspection laws. It seems to be very doubtful whether that is a properexercise of the constitutional power. The new clause as it stands must have reference to State inspection laws. I submit that there is only one way of repealing objectionable regulations relating to inspection,' and that is by a distinct Act ofParlian:eu(. I doubt whether the Parliament can delegate to the Governor General a general authority to annul State inspection laws. regulations inconsistent with them. can pass' laws, or the Federal Government can pass regulations, based on Federal laws, which, if inconsistent with the States laws, will prevail over the latter.

270,Sir John Quick,"This Parliamentof a substantive character to take their place. of the Constitution, have we power to put this authority in. operation without a Bill ?' that under that section this Parliament can give to the Governor General power 'to annul State inspection laws. I believe that they must be expressly annulled by Act of Parliament. words "" annulled by the Parliament"" mean that the State inspection laws are to be annulled by an Act of this Parliament passed in the usual way. There is a great deal of force in the view presented by the honourable member for Angas. I hardly realized the significance of the new clause before I beard his address, and that has been appropriately supplemented by the deputy leader of the Opposition. I concur in their arguments. The new clause involves a method not contemplated by the Constitution, and the Minister ought to seriously consider the propriety of not pressing it. Mr W. H . IRVINE -I s there any authority for this course of action ? astounded at the proposition. Certainly, it is news to me that we can give to the Governor General a general power to repeal State inspection laws. In other words, the clause hands over to the Executive the general authority of repealing such laws when this Parliament alone has the right as well as the duty to review, and, if necessary, annul State inspection laws. are not quarantine laws. clause is passed, it will certainly operate on inspection laws, because it contemplates laws which are passed for the purpose of keeping out disease. more in that direction than will clause 13 of the Bill as passed I do not agree with the remarks of the course, limits the operation of Federal laws, but this new clause purports to limit the operation of, and to repeal and supersede by an Executive act, State laws. That, I contend, would be a very dangerous power to place in the hands of any Government. It is not contemplated by the Constitution, and probably the effect of the proposition is hardly realized by the Government at the present stage. The framers of the Constitution seem to have had a sufficient reason for placing in the Parliament the power of annulling State legislation of a particular kind, because in the Parliament the States are represented. In the Senate, the States are equally represented. The words "" Governor in Council"" do not necessarily imply parliamentary approval, they may mean merely the approval of this House. The other branch of the Legislature, which represents the States, may be altogether opposed to the action of the Ministry as represented by the Governor in Council. I can see sufficient reason for giving this Parliament power to annul a State law which interferes with freedom of trade, but I can see no reason why we should delegate that power to the Ministry of the day. When we come to look at the matter from the stand-point of freedom of trade as between the States, we cannot fail to remember that the framers of our Constitution decided upon the establishment of a special tribunal, namely, the Inter-State Commission, to deal with it. The Commission was to be a non-political body, which wpuld be free from bias, and which would not need to look for the support of a parliamentary majority. This tribunal was to view the matter from an all-round stand-point, in the interests of the whole of the States. The words "" Governor in Council"" really mean a parliamentary majority for the time being, and I do not think the power of dealing with the question of Inter-State free-trade should be delegated to such a body. I do not think that a parliamentary majority is the right tribunal to deal with these matters. I admit that by the method laid down in the Constitution their decision would rest with a parliamentary majority, but it would, at least, be a majority of both Houses of the Legislaturej which is a very different thing from the decision of the Ministry of the day. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [6.3]. honourable member for Boothby regarding the power of delegation, because if we have power to pass legislation of this kind, I think it -lhas been sufficiently decided that we have power to delegate our authority.

The same question arose in Canada, where the Supreme Court decided that such power was not vested in the Federal Parliament.' In Lefroy's Legislative Power in Canada, one proposition which the author says is established by authority isThere is no power given by the Confederation Act to the Dominion Parliament to amend or repeal an Act passed by a Provincial Legislature within the limits of its authority nor to the within the limits of the authority of the Provincial Legislatures to amend or repeal a Dominion Act. I may say that the State Parliament has just as much right to repeal a Commonwealth statute as the Commonwealth Parliament has to repeal a State statute. Under the Constitution, we have power to make laws covering a certain area, and if those laws are inconsistent with any laws passed by the States Parliaments, to the extent to which they are inconsistent, the State laws are overridden. By our substi. tuting other provisions for those which exist under State legislation, we can secure an -effective repeal of such legislation. Chief Justice Dorion, in the case of Dobie v. Temporalities Board, which is reported in /. Cartright's Reports, puts the position thusButi t is important to remember that though -the Dominion Parliament has no power directly and tolidem verbis to amend or repeal an Act passed by a Provincial Legislature within the -limits of its authority, there are many cases where its legislation may have the effect of susency with the Commonwealth Act. pending the operation of valid provincial Acts. .So it is with us. If we choose to pass any legislation upon the subject of quarantine -which conflicts with any State law upon the same subject, the latter will, to the -extent of the inconsistency, be rendered in'Operative. But we have no power beyond -that. Here, however, we are simply attempting to annul the Acts which the States Parliaments have passed within the limits -of their own authority. I urge the Attorney-General to give this matter his earnest consideration, because every step that we -take which improperly overrides the legislation of the State authorities can only -lead to vexatious litigation, to uncertainty, and ultimately to the humiliation of this Parliament.

The position is altogether different in connection with the exercise by the Commonwealth of. its powers in respect to quarantine, because in connection with this subject there is a-concurrent power in the States, as well as the Federal power, embodied in paragraph i x . of section 51 of the Constitution. We covered the whole field in our defence legislation. We took over the Defence Acts of the States, and administered them; we added something to them, and we declared that ""after a certain time certain provisions of. the States. Acts should no longer be in force. In view of the fact that not only the legislative power, but also the administrative power, was vested in the one authority, it might have been competent for the Federal Parliament to pass such an Act as that. In this case, however, we allow the concurrent legislation of the States to continue. That is recognised by the general terms of this B ill , and by the proposed clause itself. This clause presupposes the existence of a concurrent power in the States, otherwise the Governor General would be unable to say that the provisions of a State Act are working in restraint of Inter-Stata trade and commerce. We recognise the existence of the States Acts when we authorize the Governor General to interfere with their operation. I do not wish to repeat what I said on that point, but I do think that inasmuch as we have from the beginning refrained from expressly repealing Acts of the States, that fact indicates some doubt as Instead of setting out to our power to do so. With the exception of the proposed clause, no attempt has ever been made to directly repeal a State Act either by Federal legislation or by the delegation of power to the Governor General, and I doubt whether it is constitutional. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, in his lucid speech, referred incidentally to our power to annul inspection laws of the States.. I do not think that quarantine laws canbe considered as amongst those inspection laws. Looking through the matter from time to time, I find that distinctions are drawn between quarantine laws and inspection laws. Section 112 of the Constitution, which is the section giving the power to annul inspection laws, deals only with exports and imports. The commentary in Quick and Garran upon this section is confined to inspection for purposes connected with the operation of iocal trade laws, anddeals with such mattersas the size of parcels, and so on. I do not think that the power to annul inspection laws given by section 112 gives us any power to directly annul States quarantine laws. To test the question'; I propose to move a limitation of the clause, Ibut, even though it should be amended in the direction I am about to suggest, I still think it would be better to negative the clause altogether. I move That the words "" o r plants',"" line 4, be left out. I propose this amendment, because in clause 13 we have already declared that the power of the Federation in respect of Inter-State quarantine, as regards plants and goods, shall not be put in force unless upon evidence of neglect to take proper precautions under the States laws. I think it would be most unwise to take power under the proposed new clause to destroy States Acts by the delegation of a power to do so to the Governor General. ney-General) [6.15] I shall not press the clause on the Committee.

I am of opinion that it complies with the requirements of the Constitution, and would meet what was desired. However, as there appears to be some objection to the form in which the provision is expressed, I am prepared to withdraw the clause. It is only fair that I should say that it was drafted after careful consideration of the constitutional position, and those who are responsible for it are quite satisfied that it is a provision that is clearly within the competence of this Parliament to enact.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE have nearly disposed of the Tariff by that time, and I do not wish to be called upon to ask for Supply whilst honourable members are engaged upon that question. But for that reason it is probable that I should not have asked to-night for three months' Supply. I desire the consideration of the Tariff, whatever the result may be, to be expedited, for I think that the. interests of the public. and more particularly of the commercial community, require that it shall be dealt with as early as possible. In submitting this motion, I am laying the foundation of a course that will enable the consideration of the Tariff to proceed without undue interruption, and I desire to emphasize the point that the vote for which I now ask is based on last year's Estimates.

I hope that next week we shall be supplied with some explanation of the principles underlying it , and what have been the guiding motives in the minds of the Government in introducing a Tariff which departs so radically from the recommendations of the expert Commission which has been sitting to inquire into the subject.

He should tell us generally what has been in the minds of Ministers in preparing the Tariff in the way they have done. In regard to the Bill before us, I have to say that, in my opinion, it is entirely unnecessary to ask for three, months' supply at one time. able member say to granting two months' supply ? any necessity for granting more than one month's supply.

I know perfectly well that we cannot take effective exception 'to a SupplyB ill of this character, but I must join with the deputy leader of the Opposition in saying that this procedure is unprecedented. We must recognise that we have before us business which will require all the attention and ability of this Parliament. One cannot, however, overlook the fact that expenditure is being increased. That is a matter that calls for our serious I think that the consideration. It is remarkable that while there .are 195 divisions in this B ill , there are at the same time 195 votes for contingencies.

I am not anticiThe Minister in his Budget speech took a good deal of credit to himself, and to the various Governments of which he has been a member since the establishment of the Commonwealth, for having exercised the strictest economy.

The honourable member would have no opportunity whatever of arriving at any conclusive result as to any particular item of Government policy in the debate on the Budget.

The leaders of the Opposition and of the Labour Party being prepared to surrender for three months their control of the Administration, it is useless for a private member to enter a further protest. not prepared to resist the request of the Government for necessary Supply, because I agree with the Minister that it is desirable to clear the decks for action in connection with the Tariff struggle; but I hope that the honourable member for Wentworth was not correct in saying that this is the only opportunity that we shall have to criticise the financial programme of the Government. will assure the Committee that, in giving him Supply to-night, we shall not lose the opportunity to fully discuss the financial policy of the Government in dealing with the .Budget that we have had on previous occasions. shall have that opportunity that I assume an attitude of non-resistance in regard to the Supply Bill. I trust that an opportunity will' also be given to discuss the Government policv on general lines in connection with the Tariff. the motion before the Chair will not prevent honourable members from doing so. and that the opportunities for discussing the Budget and Tariff proposals that we have enjoyed on former occasion's will remain to us. I am willing to assist the Government in obtaining the Supply that is asked for. I wish, however, to use this occasion to refer to a reply given to me on Friday, to the effect that the Minister could not agree to hold in suspense the revenue paid under the present Tariff, and to refund any difference between the rates now in force and those which may be adopted in Committee of Supply. That was the practice under the first Commonwealth Tariff. At the present time great hardship and serious loss is likely to be entailed on a large number of importers by the Tariff alterations. We are now, especially in connection with the soft goods trade, at the. period between two seasons. Large bulks have to be broken for distribution throughout the country, and probably by the time that the goods have been sent away, and the invoices forwarded to the country storekeepers, there will be an alteration in the rates of duties. Very serious loss will have to be borne by the importers if the ""difference between the present and. the permanent rates is not returned to them. It cannot be the desire of Ministers, or of honourable members, to do more than protect the revenue, and I take it that, where possible, the Government desires to prevent unnecessary loss to importers. more logical rule than to say that duties must be paid from the date of the imposition of the Tariff, and the rates reduced from the time of their subsequent reduction in Committee of Supply? and I believe in the other States, has been to refund the difference between the rates, first imposed and those subsequently agreed to by Parliament. There need be no difI t is because I believe that we ficulty about making a refund of duty in connection with unbroken parcels of goods. This notice was posted up at the 'Customs House to-dayIn all cases where the rates under the new Tariff proposals are lower than the rates previously in force, the difference between the higher and the lower rates is to be taken on deThe carrying of posit.

But the duties may be altered during the next month or two. A t this period of the year-betwee n the two seasons-the introduction of a new Tariff is very awkward and inopportune. On behalf of many honourable importers here, I wish to put on record their protest against this effort to place them in a position of financial loss, and one in which it is quite unnecessary to place them. In all the circumstances, however-havin g made my protest, and with a distinct promise from the Minister that we shall have the usual latitude of debate on the first item in the Budget, and another opportunity to deal with the Tariff proposals generallyI do not propose to offer any resistance to the desire of the Government to obtain Supply for three months. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [8.36]. I cannot see that, in present circumstances, the request which the Treasurer has made for three months' Supply is at all unreasonable. I think it would be undesirable to have the debate on the Tariff interrupted by an application for further Supply, and I welcome the promise from the honourable gentleman that once we enter upon the debate he intends that we shall go right through with it. I desire information on one or two points. The first I regard as of vital importance to the discussion of the Budget proposals next week. The honourable gentleman stated-of course it was apparent from the figures which he placed before the Committee-that the reI n some instances as much venue fromCustoms and Excise duties * during the current financial year will exceed by a very large sum that which hitherto has been derived from that source. I do not know howwe We can all understand that that must result from the imposition of higher duties on almost all articles. I ask the Treasurer if he can tell the Committee whether an estimate has been made of what the normal revenue from the new duties will be when things have settled down ? During the first year the revenue will be far greater than the ordinary amount, but the honourable gentleman has stated that in succeeding years there will be a very serious diminution. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is estimated that there will be. If refunds are made, the Mr W. H . IRVINE -Naturally the revenue will be less in subsequent years. Can the honourable gentleman give the Committee even the roughest approximate estimate of what the normal revenue from, the new duties will be? looking for a prophet. Mr W. H . IRVINE Of course, all estimates are more or less in the nature of prophesies. If the Treasurer says he has not attempted to make an estimate of that kind, I am quite prepared to accept his statement. Buti f he or his officers have arrived at any estimate, I for one shall be very glad to know what it is. I quite admit that it is a very difficult estimate to make. It depends entirely upon the extent to which the duties are protective. down under a protective Tariff? Mr W. H .

Last year Excise duties were imposed under a short Tariff. I recognise that to extend them to the full Tariff, or to the main items in the full Tariff, might make our legislation. very cumbersome. Therefore, I am trying to ascertain whether it is not possible to devise a scheme which will be quite as effective, and yet not so cumbersome. But I wish honourable members clearly to understand that before the Bill dealing with the Tariff is completed, there will be either Excise duties or an improved provision under which there shall be protection insured to the employees, and, if possible, to the public, in order to prevent the reduction of wages, and the increase of prices unduly. A statement has passed ? Bill which is to accompany the Tariff is passed. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is essential to the consideration of the financial proposals' of the Government.

IRVINE -Will the Treasurer permit me to explain my question? If an estimate Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [8.44]. If a system of Excise duties covering most or a large number of the articles which are included in the schedule to the protective Tariff is brought in, that will entirely change the financial position in connection with the Tariff so far as those articles are concerned. Therefore, if we are to have a discussion on the financial position, we ought to ""know whether such a schedule is to be brought in or not. But the Treasurer has stated that he is not yet prepared to say definitely what will be done. I , am going to deal with the matter, but that it was questionable whether it should be done by means of Excise duties, or by With some.other method. Mr W. H .

In the pamphlet I find the followingDo you know that from 1891 to the 31st December, 1906, Victoria has lost by net emigration, by sea (by excess of departures over arrivals) 77,068 persons, of whom 24,428 have emigrated to New Zealand? Do you know that Victoria is threatened with further losses in the immediate future, owing to land in the other States, and in the Northern Territory being made available for thousands of settlers? We have paid .£100 to a league which scatters statements of .this kind all over the Commonwealth. The pamphlet also contains tlie following paragraphWe must secure land for our own people in Victoria before land can be offered to immigrants. until the State Government has arranged for land for its own people. ment ? tion to Victoria is possible/ and that the people of Victoria will be glad to receive immigrants. torian Government could not settle twenty-seven of them. hundreds. An immigration league which receives from -the Government a grant to assist its efforts to promote immigration to Australia is allowed to distribute pamphlets of this sort all over the world. We have in the pamphlet the further statementWe do not want our farmers' sons to be leaving Victoria. young country like Victoria is a symptom that there is something wrong, and we think the want of land is the root of the matter. want our farmers' sons to get land in Victoria, and to stay here and prosper. the land to remain uncultivated.' We want the land to be tilled, and to increase the production of Victoria. It proceeds to give a lot of information about the central districts surrounding Port Phillip Bay, and then states that the county of Grant, in which my electorate is situate, "" lost .7,655 of its population from 1871 to 1881."" As a matter of fact, from 1881 to.1891, as well as from 1891 to 1901, the population of that county increased. natural increase ? gained in population in respect of two decades other than the one mentioned here. In a pamphlet, designed presumably to attract immigration to Victoria, we find special reference made to the only decade in which there has been a loss of population. It is also .stated that in the north-central district of Victoria, comprising Anglesey, Dalhousie, and Talbot, there has likewise bien a loss of population. The pamphlet is so ful l of shocking pessimistic statements that I do not think we could have done worse than spend ,£100 in this way. I find also the statement thatThe losses of population we have mentioned mean that instead of there being in these districts a natural increase of population, in the periods mentioned, there is a decline of population as shown by the census returns, from which No immigration is possible to Victoria thesesaddening particulars have been taken. 'Tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed, That it should come to this : This should not be. It is not the aged, the feeble, the vicious, or the weak who are leaving Victoria. The policy of emigration from Victoria, however hidden and unconfessed, exposes itself in its workings. It is the 'young men and women taught in our State schools. It is the strong, the daring, the enterprising, the robust, who are leaving, and who marry and settle down in other lands. The marriage rate in Victoria is below the average for Australia, and the average for Australia is lower than in the following twelve countries of Europe : -Hungary, Spain, German Empire, Belgium, Austria, England and Wales, France, Holland Switzerland, Denmark, Scotland, and Italy. The birth rate in Victoria is lower than in any Australian State (except South Australia, which is slightly lower), . and lower than New Zealand. And the average birth rate in Australia is lower than in any of the European countries (1002), except Ireland and France.

Dear Sir,-There is a great demand at present, and will be for some time to come, for miners of all kinds, and pick and shovel men, in New South Wales.

The land at which this Corporation is operating is about 120 miles from Sydney, N.S.W., and good men may be certain of permanent work there. The New South Wales Government is also 'commencing the construction of a railway of over 300 miles in length, the cost of which is The letter saidestimated at about three million pounds.

The following is the letter written by direction of the Premier of New South WalesIntelligence Department, Phillip and Bridge Streets, Sydney, 20th April, 1907.

In view of the increasing numbers of immitions from the Inspector-General of Police grants that are now arriving week by week, we that the proposed duties be performed at ten have to use every means to get into touch with employers of labour in the country districts Commonwealth money is, therefore, being who may be able and willing to take such immigrants and supply them with different classes of spent in upholding a League which is inwork.

We know that the' duties of the police are anything from A to Z. If a policeman has to waste his time asking employers, whether they have work available for immigrants who may arrive, but about whom he knows nothing personally, he will not have time for the duties which.he undertook to perform when he took his oath of office. The honourable member for West Sydney has some knowledge of Dr. Arthur, having been, I believe, associated with him in some matter, so that he speaks with authority and knowledge which I must respect. The state of affairs that has been revealed should not be tolerated by this Committee or by a Treasurer having control of the public funds. I trust that it will be made public, so that the people of New South Wales may learn, not only '.what these men are doing under the garb of an Immigration League, but what they are doing in the interests of another class of people for whom they are working. They profess to be actuated by a desire to populate Australia with the right class of people, and, while getting subscriptions to the League for that purpose, they use the money to deceive the Britishpublic, and to degrade the public sentiment of Australia. I have read those striking extracts so that, when sums are being voted for immigration in the future-a n amount of .£20,000 appears on the Estimates-inChief for the purpose-w e may indicate clearly and unmistakably that no more money is to be expended in this way unless the Government have direct control, and that none shall be given to an irresponsible League to advertise a state of affairs that does not exist in Australia. I believe that Parliament voted ,£5,000 last year for the purpose of advertising Australia, but not necessarily to be spent directly to bring out any particular class of immigrants. We find now that some of the money has been given to people who are quite irresponsibleI say it with all respect-so far as concerns the spending of Government funds. On the one hand, we have a complaint from the honourable member for Corio, that one branch which has received some of the money will not keep certain facts back, while on the other hand there has been a general comcalled Immigration League have been so misrepresenting the position in Australia as practically to have misapplied the money that was given them by the ex-Treasurer for the purpose of advertising the Commonwealth. Quite a number of these advertisements, which have' been spread throughout the industrial centres of England, were sent to me to-day. The position of the coal mining industrv in New South Wales has, at the instigation of the Premier of the State, been inquired into by the head of the Labour Department there, and, after an exhaustive investigation, he has been forced to admit that the supply of labour is equal to the demand. He adds the forecast-thoug h in this I regard him as treading on very dangerous ground-that during the next twelve months perhaps 1,000 men may be absorbed. I have as intimate a knowledge of coal mining as is possessed by any man in this country, and I say that, if everything goes well with the coal trade for the next twelve months, and the output is doubled, openings may be afforded for the employment of a large number of additional men. But at the present time men who have arrived in our coal mining districts from the old world are absolutely disappointed with the conditions with which they have been met, and regard the promises made to them as unfulfilled, the fact being that, if no employment were given to the local labour now looking for work, the -utmost endeavour could not find places for more than fifty additional hands. Do not these facts give the lie to the statements made by those in responsible positions in the State that hundreds of men can be employed in various avocations?

Sir WILLIAM LYNE by me for the purpose to which the honourable member refers. ply B ill , we have a right to discuss any matter affecting the policy of the Government. ing Prime Minister has given me the assurance that nothing will be spent out of the Treasurer's advance for advertising abroad, I am content to let the further discussion of this matter stand over until the Estimates come before us. -There is one very important matter on which I should like to get some information from the Treasurer, and that is whether under the experimental imposition of Excise duties on agricultural machinery the rates of wages paid by the manufacturers are the standard rates of wages in the district. So far as I can find out there seems to be a general impression in South Australia that the experiment is hot working as was anticipated. told that some employers are evading the award of the Arbitration Court. Of course we shall know all about that when the return which I moved 'for the other day is furnished, and the Minister has been kind enough to say that it will be made available at the earliest moment. know what steps have been taken to protect the revenue; what amount of Excise duty has been collected, and what method has been adopted. should be very glad to know whether any obstruction has been put in the way of officers getting all the information which they are entitled to obtain for the Department. I do not desire to delay the passing of the Supply Bill any longer, provided that the Minister is prepared to give us the information on the points which have been raised by honourable members, and also in connection with the collection of Excise duties on agricultural machinery. only rise for the purpose of asking the Acting Prime Minister whether he has an answer to give to the honourable member for Coolgardie. chance to speak. The £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 which the honourable gentleman a chance now. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I want to listen to what other honourable members have to say before I speak. I am very pleased that the honourable member for Gwydir has brought up the quesI n dealing with the Suption of immigration. I trust that before more money is expended in that direction the Commonwealth Government will look into the matter, and have it put on a proY e s ; but as the Actper basis. It has been stated that the Premier of New South Wales has offered so much money to the police to get billets for immigrants. I was credibly informed more than two months ago that not one shilling but ten shillings per head was to be given to the police for each immigrant who was provided with employment. Knowing of the existence of that offer a young man in Sydney asked me to get him employment. I took him to the Intelligence Department and asked the authorities if they could find him a billet. They asked, "" Is he an immigrant?"" I replied "" No. He is a young Australian of good character and ability, who is out of work."" Thereupon they said "" We are not a labour bureau to get work for unemployed Australians. If he were an immigrant we I am would try to get work for h i m . "" wanted. not object to the Government finding employment for every immigrant, I think it I want to would be a good thing if they would take it upon themselves to find employment for every man who cannot get work. Unemployed men are no good to the community. I Men should always be at work, and if it is impossible for a man to find work, the Government should do their best to find it for him. WhatI protest against-is that an office should be run at a large expense, and that a sum should be paid to the police to find employment for immigrants, while our own men are deliberately refused help.' It constitutes quite a scandal.

The manufacturers, through their agents, have alleged throughout the State that the increased prices are consequent upon the Excise duties which they have had to pay upon the machinery. SinceI came to Melbourne, I have ascertained that those firms appear' on the schedule of firms exO'Connor from paying Excise duties. I ask the Minister, before we begin the consideration of the Tariff, to instruct his officers to call upon each firm to produce their catalogue of prices for last year, as well as for this year. If , from a comparison of the catalogues, it should be found that my statement is correct, then it will be clear evidence that the firms have been deliberately robbing the farmers of the increase in the prices under the excuse that they had been charged Excise duties. Not only have they done that, but they have credited this Parliament with having done something which has made the cost of the machinery much dearer to the primary producer. I think it is the duty of the. Minister to have the matter investigated thoroughly before we proceed to consider the Tariff, so that we may know how to deal with these manufacturers. rather regret the attitude which the Acting Prime Minister seems to take up on this question. very quiet attitude. man is very quiet indeed, and so far as I can see, he is absolutely unconcerned. of the Labour Party can roar at the opening of this sitting, and coo at the end of it.

The majority of the honourable members supporting the Government have actually no power in the Chamber now. However, that is only by the way. WhatI desire to ask the Treasurer is, what explanation there is of the position put by the honourable member for Coolgardie? The position is a very difficult one, I admit. an explanation, difficult as it may be, if the honourable gentleman will give me an opportunity.

I can make no promise at all, because it is quite impossible, in anv circumstances, to return any of the money which has been paid by way of duty where the packages have been broken. Prime Minister promise to consider the matter quickly? what I am doing. Personally, my desire is that no injury shall be done by accident, if I may so put it, to those persons who were unfortunate enough to have goods in transit between certain ports in Australia when the Tariff was introduced.

If the old rates of duty are to be charged, they must be collected before the packages are broken, or not at all. That practice has not prevailed in the past, although it was followed in nearly every State. the old Tariff be collected upon these goods, what guarantee shall we have that the consumers will not afterwards be called upon to pay the higher rates? that that is the point. I cannot say more than that I will consult the Minister of Trade and.

In regard to the matter of the Excise duties on machinery, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I wish to say that before I relinquished Ministerial control of the Department of Trade and Customs, I gave instructions that the Excise duties were to be collected from all manufacturers who committed a breach of the regulations. Probably proceedings are very far advanced by now. duties to have been collected by this time? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -If there has been any breach probably it has been collected, but it can only be collected where there has been a proved breach. the standard rate of wages ? has been a breach of the law. I understood that the cases referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the honourable member for Grey were those of firms who were exempt from the payment of the duty by the direction of the Judge of the Arbitration Court-firm s who have added to the cost of their machinery, charges which they were not entitled to add under the law. That, of course, is a different phase of the question altogether, and I shall ask the Minister to have it investigated as early as possible. I recognise that the position should be"" known so that we may understand how this scheme of Excise duties works before we submit a proposal to continue it, or to substitute something for it.

The amount of £20,000 is designed to cover contingencies connected with the conveyance of mails, the purchase of instruments and books, and a number of other things. There is one item which is very important. My predecessor in office declined to pay out of the Treasurer's advance increments upon salaries in excess of £110 a year. I propose to pay increments upon salaries up to ,£160, which represents the maximum of the fifth class. If the Treasurer's advance can be used to pay legitimate and approved salaries up to £110 a year, it is unfair that the fund should not be used, to pay increments on salaries up to .£160. present arrears?

When the expenditure of .£1,000 upon the Women's Work Exhibition was first mentioned by the honourable member for Coolgardie, I knew nothing whatever about it. It so happened that I was absent when action was taken in this connection. I understand, however, that the late Treasurer remitted the sum of ,£1,000 to London with which to pay freight charges upon goods intended for this exhibition in which Lady Northcote takes a great interest. Mr ""AUSTIN CHAPMAN -It is an exhibition that will do Australia a great deal of good. ; and Oriental Company have agreed to bring all goods which are sent from the Continent to England-to defraying the freight charges upon which this money was to be devoted-to Australia, where the exhibition is to be held, free of cost. £1,000 out of a vote? Sir WILLIA M LYNE I did not pay anything. I expect that the late Treasurer paid it out of the Treasurer's advance. I wish to say further that the amount that was remitted last year was charged to the Treasurer's advance, and will appear on the Supply Estimates of 1906-7. That is the information I have in reference to the matter. man think that, a debatable vote like that should be paid out of the Treasurer's advance ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE,I should not like to answer a question concerning the action of my late colleague. The late Treasurer thought he was justified in what he did, and 1 am also inclined to think that where it is clear that good may be done to Australia by an exhibition, it might be left to the discretion of the Treasurer to assist a movement of the kind when there is no opportunity to consult Parliament in the matter. would do the same himself if the occasion arose. swer problematical questions, but I am prepared to take all the responsibility I am called upon to take for anything I do. tleman will surely stand by what his late colleague did. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am standing by it now. As a matter of fact, the item does not appear on the Estimates for this year. It is not covered by the SupplyBill we are now seeking to introduce, and if the point were taken, I think it would be held that it is scarcely in order to discuss the subject. When the Budget comes on, or when the Estimates are before honourable members, will be the time to deal with the question.

While he might say that the Government have no right to do what they propose to do, when it came to a question of voting the honourable member would find himself "" drawn by the wire,"" and his previous statements would go for nothing.

The honourable member for Kooyong and several other honourable members have asked what the Minister of Trade and Customs proposes to do with respect to ships about to arrive lian port. I look upon the question raised as one of very serious moment, because merchants throughout Australia have at this I do not think moment cleared out of bond large stocks of tobacco and goods of various kinds, and are I hope honourable charging the public f u l l prices for these goods as though they had paid duty on them in accordance with the new Tariff.

Thev are charging these increased prices upon goods that have never paid the increased duty, and thereby, I will not say the public are being robbed, but extortion is being pracL e t honourable memtised upon them. If the Minister of Trade and Customs rules that ships about to arrive, and ships that have touched at one port in Australia, are to be allowed to land their cargoes at the old Tariff rates, the consumers will, still be charged the increased duties on the new scale proposed for the goods brought in those ships. That would not be. fair to the people. The -Minister of Trade and Customs should look very carefully into the matter before he accedes to the request or"" the merchants.

Honourable members will find that the Constitution provides that no money shall be appropriated to the Crown except with the consent of this House. The imposition of a duty is an appropriation of the people's money; and if this House, after the message, refuses to endorse that appropriation, a refund should be made of all moneys collected under a misapprehension on the part of the Minister that the House would endorse the duties originally proposed by him. . the consumers the excess duty paid ? question, and, so far as the rough equity of the case is concerned, I should not be very much troubled about the refunding of any particular sum collected in excess of any duty ultimately imposed by the Parliament. But we have our duty as interpreters of the Constitution under which we work, and I think that the honourable member for South Sydney would be the first to admit that under the Constitution a Minister has not the power to impose taxation upon the people of Australia without the consent of this House. done. in regard to the first Federal Tariff was different. When the original Tariff was before the House, we were trying to determine what really were the burdens upon the backs of the majority of the people of Australia There were in operation in Australia at the time six separate Tariffs, and it was very difficult for the Chair then to interpret what was and what was not a new burden on the people. In this instance, however, we know that there was a uniform Federal Tariff in operation prior to that now before the House, and that that Tariff has been increased on a message from the Crown. If we do not endorse the increase of a duty, and yet allow the Crown to take the revenue resulting from its own action, we shall practically give up to the Ministry our control of the taxation of the Commonwealth. That is a very serious thing to contemplate. I admit that I should very much prefer some means if means could be devised-whereb y the consumers could obtain the benefit of any ref und, but in any event our duty under the Constitution is to see that the Crown is not allowed to tax the people of Australia without the consent of this House. careful to see that, the importers do not rob the people outside. tween the importer and the consumer, the importance of which I have no desire to minimize. duty to see that people act honestly as it is'to make refunds of excess duty paid. our first duty is to see that the Crown does not raise funds without our consent. avoid giving people outside a motive to be T h a t is a very difficult dishonest. sider this subject before we express an ex parte opinion upon it. So far as my personal inclinations are concerned, I have no desire that refunds shall be made to importers who, as the result of increased duties, subsequently reduced by Parliament, have made a profit out of their customers. But every member of this House must endeavour to honour the oath to uphold the Constitution that we took in entering Parliament. One of the first principles of the Constitution is that this House shall have the control and the initiation of expenditure.

That suspicion will gain considerable weight if be insists on pushing this Bill through to-night. [10.42] -It is unreasonable for the Government to endeavour to force through the Bill to-night. There is. no violent hurry about it. Sir WILLI AM LYNE Bill passed into law by the 15th inst., and before it is passed it has to go to the S) ens. to know, it would not take much time to deal with the Bill to-morrow. There are several items in it about which honourable members may reasonably require information. There is, for instance, a vote for the Commonwealth Office in London. The Treasurer has' told us that there is nothing in the Bill but what is in conformity with last year's Estimates. But I find that there is a vote for ,£250 on account of salaries for the Commonwealth Office, amounting to one-half of the total salaries for the year. There is also an item of £1,800 for contingencies on account of the same office, whereas the total amount expendedlast year was £1,040. object to this expenditure unless some adequate explanation of it is given. This is one of the items about which there may reasonably be discussion. We can also legitimately discuss the conduct of the Commonwealth Office in London. A large number of members desire to criticise very severely tbj recent doings of that office, and I do not think that the Minister ought to attempt to bludgeon the Bill through in this way. I promise that if there be an adjournment, there shall be no unnecessary delay in regard to this measure; but there -is a reasonable desire to discuss one or two of the items. Treasurer is asking honourable members to make a very serious concession if he desires to pass this Bill through all its stages in two days. There are, I suppose, half-adozen stages, at any one of which the Bill might be blocked for a day by a single member; and yet the Treasurer is prepared to make us sit up all night to suit his convenience. cussed a hundred items in the time the honourable member has been talking about nothing. thing I was listening to the honourable member's eloquent remarks; and I hope he will give me credit for sincerity equal to his own. We are .told by the Treasurer that it is essential that the Bill should be passed before the 15th inst., but if the honourable gentleman is persistent, he will find that any single honourable member, as I have said, may thwart his wishes. anxious to get on with the consideration of the Tariff. What is the use of wasting the time of the Committee? member will remember that when one is talking here about the proper passage ofmoney Bills, one is not used to be reminded by members of large experience about the waste of time. When the honourable member has been here a little longer, he will find that the control of the expenditure of the country is one of the most sacred trusts which we have to guard. I hope he will also remember that it is not customary for honourable members on the same side of the Chamber as a member addressing the Chair to-make flank attacks for the purpose even of gaining the popularity of his late enemies. However, I I urge on the Minister the advisability-eve n though it be a matter of small concern to the honourable member who interjected-of permitting honourable members to keep a close control of thefinancesof the country. I am sure honourable members will be only too glad to make the concession which the Treasurer asks, and pass the Bill at the earliest possible moment; but in return there must be some consideration of the rights of honourable members. customary on Tuesday night, when several honourable members have travelled long distances, to adjourn at about a quarter past ten o'clock; and I hope the Treasurer will not persevere in his determination to force the Bill through to-night. There are yet some honourable members on this side who desire to speak; and I think it would only be reasonable to adjourn; but if it be the intention to "" bullock"" the Bill through, then I am prepared to help to "" bullock "" it-in an opposite direction. If the Minister will not listen to reason, why should we be deprived of our undoubted right to deal with every item?

The Government in bringing down their proposal for three months' Supply,' evidently with the assured support of men who call themselves labour representatives, and who ought to be back-, ing up the workers, standing up for their rights, and defending them from unjust impositions, have' evidently counted noses beforehand. But the fact that, I challenge honorthey have the numbers up does not relieve the Opposition, especially the free trade section of it, of the duty of opposing by every legitimate means in their power such iniquitous and unjust imposts -The Tariff. proposals had no sooner been published in the press than the wholesale dealers throughout -Australia; with* the honourable few exceptions, increased the cost to the retailers of / all the commodities they .handled.

The only reason which has been advanced for the Ministerial proposal is that the discussion on the Tariff ought not to be interrupted. On several occasions debates on matters equally important as-ir i fact, a great deal more important than-the Tariff have been interrupted in order to get a month's Supply. Hitherto there has not been any trouble in getting a monthly Supply Bill passed, nor can I see that the Ministry have any reason to anticipate any trouble in obtaining a monch's Supply from time to time.

I propose to quote a few extracts from the speeches of the Prime Minister and"" Lord Tweedmouth, which show that the statement in question was definitely made. Upon page 129 of the official reports Lord Tweedmouth is thus reportedThe only reservation that the Admiralty desire to make is, that they claim to have the charge of the strategical questions which are necessarily involved in naval defence, to hold the command of the Naval Forces of the country, and to arrange the distribution-of ships in the best possible manner to resist attacks and to defend the Empire at large, whether it be our own islands or the Dominions beyond the seas. We thoroughly recognise that we are responsible for that defence. We want you to help us in that defence. assistance you can, but we do not come to you as beggars; we gladly take all that you can give us, but at the same time, if you are not inclined to give us the help that we hope to have from you, we acknowledge our absolute obligation to defend the King's Dominions across the seas to the best of our ability. I should like to know what these remarks have reference to, if it is not to some statement by the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister prior to the delivery of that speech by Lord Tweedmouth. From the tenor of these remarks, it is distinct quite evident, even if there were nothing defence more to follow, that the impression left which it is a part was necessary, and though it on minds of the Lords of the Admiralty did not take the form -which commended itself was that Australia desired to terminate the most Naval Agreement, and did not propose to of co-operation until something better presented continue the payment of the annual subitself. Further consideration has convinced the sidy of £[200,000, or, at any rate, wished public that the present agreement is not satisfacto be relieved of that responsibility. This tory view -of the matter is strengthened by professional further remarks made by Lord Tweedmouth, in a speech which will be found That is a very sweeping statement for the reported on page 469 of the proceedings Prime Minister to have made as a repreof the Conference. He saidSince we last met, I have had the opportugentleman's colleagues endorsed that statenity of having conversations with various of the ment, or whether he made it with their Prime Ministers and also with their colleagues, authority ? Whether it was made with or and they have had some conferences with 'some without their authority, there is absolutely of my colleagues at the Admiralty also. do nQt know that I have any very definite plan not the slightest foundation in fact for to propose to you. I can only repeat what I said before, that at the Admiralty we are most anxious to meet the wishes of the various Colonies. But, of course, the real difficulty is that the position varies in the different Colonies, and they have very different' wants. In a later paragraph, I find that he saidAsI understand Australia puts forward a proposal that the agreement of 1902 should be ended, and that Australia should start something in the way of a local Defence Force. Here Lord Tweedmouth puts the position as it was understood by the Admiralty authorities from the statements of the Prime Minister of Australia. I should like to know whether the other members of the Ministry concur in the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister, and whether that honourable gentleman before he left Australia was authorized by them to make statements which so misrepresented the opinion of the people of the Commonwealth. At page 473 of the proceedings of the Conference, it will be found that Mr Deakin, speaking after Lord Tweedmouth, made this definite statementIn Australia, for reasons which have alreadv We want you to giv£ us all the been out on record in the despatch which I had the honour of addressing to the Admiralty about two years ago, the existing contribution has not proved generally popular. A copy of that despatch ought to have been placed on the table of the House, so that we might have been made acquainted with the reasons which caused the Prime Minister to arrive at the conclusion that the agreement has not proved generally popular. The honourable gentleman went on to sayIt was passed because it was felt that some recognition of our responsibility for the of our own country and of the Empire of to the very large minority, possibly even a majority of the electors, we accepted that mode either to the Admiralty, the political or Lords of .the Admiralty, or to the Parliament of the Commonwealth. sentative of the people of Australia.

I have been able to make only a cursory examination of the B ill , because, though it was circulated this morning* the copy intended for me did not reach me. Apparently, for some reason which I cannot understand, the Government are anxious to force the measure through, under the pretence of bringing us nearer to the Tariff debate. But that is no reason why we should pass soimportant a measure in a perfunctory manner. The present procedure is contrary to the best principles of constitutional government. It has never been the custom to pass three months' Supply Bills in this Parliament. two months' Supply Bills have been passed. month's Supply has been voted at one time, it has been the practice of the Government to show urgent reasons.

700,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"whether, in regard to the mail, service to the Pacific Islands, there is an increase or a decrease. I wish to know whether there has been a new contract entered into, and whether that contract bears any relation, to the whole question of the eastern services. This is a very important matter. Already the States are taking into their own hands the organization of independent mail services to the East; and I am not quite sure whether, such action is constitutional. It appears to me that the Commonwealth should make an arrangement by which all the States should have equal facilities, without competition. This is a matter of great importance, which needs more discussion than it is likely to receive to-night. However, if the Government are intent on forcing matters through without discussion, I can only call attention to these points, and protest against such a measure being put through without a tittle of explanation. I move That the item "" Offices of the Commonwealth in London-contingencie s ;£i,8oo "" be left out. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Treasurer ) [12.15] -The reason that J£I,8OO is nowasked for is because the whole amount has in the past been remitted to London at one time. I have just asked the Under-Treasurer whether there is any increase. I am told that there is none of any importance. understand the items in the Estimates. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE is that that is the information given to me. The reason this amount is put down is that it is customary to remit the money to London in a lump sum instead of a proportion every quarter. wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister further questions about the Commonwealth office in London, with reference especially to the recovery of the bond of £[25,000 which was entered into by Sir James Laing and Company. It was rumoured that the reason why the bond which Captain Collins is endeavouring to receive payment upon has not been honoured, is that it contained a stipulation that it was only to be binding in the event of the Commonwealth Parliament ratifying the contract within a certain period from the signing of the bond, and that, inasmuch as the Commonwealth Parliament had not done so, the bondwas no longer operative. That rumour was current in Australian commercial circles. I should like to know definitely whether it is true. If it is, the sooner the House knows that it cannot recover the amount which we all hoped would be recovered, the better. in the rumour. [12.17] -The Treasurer says that this item is in no way altered. But I would call his attention to the fact that the total amount of the division in the Estimates is £ 4 , 4 0 0 as against . £ 2 , 1 0 0 appropriated last year. The amount is more than doubled, and it is therefore idle for the honourable gentleman to say that there is no material increase. £ 1 , 8 0 0 represents a large proportion of the total amount. £ 1 , 8 0 0 represent? connection with the London office. of the London office as shown on the Estimates are :-Salaries, £ 5 5 0 ; rent, telegrams, stationery, travelling and incidental expenditure, £ 3 , 2 0 0 ; collection of Australian historical records, £ [ 6 5 0 ; or a total of £ 4 , 4 0 0 . I understood from the Treasurer that he was taking power to spend nothing under this Bill except upon the ordinary services upon ""last year's basis, but the COOK -Then I cannot amount he is now asking for this division for three months is almost exactly the total All I can say amount voted last year.

' Afterwards, when we attempt to discuss the question on the Estimates, we shall be told that the money has been voted, and that we must submit. Now is the time to raise the question why there is so disproportionate an increase in this item as compared with others. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [12.20] -The honourable member for Parramatta is very persistent, but he knows just as much as I do about the matter. He has had to deal with questions of this kind, and knows that it is convenient to send more than the ordinary sum in many cases. The item of £[1,806 is for rent, stationery, office cleaning, travelling expenses, &c. Only half the vote is taken; that is, up to 31st December, 1907.

[12.35] -A t this hour cf the morning, I do not intend to persevere with regard to the item for a service to the Pacific Islands, but in my judgment it is one of the most important items in the schedule. I should like to hear from the Treasurer a full explanation of the arrangement which has been made with regard to ""the service to the Pacific Islands, and also the whole of the Commonwealth services to the East. Lately, the States have been making arrangements of their own for the carriage of their produce eastwards, and, sooner or later, a good .deal of friction will arise. Sir member means the arrangement with Burns, Philp, and Company, I suppose? with Burns, Philp, and Company, and also that with Currie and Company. There are. several companies competing for the trade of the various States, and it has been suggested that the arrangements recently made are unconstitutional. It would be very much better if the Commonwealth Government could arrange the mail services to the East, so as to secure equal facilities to all parties concerned. At the present time, each State is fighting the other States for space in the vessels going eastward. However, it is a large question, and I do not intend to go into it at this hour. I think, however, that we might have had from the Treasurer a full explanation at a more reasonable time. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [12.37] -There is no doubt that the honourable member is correct in saying that the question he has raised is a large one, because it deals with not only part of New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, and the New Hebrides, but with the Pacific Islands generally. When he was in London, the Prime Minister was very anxious-and I was assisting him-to make an arrangement in regard to the control of some of the Pacific Islands. ceed in what we wanted to do. We have simply carried on the contract with Burns, Philp, and Company on the same lines as before. As regards the desire of the States to employ other services, there is a difficulty about interfering. The question has been under consideration, but at the present moment I cannot give any definite information regarding the shipping companies to which the honourable member has referred. We have taken care to adhere to what has been authorized, and have continued the services at the same rate. Schedule agreed to. Title agreed to.

It was thought that as it had not been mentioned in the Governor General's Speech, it could not be made a Government matter, and so no action.has been taken. When a similar case arose in New South Wales some years ago, while Sir Henry Parkes was head of the Government, one of his Ministers brought in aprivate Bill to provide for the payment of an allowance -to members of the Legislative Assembly.
