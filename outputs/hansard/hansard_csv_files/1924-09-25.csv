0,"Other Honourable Members On This Side, I Am Very Far From Desiring That The Cession Should Close At An Early Date, And I Am Aware That, Under The Standing Orders Which Mr Speaker So Strictly","and , if I may be allowed to say it, so ably interpretsI may not ask a question arising out of an answer given to another honourable member. But, in a speech made by the Prime Minister recently-for the purpose of identification, I may say that in it he spoke of blackmailers, cut-throats, sectionists, and other has stated in a speech that the people owe undesirables; the right honourable gentleman will remember the speechhe stated likely to close when the measures appearing on the notice-paper, with the exception of certain minor measures, were disposed of. Having regard to the fact that, in the process of debate, minor measures may develop into major measures, I shttuld be glad if the right honourable gentleman would inform the House which are the minor measures on the paper that are likely to be jettisoned before the session closes? of having made any speech in which I referred to cut-throats, and I have, therefore, been somewhat embarrassed in the effort to identify the speech to which the honourable member refers. making any speech in which I referred to the work which has to be dono before the session closes. As the honourable gentleman has asked what are the measures with which it is not intended to proceed, I shall take an opportunity at an early date to inform the House what are the proposals of the Government. to address.a question to you. Those of us who come to Parliament House between the hours of 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning are compelled to swallow quantities of dust stirred up by the sweeping pf the cleaning staff, which uses the most antiquated carpet appliances, so that as much dust arises as goes into the sweepers. I wish to ask whether better methods might not be adopted, including, if necessary, the laying down of rubber carpets. with the system of cleaning adopted in the building, but I shall confer with the staff, ancl see whether it is advisable to install better methods, and, if possible, will have it done. the National par.ty an undying debt of gratitude for its action during the war in saving the honour and prestige of Austhat the session was tralia. Therefore, I ask the right honourable gentleman, Who was the first Leader of this party that has saved the honour and prestige of Australia? What recognition has the Nationalist party made of his great services? What has become of him ? Is nob to-day his birthday, and what does the Government propose to do to recognize his past services? the questions which the honourable member has asked are well within his own knowledge. The Leader of the Nationalist party during the period of the war, when it rendered such unforgettable services to Australia, was the right honourable gentleman who now represents North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes). Whilst Indeed, I cannot remember I do not altogether appreciate the form in which the questions are couched, it affords me very great pleasure to answer them, as it enables me personally-ari d I am sure I may also add on behalf of the whole House-to congratulate the right honourable member on the occasion of his birthday. : expressing my compliments? for Defence received any correspondence from the Townsville Chamber of Commerce in regard to the survey of Magnetic Passage, about 35 miles from Magnetic Island?

In addition, I had convened several meetings of dominion representatives, and also attended two meetings of all British representatives, at which matters affecting the Empire were fully discussed. After being in session for a fortnight, the congress adjourned for at least eight days, and I was called to London to attend to important matters which were pending there, and which required immediate personal attention. 3.

I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1013-1921, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report, viz.:-Federa l Capital: Northern Main Sewer-Extension of sewer from main intercepting sewer on Commonwealth-avenue, across Molonglo River, to serve the northern portion of the city. The Public. Works Committee has already investigated and reported to Parliament concerning the main outfall sewer at Canberra, the main intercepting sewer within the city boundary, and the main serving the southern portion of the city. The time has now' come when consideration should be given to the connorth-eastern portion of the city. The present proposal comprises the construction of a main sewer leading northwards from the junction of the southern and main intercepting sewers on Commonwealth-avenue, across the Molonglo River, sfnd extending eastwards as far as Prospect-parkway. At the present time, this district is served by local treatment works, the reticulation thereto being so arranged that it may easily be connected with the proposed sewer when constructed. The population on the northern side of the city is increasing. With the advent of private enterprise and the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra, the present works will be inadequate to meet the demand, and it will be necessary to connect the service with the main city sewerage scheme. The proposed development is in general conformity with the scheme submitted by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee in its first general report. A plan indicating the proposed .route of the sewer is submitted herewith. This sewer will be laid in the form of precast concrete pipes of similar construction to those used for the southern intercepting sewer. The estimated cost of the proposed northern main sewer is £82,000. Question resolved in the affirmative. sident of the Executive Council) [2.50].

23,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot,"Vice-PreThe gravitation, sewerage scheme adopted for the Federal Capital involves the construction of works at the outfall to treat the sewage, in order that an innocuous effluent may he obtained for discharge into the Molonglo River. In 1915, the Public Works Committee, when considering the general sewerage scheme for Canberra, and approving of the main outfall sewer, suggested that ""prior to the date on which it is proposed to erect treatment tanks, exhaustive inquiries be made, with a view to the installation of the most up to-date system then obtainable."" that time, methods of sewage disposal have been the subject of close investigation by experts in various parts of the world, and the results of these experiments, and the conclusions arrived at by leading authorities were carefully reviewed, before a method of treatment for the Federal Capital was adopted by the technical advisers of the Government. In Order that the sewerage scheme may be in operation by the time Parliament is transferred to Canberra, it is necessary that preliminary action should now be taken iii connection with the treatment works, and accordingly a scheme has been formulated for reference to the Public Works: Committee. The scheme provides for-the installation of a first unit of sediwith this motion, which relates to the 'promentation tanks and trickling niters to deal with 500,000 gallons daily, being the sewage from 5,000 people, plus the flushing water necessary for scouring the sewers in the initial stages, and for the installation of a small experimental unit capable of treating the sewage of 500 people by the activated sludge method, so arranged that either crude sewage or settled sewage from the tanks can be passed through it. The present proposal provides for these units to be increased, as necessity arises, to treat the sewage of 10,000, and, later, of 25,000 people. immediate requirements at a minimum of cost, and at the same time offer possibilities of developing alternatives at a later date, after experience of Canberra conditions has supplied the necessary local data on which to form a definite opinion as to the direction in which future expansion should be made. I lay upon the table a plan showing the general locality of the works, and an outline of the proMr Atkinson. posed scheme. The estimated cost of treatment works to provide for 25,000 people is £60,000, of which, it is anticipated, £37,000 would be expended within the next three years. meeting at Canberra within three years, and I should like an assurance from the Minister that the treatment works will be sufficiently advanced to meet requirements at the date of the transfer. provision is being made to meet all reSince quirements when Parliament first assembles at Canberra. posed expenditure of this kind must be governed by the probable influx of population into Canberra. We have been told that a big city will grow there, and that as soon as the land is thrown open for selection many people will take up residential and business blocks. So far no attempt has been made to make the land available for selection, and population cannot go there until that is done. We were assured that the first sale of leases would be held in September or October, but it has been further postponed. It is not in order to discuss the land policy at Canberra in connection vision of certain sewage treatment works. get from the Minister some definite statement as to when land will be available for selection so that we may estimate at what rate the population of the city will increase. land will be made available, but I do sedimentation know that leases in the business area are to be sold shortly.

29,Mr Atkinson,"I cannot say when theProvided that a Proclamation under this Bection shall not issue unless and until, at a understanding between Great Britain and poll of growers taken in the prescribed manner throughout the Commonwealth, a majority of votes have been given in favour of tlie act being brought into operation. By introducing such measures as this, the Government seems to be dealing piecemeal with our various industries, without any attempt to organize them at a l l. If our primary industries are to flourish, we must in a few years take uniform and comprehensive action to deal with Australian products, and to obtain markets for them overseas. I shall quote a few figures respecting the importation of currants into Britain. Last year the currants imported into Britain from Australia amounted at £278,000, and from other countries, 967,000 cwt., valued at £3,000,000. Other dried fruit s imported into Britain from Australia amounted to 102,000 cwt., valued at £483,000, and from other countries, 1,312,000 cwt., valued at £5.714,000. These figures show that there is a splendid market in Britaini t self for Australian dried fruits. I believe that the scheme outlined in the bill, if put into operation, will be of some benefit to the producers, but assistance will be needed in other directions if their industry is to flourish at all. I have been greatly impressed with speeches recently delivered on this subject by party leaders in the British House of Commons. They seem to be unanimous that something must be done by way of organization to bring about the satisfactory marketing of the products of the dominions in Britain itself. The Secretary of State for the Colonies( Mr Thomas), following in tbe footsteps of his predecessor, is strongly in favour of this. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), when introducing the bill, mentioned the I m perial Economic Committee that had been appointed by the Imperial Conference. I believe that committee was established to encourage trade within the Empire. The ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain( Mr Baldwin) made a most important proposition. Mr Philip Snowden, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when delivering his budget speech recently, referred to that proposal as one certainly of the most drastic character. A number of honourable members in this chamber would disapprove of it , but I am inclined to support it , because we should do everything possible to bring about a better trade the dominions. According to the Journal of the Parliaments of the Empire, Mr. Thomas, when dealing with this subject, saidIt is unfair to adopt the policy that, unfortunately, has been adopted in the past, of assuming that on these Empire questions one party alone is the patriotic party. It is not true. We resent it, and we shall be able to prove that it is not true. Equally we are prepared outside these fiscal controversies to consider every question without party bias or prejudice. Mr Asquith, the leader of the Liberal party, saidThere was a great deal still left undone in the development of Imperial resources, in the to 77,000 cwt., valued extension of credit facilities, in tbe improvement and transportation and the storage and marketing of produce. Mr Asquith welcomed the suggestion for the establishment of a permanent I m perial Economio Committee. The Prime Minister of Great Britain( Mr Ramsay MacDonald) spoke in a similar strain, and said that the people of Great Britain had a perfect right to decide their own fiscal issues in the same way as the dominions had the right to settle their own domestic affairs. I shall now refer win. When I was dealing with this matter the other night, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) win had not since changed his opinion. So far as I know, the statement of Mr. Baldwin still stands that Great Britain should be prepared to take produce from Australia. under a misapprehension. I thought the honourable member was referring to something else. stated that there was no reason why a satisfactory trade arrangement should not last for the best part of a generation. an arrangement. statedThe Colonial Secretary referred on the previous day to the discussion at the Imperial Conference on the question of a definite economic Council of the Empire, His Majesty's Government had submitted to all the Dominion Governments a proposal of a definite character under that head.

If we could eliminate the profits that are at present being drawn by many agencies in GreatB r it a in from the sale of various ment is that every grower shall have a Australian products, and organize our sales, it would be a splendid thing. Mr Customs Department, who have this Snowden proceeded as follows:Wo have already gone some distance in that direction, because this is what we have proposed to the dominions in regard to a permanent Economic Conference, that it should be set up for tlie purpose of considering the possibility of improving and preparing for markets and marketing within the United Kingdom the food products of the overseas parts of the Empire, with a view to increasing the consumption of such products in the United Kingdom, and promoting the interests of both producers ancl consumers. I am whole-heartedly in favour of the proposal, notwithstanding that it is a radical departure from the established policy of Great Britain. Australian proposal for inter-imperial preference made at the meeting of the economic committee of the Imperial Conference was objected to by Canada, it seems to me that when the leaders of the various political parties in England are favorable to something of that character being done, it should be possible to do it . more satisfactory scheme of marketing our products in GreatB r it a in would be greatly to the advantage of both the Australian producers and the British consumers.

The fruit-growers in New South Wales, Victoria, ancl South Australia are settled principally on the Murray, and will have no difficulty in appointing their representatives. I desire' that an additional representative shall be elected by the producers of Western Australia. amendment contains a most extraordinary proposal, which I hope the Prime Minister will not accept. A poll should be taken of all the growers. growers of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia are content, as a body, to elect their representatives. Western Australian growers should not be equally content with the proposal in the bill. In my opinion, the board is already too large. We keep piling these boards one on top of another, and during the past two or three years an enormous number of them has been created. I am more inclined to reduce than to increase the size and number of boards. If the growers, whose interests are identical all over Australia, are not satisfied with a majority decision, they cannot be satisfied with anything. There is no reason why state boundaries should be considered at all. The growers might prefer to elect three men from one state, and it may be assumed that if they did so, they would have every confidence in their representatives. The effect of the amendment will be to add one more member to a board that is already too large. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [3.25] -Personally , I agree with the view of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) that it is undesirable to increase the size of the board. The number of members of such boards should be restricted as much as possible. There is, however, a great difficulty in arranging the personnel of this board. It is imperative that the growers should have confidence in it. The dried fruits areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia' adjoin one another, and are situated mainly in the Murray River valley. There is no doubt that representatives elected by the growers in those areas would have their confidence. Western Australia is in a somewhat different ciple of electing representatives of the whole industry, I can appreciate the argument that the Western Australian growers will have more confidence in the board if one of its members is elected by them. bility of state interests conflicting on such a boarcl? there is any serious possibility of such a conflict. As a general principle, I am opposed to recognizing state boundaries, but in view of the peculiar circumstances of Western Australia, the Government is prepared to accept the amendment. The three representatives of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia will not be elected one from each of those states; they will be elected by the growers in those three states as one body. There is another argument that can be advanced in favour of the amendment. To give the growers a fourth representative will give them a majority of representatives on the board. That was not provided for in the first instance, because it was felt desirable to keep the size of the board as small as possible. As the bill is a purely marketing proposition, and as a considerable sum of Government money will be involved, it is necessary, in the interests of the producers, to have on the board men who have an intimate knowledge and a wide experience of the marketing of this product. stitution of the board savours very much of Government control. The bill provides for one member to be elected by the Governor General in Council, and two members of commercial experience to be appointed by the Governor General. That means that three members of the board will be appointed by the Government. Amendment agreed to. I am inclined to moyeThat after the word "" experience,"" paragraph (e), sub-clause (2), the following words be inserted:-""on e of whom shall be nominated by the growers and one "".

I think it would be better to provide for the nomination of persons for appointment to the board by the growers, and leave with the Government the discretion to select from the nominees those believed to be most suitable. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [3.33] -The object of the clause is to ensure that one of the members of the board, with commercial experience, shall be a person acceptable to the growers He will, under the clause, be really a nominee of the growers. The only way in which this could be carried into effect would be by consultation with the Australian Dried Fruits Association. I can assure the honourable member that the Government has no intention of appointing to the board members with commercial experience without consultation with the representative body of the dried fruit growers. Before any appointments are made it will consult with the associaday, and of a majority of the board. tion.

That is a vague expression. A t a meeting held somewhere near Mildura, which, I think, was addressed by the honourable member for ""Wimmera( Mr Stewart), a request was made by the growers that the election Should be on the preferential system. I shall be glad if the Prime Minister will say whether the preferential system of election is to be adonted. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [3.35] -In such matters, one would like to follow the electoral law of the Commonwealth, but in certain circumstances it might be found almost impossible to do that. I cannot see that any difficulty ie likely to arise under this clause, because the growers will be electing three representatives for the whole body of the growers in the states concerned. choose their own method ? because different views would be held as to the course to be followed. The Government will lay down the method of election, and there should be no insuperable difficulties in the way of adopting the preferential system. move That in sub-clause 7 the words "" Provided that an elected member may be removed from office by the Governor General on the recommendation of the board"" be omitted. The effect of the inclusion of this proviso might be that a majority might get rid of a minority on the board. It makes the election by the growers subject to the approval of the Government, and of the majority on the board. . Under this proviso the Government of the day, on the recommendation of a majority of the board, might remove any member, or any smaller number of members than the majority, from office. It is, in my view, dangerous to put such a degree of control into the hands of the Government of the dangerous to have no'provision for the removal of a member of the board from office? constituency electing the members of the board would be responsible for the character and behaviour of those whom it elected. If it elects persons who do not carry out their duties properly that will be its own fault. The proviso to which I take exception would enable a majority on the board and the Government of the day to remove from office members of the board with whose views they did not agree. That is a dangerous provision to enact. think it would be' unwise to omit the whole of the proviso. The honourable member might propose the omission of the words, "" on the recommendation of the board."". The Governor General should have the power to remove a member of the board from office. Such action would not be taken except in very extreme circumstances, but extreme circumstances might arise in which it would be advisable to remove a member.

I quite appreciate the view he holds. Four of the members of the board will be elected by the growers as a whole, one will be appointed by the Government, and two will be appointed by the Government in consultation with those engaged in the industry.

I hope that the board will work smoothly, but it might happen that a member of the board who, in the opinion of the growers, would be their greatest champion, might not meet with the approval of other members of the board, and, under the proviso as it stands, a majority of the board could recommend the Governor General to dispense with his services. not be acted on. vision for it?

There is something to be said in favour of that, for the board will consist of the elected representatives of the producers, and should be able to give expression to their views. The Government, however, saw great objection to allowing the board to fix its own fees, and consequently decided that the fees and expenses should be prescribed. After the board has been appointed, it can consider how often it will have to meet, and what fees it thinks should be paid. If the amount is reasonable I have no doubt that the Government will accept it and prescribe it.

My object in moving the amendment is to remedy this unsatisfactory position. If we strike out clause 16 and The honourable member for Angas has moved an amendment which, if carried, will .make the bill more compulsory in character than it is now. The bill appears to provide for the voluntary placing of fruit for export under the control of the board, growers who so desire remaining free. That appearance, however, is only superficial, because clause 18 provides that when the board has been appointed no contracts for the carriage of dried fruits by sea to any place beyond the Commonwealth shall be made, except by the board acting as the agent of the owners of the dried fruits, or of other persons having authority to export dried fruits, in conformity with conditions approved by the board. The placing of fruit under the control of the board is a voluntary matter, but even if a grower had obtained to export by sea unless the board made exportation. He would be at liberty to export by seaplane or airship, but he could not export by steamer. The bill, therefore, is compulsory, and the amendment moved by the honourable member for Angas would produce no effect in the direction he desires, but might lead to a great deal of complication. The honourable member proposes that clause 16 should read-"" Power is hereby given to the board to take control of any dried fruits for export.""

That is protection, and I am glad that the honourable member is veering round to the economic policy for which I stand. I wish we had control of local distribution and local markets. We have the spectacle to-day_ of fruit-growers starving on their land because they are unable to get reasonable prices, while the people in the cities have to pay famine prices for fruit. not sufficient to pay the wages that the Arbitration Court orders the fruit growers to pay. in the shops of Melbourne would pay twice the wages that the Arbitration Court has awarded in the fruit industry. There would not be much need to talk of stabilizing exports if we could bring f r u it to the Australian consumer at a reasonable price. Thousands of people in the large cities of Australia have not seen frui t on their tables for the past twelve months. fruit for a mere trifle. it is the retailer who inflates the price. Many people come between the grower and the retailer. I realize that there is a surplus of dried fruits in Australia, and that the size of that surplus will increase in the next few years when the hundreds of thousands of acres of land that have been planted come into bearing. We shall then be faced with a very big problem. porting dried fruits. quantity imported is very small by comparison with the quantity produced in Australia. Australia imported gold when it was producing it in large quantities. Such anomalies under the present system are inexplicable. I suggest to the honourable member for Swan, who lecably gone too far in extending the f r u it industry, and in settling returned soldiers on the land. Whether that is so or not, we must face the problem as it exists. If we bring thousands of people from We say that we overseas and settle them on the land, whether to produce wheat, fruit, or butter, without providing local markets by creating secondary industries in the towns, we shall be buying trouble, and setting up a balance against the men we are sending to the back country. A sound protectionist policy is required to build up our secondary industries. In providing for exporting the surplus of oiir produce, we should do it equitably. I commend the honourable member for Angas for bis suggestion, which will be equitable as between the big and the little man, and the rich and the poor man. largely with the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). If provision cannot be made in this bill for each grower to provide his quota for export, the bill will be practically useless. I am not a lawyer, but I .doubt whether the Commonwealth has the power to carry out the intention of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb). It would involve, at least, the scrapping of the bill and the introduction of another. One important consideration arises on this amendment. If the amendment means that the board shall have power to take control of any dried fruits and to compel the grower to export a fair proportion of them, it is very doubtful whether this Parliament has power to pass it. I have at this stage no interest in this bill other than the desire to assist the committee to produce a workmanlike act that will stand criticism. The Commonwealth Parliament has f u l l power to legislate for foreign and interstate trade. It can deal with an article in foreign trade, and, therefore, it has power to legislate in the manner prescribed in clause 18, concerning contracts for the shipment of dried fruits. But, speaking generally, it has no power to deal with an article before it has become the subject-matter of foreign trade. In other words, it cannot empower an official to go into a",27,Dried Fruits Export Control

We hear talk of the solidarity of the Labour movement, but the way in which honourable members opposite joined forces ""with their political opponents to impose burdens on the primary industries under the last tariff was the finest example of solidarity I have ever seen in this Parliament. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Will the honourable member connect his They remarks with the clause? understand that by interjection the honourable member for Angas has foreshadowed other amendments, and his purpose is to enact the principle of compulsion to acquire dried fruits for export. I have come to the conclusion that while the circumstances, which I have briefly outlined, exist there is no other way in which we can effectively organize the marketing of primary products than by compulsion. This bill goes half a dozen .steps in the right direction and stops short of providing for an effective control of the industry. I must, in the circumstances, say that I intend to support the amendments of the honourable m'ember for Angas. I recently addressed at Mildura a most representative gathering of those engaged in the dried fruits industry. Those present represented about 2,000 growers of Mildura, Merbein, and Red Cliffs. The meeting passed unanimously a resolution in favour of a compulsory pool. If the amendments foreshadowed by the honourable member for Angas are intended to give effect to that principle, I am, in the circumstances I have outlined, obliged to support it. think I might be accused of a lack of sympathy with my socialistic friends on the other side if I allowed a measure of this kind to pass into law without at least making an attempt, however feeble, to add something to the sum of wisdom developed in the debate.

I have every confidence in that, but I do not admit that he is impeccable, or that his judgment is in all matters wholly faultless, as ho would seem to suggest by the tone he adopted towards the honourable member for Angas.

I hardly think that the committee is prepared, at a moment's notice, to pass judgment on that aspect of the case. I am convinced that the honourable member for Kooyong could, for an adequate consideration, present an equally convincing argument upon the other side, when we should be left in some doubt as to the true construction of the amendment from the constitutional point of view. socialistic friends on the other side, and my principal object in rising to discuss this bill two on that subject. consumers who buy these various commodities, in respect of which we have been legislating so freely during recent months, have been very little considered. I represent persons who do not export dried fruits, butter or cheese, and who have no butter or cheeee factories among them. I represent a handful of some 40,000 electors, mostly working people, who are under the necessity of paying, for the most part, substantial prices for the various commodities about which we have legislated so freely in this chamber. whilst the Country party is moving in the right direction, is proceeding from the chrysalis to the full-fledged butterfly with a degree cf certaintv of movement, it has not yet become in fact qualified to describe itself as the Socialist party in this House.

We have seen the dav come in our own time and generation when private enterprise is to be overwhelmed by government interference; when wool and wheat, peas, potatoes, peanuts, and other things are to be controlled by this Parliament in the interests of the people. Some have taken the plunge, 'like the honourable member for Wimmera, and are swimming in these uncharted seas as confidently as if they had been returned to advance the great cause of socialism. Others, like the small boy, have taken off their clothes to bathe, but dipping their toes in the water, have remarked, "" Ah, but it is cold,"" and do not take the plunge. Of such is the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham). I am glad to know that you, Mr Temporary Chairman( Mr Cook), as a representative of the primary producers, uphold the right of the Government to interfere w i th private enterprise. gratulate you on the great success of your party in inducing the National party to bend to its w ill .

There are. some people outside this Parliament who, seeing the Prime Minister-the still, strong man-sittin g at the table, would imagine that he really is leading the Ministry and governing the Commonwealth. But the leadership comes from the Country party, the members of which are entitled to take to themselves all possible kudos for what they have done in this Parliament. Well may the honourable member for Wimmera look sad; I fear that he has backed the wrong horse. Let us look at the legislation that has been introduced during this session, and ask ourselves who has dictated it . The answer is that honourable members in the ministerial corner have dictated it in the interests of their masters who sent them here; and when the still, strong leader speaks as though he leads, he actually speaks and leads only as the pliant instrument of the reactionaries of the Country party, who, in turn, serve faithfull y the squatter and the middleman under an unconvincing pretence of serving the working farmer. Thus the patchy pact has been maintained in p a r t; I wonder for how long. Out of this situation there comes a homely illustration of the old proverb that "" Honesty is the best policy.""

If I have said anything that is in consistent with the terms, of that clause I apologize, but it seems to me that everything I have said was directly germane to the clause, and to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Angas.

I shall not, like the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham), take the risk of pronouncing judgment as to its legality, and shall certainly not give an opinion in opposition to his, because that would be rank heresy, as well as a breach of the rules of the affiliated unions of which he and I are members. The Labour party stands for the interests of the primary producer, as it does for the interests of the wage earner and every other class we of the Country party is a constant reiteration of "" t h e primary producer"" until at night one dreams that phrase. It is as if there were no person who had work to do in this country but the p r i mary producer; no , person who had to pay through the nose for primary products, and nobody worthy of consideration other than the primary producer, for whom honourable members of the Country party claim to speak exclusively. A few evenings ago I entered a small shop in a main street of Melthe only apples for sale were quoted at 8d. per lb., and the oranges at 3d., 4d., and 5d. each. A few months hence The clause diswhen we travel into the country we may see within 15 or 16 miles of Melbourne trees laden with beautiful apples, and the ground strewn with windfalls which apparently are not worth gathering.

I believe in Government interference w i th private enterprise, but I do not believe in the p r i Memmary producer becoming a regular mendicant at the door of Parliament House. We The long faces of honourable members of the Country party would lead one to think that the lot of the primary producer was similar to that of the dweller in the slums of some of the great cities of Europe and other continents, that they are reduced below the capacity of self-help, and must have the Fort h a t ' reason I apaid of this Parliament for everything. I do not agree with that. As a rule the primary producer has some independence, and enough grit and capacity to do something for himself by co-operative effort. One thing I wish h i m to do is to endeavour to organize the marketing of his f r u it at prices which, whilst ensuring to him an adequate return, will bring that essential article of diet within the means of some of the poor electors of such densely populated districts as Batman, East Sydney, and West Sydney. of the community, but all Those people do not include any primary hear from honourable members producers, but let them be considered sometimes.

For the proper development of the Commonwealth a uniform railway gauge is essential. vested millions of pounds in the construction of railways at the time of federation, they could not be induced to agree to the adoption of a uniform gauge. between officials of the railways departments, but they were unable to reach finality in the matter. In 1920 a conference was held between the prime minister of the Commonwealth and the premiers of the different states, and they agreed that the best thing to do was to appoint a commission of experts from overseas to deal with the matter. way men in the United States of America and selected. . These gentlemen were brought here at the expense of the Commonwealth, and with Mr Garvin,, a capable big business man of Sydney, as chairman, they formed a commission to inquire into and report on the question of the unification of the gauges of the railways in the Commonwealth. A f t e r examining all our railway systems, and considering the throughout the world, the commission recommended the 4 f t. 8^-in. gauge as a standard gauge for the Commonwealth. Aft e r the presentation of the commission's report, a conference of state premiers and the prime minister of the Commonwealth was held, which adopted that report. The conference agreed that, for cheapness of construction, capacity, speed, and safety, the 4 f t. 8|-in. gauge should be adopted. In the course of the consideration of the bill for the construction of the transcontinental line in South Australia and Western Australia, a distance of 1,051 miles, there was a long debate on the subject of the standard railway gauge. Representatives of VicQueensland toria were anxious that the line should be constructed on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge; some considered that the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge should be adopted; and, after f u l l consideration, this Parliament decided that One of the hopes based the line should be constructed on the 4-ft 8 i in. gauge. The Commonwealth, in this case, led the way in the adoption of the standard railway gauge. A t one We have uniform postage, unitime the states of the United States of America had railways of different gauges, but it was found absolutely necessary in that country to adopt a uniform railway gauge. That was done at a cost As the various states had in of hundreds of millions of pounds. A t thfpresent time it is possible for a man to get into a train in America and travel in the same carriage for a ' f u l l week across Canada or the United States. In Many conferences were held Great Britain, also, it was found necesstate ministers and the sary for the economic working of the railway systems of the country and the safety of railway travellers to adopt a uniform gauge. In the bill before us the Government proposes the first step towards the adoption of a uniform railway gauge between New South Wales and Queensland. This is a bill for the construction of a line from Kyogle to South One of the ablest railBrisbane. New South Wales already has two railways to the Queensland border, one in Great Britain were but those travelling to Brisbane must change at the border to a railway on the 3 f t . 6 in . gauge. This change of gauge is very inconvenient to the travelling public. It may be contended that as the bill deals with the construction of a railway in which they only are concerned, Queensland and New South Wales should not call upon the Commonwealth to assist in its construction. New South Wales history of railway construction has already constructed a line along the north coast to Murwillumbah, and the construction of the line proposed by the bill would not bring more trade to that state. Each state in the Commonwealth is at the present time continuing to build railways of varying gauges. South Australia is building railways on the 5 f t . 3 in . gauge, and Queensland on the 3 f t . 6 in . gauge, and delay in the adoption of the standard gauge in railway construction in the different states must add to the cost of conversion later. A proposal has been made for the construction of a direct line from Port Augusta to Hay on the standard gauge, which would be about 500 miles long, and which it is estimated would cost £8,000,000. It would l in k up tralia, South Australia, and Victoria, are the transcontinental line w i th the New not prepared to contribute to the cost, South ""Wales system, and give a uniform because they contend that the line w ill gauge-if the proposed Kyogle to South not Brisbane line were made-fro m KalgoorThe Commonwealth Government is prelie to Brisbane. constructed for the defence of the counhave been paid by the other states as their try. portant consideration.

A t the present time, the traffic northward, on the coastal line, passes over the Clarence River by punt, but the New South Wales Government has £1,000,000 in the construction of a bridge over the Clarence.

The bridge to be erected w ill be the most expensive in Australia. line is only the first instalment of the work necessary for the unification of gauges, so that the people may travel between Brisbane to Perth without changing trains. The bill should be supported by all honourable members who regard themselves as true Australians. MrI t . GREEN (Richmond) [8.25] I having brought down this bill, for it is the first practical step towards tbe consummation of an ideal that has long been cherished-the unification of the railway gauges of the Commonwealth. I do not intend to repeat the arguments of t h e ' honourable member for South Sydney( MrE . Riley), but I agree with his contention that the proposal is of the utmost importance from the national point of view. The gauge that is accepted throughout the world as the best, and that has been adopted as the standard gauge for Australia, is New South Wales. The Commonwealth has built the transcontinental line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta on the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge, but the other states have railways of 5-ft. 3-in. or 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, whilst South Australia has both gauges. The fact that the East-West line connects gauge is responsible for heavy charges' in transporting rolling-stock. It is a great pity that Australia does not enjoy the benefits of a uniform gauge as does the United States of America,' where rolling stock can be sent over the lines of riva l companies. H a d it not been for the breaks of gauge, this country would have been saved the expense caused at Albury New South Wales is when fodder had to be distributed for starving stock. The honourable member for South Sydney supported the present . proposal on the ground of its value from a defence stand-point. No t long ago I referred to the comparative isolation of the various capital cities of Australia, decided to spend and I likened them to a series of islands that had direct communication w i th one another only by sea. A person desiring to travel by r a i l between Sydney and Melbourne, or Sydney and Brisbane, or Adelaide and Perth, has to change trains, and in time of war when it became necessary to transport I hope that the proposed new troops from one state to another, enormous congestion and delay would take place at the breaks of gauge. With a unified gauge delay at the borders would be obviated, and transportation of troops would be further facilitated by the interchangeability of Commonwealth and state rolling-stock. During the great war rolling-stock from Great Britain, and even from America, was used on the French and Belgian railways, becongratulate the Government on cause the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge was common to all those countries. I am glad to say that the old parochialism and interstate jealousies which existed before federation, and of which the varying railway gauges are a relic, are dying out. A t one time a New South Welshman was anathema to Victorians, and that feeling existed even during the early part of the war. When I transferred early in 1915 from a New South Wales regiment of light horse to a Victorian infantr y battalion 1 committed two unpardonable offencesI was not only a light horseman entering an infantr y battalion, but that of the mother state of I was a New South Welshman joining a Victorian unit. But as the war proceeded and men from different parts of Australia were assembled in the various unite, interstate divisions disappeared, and we were glad to bo known only as "" Aussies."" The Australian Imperial Force Australia. I believe that people of the younger generation are gradually freeing of the old parochialism differences, and are taking pride in their citizenship of Australia as a whole. the advancement of this projected railway I pay a tribute to the honourable for Wimmera( Mr Stewart). last year I had the pleasure of accompanying him-he Works and Railways-and General( Mr Gibson) over a big portion of the route to be traversed by this line, and we were able to see some of the country that will be opened up. velopmental sideration, was required, and it was difficult to get it constructed by Queensland and New South Wales, because of their gauges. provided for the Commonwealth forward the scheme for the unification of gauges by assisting those two states to build a line from the terminus at Kyogle to South Brisbane. operation it will do a great deal of developmental work, and the traffio will be sufficient to pay working expenses and interest, and possibly to establish a sinking fund. cularly the portion on the New South Wales side of the border, is probably the most closely-settled iu Australia. is impossible to imagine the richness of the country on both sides of the Macpherson Range. member for AVimmera made him an even more ardent advocate of the line than he had been before, and although he is a Victorian representative, deal to bring about the agreement which has permitted of the introduction bill. great deal of unmerited censure, and almost abuse, from the people and press of his own state, but being convinced that he was right, he persisted in his advocacy of the line. No credit is due to the Premiers of Western half fused to bear any share of the cost of constructing the railway. in recent months there have been changes of government and I should like the Prime Minister to Mr II. Green. tried to' bring back to inform the House whether the present the same national spirit, and premiers have been consulted. It is possible that they may take a different view themselves from that expressed by their predecessors, and interstate and that Victoria and South Australia, at any rate, w ill withdraw their' parochial For objections and recognize the national character of this project. The Prime member Minister mentioned that the Government In May of of New South Wales has promised to construct a bridge over the Clarence was then Minister for River to connect Grafton and South the PostmasterGrafton. I am sorry that that undertaking is not contained in the agreement. If the promise of the New South Wales Its deGovernment is bona fide there can be no possibilities demanded conobjection to its inclusion in the docubut an interstate railway ment that is now before the House. If that were done we would have some assurance that the bridge w ill be available for different traffic by the time the railway is comAn excellent opportunity w.as pleted. Last year I was present at a to help reception by the mayors of Grafton and South Grafton to the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page), the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson), and the then Ministerf or When the line is in Works and Railways( Mr Stewart). Among others present was Sir Joseph Carruthers, the leader of the New South Wales Legislative Council, and he definitely promised that the state government The area to be served, partiwould construct a bridge over the Clarence River. I cannot credit a newspaper statement that he has since denied having rural district made the statement, because it was heard Without seeing it it by all those who were present at that reception. To make assurance doubly sure the undertaking should be included in The visit of the honourable the bill. A bridge at that noint has been promised for over 40 years. Between Grafton and South Grafton, the Clarence River is over half a mile wide, he did a great and has a maximum depth of 70 feet. It is a magnificent stream, but instead of of this being, as it should be, a great asset to the For that attitude he received a country, its very size and grandeur have acted as a bar to progress. Before constructing the north coast line from Sydney to South Grafton, the New South Wales Government should have built a bridge over the Clarence Victoria, South Australia, and River as an outlet for the traffie Australia, who in bef r o m the rich lands of the north of their respective states recoast which are now served by the railway from Grafton to Murwillumbah. However, That railway commences on the north in each of those states, bank of the Clarence, and ends on the south bank of the Tweed. I ts position is worse than that of the transcontinental railway. The town of Lismore, with a population of over 10,000 people, supplied with gas, water, electricity, and sewerage services, is absolutely unconnected by rail with any other part of the Commonwealth,, and will remain so until a bridge is built across the Clarence River at Grafton. For years past the New South Wales Government has promised to build this bridge. I should like the bill to contain a provision making it obligatory for the New South Wales Government to construct a bridge across the Clarence River. The agreement provides for the re-grading and re-laying of the line between Grafton and Kyogle. This is at present a light line laid with 60-lb. rails. In the summer iime a cloud of dust follows the train, much to the inconvenience of the passengers in the rear carriages. The newest engine used on that line was built in 1S78. use on that line? runs regularly only between Casino and Kyogle. that that line should . be re-graded and rc-laid so that heavy express traffic can be carried upon it. The proposed line will run practically straight from Brisbane South, saving a distance of 100 miles in the journey from Brisbane to Sydney, and will give the magnificent north coast district of New South Wales access to the Brisbane market, which is at present denied to it. A l though a representative of New South Wales, I am glad that this line will traverse Queensland territory. I am not a "" state righter,"" as are many other honourable members. I do not recognize state boundaries. I represent the whole of Australia, including Tasmania. I appeal to honourable members to rise above petty jealousies and to think, not of individual states, but of Australia as a whole. versation in the chamber is persisted in, coupled with interjections, I shall have Railways in 1920:to take action and name some honourable member. vides for the construction of a railway gauges of many of the existing lines, which 97 miles in length, at a cost of £3,500,000. remain This is not an exorbitant sum, considering even if the adoption of a uniform gauge was the engineering difficultes involved in crossing the Macpherson Range. The line, when constructed, will carry not only an increased interstate passenger traffic, but also heavy timber and other traffic. No loss will be sustained by the Commonwealth, because the line, when in use, is certain to show a profit. We shall experience none of the losses that are from year to year incurred on the Oodnadatta railway. AgainI ask honourable members to take a broad and national view of this agreement. do not intend to lecture honourable members on this subject, as did the honourable member whohas just spoken, because I believe that they are endowed with just as much intelligence as I have myself. Although a Queenslander, I intend to put the case for the proposed railway from Grafton to South Brisbane from the viewpoint of an Australian. It seems to me a pity that we should have state boundaries, and the consequent jealousies, in this country. Without them many existing petty jealousies would not have arisen. When important national projects, such as that to unify the railI t is very necessary way gauges of Australia, are being discussed, people are inclined to consider only whether the district iu which they live will be benefited. This railway is a national one, and is one of the links in the proposed scheme to connect up the various capitals of Australia with a uniform gauge railway. On that ground I appeal to honourable members to put aside party politics and state rights, and to support the agreement. It so happens that Queensland and New South Wales are the states particularly interested in this railway, which really is the forerunner of others connected with the scheme. That the other states will not immediately benefit is no reason why honourable members should oppose this national project.

This could be accomplished by(1) Connecting Kyogle and Brisbane with a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge line. This, I understand, has been favourably reported on by both New South Wales and Queensland. (2) By building a separate 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge line from Albury to Melbourne. (3) By building a 4-ft. 8£-in.

The foregoing would, in my opinion, largely do away with the present difficulties and inconvenience caused by the varying gauges in existence throughout Australia, and could be followed as funds permitted, and as traffic developed, by the gradual extension of the gauge which has been adopted as the Australian standard.

It was quite natural that the state premiers, in view of the opinions of the people in their respective states, could not agree to those proposals; but if they had acted as big Australians they would have agreed.

A similar bill will be passed by the New South Wales Parliament, and we in the Commonwealth Parliament are now asked to do our part. I , first as an Australian, and secondly as a Queenslander, have very much pleasure in supporting the bill. I urge the Government to instruct the Railway Council, as soon as the agreement is ratified, to proceed 6,117,000 with the work as expeditiously as possible.

I appeal to all honourable members to vote in favour of the bill which, as it sanctions a big national project, is above party, and is worthy of the support of all honourable members of this chamber. The bill is to approve, ratify, and confirm the agreement made between the Commonwealth of Australia and the States of Queensland and New South Wales, for the construction of a standard gauge line from South Brisbane to Kyogle. The preamble refers to the conference of Ministers of the Crown in July, 1920, which dealt with the unification of the railway gauges.' That conference subsequently appointed a Railway Commission of two experts, who were objected. brought from Great Britain and America. That commission recommended the adoption of a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge for a railway Notwithstanding from Brisbane to Fremantle, a distance of 3,488 miles. The bill deals with the construction of the first section of this the great'national line. The passing of this measure will be the most definite move yet made to give effect to the important recommendation of the commission, and Mr Theodore, Premier will permit of a commencement being made *with a great national work that has been too long delayed.

The Government considers that entertainments with these objects are as much entitled to complete exemption from the tax as those for which exemption at present exists under section 12 of the principal act. The requirement of the bill that the Commissioner of Taxation shall be satisfied on all the points upon which exemption is dependent is considered necessary for the effective and economical protection of the revenue, and desirable from the point of view of prompt administration of the act. The amount of revenue involved by the proposal cannot be estimated with any degree of reasonable accuracy, b u t it is considered to be small. The exemption proposed would not relieve promoters of such entertainments from the necessity to apply to the Taxation Department for exemption, because it will be necessary for the department to be satisfied that the entertainment is one which falls within the exemption. Promoters of these entertainments, as in all other cases, w ill , therefore, continue to be liable to the penalties provided by the principal act for failure to register the entertainments with the department. The proposed exemption will operate from the date when the act receives the royal assent.

If the entertainment presented by the American Chautauqua party is exempt, I certainly think that evenings arranged by national societies to keep alive the national spirit should aho be exempt. In sider that imposing the entertainments tax on certain private dances is making taxation a fine art. Many small private dance3 are held in various halls by ten or a dozen people, simply because The experience of the past few the participants have not a room in their own homes large enough for The dancing.
