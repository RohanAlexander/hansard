I remind the honourable gentleman that it is not usual for a government to make representations to the governments of Other countries in regard to tariff proposals or other matters of domestic policy. This Parliament would be the first to resent any such interference from a foreign country.

In view of the contradictory statements which have been made, will the Prime Minister state whether the delay is due to a shortage of loan money and, as he has said, the matter will receive ful l consideration when next year's scheme of work is being prepared, or whether the project is being held up for the reasons given by the Premier of South Australia ? who can be responsible for the policy of the Commonwealth Government are the members of that",12,Representatio N Oe Th E Northern Territory

The extract is as follows:If the recommendation of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures had been followed, Mr W. M . Hughes, M.H.R., would, if he had cared to accept the position, now be Minister for Trade and Customsi n the Bruce Page Ministry. The Secretary to the Chamber( Mr F. Edwards) said to-day that, at the Manufacturers' dinner last year, the question of filling the position left vacant by Mr Pratten's death was discussed by several manufacturers with the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce). The manufacturers said that they were much concerned about the matter. replied that he also was much concerned about this vexed question, and asked that the chamber should make a recommendation. As a result, the Chamber wrote stating that, in its opinion, the most suitable man in the Federal Parliament on tbe "" unattached "" list was Mr Hughes. Isi t a fact that the Prime Minister invited the members of the Chamber of Manufactures to make a recommendation as to a suitable man to be appointed as Minister for Trade and Customs? Was such a recommendation made? I have no comment to make upon the reckless disregard of the advice given. the honourable member for Dalley was present, I invited the members of the Chamber of Manufactures to make any contributions they wished towards the solution of the problem of appointing a suitable Minister for Trade and Customs.

What is the result of the overtures made by the Premier of South Australia concerning the application of a petrol tax, and the possibility of that form of taxation taking the place of the apparently unfair power-weight tax that is now in operation in that Statef 2. Will he consider making arrangements which will ensure that persons using petrol for power purposes, and other than in road vehicles, will receive a refund for any. tax paid, and will not be called upon to pay the tax in future? 3. Will he see that, if this matter is not adjusted in the meanwhile, it will be discussed at the next Premiers' Conference? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Representations in regard to this matter were made by the Premier of South Australia in December last, and it was also mentioned at the Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in Canberra, in the following month. The discussions at the conference, however, showed that there was a lack of agreement between the States on the subject. The Commonwealth Government is not prepared to give consideration to a proposal of the nature mentioned, which has not the support of the States as a whole. 2. Great difficulty has been experienced in connection witli the application of the existing Customs By-law providing for a refund to oil importers in respect of petrol used for nonroad purposes, as the importers have found it quite impracticable to collect the necessary evidence of the use of the petrol for other than road purposes. As the duty is paid in the first instance by the importers and the oil usually passes through intermediaries before it ultimately reaches the actual consumer, the practical difficulties in tlie way of handling the discrimination in tariff duties by any nation; refunds and ensuring that the oil has not been used for road purposes are considerable. The whole question of what action can be taken to meet the situation is at present being carefully investigated by the Department of Trade and Customs. 3. Consideration will be given to the honourable member's suggestion. General, upon notice1. With reference to the recent prosecution under the Crimes Act of a former officer of the Federal Capital Commission, was such prosecution launched by the Commission or by the Commonwealth police? 2. Before such prosecution, did the Commission punish the officer concerned on the finding of a Board of Inquiry? 3: Did the Commission then recommend a prosecution under the Crimes Act; if not, who recommended the prosecution and who approved it? ' honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The prosecution referred to, in which the defendant was charged with and convicted of imposing upon the Federal Capital Commission by an untrue representation with a view to obtain money, was instituted by the Commonwealth police. 2. The Commission inquired into the matter, reduced the officer's salary, and informed the officer that his appointment would be terminated. 3. The Commission was not invited to make a recommendation and made no recommendation. The prosecution was directed by the Attorney-General. Trade and Customs, upon notice1. Has his attention been drawn to the fact that the United States of America has imposed discriminatory duties on Australian goods imported into America? 2. Will the Government give consideration to the imposition of retaliatory measures against any nation using its tariff in a manner prejudicial to Australia as against any other country ? 3. Does the Government propose to take any steps to protect the interests of Australian exporters who are subject to any unfavorable if not, why not? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2 and 3. The matter is receiving careful consideration in all its aspects.",16,Submarines Oxley

Of those, 114, or 1.36 per thousand, were admitted to mental institutions.

Approximately SYSTEM OP PAYMENT. upon noticeWhether he w ill alter the system of payment to old-age pensioners by issuing a government cheque, delivered by post to the pensioner, instead of the present method, which causes elderly people to wait for hours at post offices ? session, I have carefully considered the question of altering the method of payment of pensions, and providing for payment by cheque, postal note, or money order forwarded through the post. I am, however, satisfied, as the result of my investigation and in the light of departmental experience, that the present method of payment is the most suitable, both for the pensioners and for the department. As few pensioners have banking accounts, payment by cheque would make it necessary for most pensioners to asked the Minister for cash their cheques through tradespeople. upon notice-rThis would be undesirable, as it might put the pensioner, to some extent, in the hands of the tradesmen. The pensioner might be obliged to give the tradesman his custom, although it might not suit him to do so. Payment by money order system, as this method of payment would involve going to the post office. Payment by postal note would involve either going to the post office or cashing the note through tradespeople. As there are frequent changes of address by pensioners, payment either by cheque, postal note, or money order would result in delay in the payment of pensions, because the documents would frequently be posted before the department received notice of the change of address. The present method of payment does not necessarily involve waiting at post offices, as payment can be secured at the post office at any time within three weeks following the pension pay-day. The waiting that now occurs at post offices is, in the main, due to the fact that large numbers of -pensioners attend some time before the post .. ..104 office opens.

On the 7th February the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) asked, inter alia, the following question:(4) What was the total Government expenditure at Canberra up to 31st December, 1923? I am now in a position to advise the honourable member as follows:The total Government expenditure at Canberra up to the 31st December, 1928, was £11,407,081. including interest paid and accrued to that date. Of this expenditure an amount of £1,728,000 was met from the receipts of the Federal Capital Territory. pose to take what may be regarded as an unusual course in movingThat Arbitration (Public Service) Act determinations by the Arbitrator, Numbers 33, 34, 35 and 30 of 1928, laid upon the table in the House of Representatives on the 7th February, be printed. whether it is in order for the honourable member for Reid to move for the allowance of certain determinations; which is what a motion for the printing of these papers amounts to? A private member cannot lay papers upon the table of the House; that is done by the Government not by private members. I suggest that the honourable member has no justification for moving a motion relating to any subject which he may wish to discuss except under the Standing Orders of this House, which provide that he may move, if he can get the necessary support, the adjournment of the House, or proceed after giving notice of a motion. My point is that it is not in order for a private member to move that a paper be printed when he was not responsible for the laying upon the table of the particular document referred to. I suggest that the Prime Minister might read Standing Order No. 322, which makes ample provision for the motion of the honourable member for Reid. The latter part of it readsProvided that when a paper has been laid exercise of which may cause difficulties. on the table, a motion may be made at any .time, without notice, that the paper be Attention was drawn to this possibility printed. showGroom) -The Prime Minister has already spoken. As to the point of order which he has raised-whethe r the motion moved by the honourable member for Reid that a document which was laid upon the table of the House last week be printed, is in order-the right of a private member to move at any time that a paper be printed is clear. According to the practice of the House, Ministers are the only persons entitled to lay papers upon the tableprivate members have no such right-bu t Standing Order No. 318 saysOn any paper being laid before the House, it shall be in order to move (1) that it be read, and, if necessary, a day appointed for its consideration; (2) that it be printed. The question was raised last session, and I then examined the position carefully. Standing Order No. 322 readsA Printing Committee, to consist of seven members, shall be appointed at the commencement of each Parliament, to which shall stand referred all petitions and papers presented to the House, or laid upon the table, the committee to report fro m time to time as to what petitions and papers ought to be printed, and whether wholly or in part: provided that when a paper has been laid on the table, a motion may be made at any time, without notice, that the paper be printed.

The Government may claim that it has a legal right to act as it proposes; but in view of its continual protestations that the awards of the Arbitration Court must be obeyed, it cannot justify its action. It has made no attempt to justify the outrageous reduction in wages, and the increased working hours awarded by Mr Justice Lukin in the timber workers' case. The Prime Minister and his supporters merely say, "" There is an award of the court and it must be obeyed. Why quarrel with the umpire?"" Yet the Government is itself quarrelling with the umpire. What are the objections to this award? The award given by the Public Service Arbitrator gives less than the allowance provided in the regulations for. other public servants.

On what grounds do the Government seek to disallow this award? Why do they challenge the decision of the Public Service Arbitrator? I know that the Prime Minister supported by the Attorney-General, will quote a section of the act, in which provision is made for the disallowance by Parliament of awards of the arbitrator. But is the right honourable gentleman going to base his objection on a legal technicality, without dealing with the case on its merits? A government was never in a more ignominious position. At a time when the Prime Minister is exhorting unionists receiving £3 19s. a week to obey awards of the court he is instrumental in moving to disallow an award of the Public Service Arbitrator. There is not an honourable member in this House who would do the work in which the timber workers are engaged for four times the amount they are paid. These men are governed by an award given by a judge whose weekly pension will be at least five times what they receive. In effect, the Prime Minister said, "" Never mind the merits of the case."" The Government has arranged that a motion for the disallowance of the award shall be moved in another place, where the Opposition is not so strong as it is in this chamber. Action of this kind is taken by the right honourable gentleman who leads an administration that is always speaking of law and order. This is the Prime Minister who said, ""We must observe the awards of the court and the laws of the country! "" We on this side of the chamber are represented as the representatives of certain bloodthirsty revolutionaries in Australia. Whatever we may be, we helieve in justice. A. good deal has been said recently about industrial peace and round-table conferences; but the action of that the Government in this connection is anything but conciliatory. The men concerned are not to be paid a single penny to assist them in meeting the extra cost of living in Canberra. Mr Scullin. General receives a substantial allowance. £2,000 a year to meet the high cost of living at Canberra, but these men are not to receive one penny. I remind honourable members that the motion for the printing It is the only means that presents itself of obtaining a test vote. The Prime Minister said that we should move the adjournment of the House and be decent about it. He knows that a motion for the adjournment of the House provides an opportunity for ventilating a grievance, but inmost cases an opportunity of voting is not given. We have no desire to obstruct the business of the House, but we are determined notwithstanding whatever charges may be made, to fight on the floor of the House for these people, and particularly those who are amongst the lowest paid in this country. I should like any honourable member who can to justify the attempt which is being made by a member of the Government in another place to disallow the arbitrator's award. I know the Attorney-General will pump some legal technicality into the ear of the Prime Minister and tell him that the action which the Government is taking is in accordance with the Public Service regulations. Provision was made by an award of the Public Service Arbitrator for the payment of child endowment to certain public servants, and the burden of the Attorney-General's argument was that it was against the regulations and so on. There was not a question of merit. present Attorney-Generali t was his predecessor who did what I say. entirely different grounds. was objected to on the ground it was contrary to the regulations.

A lead has been given by this Government to disregard the arbitration awards. Surely the Government should be the first to set an example, particularly when their objection is only a technical one. willing to thresh out the case on its merits, why did it not introduce a motion for the disallowance of the award in this chamber as well as in another place?

That is the view I take, too. You, Mr Speaker, make the Standing Orders your guide, and follow them in giving a decision; but I suggest that it is desirable for the proper conduct The of our business, that when a revision of the Standing Orders takes place -and I hope it may be possible to arrange for that-thi s particular standing order should be altered.

As to the complaint that the matter should not be If the Government were dealt with in the Senate, I remind honourable members that on several occasions action has been taken in that chamber to disallow ordinances or regulations, and that course has been adopted by honourable members opposite. It is provided in the statute that action can be taken in either House of Parliament for the disallowance of any regulation or ordinance laid upon the table. both Houses. one only. It has been suggested that this course was adopted by the Government for the purpose of shirking discussion. Honourable members opposite must be forgetting that there is a procedure by which the adjournment of the House matter, and that such a matter may also be discussed upon the ordinary motion for day's business. The only point that has been made by members of the Opposition i i that, in moving for the disallowance of the determination of the Federal Arbitrator, the Government is going back on everything it has ever said on the subject of arbitration; that the Government, which said that the law must be obeyed, and that persons who submit their case to arbitration must abide by the award of the arbitrator, is now proposing to do something exactly contrary to what it preached. But let me remind honourable members that the law does not require the Government to accept the determination of the arbitrator. It is definitely laid down that any determination of the arbitrator must be laid on the table of Parliament, which has constituted itself",26,Determination S Of Public Service Arbitrator

109,Mr Bruce,"No; it need be done in the final determining autliority in these issues, and has specifically withheld such power from the Public Service Arbitrator. Of matters which come before the Arbitration Court, Parliament has decided that the court itself shall be the final arbiter. It is a wise and proper provision that Parliament should reserve to itself the right to revise the decisions of the Public Service Arbitrator, because these matters concern the great Commonwealth Public Service for which Parliament is responsible, and for which it must provide the money. Parliament must have the power to intervene if it thinks fit iu the regulation and conduct of the service. It is very rare that Parliament exercises this power, but there are occasions when it must intervene, and this is one of them. If Parliament does not intervene now, either a great injustice will be done te many public servants or it will be necessary to make a complete revision of many of the regulations now governing the Service. When the task of transferring the federal departments to Canberra was first begun, the public servants concerned were given no option as to whether or not they would be moved. For this reason special provision was made by regulation under the Public Service Act for the payment of housing and living allowances to jmblic servants who were compulsorily transferred to Canberra. Later, however, public servants were transferred to Canberra from Sydney, Melbourne, and other places by way of promotion, or for other reasons, in the ordinary working of the Service. It was then recognized that if the Canberra allowance were paid to such officers, a great injustice would be done to such members of the Service as were transferred in the ordinary course of events to other parts of Australia where the cost of living was just as high as in Canberra. Service Arbitrator find that out? later. A good illustration of how unfairly such a rule would work is provided in the case of Queanbeyan and Canberra. Queanbeyan is just outside the Federal Territory, and officers stationed there do not receive the Canberra allowance. If the award which has been made by the Public Service Arbitrator were given effect, an officer transferred from Queanbeyan to Canberra would receive this cost of living allowance, but one transferred from Canberra to Queanbeyan would not, notwithstanding the fact that the cost of living is slightly higher in Queanbeyan than in Canberra. Cooktown, officers are paid a special tropical allowance, but generally speaking, no extra payment is made to civil servants even though stationed in districts where the cost of living is just as high as in Canberra. plained to the Public Service Arbitrator ? presently. Most of the persons concerned are postal workers. They are being transferred to Canberra from all parts of New South Wales, and possibly from other States as well, but the Public Service Arbitrator appears to have dealt with the matter as if they were all coming from Sydney or Melbourne. Two separate concessions were granted to civil servants compulsorily transferred to Canberra; first, they were granted a special housing allowance because housing costs are undoubtedly higher in Canberra than in many other parts of Australia, and, secondly, they were granted a cost of living allowance. The housing allowance was made of general application to all civil servants who came to Canberra, and was not limited to those who were compulsorily transferred. The cost of living allowance was limited under the Public Service regulations to officers who were compulsorily transferred. The Government is of the opinion that the Public Service Arbitrator has made a mistake in making this award.

The Prime Minister has acted in a perfectly proper manner. the circumstances surrounding this finding of the Public Service Arbitrator must convince honourable members that this is an occasion on which they should exercise the power which they have reserved to themselves of disallowing a finding which does not do justice to the whole Service. Unless Parliament is satisfied that a particular finding is fair and just, it should not allow it to go unchallenged. No proper analogy can be drawn between the case of persons who submit themselves to a tribunal of final jurisdiction and undertake to obey its awards, and the case which is now under notice. The legislature has determined that the Arbitration Court shall be the final authority in matters with which it deals, and that there shall be no appeal against its decisions. Its awards may not therefore be reviewed even by Parliament; they must be accepted and obeyed. Buti t has been laid down that the decisions of the Public Service Arbitrator shall be subject to review by Parliament. Consequently, it is quite, proper for Parliament to determine whether a particular decision shall be allowed or disallowed, and that obligation should not be shirked. As to the merits of the case before us, there can be no possible doubt. The principle the Government has adopted is to apply to officers transferred to Canberra in the ordinary course of their employment the conditions which apply to officers transferred to oth«r parts of the Commonwealth is perfectly just. Those conditions are laid down by the Public Service Board, which determines whether an allowance should or should not be paid. The board takes into consideration all the circumstances in deciding such matters. represented before the Public Service Arbitrator when this decision was given ? Service Commissioners were represented. was not a party to the award? Commissioners appear before the Public Service Arbitrator to argue matters which are submitted to him. After he has given his determination it rests with Parliament to allow it or disallow it . I stress particularly that no proper analogy can be drawn between the proceedings before the Arbitration Court and those before the Public Service Arbitrator. Jt is unthinkable that Parliament should approve of the payment to all officers of special allowances which were fixed, primarily, for application only to officei * compulsorily transferred from Melbourneto Canberra when the Seat of Government was established here. It would be grossly unjust to do so.

As a matter of fact, this most interesting subject has been brought into the chamber through a side door. A motion appears on the business-paper of another place with the object of disallowing this award. I am bound to say that when I saw it there I was confident that the Government would not proceed with it in that chamber. If it were to be proceeded with at all I felt certain that the Government would cause the discussion to take place in this House. I do not intend to discuss the merits of the question. The plain facts are these: the principle of arbitration is at stake. Certain officers of the Public Service approached the Arbitrator and obtained an award. Thereupon the Government thought fit to ask another place to disallow the award. I do not say that Parliament should not be allowed to review an award of the Arbitrator; but if it is to be reviewed the whole Parliament should review it. The matter should certainly not be submitted to that chamber whose present members have not been elected by the recent vote of the people. It is well known that number of the honourable gentlemen at present sitting in another place are there because they were members of the last Parliament, and not because they have recently been elected by the people. If awards of the Public Service Arbitrator are to be disallowed it should be only with the approval of this chamber. should be withdrawn and an opportunity given to honourable members to discuss the main question to-morrow. If that course is taken I shall vote with the Government ; if it is not, I shall vote, against it. Hurry, G. agree to that course we will withdraw the motion. wish to make my position perfectly clear. If the motion simply means that a parliamentary paper is to be printed, it is formal. If it means more than that, it is an effort by the Opposition to take the business of the House out of the hands of the Government. I object to that being done. I do not intend to be forced into the position of voting on the allowance or disallowance of an award by a motion of this kind. I consider that this is an attempt by the Opposition to take the business of the House out of the hands of the Government, and not an effort to obtain a decision as to whether the award should be allowed or disallowed.

That the bill be now read a second time. shall say but few words concerning this measure, which is extremely technical and, so far as I am competent to judge, unobjectionable. When I say this of a bill introduced by the present Government, at least it may be regarded as faint praise. It is open to question whether we are not, in our legislation, tending to overload what is known as the Acts Interpretation Act; whether we are not legislating rather by a process of interpretation than by indicating, in clear terms, what is intended to be done by each particular measure. Therefore, I suggest that while this bill is, as I have said, unobjectionable in principle, it is open to criticism inasmuch as it means legislation by interpretation. The earlier provisions are designed to give the form and substance of statute law to rules which have been laid down in decisions of the High Court, and are intended to save as much of the law as can be saved in those cases where part at least of an act has been declared ultra vires of the Constitution. Up to the present this question has been a prolific source of legal argument, which has disclosed a considerable amount of ingenuity on the part of members of the legal profession, followed by considered decisions hy members of the High Court Bench. Proposed new section 19A, which appears as clause 4 in the bill, readsWherei n any act, whether passed before or after the commencement of this section, it is provided that the act shall be administered by a specified Minister of State of the Commonwealth, or shall be administered, controlled or carried into effect by a specified Department of State of the Commonwealth(a) the reference to that Minister shall be read as a reference to any Minister act is allotted by order of the Governor General and shall be deemed to include any Minister or Member of the Executive Council for the timebeing acting for and on behalf of the Minister to whom the administration of the act is so allotted; and (6) tlie reference to that department shall be read as a reference to any department to which the administration of the act is allotted by This provision is apparently a machinery one to provide for those cases in which it is desired to allot particular duties of administration to a Minister not hitherto named or indicated, including an Acting Minister.

I am not questioning his ability to occupy his present position, but before I congratulate him I should like to know a little more of his tariff proclivities. Had he been allowed to proceed with his speech last Friday without interruption by the Prime Minister, I believe that considerable light would have been thrown upon his motives. When the Minister was beginning to explain his policy, the Prime Minister in an undertone advised him not to do so. At any rate the Minister did not then complete the sentence that he was uttering. I suppose that what he was not allowed to say in this House he gave expression to at a certain meeting in Sydney that he addressed last week-end. The Minister during his second-reading speech made no definite pronouncement as to his tariff leanings. He said much about mergers. He hid behind combines and enshrouded his words with ambiguities, so that his attitude towards the true principles of the tariff is yet unknown. I therefore must decline to congratulate him on his accession to office. The people will not tolerate a Minister who moves in zig-zag fashion, who is a free trader this week and a protectionist the next. Compare the attitude of the present Minister with that of the previous Minister. The late MrH . E. Pratten always strove for a homogeneous policy. He had a distinct objective when dealing with the tariff, and left no doubt in the minds of the great mass of the people of this country as to his attitude. I have already noticed many defects in the present Minister. He undoubtedly has a lack of sympathy with what is no doubt the pronounced opinion of the people. The bill proposes to amend the Tariff Board Act for the third time, and the Minister, in explaining its provisions, left us in a state of uncertainty respecting the operation of the act and of the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board's report for 1926-27 contains these three recommendations which have been embodied in the bill:The hoard desires to invite attention to the receive £5 5s. for each sitting. necessity in its opinion for an amendment of the Tariff Board Act 1921-1924, in several important directions, with a view to materially increasing the efficiency of the hoard,. particularly by way of expediting its operations. At present a sitting of the board has to be If r . Fenton. called for each occasion on which it is to meet, and two members constitute a quorum. The full board consists of four members. It has to be recognized that the Australian continent is of enormous size, also that the citizens of States which are far from the seat of Government may be deeply interested in and have as much right to be heard on questions of tariff revision, as have those who live in the State nearer the Federal centre. For the whole board of four members to visit all the distant States on all matters in which parties in such States may be interested, and with reasonable frequency, is impossible. The board then goes on to recommend that for the purpose of facilitating its operations it should be divisible into committees of two members each. The proposal to expedite the work of the Tariff Board will have the support of at least this side of the House. The board recommended an alteration in the salaries of its members. Its report readsThis directly raises the question of the manner in which the board is remunerated. Except as to the chairman (who is an officer of the Public Service) such remuneration is by means of a fixed fee for every sitting attended. If provisions were made for the board to divide itself as suggested, it is considered tliat remuneration to its members should be in the form of a.n annual salary, instead of a fee as at present, and in any case it is suggested that payments by fixed salary for a whole-time board is far more desirable than payment by fee for attendance at meetings. The board also made this recommendationAnother direction in which it is thought that the act could be amended with advantage, is in relation to section 15 (1), which requires that the Minister shall refer to the board for inquiry and report;"" the classification of goods under all tariff items which provide for classification under by-law."" The bill embodies those three recommendations. Clause2 relates to the salaries of members of the board. Up to the present the chairman has been in receipt of £1,400 per annum. His salary is to be increased to £1,600. He is an officer of the Customs Department, and I presume that in addition to his fixed salary as an oflicer he has been receiving payment for his services as chairman of the board. Three members of the board Their expenses, and, I believe, those of the chairman, are met hy the Government. Last year the three members received £5 5s. for each of 300 sittings, or a total payment of £1,500. They are now to receive £6 6s. for each of 248 sittings, or a total payment of £1,560, with allowance for expenses. I find from the Estimates of last year that the total expenses for the board amounted to £1,250, or over £300 each member. that in future the Tariff Board will cost this country practically £2,000 per annum for each of its members. India, Canada, and the TJnited States of America each have some authority for tariff inquiries. In India and Canada the tariff authority is called a hoard, and in the TJnited States of America, a commission. The population of the TJnited States of America today is about 120,000,000, and the area of its territory, within a few square miles, is about the same as that of Australia, [ts transactions through the customs and various other departments of State have reached mammoth proportions. Australia has a population of about 6,300,000. Tariff Commission of the TJnited States of America, of 175 pages, is a fine production, containing valued and varied information respecting the operations of the commission and of acts of Parliament relating to the tariff of that country. The cost of the commission is also shown. Similarly, the Tariff Board of Australia should publish an annual report, detailing the cost of its operations, including the amount paid in salaries, fees, and travelling expenses, both to the board and to its staff. It should submit, as does the Tariff Commission of the TJnited States of America, a balance-sheet showing the whole of its transactions. What do we find on analysis? The commission of the TJnited States of America, consisting of six members, controls a staff of over 200 officers, 85 of whom are professional and scientific expertsThe operations of the Commission extend beyond America. The annual report discloses that in 1927 two of the Commissioners visited twenty European countries and inquired fully into the trade relations between them and the TJnited States of America. In regard to salaries, it is clear that these Commissioners, serving 120,000,000 people, are paid very little more than the Government proposes to pay to members of the Tariff Board. Yet America is a land of big salaries, both governmental and private employers believing in paying well for the services of men of ability. As. a general principle, I believe in the payment of hi£h wages and good salaries, especially to those who do the country's work, but the Government is going too far in the creation of This means well paid posts in the Public Service. to the American Commissioners? £2,400? American Commissioners are giving service to 127,000,000 people. more important than are those of the Tariff Board. carried out by the Commission cover a much wider field than do those of the Tariff Board. Whilst the members of the board did not recommend that they The annual report of the should be paid higher salaries, they did suggest to the Minister that their financial position should be improved and that their emoluments should be on a salary basis. Yet these same gentlemen have devoted many pages of printed matter to pointing out that the high wages demanded by the workers of Australia are a menace to industry. Their attitude when their own interests are at stake is at least inconsistent with their criticism of the workers. The proposals in regard to salaries will require investigation, and unless the Minister can, in committee, furnish more justification for the change than was contained in his brief second-reading speech, the majority of honourable members will not be likely to sanction any increase. The present Government has offended in this regard more than any other. It is continually appointing men at very high salaries, sometimes to do quite unimportant duties. Thousands of pounds have heen paid to individual public servants who work under model conditions; yet Ministers are for ever criticizing the workers who are fighting hard to obtain reasonable, wages and decent conditions of employment. Quite recently, without consulting Parliament or, so far as I know, the Public Service Board, the Government raised the salary of one public servant to several thousand pounds per annum. The time has come to call a halt to political patronage of that character.",31,Gullett

They are a sort of earnest that, although the Government is not doing al! that such members desire, it is taking some step towards the adoption of their free trade views. The Minister is wise in adopting the recommendation of the board that it should be relieved of detailed work under by-laws, such as the classification and valuation of goods. The law at present requires the board to make a detailed investigation of these matters, but in practice it has been guided by the reports of the expert officers of the department. I believe that these experts may be trusted to discharge their duties faithfully and -veil in the future as they did before the board was created. This tribunal, being relieved of much detail work, will be freer to deal with more important matters. At the same time the Minister reserves the right to refer to the board any important question of classification or valuation. The amendments proposed in clause 5 emphasize once again the unnecessarily complicated manner in which proposed alterations of existing laws are brought 6efore the House. amendment should be couched in such plain and simple language as to be easily understandable by every honourable member and by the general public. It may e that this manner of setting forth mendments is designed to facilitate a consolidation of the tariff laws. As an instance of the draftsmanship to which I take exception, I quote paragraph (e) of clause 5Section 15 of the principal act is amended(e) by omitting from sub-section (3.) the words "" that any complaint referred to it under paragraph (7i) of subsection (1.) of this section is justified "" and inserting in their stead the words "", in respect of any question referred to it under paragraph (7i) of sub-section (1.) of this section, that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the T a r if f "" ; and On referring to the principal act I found that the words quoted in the clause are not there; they belong to an amending statute.

After the appointment of a person to be Director of Economic Besearch, the Minister may direct the board to confer with the Director upon any particular matter referred to the board for inquiry and report, and, when so directed, the board shall so confer accordingly."" We have not been told who is likely to be appointed Director of Economic Research; but we hope he will be a person well qualified and fully capable of carrying out the important duties which he will have to perform. Notwithstanding the number of commissions, boards and committees already in existence, a bureau is to be established and additional appointments at high salaries are still being made. I do not object to scientific research, because I think we should avail ourselves of the best brains that are available to assist us; but I trust that a director will be appointed who understands Australian conditions, and who can carry on the work of an important department in accordance with the desire of a vast majority of the Australian people. Before the measure leaves this chamber I trust the Minister will give some indication of who is likely to be appointed. Will he be some economic expert from Cambridge or Oxford who has no knowledge of Australian trade and conditions? Will this economic policeman, who will be acting under instructions from the Minister, be of the old Cobden school? Will he be competent to investigate the efficiency or suitability of an industry? If the right gentleman is selected he should be able to assist tbe board in coming to a correct determination about some of the matters upon which it requires expert assistance. member concerned with the personnel of the board? member of the Country party that that organization has practically demanded that those engaged in rural industries should he represented on the board, and to that I have no objection if the right man is selected. If particular sections said that the Chairman of the Board, who is a Government servant, represents the consumers' interests; but I maintain that a worker is quite capable of representing the consumers. Honourable members opposite should dismiss from their minds the thought that if a worker were placed upon the board he would represent a mere coterie. Working people and their dependants comprise the great bulk of the consumers, and if a worker were placed on the Tariff Board the consumers' requirements would be fully considered. I trust that at a later stage the Minister will give us a declaration of his real attitude in regard to tariff matters. Hp to the present we can only regard his utterances as ambiguous. does not regard the Minister's utterances at Sydney on Monday last as ambiguous. Mr Pratten had delivered that speech he would have expressed the sentiments of every member of the Opposition. As a member of the Government the Minister dare not say other than he did. He says that he is a protectionist. Even the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) says that he is favorable in some instances to a certain measure of protection; but under the protection which he favours many of our industries would remain in operation for only a few weeks. Tariff work is of such importance in the United States of America that on the staff of the Tariff Commission in that country there are 85 professional and scientific experts conducting investigations. The application of honourable science to industry is essential; but if the proposed Director of the Bureau of Research is to be a man of the Cobden type, his services will be of little use to Australia. The Government must avoid the appointment of a person who even through unconscious bias may seriously interfere with the progress of our secondary industries. There are certain features in the measure which I shall support; but unless",34,Gullett

Eor the work they do I consider they are at present well paid, especially when they are associated with men who think that the workers are getting their dues. The Minister stated that higher salaries would have to be paid to obtain, the services of the best men. Apart from special occasions on which, in order to expedite the furnishing of a report they may have to work overtime, they will conclude their work at 3 p.m. and return to their own business houses. In many instances, the United States of America shows the way we should go, and although that country pays high salaries, I believe the fees proposed to be paid to the members of the board are too high, particularly as they will give only a portion of their time to tariff work. I trust that the opinions I have expressed concerning the Minister's fiscal beliefs are not unjust, but I can judge his possible action only by his utterances. I do not think he will administer the department with the same regard foT Australian industries as was displayed by the late Mr TL E. Pratten. He was a man in whom honourable members on this side of the chamber'had confidence, and I trust that the present actions with the protectionist policy which has been so strongly supported hy the people at every election. encourage Australian production and assist in providing employment for every man and woman in Australia who desires it, and also for those who That is the policy which I desire to see the Tariff Board follow, and any experts appointed to advise it should work with the idea of Australia's advancement in view.

If we were to apply with equal thoroughness the other methods employed by the United not be necessary to raise duties to an unreasonable level. Unfortunately, we have borrowed from the United States too much of our tariff legislation and too little of the efficiency by which that country has become so prosperous. The honourable member was almost eloquent when he urged that the Minister should do nothing to hinder Australia's industries, but he seemed to have in mind only our manufacturing industries. Are we to give all our consideration to the manufacturing interests in the city, and none to the activities of those on the land ? The honourable member for Maribyrnong raises objection to the proposal that the Tariff Board shall hold conferences with experts on economics. If we are not to consider the economic effect of the tariff, how are we to make it operate in the interests of the people as a whole? Apparently, no heed is to be paid to the requirements of the primary, producers. Every utterance made by responsible public men in recent times points to the fact that we have already gone a long way towards jeopardizing the real interests of the nation. After six years of magnificent seasons, when prices for primary produce have been higher than at any other period of our history and the expenditure of millions Minister will reconcile his of loan money there is actually more unemployment than ever before. We are coming very near the breaking point. It should be his desire to I congratulate the Minister on having brought in his first bill, but I regret that it contains no provision which will have the effect of making the Tariff Board of greater value to Australia. Personally, I come to us from overseas. believe in the Tariff Board. Some fifteen years ago an interstate commission was appointed to investigate and report on tariff anomalies, and make recommendations to the Government of the day.

In the Customs Tariff 1908, there were only eight items which provided ad valorem duties of 40 per cent, or over. Of these six were 40 per cent, and the remaining two 45 per cent. In the existing Customs Tariff there are 259 items or sub-items whicli provide ad valorem rates of 40 per cent, or over as set out hereunder:93 providing 40 per cent. 72 providing 45 per cent. 35 providing 50 per cent. 19 providing 55 per cent. 38 providing 00 per cent. 2 providing 05 per cent.

Any one who has investigated the effect of the present tariff or has come into contact with the difficulties experienced by primary producers and manufacturers knows that full effect has not been given to the express intention of Parliament in regard to the protection of industries. This is due either to the insufficiency of the duty, to the breaking down of certain customs machinery or to the adoption of new methods of dumping or something of that sort which nullifies the measure of protection we have set up in this Parliament. It would undoubtedly be of advantage to allow the Tariff Board to be divided for the purpose of conducting inquiries in different cities simultaneously upon the same subject. This would obviate delay, and delay is one of the great causes of trouble at the present time with the manufacturers of Australia. ""Minister will readily recognize that delay is harmful to the manufacturer. No doubt it is equally harmful, in certain circumstances, to the primary producer; but it is particularly harmful to the manufacturer whose prices represent a gross return which enables him to meet his daily or weekly obligations. Such a man may find that the whole financial situation of his business is upset through the dumping into Australia, without any prior warning or notice, of goods similar to those he is manufacturing at prices enabling them to be retailed at half of his cost of production. circumstances, prompt assistance, he is faced with the necessity for closing his factory, or with financial ruin if he carries on. That has been the story of many small and large enterprises in Australia. I shall give the Minister one or two examples so that it may not be said that I am merely generalizing on this subject. nexion with the Tariff Board? that the Tariff Board, which has power to make recommendations, does not act expeditiously enough in cases of dumping, or, if the board does act expeditiously, that the Minister does not follow its recommendations quickly enough with administrative or parliamentary action. When I was in Sydney a few days ago firms manufacturing knitted goods were faced with great difficulties because Italian half hose was being sold by retailers at 16s. 6d. a dozen, a price with which no Australian manufacturer could successfully compete. Although we have in Australia a large manufacture of fur felt hats, the major portion of our fur felt hat trade is possessed by Erance and Italy. Foreign hats are dumped here to the detriment of an Australian industry which is employing and training Australian workmen. imported hats lower than the ruling prices for them in the countries of origin ? turers say so. The honourable member has raised a point which is pertinent to the discussion of this bill. At the preThe sent time the onus of proving dumping rests upon the Australian manufacturer. charge to prove. almost impossible to prove it. It has been advocated, and I advocate it here to-night, that it is only reasonable that in such cases the onus of proof should not be left entirely to the Australian manufacturer; that if a prima facie case has been made out that dumping is taking place, part of the onus of proof, at any rate, should rest on the importer. unless he is given facie case? case would be made out if it could be shown that fur felt hats were being imported at a rate which would he equivalent to 6s. 6d. retail, and they were suddenly made available at 3s. 6d. retail. That fact would not be actual proof, but would be prima facie evidence of dumping. A few months ago we increased the ad valorem duty on shock absorbers for motor cars in the belief that that would fully protect the Australian manufacfacturer. But it was subsequently found that he was getting no greater protection than previously, because the overseas manufacturer of motor car chassis declined to make adequate allowance in price if shock absorbers are eliminated.",40,Gullett

I do not know the cost of shock absorbers in the United States of America, but if they have a retail price that position. I do not know to what there equal to £10, as a separate item of motor car equipment, when the chassis is shipped Australia minus shock absorbers, the importer gets credit for only 15s., there is clearly a prima facie case of dumping to the detriment of the Australian manufacturer. At any rate, the ad valorem duty has proved ineffective, and the only effective way of affording protection to the Australian turer would be to impose a flat rate specific duty. I am aware, however, that a discussion on these lines will take me far beyond the scope of the bill. The measure itself is very restricted in character, because it merely concerns the constitution of the board and the duties and remuneration of the members of the board. I agree with Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), that there is no justification circumstances for the increased remuneration At a time when economy is heing preached in many directions it seems most inconsistent on the part of the Government to propose unnecessarily to increase the emoluments of the board. I do not agree with the suggestion made by the honourable member for Swan Gregory) that the chairman of the board should not be in any way identified with the Customs Department. It is distinctly advantageous to have as chairman a man in the Customs Department with a complete knowledge of the intricate working of the tariff. We have been fortunate in that always we have had men of proved integrity and outstanding ability as permanent heads of the Customs Department. If we can continue to command the services of such men, there will never the committee stage rather than on the be any reason to impugn the integrity of the board or suggest that it is biased one way or the other. Mr Theodore. the act to have as chairman of the Tariff Board an administrative oflicer of the That, I contend, is an excellent practice. It works very satisfactorily, and I hope that we shall always have a senior oflicer of the Department of Trade and Customs filling extent the Tariff Board, as a wholeI am and if not speaking with any particular referto ence to the chairman-migh t in future be influenced by the Minister or the Government of the day. The board functions in a manner somewhat different from ordinary judicial bodies. From the nature of its investigations it must necessarily be in close contact with the Customs Department and the administration, and in manufaccertain circumstances it might be influenced to give effect to the policy of the Government. that the Tariff Board should give effect to the policy of the Government? yes; but I suggest that it would be most unfortunate for the Commonwealth if the Tariff Board gave effect to the policy of the honourable member for the present Minister for Trade and Customs.

I take it that your ruling contains the implication that the opinion expressed by the honourable member for Warringah is quite erroneous and misleading. However, I do not desire to carry the discussion any further. I realize that the bill is one for debate at motion for the second reading, but the measure is so limited, that one is tempted to go beyond the scope of the bill.",41,Gullett

208,Mr Theodorei Am Not Particu,"compliment the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) for this rather belated attempt to amend the Tariff Board Act. Up to the present, too much attention has been given by the board to those who have been able to make the most effective appeal for protective duties. I hope that the newly constituted hoard will be oomposed of non-party men of a scientific and economic turn of mind, capable of analysing fully the effect of proposed new duties. Every request for protective duties should be scientifically examined. Quite recently we welcomed the British Economic Mission, the members of which made a careful inquiry into our economic position and tendered certain advice in a memorandum forwarded to the Prime Minister. If we are to eliminate unemployment in. Australia, we must conduct all our business undertakings on sound economic lines. I take it that this is what the Government has in mind in connection with the bill. I am pleased to know that the board will be empowered to confer with the Director of Economic Research, upon any matter that may be referred to it for inquiry and advice. This encourages me in the belief that in future our system of protection will be administered on a more economic basis. Hitherto it has been possible for quite unimportant industries to secure protection, to the disadvantage of other concerns. The iron and steel industry, for example, has been unduly weighted by the protection given to a number of other industries. If those handicaps could be removed our manufacturers of iron and steel would be able to hold their own with competitors from other countries. As has been pointed out by other speakers, the bill provides for appointments to the board and proposes certain alterations in the act to make it possible for the board to give its attention to the more important requests that may come before it. In committee I hope to have an assurance from the Minister that the members of the board will bo untrammelled by political or party views, and will not be subject to, or be influenced by, the Minister in charge of the department. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) that this is a measure more for the committee stage than for a second-reading debate. The Minister( Mr Gullett) appeared inclined to debate the general question, and I regret that you, Mr Speaker, prevented him from doing so. The duties devolving upon the board are of the very greatest importance. As to the personnel and work of the board, I am inclined to think that the practice adopted in the United States of America is to be preferred. In that country the board is small in numbers, but it commands the services of a trained staff, which makes investigations on tariff matters, not only in the United States of America, but also in other countries, and in particular investigates the cost of the production of commodities that are imported into the United States of America in competition with home manufactures. But I doubt that our Tariff Board could prepare any report on similar lines without making investigations outside Australia. The honourable member for Dalley mentioned just now that a number of Australian industries had been practically ruined by the dumping of certain goods in Australia. If this dumping is of a temporary character, we have in the act the machinery to deal with it. has been used very expeditiously on occasion. What is feared is the lowering of prices by overseas competitors, whose production costs have been reduced . as a result of improved methods. This enables them to land goods in Australia at a cost lower than local manufacturers' prices. What action is it suggested we take to meet a situation like that? tion against it? question, whither are we tending? Are those who contend that imported goods must not be sold in Australia for less than similar goods could be manufactured here, prepared to ignore all considerations of efficiency both here and overseas?

I did so in the hope that some consideration would be given to the effect on our primary industries of any recommendation that the board might make. My anticipations in that direction have not been realized. On the contrary, the presence on the board of a representative of the primary producers has given to the board's decisions an atmosphere of justice which has not been warranted. I have in mind particularly the board's recommendations in relation to the duties on agricultural machinery. WheneverI criticized those recommendations I was told that the primary producer's own representative on the board had signed the report. by the Government of the day. ducers recommend him? with all the circumstances of his appointment. I did not challenge it. My point now is that we who claim to speak on behalf of the primary producers of the country cannot logically ask that they should be represented on the Tariff Board without conceding the. same right to other sections of the community. Buti f each section of the community had its representative on the Tariff Board working in the interest of the industry he represented, that body would become partisan rather than judicial. Much may be said both for and against the policy of having a permanent officer of the Customs Department as chairman of the Tariff Board. My experience is that the great majority of our public officers are intensely loyal, and endeavour faithfully to carry out the policy of the Government of the day. Should there be a change of Government, they say in effect "" the King is dead; long live the K in g .

Loyalty is an admirable quality. I go further, and say that officers who failed to do their best to carry out the policy of the majority of the people of Australia would be lacking a proper sense of duty, but one never knows how suddenly a turn of the political wheel may cause a change of government. one never knows. If there was a change of government it would be the duty of all public officers to carry out the policy of the new government as faithfully as they carried out the policy of the government it displaced.

231,Mr Stewart,"No; but he couldemphasized their value to Australia. He used the term "" effective protection."" The only way to grant the effective protection desired by the honourable member for Dalley is to prohibit certain imports. The American proposal was that Parliament should determine the maximum duty to be imposed, that the tariff commission would then hear evidence and make its recommendations, and that such recommendations would, in turn, be considered by the tariff adjustments board, which body would fix duties within the limits imposed by Parliament. adjustments board keep within those limits even if the evidence showed that the maximum protection agreed to by Parliament would not be effective? tariff adjustments board would be superior to Parliament. the importation of certain goods into the United States of America may be prohibited. dent of the United States of America has certain powers of veto, he cannot make any change in the tariff duties unless it has been reported upon by the Tariff Commission. He may change the classification of certain goods, or alter the assessment of the value of goods from their foreign value to their American value; but he may not change duties above 50 per cent. The exercise of those presidential powers has been limited to a few instances. There is ground for complaint that the Tariff Board's recommendations, instead of being made to the Minister, should he presented to Parliament. I have previously suggested, and I suggest again to-night, that this Parliament should appoint a tariff committee on the lines of the Public Works Committee or the Public Accounts Committee, such committee to consist of representatives of the various parties and interests in Parliament, its duties being to sift evidence in order to ascertain the facts, and to make recommendations to Parliament. If desired, the Minister could be chairman of the board. arrived at a decision many of us would probably be dead. bers of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees, and of other committees and commissions appointed from time to time are drawn from all political parties, my experience is that they work well together and do splendid work. member suggest that such a committee should work side by side with the Tariff Board? it should be appointed to consider the the tariff Tariff Board's recommendations and to report to Parliament. evidence ? sider the evidence given before the board. If effect were given to my recommendation, honourable members of this House and of another place would be in a position to deal intelligently with any proposal for the alteration of duties. I believe that this bill is an earnest attempt to improve the machinery of tariff making. We' hear a good deal about the desirability of a scientific and equitable tariff; but the experience of the United States of America shows that it is almost impossible to prepare a tariff schedule of that nature. So many factors alter the price of goods arriving here from overseas, factors such as efficiency, different methods of manufacture, new inventions, varying seasons. For instance, South Africa may unexpectedly have a most favorable season for maize, and that product may be sent here in huge quantities, and at low prices. In that case there would be an immediate clamour for the imposition of an increased duty on maize. Any attempt to frame a tariff that will satisfy every section of the community is almost hopeless. Still, we have to make the best of the policy that we have to-day. With it I do not agree, but nevertheless I would vote against any proposal to eliminate the Tariff Board. The bill attempts to improve the machinery of the board, and, at the committee stage, I hope to be able to make one or two suggestions that will be acceptable to honourable members.",44,Gullett

I am. not dissatisfied with the members of the board, because I know them to be capable and conscientious men; but we must look at the results, for, after all, that is the true test of efficiency. We are gaining little from the work of the board. Had there been no such body I am certain that the tariff would have been much the same as it is to-day. The board has been subjected to much criticism, but that was inevitable. A board composed of the best scientists and experts in the world would have little effect on the tariff, because it frequently happens that questions that have been investigated by the board are finally decided in this House upon a geographical basis, or by some other method which was not taken into account by the board when framing its report in accordance with the evidence given before it. I , myself, have been guilty of ignoring the recommendations of the Tariff Board. Had not certain honourable members taken a firm stand when the timber duties were before this House the industry would have been ruined. The timber industry is one of the best that Australia possesses, and I am, therefore, prepared to support the imposition of heavy duties upon imported timber. not yet heard any argument to convince me that the salaries of the members of the board should be increased. unlikely that an increase in salaries from £1,400 to £1,600 a year will secure the services of men who are more capable and intelligent than the present members of the board. mind, and will be prepared to listen to the argument of the Minister at the committee stage. It has been said that it would be of advantage if the chairman of the board were not an officer of the Customs Department. As a general principle I should say that that is right, but in the case of the Tariff BoardI think that we possess a great advantage -in having, as chairman, an oflicer who is conversant with the tariff and the tariff items. There is little danger of any influence being brought to bear upon this officer, because the board's reports are based upon evidence given in public. The members of this House know what evidence is given. obtainable ? public, and is published by the Sydney Morning Herald and other leading newspapers. Honourable members should get the reports of the Tariff Board sooner than they do. It usually happens that when any specific tariff item is to come before the House the Minister promises to make copies of the report available; but, unfortunately, when the discussion takes place no copies are obtainable. This difficulty could be overcome by making the more important reports available to honourable members within a reasonable time. Many of the reports deal only -with minor matters. I do not think that reports should go from the Tariff Board direct to Parliament. As the Minister appoints the board, its reports should be furnished to him, especially as many of them effect the Government's policy. Were a recommendation for an increased duty divulged prematurely, merchants would immediately ,t^ake their goods out of bond and deprive this country of considerable revenue. [9.7] I wish first of all to offer my sincere congratulations to the I have Minister for the very able manner in which he has presented his first bill ' to this House. Since the inI t is auguration of the Tariff Board seven years ago, its operation has been generally recognized as being successful, and we have had sufficient time to discover its defects. According to the Minister, the However, I have an open criticism of the board has been levelled, not at findings in its reports, but at its slowness in taking action. After all it is all important that cases should be considered expeditiously, and the decisions of the board immediately acted upon by the Government. Industries that have legitimate complaints may suffer considerably because of delay in presenting the board's report and in the action of the Government. They may possibly suffer a great deal of financial embarrassment and at times be ruined. Therefore any bill that is designed to speed up the work of the board should have the",45,Gullett

A careful examination of the general tariff will be very welcome, because in such a huge and complex undertaking as the provision of a tariff for Australia, a large number of anomalies are bound to arise. It is with a view to the correction of these anomalies that the Government intends to review the tariff. The object of the bill is not to alter the fiscal policy of this country, which is supported and subscribed to by an overwhelming majority of the people, but rather to appoint a board that will carefully consider and examine cases which require scientific treatment, give better benefits where necessary, and place a definite check upon inefficiency. I believe that it is not proposed to remove from the board cases arising out of the anti-dumping provisions. When the tariff is before the House the Government should take strong and accelerated action against the dumping of goods from overseas, because that is not legitimate trading. Groom) -The honourable member must confine his remarks to the Tariff Board. goods here from countries employing low paid labour must eventually ruin our industries and leave the people of Australia open to exploitation. In view of the all-important work of the board in examining questions of such vital economic importance we should not object to the proposed small increase in salaries. It must be remembered that there are tens of thousands of our people employed in secondary industries in which hundreds of thousands of pounds have been invested. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the best brains should be obtained when appointments are made to the Tariff Board, because it is largely by the decision of its members that this Parliament is guided. As the operation of this measure will undoubtedly increase the efficiency of the hoard, it should have the wholehearted support of all honourable members interested in the welfare of Australia. The Government's proposal desire first to congratulate the Minister on his assumption of office and to wish him a very happy time in it. The bill, as a measure of Tariff Board reconstruction, offers little opportunity for discussion. It cannot be said to be a full measure of reconstruction, because there are only two phases of recon-' struction in it. One is the appointmeut of committees and the other the handing back to the department, which is best fitted for that work, of the responsibility of dealing with regulations. The Tariff Board, since it was first appointed, has received at the hands of many members of this chamber, of certain sections of the press, of the commercial community, and, in some cases, the manufacturing community, an undue amount of criticism. Certain critics have been led to consider the board responsible for the imposition of anti-dumping and increased duties, for the issuing of regulations and the consequent hampering of trade. That belief is, of course, wrong. I had the honour of appointing the first Tariff Board, and the positions were given to gentlemen who did not seek them. It would, indeed, be a grave mistake if this Parliament attempted to interfere in the appointment of the chairman of this board or in any other departmental administration. Hitherto the chairman of the-Tariff Board has been a man who has grown up with the system, is immersed in the great intricacies of the tariff and, as is the case with the present chairman of the board, a very able surveyor. Such a man is the mainstay of the Tariff Board. Without his guidance, and the assistance of his wide knowledge, it would be impossible for such a board to operate to f u l l advantage. It would be extremely unwise to put four laymen on a.tariff board and expect them to master the intricacies of tariffs and the ramifications of manufacture and trade. We have been extremely fortunate in our choice of chairmen of the Tariff Board, beginning with that very able man, the late Mr Oakley, as also of the other members of the board. At first thought, I was of the opinion that it was an unsound principle to increase salaries, reduce hours of work, and lessen duties by allowing the department to deal with",46,Gullett

In practice, however, it is the custom of the department always to deal with the regulations, the Tariff Board merely acquiescing in the recommendations of the departmental officers. Actually, too, we are not increasing the salaries of the whole of the present board, as two of its members are retiring, and it is necessary to fill their places. able men with wide vision and patriotic views, who are anxious to advance the welfare of Australia and her industries. It is not a question whether the difference between £1,400 and £1,600 per annum will entice such men. When I had the privilege of appointing the first board I sought as a member Mr the. key industries of Australia. While Herbert Brookes, a devoted and patriotic Australian, and a man with extensive interests, both in our primary and secondary industries. He had to be pressed to accept the position, and now that he has resigned and returned to private life, I place on record my opinion that he rendered Australia distinguished service in the pioneering days of the Tariff Board. difficulty in obtaining another man of his calibre to fill the vacancy. The salary attached to the position did not influence Mr Brookes. Throughout his years of association with the board he devoted practically the whole of his time, day and night, to his duties, and suffered considersubmit their report to it, the board later able discomfort in traversing Australia from end to end when he might have been enjoying years of leisured ease; the same Leitch. I have sympathy with the Minister, who has a difficult task to perform in suitably filling the vacancies on the board. My association with the board made me realize that its members are of a most independent turn of mind. the Minister and head of his department are in close daily contact with the board, but in practice they are widely separated, and the board is not likely to alter its recommendations in order to conform to the wish of the Minister on any matter. honourable member. The members of the Tariff Board work in an independent I desire to extend my congratulations to atmosphere, rendered possible by the prothe Minister on the clear and concise way visions of the principal act, and no one should tolerate the thought that any minister can sway its policy. Honourable members must remember occasions on which the Tariff Board and the Minister and his department have disagreed on vital points of tariff policy. That indicates a very healthy condition of affairs. I have in mind the instance reWe must secure the services of ferred to by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), affecting the iron and steel industry, when there was a definite conflict of opinion between the recommendation of the Tariff Board and the views of the Minister and his department. That proved conclusively that no collusion is possible in matters affecting on the subject, I confess that I think that the suggestions of the honourable member for Dalley are quite impracticable. It would be an unwise procedure for this Parliament to give any direction to the Tariff Board limiting it to a minimum rate. We must trust the board and make it an independent body, with a wide charter, to examine, in the best interests of the community generally, the We shall have considerable effect of tariffs upon both our primary and secondary industries. Such a charter is granted under the existing law, and it should not be modified. I believe that the appointment of committees will save time, but those committees must first be appointed by the board.. They will then considering the report and arriving at its recommendation. quire and make recommendations. mittee nor the board itself has the power to do other than make recommendations. The committee will examine a proposal and report to the Tariff Board, which will In theory make its recommendation to the Minister who, in turn, will forward it to the Government, to be submitted to Parliament. I support the bill in the main, and again express the hope that the Minister will not be induced to give the vacant positions to men who are not competent to discharge to Australia a great and patriotic duty in an extremely important post.",47,Gullett

I regret that the honourable gentleman was not permitted to enter upon a general discussion on the whole tariff policy, as such a discussion would have cleared the air, with advantage to honourable members. The provisions of the bill confer a great advantage upon Australian industry, and will improve an act which is already very comprehensive. The transfer of minor duties to the administration of the departpast to give. Although not specifically ment will be of considerable advantage to members of the Tariff Board, as it will enable them to apply their minds to the more important problems affecting the industry of the country. I am a trifle disappointed that the Government has not gone even a little further, and estabmeasure, said that the Government will lished an Australian Board of Trade, which could have co-ordinated under its aegis the operations of the Council for Industrial and Scientific Besearch, the Development and Migration Commission and similar bodies. In that way the whole of our trade and commerce would have been dealt with definitely and under a fixed policy. However, these amendments of the principal act confer additional powers upon the Tariff Board and will make its operations of a very important nature indeed. I notice that in the event of there being a doubt as to whether a manufacturer is fully utilizing the advantages of the protection conferred without increasing unduly the cost of upon him, power is granted to the board to recommend the reduction or abolition of a duty. that, in order to ascertain whether a manufacturer is effectively taking advantage of the duty granted, the board has the right to inquire into the most intimate details of that industry, and that should it be found that the duty is insufficient and that the industry would be benefited by an increased duty, it will not hesitate to recommend an increase. The honourable member for Wimmera has suggested that the reports of the hoard should be referred by the Minister to a tariff committee of this House. I dissent from that proposal because I think such procedure would be too circuitous and would cause even greater delays than are experienced at present. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the manufacturers complain not so much of the amount of tariff protection afforded them, as of the delay in remedying defects, the expeditious removal of which would mean so much to their industries. The subdivision of the board, as the bill proposes, will remove the cause of complaint, and I have not the least doubt that these amendments will be accepted by the manufacturers as a further instalment of the assistance to Australian industries which this Government has shown itself so anxious in the mentioned in the bill I assume that there is nothing to prevent the board from calling to its assistance whatever expert opinion it requires. The Minister, in a recent speech which appears to have been intended in part as an explanation of this be prepared to accept the recommendations of the board unless they are clearly shown to be opposed to the best interests of the country, and I think that the board should be empowered to call to its assistance any technical and economic opinion that would be helpful to it in arriving at its conclusions. In regard to the policy of the board, I interjected that this body would naturally carry out the policy of the Government. The policy of the present Government being the protection of Australian industries, the minds of members of the board will naturally be directed to the achievement of that end living or inflicting hardship on the consumers who are . the overwhelming I presume majority of the people. I do not object to the board carrying out the policy of the Government. Obviously it would be inconsistent and impracticable for a board to make rabid free trade recommendations to a Government whose policy was, say, protection to the point of prohibition. Therefore, the operations of. the board must be regulated to some extent by the policy of the Government of the day. should carry out the policy of the country rather than that of the Government. synonymous?

The fact that the board has power to investigate in the most minute and detailed way all claims for new or increased duties commends it to my approval. I have already said by interjection that the board is more competent than the average member of Parliament to declare what duties should be imposed. Having regard to the list of inquiries quoted by the honourable member for Swan, the thousands of expert witnesses examined, and the investigation of all aspects of industries and their relation to the everyday life of the community, honourable members must recognize that the board is carrying out an exceedingly important function and is well qualified to make recommendations for the guidance of honourable members. rate, am prepared to accept its views almost entirely. to some discussion as to whether the chairman of the board .should continue to be a permanent oflicer of the Customs Department. an important consideration.

I am not much concerned as to whether the salaries to be paid to the members shall be £1400 or £1600. If a man is doing good work he is entitled to adequate remuneration, and I would not hesitate to vote for the higher salary. The mere increasing of the salaries, however, will not alone improve the personnel of the board. The appointments must rest with the Government, which must accept the responsibility of finding the best men available for these difficult and onerous positions. -The speeches of some honourable members have revealed anxiety on their part regarding the personnel of the new board.

Whilst he did refer with gratification to the detailed investigations by the board and the mass of evidence it collects, he Avas clearly of opinion that its opinions would be, and should be, based, not upon the eAddence, but upon the policy of the Government. That supports my vieAv that the members to be appointed will be such as Avill discharge their duties in a manner acceptable to the Government. No doubt the honourable member knows the intention of the Government in this regard. Believing in high Avages and good Avorking conditions, I am not opposed to the payment of high salaries to members of the board. But the Government should be consistent, and apply the same principle all round. If a I , at any man using a pick and shovel on the highways of this country does his Avork We have listened he is as much entitled to adequate Avages, good conditions, and annual leave as are the members of the Tariff Board. It may be that with the opening That is not of this Parliament, the Government is turning over a neAV leaf. I sincerely hope that the proposal in this bill for the payment of higher salaries to one section of the Public Service, indicates that the Government has seen the error of its Avays and now believes in decent standards of payment for all workers.

The honourable member's remarks are exceeding the scope of the bill. When I was moving the second reading Mr member the debates that took place at Speaker made me confine my remarks closely to the provisions of the bill and refused to allow me to discuss tariff principles generally. point of order raised by the Minister must be sustained. The remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney certainly exceeded the scope of this amending bill, but being a new member^he was allowed greater latitude than would be permitted in other circumstances. I remind him, however, that his remarks must be relevant to the specific provisions of the bill. porter, who, while exceedingly valuable Bayley, for the latitude you have allowed me. Probably, as time goes on, I shall find myself able to confine my remarks more strictly to the question before the Chair. I was leading up to the clause in the bill which provides for the appointment of a Director of Economic Research, and I considered that I might aptly draw attention to certain remarks that were made by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) at a public meeting. I felt that, if the policy of the Minister was to be along certain lines, the investigations that are to be carried out would suggest that it would be uneconomic to protect by means of the tariff certain small manufacturers. Doubtless the Minister will offer some further explanation at a later stage of the bill. I trust that the more experienced of honourable members who sit on this side will take note of the point I have made, and propose some means to overcome the difficulty. I have followed, as closely as I could through the columns of the press, the reports of meetings that have been held before the Tariff Board, and have been astonished to find that during the last [10] twelve months or two years the proceedings have drifted into a struggle between the importer and the manufacturer. Judging by the trend of this debate, and certain authoritative statements that have been made, the Tariff Board is to become a kind of loplolly boy for the ministry of the day, and its duty is to carry out the wishes of the Government instead of to give effect to the high ideals which it was created to fulfil. I well rethe creation of the board. The object was, not to carry out the wishes of any particular party or government, but to hold an impartial inquiry into every matter that was brought before it, and to report honestly and impartially to the government of the day. I have not been able to peruse the reports of the board, and in that respect I am not any different from all other members; but, according to the reports that have appeared in the' press, the issue on every occasion has been between the manufacturer and the imOne of the objects for which the Tariff Board was created was to see the effect of the tariff not only upon the importer and manufacturer, but also upon the great mass of the people of Australia, who feel the effect of every impost to a far greater extent than any industry or body of importers. It is exceedingly regrettable to find that the Tariff Board is ceasing to be the impartial tribunal which it was intended to he, and is to have no higher duty than to carry out the policy of the government of the day. I hope that the House will not allow the board to degenerate into a "" Jemmy Ducks"" for any government which may be in office. If that is to be the case we shall have to adopt the dangerous practice that exists in the United States of America, of having a different board with every change of government. I should rather see it swept away. There are one or two directions in which the bill might be altered with advantage. It is altogether wrong that the members of a body such as this-on e of the most important bodies that could he created hy this Parliament:-shoul d be paid a fee for each sitting. That is a most improper practice, and one which does not obtain in relation to any other permanent body.",50,Gullett

262,Mr Mcwilliams (Franklin) [9.48].,"I hope that the bill will be amended in committee to make it provide for the payment to each member of a fixed salary, to be determined by this Parliament. Another suggestion, which I know will have the ful l approval of the Minister, is that there should be a woman member of the board. There is no class in this community which is affected so greatly as are the housewives by an increase in the cost of commodities. It is not so much the amount of money that <t man receives in his envelope on. Eridays which determines his financial position, as the amount which the housewife has in her purse after she has paid the week's bills. Owing to the ramifications of manufacturers and importers, the cost of living has risen so greatly that, sooner or later, it will force itself upon the attenas capable of filling the positions as those tion of this House. It is futile to discuss who had been selected. I was surprised the cost of production while the cost of living remains at its present abnormally high level. If a woman were appointed to the board she would represent a section of the community that is not represented to-day and which receives very little attention at any of its meetings. The manufacturer is fighting for increased duties, and the importer wishes to have them reduced. No attention is paid to the interests of the great mass of the people, especially those who are living on the bread line, whether they reside in the city or the back-blocks. It is because I believe that the presence of a woman on the board-would lead to all sections of the community receiving fair consideration that I propose such an appointment. I hope that the bill will be amended in that direction. I should not have risen to discuss this measure had there not been so much rubbish uttered in regard to the Tariff Board. I have begun to wonder whether' I am participating in the proceedings of a mutual admiration society. The eulogy that has been showered upon the new Minister for Trade and Customs has been sufficient to give him swelled head. Honourable members appear to have lost sight of the fact that it is not the duty of the Tariff Board to determine what our policy should be; that question was decided when the States agreed to federate. Those who know the Minister for Trade and Customs have some doubts as to his political honesty in the matter of our protective policy. It is said that environment influences character, and that opportunity makes the thief. The environment in which the Minister moves is not such as to inspire confidence in him as a protectionist. I wish to have some tangible proof that he is really a protectionist at heart. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) have drawn attention to the salaries of the members of the board. One would imagine from, the trend of the debate that the gentlemen who occupy positions on the board were created for that special purpose. I interjected that there were others quite at the Minister's statement that as the present members of the board, who are in receipt of JE1;400 a year, have been compelled to work very long hours it is proposed to increase the fees and reduce the number of hours worked per week to 33, and that there shall be no Saturday work. This is a glaring act of inconsistency on the part of a government which has strongly condemned the timber workers, who are entitled to shorter hours, because they are objecting to Saturday work. I trust that the Minister and those associated with him will now admit that the timber . workers and other unionists, who are asking for a 44-hour week, are as much entitled to shorter hours as are the members of the Tariff Board. The press of Australia is repeatedly directing attention to the high cost of government, and the impossibility of the present administration balancing the ledger. Although charges of extravagance are made in every direction, the Government now proposes to increase the cost of the Tariff Board, and also to establish a Bureau of Economic Research, the director of which is to be paid a substantial salary. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) endeavoured to justify the establishment of the bureau by saying that the director would be able to assist the Tariff Board in arriving at recommendations that would he beneficial to industry and consequently to the whole community. The",51,Gullett
263,Mr West (East Sydney) [9.57],"Government's proposal in this instance does not embody an honest attempt to grapple with one of the principal problems confronting us to-day. From personal acquaintance with economists, I believe that when the director of the bureau is summoned before the board he will assert that there is no necessity to impose a high duty on a certain commodity, because it can be obtained from Japan or some other country where colored labor is employed at a price much lower than it can be manufactured in Australia. Every so-called economist is a free trader, and the director to be appointed will oppose the fiscal views held by the majority of the Australian people. He will have no desire to assist in making Australia a self-contained nation, and providing employment for our own people. The questions which will be submitted to this official by the Tariff Board will not be studied by him from the viewpoint of Australia, but merely from the price at which certain commodities can be obtained in foreign countries. The recommendations on tariff matters should be made by the members of the board, who are experienced in commerce and industries, without the assistance of a theorist. Minister in charge of the measure told When appointments of this kind are to be made they should be from men within the Oommonwealth service. I have the greatest respect for the service, which in eludes many men who are fully acquainted with Australian conditions. The adoption of the course I have suggested would give some reward for faithful service and would open the road to promotions in general. made some stupid reference to attempted log rolling; but that is sheer nonsense and humbug. When the late Mr Frank Tudor was Minister for Trade and Customs, .there was never a suggestion of anything in the nature of log rolling. He carried out his important dirties without the assistance of such a person as the Government proposes to appoint. If log rolling has been attempted during the period the Bruce-Page Government has been in ofiice, we should have been told of it. The present Minister is, I am afraid, under the influence of free trade journals such as the Sydney Morning, Herald and the Melbourne Argus. I am expressing the opinions of manufacturers who often approach me in George or Pitt streets, Sydney, or in Bourke-street, Melbourne. It is my duty to ventilate their grievances concerning a policy which is retarding the development of Australia and causing widespread unemployment. In considering this bill, I cannot help paying regard to the composition of the party behind the present Ministry. It would be impossible to find a greater mixture. I doubt if three or four of the honourable members opposite could be found in agreement upon tariff matters. Groom) -The honourable member must not discuss the tariff policy of honourable members opposite; he must confine his remarks to the bill. those honourable members are responsible for my digression. The Labour party, unfortunately, is not in power at the present time, but in view of the vote that took place this afternoon, I should not be downhearted. On the other hand, I should be quite cheerful. The people wish to know what the Government means by its proposed alteration in the composition of the Tariff Board. The us practically nothing. He did not say that the previous board had committed itself in any way, but he gave the impression that it had power to work in sections. As an old member of a Trades Hall Council and of parliamentary committees, I can say that sectional committees are unsatisfactory. It is desirable that important matters should be dealt with by The Minister the whole of the members of a responsible body. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) said that Parliament should know what the Tariff Board was doing. The men in the commercial world, with whom the board has to deal, and particularly the importers, are among the smartest persons to he found. They are aware of every possible move. If they get an idea that a tariff alteration is contemplated, they take full advantage of wireless communication and sea transport, and, if it suits them, they bring into Australia suflicieht goods to supply the market for three or four years before the benefit of an increased tariff can be felt. I regard the bill as mere make-believe, but there is more in it than",52,Gullett

265,Mr West,"The varying views ofappears on the surface. possible to improve the measure in the committee stage, and I advise honourable members to delete the provision giving the board power to confer with the Director of Economics, because it would result in delay in the deliberations of the board, ill feeling would be engendered, and manipulation would be encouraged. Since protection is the fiscal -policy of this country, it is desirable that our secondary industries should be encouraged, so that the industrial section will be in a position manufacturers, who profess to seek what to purchase the commodities of the primary producers. In the matter of economics economics ? honourable member's question by reminding him of the reply given by Professor Huxley, who, when he was asked for a definition of science, said, "" It is common sense."" have listened with interest to the dissertation on economics by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West). I am glad that he likened economics to common sense, but, apparently, he does not wish to have common sense introduced into the legislation of this country. I was astounded to hear the statement that the object of the Tariff Board is to make inquiries on the lines that the Government desires; in other words, that the Tariff Board is to be nothing more than the mouthpiece of the Government. I was under the impression that the board was established to conserve the true interests of the community, and to make inquiry into every proposed increase or decrease of duty with the object of deciding what was -: best in the interests, not of those making the requests, but of Australia as a whole. If the board is merely to reflect the opinion of the government of the day, we may as well wipe it out of existence, and impose duties, not in the interests of the community at large, but in the interests of that section which is fortunate enough to command a majority in the Parliament. At the present time we have quite enough of what I call scratching around and looking for favours. I had occasion to protest against this in the last Parliament. I am It may be entirely in accord with the proposal for the division of the board to enable it to make simultaneous inquiries in different places. One of the grievances of the State that I represent is that the board does not visit the capital cities of the smaller States often enough. Inquiries are almost entirely confined, so far as location is concerned, to Melbourne and Sydney, and the witnesses called are the persons directly interested in the matters that come before the board, whether it be the they call the interests of Australia, or those who oppose their demands. Witnesses from other States suffer much inconvenience by having to come long are these distances to give evidence. Not only do they have to travel a long way from their homes, but they have, in many cases, to wait a considerable time for their case to come on. I am pleased to see that the board will be able to break up and hear evidence in different parts of the country. I hope that, in its future inquiries, the board will not only take evidence from those who offer themselves, but that when applications are being considered which, if granted, will result in an increase in the cost of production, evidence will be heard from those who will have to bear the brunt of these increased costs. The consumers, particularly in the country, have not been consulted as much in these inquiries as they should have been. I support the suggestion of the honourable that there should be a woman on the Tariff Board. Women are vitally concerned in the cost of living and, as has been pointed out, the important thing is not what the pay envelope contains^but what can be bought with it. In the constituency which I represent, there are many persons who have received no pay envelope during the last two years. They are vitally concerned with the activities of the Tariff Board, because they are affected perhaps more than most by increases in the cost of living, and cost of production. I have heard much talk about poverty in*the cities, but it would be instructive to honourable members opposite to visit some country districts and witness for themselves the poverty which exists there.

I endeavoured to state the case for them in the most temperate language possible, and did not in any way exaggerate in order unduly to draw upon the sympathy of honourable members. I spoke from a personal knowlege of the situation, for I have been in close touch with this community. I sought no publicity for myself. I did not wish to become prominent nor did I seek to gain any party political advantage.

281,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [10.31],"Adelaide Premier of South Australia, Mr Butler, practically denied the truth of my statement and I feel that his remarks require a reply from me. Doubtless the Prime Minister will approach the State Government for a report upon the situation. If the Premier presents a report in the terms of his statement to the press, the likelihood of the people of Port Adelaide receiving any relief from the Commonwealth will be remote. The following statement by Mr Butler appeared in the Melbourne Age on Tuesday, 8th February:The Premier( Mr Butler) stated to-day that he had received a report from the chairman of the Children's Welfare and Public Belief Board( Mr T. H . Atkinson) regarding the allegations made in the House of Representatives on Friday by MrN . J. Makin concerning the distress through unemployment in South Australia, and particularly at Port Adelaide. It showed that the number of families receiving relief at Port Adelaide from all causes was 1.000. The department was represented there by the mayor, town clerk, a lady official, and a permanent police officer. In addition, two officers regularly visited the homes of permanent. cases. The applications for relief were dealt with by the police officer. certain hopes, the weak and helpless are No needy case had been refused assistance, but in a few cases assistance had been deferred in order that further information might be obtained. The total cost of relief at Port Adelaide for the past twelve months was £22,838. The Port Adelaide officer had no knowledge of any children being absolutely starving. In only two cases where furniture was being purchased on the time-payment system had it been seized for arrears by the owners. Tliere was no evidence that Mr nourishment. Sick people w ill need something Makin had closely associated himself with the distress at Port Adelaide. Altliough he had sometimes taken part in processions of unemployed, he had not been in close touch with the department. A similar statement appeared in the Adelaide press, and in the Sunday newspapers of Sydney, together with the text of the Premier's denial. In support of my appeal of Friday last, I surely have no need to do more than bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a report that appeared on Saturday last in the Adelaide Register, the principal conservative organ of South Australia. Register is to Adelaide in the newspaper sphere what the Argus is to Melbourne and the Sydney Morning Herald to Sydney. The article to which I refer is headed ""Distressed Women and Children of Port Adelaide need help; Register gives £100 for relief fund."" A newspaper does Mr Makin. press. Subsequently the not do that kind of thing unless the need is imperative. I heartily congratulate this newspaper upon its humanitarian appeal. The article also had the following headings:"" Money and clothing urgently needed for families in distress; leave parcels in city."" The Register charged a special representative with the duty of investigating the situation, and while she was not prepared to admit that people were actually starving, she showed clearly that a serious state of affairs exists. Her report readsThe Government gives rations, which provide for bare sustenance, and the charitable of Port Adelaide do what they can, though many of them have suffered too. The whole spectacle is something less sensational, more deadening and gradual-the slow d r if t of decent working families down to slum conditions. Whole neighbourhoods of people owning nothing, crowding into small houses, two or three families to a house, dependent on private charity for all their needs beyond bare sustenance, have lost that sense of security which in Australia has hitherto kept those able to work from the terror of utter destitution. Beyond them is the prospect of a workless winter. Into this life of certain privation and undaily born. The mayoress and her relief workers are in touch at present with a hundred cases of expectant mothers, all quite without means, and in workless families. The. concluding paragraph of the report is as follows:Winter is not very far away. The children who go happily barefoot now w ill , some of them, shiver w it h cold and suffer from underother than mere ration of meat and groceries. The old and the babies w ill suffer. It is too big a problem for all the goodwill of Port Adelaide to deal with. Who w ill help to relieve the suffering of innocent women and children ? The Mayoress of Port Adelaide, who in association with her husband and other public spirited citizens, is doing wonderf ul service for the poor and distressed, also makes in the same issue of the Register an appeal for assistance for these people under thebeading, "" Mayoress appeals for help; clothing and The extra food badly needed."" The appeal contains the following paragraph:W it h many hundreds of men out of work, a great proportion of whom owe their plight to genera! trade depression, those who are helpless have been reduced to utter destitution. Clothing and additional food, to supplement government rations where necessary, are urgently needed. Above all, we wiBh to raise fundB to help feed and clothe women and children during the winter, which will soon be upon us, and will find many hundreds of children barefoot and insufficiently clad. The following morning's paper contained a further appeal and cited instances of the serious plight in which individuals were placed. The Mail, oi Adelaide, has also directed public attention to the grave position of many good and honest citizens. Australia would try to make it appear that I was exaggerating the position and was seeking to secure some personal publicity by drawing attention to this matter. challenge what I personally have done to relieve distress. All the time. I was in my constituency my home was constantly besieged by people in need, and in several instances by those who had not even enough to provide their children with breakfast next morning. I can take this measure of satisfaction to myself, that so far as it was within my power to prevent it, no one actually went hungry. This does not constitute my full effort to lighten the load and ease the burden of distress; but I am not prepared to parade what I have done in that regard. Others, if they so desire, may bear testimony to it. The virtue of the assistance one gives in these cases iB, to a very large extent, lost if one parades it. If the Premier of the State seeks to make the people of Australia believe that things are not serious in South Australia, recognizing, of course, that it is a bad advertisement for the State, my reply is that the position is very serious indeed, and I hope that the investigation made by the Commonwealth Government will extend beyond what is gathered from the State Government. I hope that the Commonwealth investigating officers will get right down into the district where the ter and Minister for External Affairs) people are suffering in the way I have [10.47] -When the honourable member indicated. I had every reason to know tor Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) referred to that my remarks on Friday last were fully this matter on Friday last I indicated justified, but I telegraphed to Adolaide that the Government would make certain for further particulars of certain cases. inquiries.

I did not seek to exaggerate the position by giving the details, but I telegraphed to Adelaide for confirmation or otherwise of the circumstances I have mentioned and I received from one of the business people of Port Adelaide the following telegram:Statement proved. Can be verified; the persona refuse to sanction names being used. I can quite understand that these people do not desire their names to be used. Two Yet the Premier of South other telegrams received by me .give the names of people in the most dire distress. I do not propose to allow tbe Premier of the State to make this a party issue or a personal quarrel, as he appears The Premier may seek to anxious to do, but there is a time coming when I shall have the opportunity to deal with him both privately and publicly as I feel he ought to he dealt with. For the time being I request from the Commonwealth Government its strongest practical sympathy and its interest and assistance in the matter. In the Hindmarsh district, which is another part of the electorate I represent, there has heen so much poverty in the last twelve months that the Rev. Magor, in association with kindly disposed friends aud supported hy public subscription, has heen running a soup 'kitchen at lunch hour for the children in the public school there. The children are recommended by the teachers as those who are insufficiently nourished. Possibly it is the only nutritious meal they have for the day. When these conditions prevail in a district like Hindmarsh it is clear that the representations I have made in regard to the distress in Port Adelaide have not been exaggerated, and demand the immediate and urgent attention of those who are prepared to show reasonable sympathy with people who are most deserving of help. I cannot, therefore, offer any Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.47 p.m.",55,Distress At Port Adelaide
