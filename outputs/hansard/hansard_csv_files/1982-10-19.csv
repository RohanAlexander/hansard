The extent of this real benefit can be seen product in 1972-73, something like 9.5 per cent. from an examination of the family man's $300 a By 1981-82 it had become 14.3 per cent.

The one finds that income tax has gone up over that same sort of improvement applies to other period from $1,975 to $3,121. One finds that salaries.
