I am satisfied from what I know of hin,' that he would not favour any one, and that even the pressure of a Ministry would not induce him to depart from what he conceived to be his duty. It is well to be able to speak in this way of a gentleman holding so responsible a position. Apart altogether from the question of the increases to the Registrar and the Examiner, I find it difficult to understand how the scheme on which these Estimates are based is going to work out. According to the statement of the Minister, the increases proposed to be paid are provided for in detail in the body of the Estimates of the Department, but a deduction is made from the totals at the end on the presumption that they probably will not be paid during the present financial year. If we are not going to grant these increases, provision should not be made for them. may not be dealt with by the end of the financial year. Sir WILLIAM LYNE to provide for increases when it is probable that they will not be payable within the financial year. In such circumstances there is always a temptation to pay them. If by way of a general deduction at the end of the estimates of the Department, we practically struck off the amount of these increases, I doubt whether the Minister would be able legally to pay them, even if the classification were passed before the end of the financial year. more danger in adding something. Sir WILLIAM LYNE so, but say, for example, that the increases to be provided for under the classification scheme amounted to £[10,000, and we voted only £[8,000, should we be justified in paying the f u l l sum ? If we should, what is the use of making a deduction ? The Minister should take this matter into consideration before allowing the Estimates to be dealt with in this way. The explanation has been made that they were prepared during the term of office of the late Government, and that any alteration would involve a good deal of confusion. That, however, is not a sound argument in support of the passing of the Estimates in this way. They should be so submitted as to provide for the moneys actually intended to be paid. . explain the matter. Sir WILLIAM LYNE If a foot-note were included as part of the schedule, it would give power to pay these increases. That course used to be followed in connection with the Schedule of the Public Works Department of New South Wales. the absence of such a foot-note, the State Minister was tied down, and could not expend money just as he might desire to expend it. It would be wise to give permissive power to the Minister to make deductions from or increases to salaries according to the classification as finally dealt with. alterations have been made in these Estimates, they were mainly prepared under the direction of the late Government; but owing to the classification intervening, and rendering it necessary to refer them back to the departmental heads for revision, there was no opportunity for their consideration All the appeals by the last Cabinet. As to the method adopted in framing the Estimates, I have only to say that I gave directions that inI t is dangerous creases in salaries due under the classification scheme should be specified in every case. It seemed to me that if that were not done honourable members might very properly ob-' ject to the Estimates on the ground that . they did not set forth what was actually intended to be paid. Although the giving of these details might involve some delav, it appeared to. me that it was right that they should appear in order that it might be possible to obtain a true conception of what the classification involved. the maximum. speak, know the worse. Whatever method be adopted it is somewhat difficult to deal with the position in view of the fact that as the appeals have not yet been dealt with, alterations are still possible in regard to all these salaries. For this year at all events we have to act upon rather tentative lines. We cannot expect to have everything placed definitely before us until the classification shall be completed and dealt with by the Parliament. I do not think that honourable members should complain of too much information having been afforded them, and I believe that I adopted the right course in insisting upon the proposed increases being specified in each case. for the amendment simply as an indication that I take exception to the increases-",15,Department Of Home Affairs

The Minister of Home Affairs has referred to the qualifications of the Examiner, who, I have always understood, is a gentleman of high 1 abilities, capable of worthily fulfilling the duties of his office, but it is strange that he encouraging them. This gentleman is to rehas not said a word about the Registrar. the proposed increase of salary in his case when th? Estimates were before us last week. the Chamber throughout the debates, I have not heard the honourable gentleman refer to the qualifications and duties of the Registrar, but, of course, I accept his assurance. I am not greatly alarmed by the outcry in the press as to alleged extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth, but if behoves us, I think, to be very cautious. If we provided for all these increases, it might be held by the Appeal Boards, who have yet to deal with a number of appeals, that Parliament had practically agreed to the classification, and that the increase should be paid in each case. Those who were appealing to the board would certainly use such an argument. knows a little better than that. we know that in the event of the classification being finally dealt with before the end of the financial year, these salaries would date from July last-fro m the time of the classification. It is to be regretted that an opportunity was not afforded us to deal with the classification before being called on to consider the Estimates. Had that course been followed, every honourable member would have known exactly what he was doing in voting for these Estimates. I do not intend to vote for increases which I consider to be too high, though I do not say that I shall vote against all increases. I shall vote for the reduction of £20. proposed by the honourable member for Maranoa, in order to express my disapproval of the increase of the salary of the Registrar. trust that the honourable and learned member for Maranoa will withdraw his amendment. ment should, not, in any circumstances, be swayed by outside clamour as to what salaries should be paid. We should recognise that if we want ability we must pay for it. The very degrees of B.A., and of LL.B., which Mr Healy, the Examiner, possesses, are surely worth £100 per annum per letter. We should not offer an inducement to ignorance and stupidity, of which, goodness knows, there are already enough in Australia, without our further ceive a salary of .£400 a year. His degrees should make him worth a thousand a year. degrees for a few dollars in America. the candidates for the Presidency of the United States, Alton B. Parker, started in life much as this'officer did. The country should be proud of such men, and we should be glad to have them in the Commonwealth service. The Public Service of the Commonwealth should set a wage standard for 'Australia. There is no power that is so efficacious in civilizing humanity as good pay for honest work. Why should we take £ 2 0 a year off the vote? I have sat in this Parliament for over three years, and have constantly pointed out that the .£400 a year, at which we are paid , is a starvation wage. Now be1 cause a young man has struggled to a good position, by reason of his ability we are asked to cut down his salary. I should be ashamed to look an honest man in the face if I voted to reduce the amount by a penny. Indeed, I would vote to make it higher if I could. I would rather be defeated at the next election because I voted to give this officer a substantial wage than I would be returned' because I voted to reduce his salary. I believe in paying our officers wages upon which they can keep their families in comfort, buy them decent clothes, take them to the theatre-o r even to the races-occasionally , and enable them to qualify for the battle of life. I know that a good deal is being said about a recent decision in the High Court in reference to the salaries of public servants; but that ought not to affect our determination. We need to have courageous men-me n with pluck-in the Parliament of this country. If we can secure to fill positions of responsibility officers who have earned University degrees, which are the hall-mark of civilization, progress, and intelligence, we should be glad to have their services, and not cut their salaries down to a miserable The Commonwealth Parliapaltry £350 a year.

Opposition, and also the Minister, have already explained that point. been explained. draw the attention of the Minister to particularly is the fact that the inspectorial staffs will in the near future have to be curtailed, or have further duties placed upon them. As the honourable member for Coolgardie said just now, the heavy work of classification is pretty well finished,' though, of course, appeals are still being heard, and that, perhaps, is a reason why the expense will be much the same this year as last year. As soon, however, as the work is completed, it will be necessary to give the inspectors and their staffs additional duties. I know that some of them recognize that when the work of classification is completed, as it will be on the adoption of the scheme by Parliament, there will be very little for them to do, especially in some of the States. nearly enough work to occupy the time of valuable officers receiving salaries of £ 6 0 0 per annum. I see that under another heading, which has been passed, and which, therefore, I cannot discuss, but may merely mention, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of Tasmania is acting as Public Works Inspector and Deputy Public Service Inspector; so that there we have an amalgamation of duties. to the Electoral Department, which it should not be. the expenses of the amalgamated offices is charged is quite wrong, and I have already spoken to the Treasurer in regard to the manian officer's time is occupied in connection with the Public Service work.

The classification, as it has been made, has been provided for, and, of course, the promise has been given that whilst officers receiving only up to £ 1 6 0 per annum will receive their increments, those officers whose salaries are over that amount will not be paid their increments until Parliament has had an opportunity to approve or disapprove of the scheme of the Commissioner. d3te back? crements will date back when Parliament approves.

99,Mr Kennedy (Moira),"I would like the honourable member was not present when the explanation was mate. 1 and I should like to have some information on the subject. With respect to the statement of the honourable member for Boothby that he feels some hesitation in voting for a reduction merely because of the reduction in the work of the inspectorial staff, if the honourable member will consult the Estimates he will find that there is actually an increase provided for the inspectorial staff. I wish to know whether there is any justification for these increases. we give a passive assent to increases of salaries now when we are told that we shall consider only the merits of the matter on some future occasion? given, if agreed to, as from the first day of the financial year. and that is another, matter with which I have to find fault. do something we should do it immediately minds, rather thani make our future action retrospective. The honourable member for Coolgardie has said that mem1 bers of the Public Service are precluded from doing other \york, but I would remind the honourable member that the conditions surrounding their employment do not apply to those outside the service, who are exposed to the cold blast of the world's competition. They have permanent employment at, generally speaking, a fair rate of wages. In the particular case to which reference has been made, I recognise that Parliament is not a competent authority to judge as to what the proper salary should be. We have a highly-paid officer employed to advise us in such matters, and we can only review his decision in a general way. The honourable member for Hume has told us that amongst these officers there is one who was brought into the service only within the last few months at ,£200 per annum. Sir whether it was £ 2 0 0 or not. statement that this officer is highly qualified, an opportunity of dealing with the classibut it is now proposed to pay him £ 4 0 0 a year. I would ask whether honourable members think that it is possible for men of equal ability outside to expect to double their rate of pay within the same time? For the reasons I have given, I shall not support any proposal for increases in the salaries of highly-paid officers. There isalways a difficulty in securing increases for I am present now, those who are getting barely sufficient to enable them to live. But as soon as a man has become what is termed an officer, and is getting .£300 or £ 4 0 0 a year, there appears to be no difficulty in raising his salary, even by 50 per cent. In the case of an unfortunate man who is receiving 6s. or 8s. per day-a n amount which I consider barely sufficient to provide his family with the necessaries of l if e if an increase of £ 5 or £ 1 0 a year be Why should asked on his behalf, the reply is made that the conditions of the country are such that it cannot be granted. ficers whose salaries are under .£160 are getting their increments. I am aware of that, deeming feature of this business. We all know of the treatment to which the pubI f we decide to lic officers of the States have been subjected during the last two or three years. Instead of receiving an increase, they have we have made up our been compelled to submit to a very serious reduction. But throughout the ramifications of the Public Service of the Commonwealth there has been a considerable increase in the salaries. For these reasons I shall not commit myself to voting for an increase, especially in the case of highlysalaried officers. I am prepared to make an exception where it can be shown that a man is receiving what I term a mere pittance, for I consider that £ 1 5 0 a year is not more than sufficient to enable a man to provide his family with the bare necessaries of life. But in the case of those men who are fairly treated, and who received an increase last year, I cannot assent to a further increase. Sk WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) -The honourable member for Moira has given expression to the feelings I entertain on one or two points. The remarks I made on a previous occasion have been emphasized today by the statement of the Minister of salaries under ,£160, the increments are I do not question the not to be paid until Parliament has had fication scheme.

I do not wish it to be understood that I shall vote against the proposed increases when they are submitted in a proper way, and at the proper time.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) I think turns. I remember that on one occasion in that the right (honourable gentleman has been exceptionally unfair in his statements. I have shown ""no antagonism to the Government in this matter, nor any desire to obstruct the Estimates. Unfortunately, ill ness compelled me to be absent when the Treasurer made his financial speech, and I was not present during its subsequent discussion. It is nonsense, however, for the Prime Minister to say that it is too late to discuss this matter. It can be brought up on every item in connection with which there is an increase, right through the Estimates. The point which I raise is, I think, an important one. The Treasurer has told us that it is practically impossible to pay these increases before the 30th June next, except so far as public servants getting £ | i 6 o or less per annum are concerned. Other increases provided for . under the classification scheme are not to be paid until that scheme has been submitted in detail to the House, and the appeals which will be made have been dealt with. If it is six months before this matter can be submitted to honourable members, we' shall then be very near the 30th June next, and there will be practically no time to consider the classification scheme and pay the increases before that date. The simplest way will be to vote these increases after the whole matter has been dealt with, if necessary charging the expenditure to the accounts of the present financial year, instead of to the accounts of next year. .There is no reason why an amendment should not be moved on every item for the striking off of increases, with a view to bringing that about. The Prime Minister had no right to impute to me a desire to oppose the Estimates. The course which is being followed is an exceptional one. We are being asked to vote sums of money which cannot be paid during the financial year. asking us to vote amounts which they have not parliamentary sanction for paying. strong argument in support of my contention. There will be no parliamentary I think, however, that as the Treasanction for the proposed increases until the classification scheme has been approved by Parliament. It is unreasonable to ask the Committee to take the course which is now being taken. The Prime Minister has said that <t is being taken to show the Treasurers of the States what we shall hav, to pay, and to give them an idea of the amount to be deducted from their reNew South Wales, the PremierI believe it was the Prime Minister himself-wh o desired to convey certain information as to proposed increases of salaries, but did not wish the Committee to vote the money, added to each of the Departments a schedule, which was not passed, showing the amounts that would be required. money represented in the Estimates was that which was to be paid during the year, but information was given with regard to the increases in the form of a schedule. Therefore, if it had been considered desirable to inform the States Treasurers of the extent of the increases involved by the classification scheme, the particulars could easily haye been embraced within a schedule, which need not have been passed by the Committee. course by which the views of the honourable member for Hume can be met, and which will also insure that action shall be taken at the proper time. We have already told the Committee-if we have not, we shall do so-the total amount of the increases involved by the classification. We have given the total amount of the statutory increases for which the law provides, and for which honourable members are willing to vote, and also the total amount which hangs upon the classification. A very distinct method of testing the matter in the sense in which the honourable member wishes to test it test it by means of a censure motion. gestion quite different from that; I shall propose a business-like step which could not possibly acquire any party significance, but which would leave the matter quite open and free.

How could a proposal of that kind, suggested by me, toe regarded as a vote of censure? We have not quite lost our faculties of apprehension.

The mere reduction of the Appropriation Bill by the amount of increases, which we are admittedly incapable of finally expending, could not be resented by the Government.

If the classification be approved then the Estimates will show every line accurately, and provide f u l l y for the expenditure of the year. We all know that the majority of these increases will be approved. I * do 'not think that the House will resolve itself into a classification committee for the Public Service. We do not want to sit here continuously for twenty four months out of three years, or anything of that kind. The classification will probably be dealt with as a whole. If the House thought it was unsatisfactory it would not begin to do the Commissioner's work over again. They would say, "" We are not satisfied with it , "" and no harm would be It is very hard for done. Not a penny will be spent until the House has had an opportunity of approving, or disapproving of the classification scheme. If the House approves of it, the Estimates will be in order, and show the actual amount of money to be expended.

That suggestion would not be unfair to the officer regarded in that sense. what I wish to see done. that it will not injuriously affect the officer in question.

That being so, we ought to be very guarded in dealing with it, and I trust that reductions will be made in items relating to all salaries above £300. The course proposed by the Prime Minister is a very inadequate one, and I hope that it will not be adopted.

It seems lo mei that the Government should instruct a clerk in the Treasury to deduct all the increases of salary provided for in the Estimates, so that as each item came before the Committee the Minister in charge would be in a position to ask that it be passed less the amount of the proposed increase. That course might be followed without difficulty, and would not involve any general remodelling of the Estimates. very great difficulty in separating the amounts.

The Treasurer has made it clear, and we do not propose to depart from his statement, that so far as the classification scheme leads to increases of salary, no payment is .to be made to any one until the House has approved of the scheme. That was stated by the Treasurer in his Budget speech. Unfortunately, he is now absent; but I am not aware of any statement that he has since made qualifying his original announcement. opportunity of referring to my right honourable friend to ascertain whether he had since his Budget statement made any other statement at variance with that; but my colleague informs me that he has not at all departed from that position in any way. Consequently I can state absolutely to the Committee that the statement made by the Treasurer in his Budget speech has not been varied, and that no classification increases will be paid under these Estimates until the House has approved of the scheme. But there is one class of increase which seems to be mixed up with the classification, which I know every honourable member is thoroughly in favour of. As honourable members know, in the lower salaries until they reach a certain amount I think it is £ 1 6 0 t h e r e is an annual increase of £ \ o by process of law. In cases of that sort-supposin g we find that there is no time to apply the classification scheme this year after all-for some reason or other the House may not have had an opportunity of discussing it during the currency of the year-of course, the legal rights of these officers in receipt of smaller salaries to statutory increases must not be taken away from them, because a classification scheme also involves the payment of increases. scheme adopted the statutory increases must be paid, but nothing else will be paid. that. portunity to make the position clear. to the two statements of the Prime Minisaminer. ter on the classification scheme.

The cases of these three officers of the Public Service Commissioner's staff are the most palpable in connection with the classification scheme. In one case there is an increase of £ 7 0 . and in. another of £50. Last year one of the officers received I took the an increase upon his State salary of ,£150, and in the next twelve months the Commissioner arrives at the conclusion that the services of the officer are worth £ 5 0 a year more. too cheap before.

But I have a duty to my constituents, just as the Prime Minister, and also I myself, have to the public servants. I wish to see all men well paid; and, as I said before, any increments which become due should be paid without hesitation. But when a man receives increments amounting to ,£200 in two years, we know there is something wrong somewhere.

Royal Commission has inquired into the whole question of the Public Service, and, in consequence, there have been reductions throughout, not only in numbers, but in salaries. We propose increases in the Federal Service in face of the fact that in Queensland men have had their salaries reduced as much as £ 1 0 0 per annum. Only last week the State Parliament of The officers who are directly under Queensland passed a special Retrenchment Act; and we now propose increases in the Federal Service of £ 5 0 to £ 7 0 , one individual receiving increments amounting to £[200 in two years. Where is the fairness of such treatment of public servants? I protest that the Federal officers I have mentioned are more than overpaid. The Such a deduction means to the States cannot bear the expenditure, and if increases are to go on year after year we shall have, as in Queensland, a Royal Commission, with the climax of a special Retrenchment Act. If the Public Service Commissioner is honest, and desires to do the Public Service Justice, let him give the men in the lower ranks, whether in the clerical or general division, the same ratio of increase that he gives to the officers in his own Department.

If the course proposed by the honourable member for Gwydir is followed, it may happen that we shall not be able to pass the Appropriation B ill until as late in the financial year as the date on which the Appropriation Bill for this year is likely to be passed, and in that case those to whom the increases are due will have to wait several months for their money, since it would be unfair to honorFurthermore, by voting the inable members who objected to individual increases to ask them to approve of the whole by voting a lump sum in a SupplyB ill , when individual cases could not be considered.

The £[170 which he has specified is made up by an increase of £ f i o to two officers who are in receipt of over £ 3 0 0 a year, by a second addition of £ 1 0 0 to public servants who are receiving between ,£200 and ^ 3 0 0 a year, and by an extra £ 1 0 to a messenger, whose salary is £ 6 0 a year. Thusi f an honourable member desires to vote for an increase to the messenger he will be obliged to support the proposed increments to the higher-paid officers, whom I have mentioned, and vice versa. Honourable members are thus placed in a very unfortunate position, and under the circumstances I shall feel obliged to vote against fhe amendment. present occasion honourable members are very awkwardly placed, simply because the Of course, classification scheme has not yet been dt*alt with. I avail myself of this opportunity to point out how unsatisfactory is the position The acto this House, and. how much more unsatisfactory if is to the rank and file of the public servants. The latter have been looking forward to receiving their increases under the classification scheme, but apparently there is very little hope that they will obtain them during the present financial year, even if this vote be carried. We know that the appeals against the classification recommended by the Public Service Commissioner are so numerous that it is practically impossible for the House to deal with that scheme during the present session. It seems very probable, too-as was pointed out by the honourable member Personally, I object for Parramatta-that the hearing of these appeals will not be completed in time to It is not likely that that offienable the scheme to be dealt with early next session, and consequently during the present financial yeai. That position is unsatisfactory to this House, and infinitely more ^unsatisfactory to the civil servants. The honourable member for Gwydir contends that this Committee should not consider the question of increases until the and honourable members have been afforded an opportunity of judging the whole position from that stand-point. That is a very W ill the Committee good position to take up. We wish to be in possession of all the available information in connection with this matter. We do not desire to record any votes in the dark. On the other hand, we must consider the position of those public servants whose interests are at stake, and also how we n.ay adjust matters so as to best serve the interests of tht State. WhilstI 9trqngly sympathize with the honourable member when he declares that this Committee ought not to sanction any vote upon which it has not the fullest information, we are compelled to acknowledge that in regard to this vote we, unfortunately, occupy that position. Until the classification scheme has been adopted, it is impossible for the Government to sunoly us with complete information.

291,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"Upon thethe end of the financial year, the public servants will not receive the increments which are due to them. Buti f the Estimates sanctioning those increases have been agreed to, it will be a guarantee that their claims have not been overlooked, and that Parliament does not intend to reject the classification scheme merely because it involves the granting of certain increases to public officers. If , however, the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir be carried, that construction might be placed upon our action. If honourable members wish to affirm that the public servants of the Commonwealth are already sufficiently well paid, and that they are not prepared -eve n under a well-thought-out classification scheme-to further augment their salaries, they stand upon firm ground in refusing to sanction these increases. If , on the contrary, they think that public servants are entitled to increments, no harm can result from agreeing to this vote, on the promise given by the Government that the increases will not be paid until the scheme has been approved. this way we shall give the Public Service a guarantee that we shall be prepared to consider their claim, to increases under the classification as from the beginning of the current financial year, as soon as we can deal with the scheme. There is mud* force in the contention advanced by the honourable member for Parramatta, that if we pass this vote the Government will be able month by month to make deductions in respect of these increases from the surplus returnable to the States. If the amendment were carried, however, no such deduction would be made. provision next year for a double increase. mean that the deductions, instead of being made in respect of the year for which the increases were payable, would all be made at the one time-that the increased expenditure so incurred would fall with double force on the finances of next year, and that the States would probably not be prepared for so heavy a call. If the whcit of the surplus, irrespective of the amount required to meet these increases, were handed to them this year, they would naturally expend it, and incur obligations which would render it more difficult for them to provide for the additional payments. It appears to me that the wiser course for us to follow is to agree to this vote, so that the deductions to be made from the surplus returnable to the States will be spread over two years. I am prepared to support the Government proposal, because, while I think there is a good deal in the objection that we are asked to a large extent , to vote in the dark, I feel that there are other more cogent reasons why we should pass the vote. I support it on the understanding that these increases will not be paid until the classification -scheme has been adopted. disposed to withdraw the amendment, because the more we; discuss it the more we must recognise the wisdom of it. The suggestion that if we pass this amendment we shall render it impossible for those in the higher divisions of the Public Service to receive their increases, while those in the lower branches of the service will be paid them, does not appeal to me. Justice should be done to all. Every member of the Public Service, whether he is in the higher or the lower divisions of the service, should receive any increase to which he is entitled, and there is nothing in the contention In that we should not vote for the amendment because it might involve the withholding from certain officers of an increase of salary. It has been admitted even by the honourable member for Parramatta that there is no likelihood of the classification scheme being finally dealt with for another two years or more. with before then. ber of appeals yet to be heard, we are being asked to vote for increases which will certainly not be payable during the current financial year. to date back to the time of the classificaI t would tion, and we must make provision for them. the classification scheme is not adopted the Treasurer will hold the money represented by these increases throughout the present financial year. that the appeals will be dealt with during the financial year, because many of them may depend on one point. to say when the Appeal Boards will finally dispose of the many cases submitted to them, but I cannot recognise the wisdom of providing for increases under a classification which has not yet been adopted.

The preparation of the classification scheme is the principal work which the Public Service Commissioner has had to carry out since his appointment. The work which involved a large portion of the expenditure in connection with this Department has been done, and I do not see why an increase should be required. The Minister spoke about the overtime that the officers have worked. What is meant by an expenditure of £[879 for temporary assistance if the officers worked overtime? addition to the overtime. deal to do in the office. Why is temporary assistance to the extent of £[500 required this year? One would have thought that by this time the work would have got down to normal dimensions. If so much extra clerical' assistance is required, why does not the Department adopt the proper course, and, instead of employing temporary officers, make permanent appointments of junior officers at small salaries? year is estimated to cost £ 9 0 0 less than last year? from the fact that the classification scheme must have involved a considerable amount of telegraphing. The item ""other printing, £ 1 , 0 0 0 "" is very large. The printing of the classification scheme and of the Commissioner's report were expensive, but the work is not required to be done again.

Nothing could be more ill-considered than the grading of some of the post-offices in Western Australia a grading which, on further consideration, had to be altered. do the honourable member's remarks apply? the vote under consideration. The Minister claims that the travelling allowances of these inspectors are not too great. I wish to show that these officers have not travelled to good purpose, or have not had their eyes open when travelling. I do not wish to labour the point, but before we adopt these Estimates, we should have a statement from the Minister as to whether some of the items are justified. I feel inclined to move for a reduction of the travelling expenses, but will give the Minister an opportunity to reply before I do so. with the item, ""boards of appeal, ^1,000,"" I presume that that sum is intended to cover the expenditure of boards of appeal under the reclassification scheme. If that be so, in view of the debate which has taken place on earlier items, I wish to take the opportunity to urge strongly upon the Government the advisability of endeavouring to have the appeals dealt with as speedily as possible. The honourable member for Parramatta seems to think that the hearing of the appeals will probably extend over two years. If that be the case the Government should take steps to strengthen the machinery so as to reduce the time. The matter is one which seriously affects the Public Service. Until the appeals are dealt with, the increases which the officers are entitled to under the reclassification scheme cannot be paid to them. I know that we cannot hope to discuss the scheme this session, but I trust that the Government will endeavour to expedite the hearing of the appeals so as to enable the public servants to receive the money to which they are entitled before the end of the present financial year. is a very large number of appeals. numerous, but many of them turn upon the same point. that one case may afford a test for a very large number, and that being so, the work involved in dealing with them will not be so great as might appear upon the face of matters. I quite understand that the appeals are so numerous, and of such a character, with so many points involved, that their hearing will take a considerable time. That is the reason I make the appeal, in the interests of the public servants and of good government by this Parliament, that the whole matter should be settled as speedily as possible-that a special effort should be made to have the question decided by the end of the present financial year. Parliament would then be in a position to deal with the classification scheme, and the Government would be empowered to pay the public servants their increased salaries. I do not propose to take objection to any of the items, but merely to press the suggestion I have made. If the present machinery under the Public Service Act is not sufficient, the Government should take the means at their disposal to strengthen the machinerv. orable member for Coolgardie raised some questions, on which I shall briefly reply. I have already taken steps to see that the items of expenditure referred to are made as low as satety requires. I have had reasons adduced by the Public Service Commissioner why the amounts in the Estimates should be maintained. The classification list will have to be reprinted; that will cost a considerable sum, although a great part of the type is already set 'up. Then additional printing will be required by the office, a great many forms passing to and fro amongst the various branches in the Commonwealth, and, in addition there is the ordinary printing for the Department itself. As to the matter of temporary assistance, it will be observed that the cost of that assistance has been reduced by £379The cause of that reduction is the carrying out of the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie, that permanent appointments should, in some measure, be made to replace the employment of temporary assistance. There must, however, be an amount available for temporary assistance, because in connection with examinations and other work there are often rushes of business, and it.is quite impossible for the ordinary staff, unless it be unduly enlarged, to get through without assistance. It is much better, in my opinion, to have temporary assistance to meet special rushes of business than to.enlarge the staff to such a degree as to be able to cope with the work",38,Thomson The N It Will Classification Scheme Has Been Submitted

325,Mr Dugald Thomson,"The honunder every condition. The honourable member will quite understand that there has been no opportunity for this Government to effect, many reductions; but every attention will be given to the desirability of keeping the expenditure down to the lowest point. As to the remarks of the honourable member for Canobolas, I , by interjection, stated that many of the appeals hang on the same point. For instance, a number of the appeals are in connection with what is really a legal question, namely, the statutory rights carried over from the States services. Whether those appeals will be satisfactorily settled by an Appeal Board has to be seen ; but a great number of the cases, as I say, hang on that one point. So with other appeals, and every effort is being made to complete the business as rapidly as possible. that the inspector has by the Act to be a member of the board, and, therefore, there cannot be a multiplication of boards. The Commissioner is very hopeful that, so far as the appeals can be settled by the Appeal Boards, there will be a conclusion of the work within the next few months. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 21 (Public Works Staff), £11,641; there ought to be some discussion on this division. It is notorious that the Public Works administration in the various States is of an unsatisfactory character. I know, from my own experience, that unsuitable buildings have been erected in some places, while in other places considerable delays have occurred in the carrying out of the most trifling improvements; and. generally the management of this branch is almost in a state of chaos. I am told that in Victoria the erection of a chimney was estimated to cost is. per brick. Specifications were called for Brunswick bricks to be delivered at Wood's Point, where it was proposed to erect the chimney, and the local contractors made the estimate which I have given. that that estimate is quite accurate. accurate, but it is near enough for all practical purposes. admit that Wood's Point is very remote and difficult of access. was the actual cost. officers of the Department arrived at that cost, but contractors, who know quite as much about the matter as the officers, estimated the cost at is. per brick. I understand that for forty years similar buildings, of stone, have stood in the same locality, and are almost as good now as when first erected. Evidently, howevei, the local stone was not good enough, in the opinion of the officers of the Department, and they specified bricks for this remote place. ' Even at the cost of only 4^d. per brick, it is monstrous to spend such a large sum when there is available local material which, in the opinion of contractors and of the general public, has been proved to be sufficiently durable. But it must be remembered member should state two things-that the building was only a chimney, and that the Public Works Department"" of the State, which had erected both rubble and brick chimneys in other buildings, are of opinion that brick, in the long run, is the cheapest. their opinion, but it is diametrically opposed to the opinion of contractors and of the general public in the neighbourhood. Even taking the Minister's estimate as correct, 4^d. per brick is a very absurd price to pay for the erection of a chimney. We should have men in the Commonwealth service, especially those charged with the carrying out of public works, who are more imbued with the idea of economy. I suppose that the salaries proposed here are reasonable.

The Department of the Postmaster-General at Perth refused the request, but the central office at Melbourne granted it, and the boxes were sent from Perth to the local office, and lay in the yard there for nine months before being erected.

411,Mr Wilkinson,"It is well that thealone it will amount to some .£12,000 or £[14,000 -the operations of the States Departments in point. In estimating the expenditure incurred by the Commonwealth in administering its affairs, all these charges are included. Of course, in the Post and .Telegraph Department they are regarded as revenue. But we have to recollect that the average elector is accustomed to compare the present cost of these Departments with their cost prior to the establishment of the Federation. that upon these Estimates provision is made for the nucleus of a staff which is intended to supervise works carried out by the Commonwealth Government. Upon that staff I observe that there will be about sixteen hands during the current year. In my judgment there is considerable force in the objection which was urged by the honourable member for Coolgardie to the manner in which Federal public works are carried out. I believe that it is the desire of the present Government to bring about a better understanding'between the Commonwealth and the States in all matters in which their interests are identical. Unfortunately for us, the States officers do not appear to realize that the carrying out of Federal work is a legitimate portion of their duties. The difficulty which we experience is that a preference is given to State work over Federal work, unless the latter is pushed forward by reason of extreme urgency. That fact is responsible for very serious delay. When the Commonwealth Government desire to undertake any particular work the matter is referred from the Department originating it to the Department of Home Affairs. The latter hands it over to its representatives in the particular State concerned. ' Those in turn pass it on to the State Public Works Department. Thus the undertaking filters through a variety of channels, involving an endless amount of red-tapeism. Serious delay is, therefore, inevitable.* I repeat that the States officers f a i l to realize that Federal work forms a part of their duties. If a better understanding could be arrived at with the States, I feel satisfied that Commonwealth public works would be carried out much more expeditiously than they have been in the past. I would further point out, that in the States capitals-notabl y in Melbourne and Sydney-ther e is, in addition to an Inspector-General, a Superintendent of Works, and a small staff o.f officials, who are employed in supervising T h a t is a case in regard to Federal undertakings. regulations it is intended that our own officials shall carry out some of the works. ceive that assurance. It appears to me that in the capitals of the different States, many of these works could be carried out more economically and efficiently if they were placed under the direct management of the Federal staff. tion has been framed for that purpose. very important work has been carried out in New South Wales in connection with the completion of the General Post-Office. Under the old system, a large part of that work was carried out upon the day-labour principle. There were special reasons why that was so. Latterly, however, the State has largely curtailed the system which was previously in vogue. I understand that it has been very anxious to get r i d of the supervision of this particular work, and that some time ago a recommendation was made that the day-labour system should be replaced by the contract system. The last Government, however, did not see its wav to give effect to that recommendation, and consequently the day-labour system has been, in operation up to the present time. That is an instance in which the work could have been more efficiently carried out under the direct control of the Commonwealth offiers. I am very glad to have the assurance of the Minister that a new regulation has been framed dealing with that matter. should like to ask the Minister to give some explanation of the intention of the Department in regard to post-office clocks.

I said that all payments in respect of services rendered to the Commonwealth by the officers of a State must go to the State Government, and that it was for the State Government to determine their distribution. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I understood that the honourable and learned member for Parkes wished to know what was the intention of the Government in regard to the post-office clocks which had fallen into disrepair, and I do not think that the Minister has fully answered his question.

Their salaries are not being increased. It seems to me that we should as far as possible appoint Commonwealth officers to supervise all our own works, and that such a system would be more satisfactory than is the present arthe States, and while, no doubt, they have been very generous in allowing their officers to attend to any urgent call on the part of the Commonwealth, complaints have beenmade that works which should have beenexpeditiously carried out have been delayed owing to the failure of the States Public Works Departments to prepare the necessary plans.

The contractor in question made an affidavit that he was paying the minimum wage, and I subsequently learned that the fault was due,, not to the contractor, but to the Department itself. As a matter of fact, the Department of Home Affairs has scheduled 9s. a day as the standard rate of pay for carpenters, whereas the rate paid by many, if not all, respectable contractors, is ios. a day.

The Department in New South Wales 'may be securing its buildings at reasonable rents, but I may point out that under the old State system engagements were made many years ago, and buildings have deteriorated in the meantime. It was found when the matter was investigated some time since that the Department was paying a rent that was altogether beyond the value of the buildings. The Minister should look into the subject, in order to ascertain whether the DepartAccording to a ment ought not to reconsider the amount of rent paid, particularly as the amount paid in New South Wales is more than double the amount paid in all the other States put together.

When we previously discussed the expenditure on the Governor General's establishment, we were promised that' the amount then being voted would be the limit, but the vote is gradually increasing year by year. asked for now is £500 less than the amount voted last year. the two items to which I have referred. On the item "" Maintenance House"" £300 was the appropriation last year, and £427 was expended. On the other item, "" Lighting on public occasions and for offices,"" £150 was the appropriation last year and £227 was expended. Then we have an item, ""Orderlies, £[25,"" and it is repeated in this year's Estimates, although nothing was spent on the item last year. I think we might have some explanation of these items. seen that the amount asked for this year, under subdivision 1, is some £[500 less than the appropriation for last year, though the amount asked for is practically the same as the expenditure for last year. Of course there will be .variation in the amounts spent in' connection with the various items during the year, as we can only approximately estimate what will be required. As regards the item "" Maintenance-House, "" a vote of £[73. over the actual expenditure for last year,' and '£,200 over the appropriation is asked for. As to the item, ""Lighting on publicoccasions and for offices,"" the vote asked for this year is .£23 more than the actual expenditure of last year, and £ 1 0 0 more than the appropriation for last year. It is thought that the amount provided for here will be found necessary to cover the expenditure required. The vote for ""Orderlies"" may or may not be required. Last year we were able to make arrangements by which the vote was not required, and we shall endeavour to make the same arrangements this year. I would point out that the expenditure in connection with many of these items depends upon the length of time during which the House is occupied by the Governor-Generala shorter period of occupation means a lower expenditure. to the vote for the next subdivision. be so, but I am afraid that the Chairman will not permit us to discuss that vote. subdivisions might be put together. for thisj subdivision might be passed, and we could then discuss any objection raised in connection with subdivision No. 2. to this very large expenditure, and I would point out that we do not, in these Estimates, get a true statement of the amount which is actually expended.

I think we should consult our dignity more if we dealt with some of the larger items, which involve big public principles, leaving .details of this sort, which are matters purely of administration, to the Executive. In view of the assurances given as to the propriety of these charges, it would be a little more becoming on our part to pass them, and throw the responsibility upon the Government. The anomalous condition of affairs in connection with which we have to maintain two establishments for one Governor General, is only of a temporary character. as soon as the Federal Capital is established, we shall have only one Government House, and one set of charges to defray. should have three. There is a great deal of State jealousy upon this question. State are clamouring that the Governor General shall reside in their State for a portion of his time, whilst others are making similar demands. The Committee, however, should be above all such narrow State feelings, and should recognise that until the Federal Capital is established, the movements of the Governor General from one to the other of the two largest States must involve something more than normal expenditure. ter beyond that of any other honourable member, but I feel that the dignity of the House suffers when, in the light of the assurances given to us by .the leaders of the present and the late Government, we enter into all these matters of petty detail. I appeal to honourable members to consider that we are making history, that our proceedings are reported in all the newspapers of the Commonwealth, and that every member, however little he may sympathize with the treatment accorded to such items, is joined in the general condemnation of the microscopic character of our criticism: I ask honourable members to allow these items to pass, and to throw the responsibility upon those who are charged with the administration. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) -We have heard a very interesting lecture from the honourable and learned member for -Parkes. learned member delivered it as such. Mr. McDONALD -The honourable and learned member told us that we should throw the responsibility for these items upon the Government, but I should like to know how we are to do that unless we discuss them in this Committee. I do not care whether the Governor General or any one else is involved, I shall express my opinion with regard to the expenditure proposed with the same freedom \that the Prime Minister criticised the action of Lord Hopetoun in connection with the discussion of certain political matters. We are the keepers of the public purse, and it is our duty to Honourable members must know that keep a close watch upon the expenditure, and to resist any proposals which we deem to be unfair. A distinct promise was given to honourable members that the expenditure upon the maintenance of the Government Houses in Sydney and Melbourne would not exceed £ 5 , 0 0 0 per annum. When the Barton Government proposed to provide for The people of one an addition to the salary of the Governor General to the extent of £[8,000, did the .honourable and learned member for Parkes speak in favour of the increase ? Honourable members were almost unanimous in their opposition to the proposal, because they thought it amounted to an extortion. They agreed, however, to recoup certain expenditure which had been incurred by the Governor General. The head of the Government then stated that sooner I have no interest in this mator later a certainsum would have to be voted for the upkeep of the Government Houses in Sydney and Melbourne, but that it would not amount to more than £[5,000 per annum. I find that in 1902-3, £ 2 , 4 3 6 was expended upon the Governor General's establishments, and that in 1903-4 the amount had risen to £[5,991. Up to that time little or no notice was taken of the increase, because it was recognised that the amount was not far in excess of that agreed' upon. We were told that the upkeep of Government House in Sydney involved an outlay of something over £ 2 , 0 0 0 per annum, whilst about £[3,000 was spent upon the Melbourne establishment. Now we are asked to vote £[7,406. tically the same amount that was voted last year. which we are asked to vote this year, and It was not a lecture.

The States Governments find it exceedingly difficult to carry on, and we I admit that, but should avoid piling up the expenditure. unnecessary to bring the name of the Governor General into this discussion. It may add some piquancy to the debate, and show how thoroughly fearless and democratic we are, but the Governor General has no more to do with these items than we have. Instead of having our own Government House, as honourable members We cannot know, we are indebted to the State of Victoria and to the State of New South Wales for granting us properties of enormous value, free of cost, for the use of our Governor General. I never said a word Surely that entails the obligation of keeping these properties in a proper state of maintenance and repair. That is all these items are intended to cover. So long as we retain possession of these two Government Houses we must incur the responsibility of such expenses. If honourable members will analyze them they will find that all these expenses represent obligations which devolve upon us as the occupiers of these valuable properties. I admit that the amount asked for does seem large in comparison with that which was expended last year. That fact, however, may afford its own explanation. For instance, last year we voted £[7,387, of which we spent only £ 6 , 0 0 0 thus effecting a saving of £[1,387. Honourable members can readily understand that that saving may be responsible for I see that provision throwing additional expenditure upon the present year. But the fact remains that Parliament voted £[7,387 last year, and is only asked to vote an additional £[19 I resent any suggestion that we this year. Of course, even these votes are subject to the exercise of the greatest economy. If we find it possible to discharge all our obligations mere economically of course we shall do so. Buti t is much If the honourable better to deal with Estimates of a f u l l character, and thus to avoid claims being subsequently made which involve the introduction of Supplementary Estimates. The Committee may rest assured that we shall not spend all this money if we can avoid it. Nevertheless, the amounts which have .been placed upon the Estimates are those which we deemto be necessary, in view of the obligations to which I have referred.

Such an expenditure would be a fitting acknowledgment of the courtesy of the Victorian Government in having placed the larger Government House at the disposal of the Commonwealth. of that course would increase this vote. would be a justifiable increase, and one to which no honourable member would object. Personally, I am of opinion that the sooner we reach the Federal Capital, the better it will be for all concerned. doubt whether the upkeep of the white House at Washington costs as much as does the maintenance of the Government Houses in Sydney and Melbourne. that no honourable member would accuse me of speaking of the Governor General, save in terms of the highest respect. Nevertheless, I have always opposed the payment of such a large salary to him. In the Victorian Parliament, I submitted a proposal that his salary should not exceed £ 1 0 , 0 0 0. That sum is as much as 85,000,000 of English-speaking people in the United States pay to their President, without any allowances, and I am sure that the occupant of that office is a very good man. Each year the expenditure upon the Governor General's establishment is increasing, and it is time that -an effort was made to check it. I doubt whether the Commonwealth Government will ever be so lavish in its expenditure in that direction as was the Victorian Government. If the honourable and learned member for Ballarat were present, he could quote figures in regard to the expenditure upon the Government Houses in Melbourne and Mount Macedon, which would simply stagger honourable members. The honourable and learned member for Parkes has made some reference to undignified conduct on the part of an honourable member. Personally, I think that no action can be undignified which is prompted by a desire to serve the best interests of the people. tfie latter had any control over the expenditure of public money, the salary of the Governor General would not be as large as it is. ment without any desire to reflect upon the Governor General, but I can assure honourable members that in Australia we have as good men as have ever filled that distinguished office. In my judgment, the Chief Justice of Victoria is quite equal in brain power to any Governor we have had during the past fifteen years. The honourable and learned member for Parkes has made some reference to charwomen. I can assure him that the welfare of the charwomen is to me quite as important as that of the highest lady who has ever danced a minuet in the ballroom of Government House. I should like to know the wages In my opinion, it which they are paid. I am aware that, prior to the transfer of the Post Office to the Commonwealth, the manner in which they were treated was barbarous and villainous. I notice that provision is ma.de upon these I Estimates for the payment of a sum of £ 2 5 to the Governor General's orderlies in Neiv South Wales, and of £ 6 0 in Victoria. I do not know whether these orderlies are paid I feel sure by the Police Department in New South Wales, but in VictoriaI understand that they are. represent contributions to them. protest against the action of one of these orderlies during the recent racing carnival. Judged by that incident, one would imagine that the roads of our country were controlled in a manner which obtains, only in Russia. I am credibly informed that two ladies, who were driving in a trap, were almost capsized by the indiscreet action of one of the orderlies. I wish to know to whom that officer is attached. Simply because the ladies in question ventured to pass the Governor General's carriage, this brute in human form pushed the trap in which they were seated on to the kerbstone. I am further assured that the horse of a one-time Legislative Councillor was similarly treated. The rule of the King's highway in England, is that it shall be free to all who desire to use it. If the Governor General desires to control our roads, surely in justice to the citizens of Australia, notice should be given that no one shall be permitted to use any road while his carriage is being driven along it. I am not aware, nor have I met any honourable member who I am satisfied that if is aware, of any such rule, and I take this opportunity to lodge my protest against the action of the orderly in question. If he were under the influence of drink, he ought I make this stateto be punished, and even if he were simply suffering from over-weening importance, some action should be taken.

I take it that the Commonwealth Government have been more reasonable in regulating the rate of wages paid, and that unfortunately the State Government are not sufficiently advanced to copy the rule set by us. I trust that the Prime Minister will ascertain whether the orderly to whom I have referred was in the employ of the Governor General. If he was, I think that some action should be taken in regard to his misbehaviour. seems to me that we have drifted a little from the track, because the honourable member for Melbourne has been giving us a pathetic description of some sad event which took place recently on the road from the races-a n incident which has not much to do with the item relating to the maintenance of the Governor General's establishment. I rose to distinguish between what the honourable member for Kennedy understood me to say, and what I intended to convey. I did not, and do not, wish to take exception to the right of any honourable member to criticise any act of the Government which is in the nature of a breach of promise. In the last speech delivered by him, the honourable member pointed out that the total vote is in excess of the amount which the Government undertook to expend upon this particular establishment. I have no objection to such criticism, if he will allow me to differentiate between it and that which he offered on a previous occasion. Such a matter is a fair subject for criticism. Honourable members have not only a perfect right, but a duty cast upon them to see that), where a Government has given an undertaking that any vote shall not exceed a certain amount, it is not exceeded. Failure to respect such an undertaking is maladministration, and is fair subject for criticism I do not remember what was the undertaking given in 1901 and 1902, when the Barton Government was in power, but if the expenditure now being incurred is distinctly in excess of that which was promised as the limit, I quite admit the honourable member's right to criticise it. WhatI objected to as referring to matters of administration, which ought to rest entirely with the Executive Government, was the criticism of the detailed expenditure of this amount. The honourable member for Kennedy will recollect that half-an-hour ago he was actually criticising the amount which should be spent on glassware at Government House, while the honourable member for Hindmarsh was criticising the number and the pay of the charwomen.",56,Honourable Members Hear Hear

If no exception is taken to it to-night we practically admit that £ 7 , 4 0 6 ought to be spent. As we were emphatically assured that the expenditure would I have the paper here, not exceed £[5,500, we have a right to expect that faith will be kept with Parliament, and that the promise will not be broken. I , for one, shall be no party to any increase of the kind. I should like, however, to alter my amendment so as to reduce the amount by £[2,000 rather than by £ 2 , 4 0 6 , seeing that the original amount proposed by the Deakin Government was £[5,500. I can well remember the indignant protests made by various honourable members at that time, including the present Minister of Trade and Customs. The opinions expressed by honourable members were such that the Government were practically afraid to proceed, and allowed the business to be practically taken out of their hands by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne.

Then, again, I think that his language might be made a little more clear, especially in regard tofinancialmatters. I know several persons who have consulted his books in order to ascertain the national indebtedness, and have arrived at opposite conclusions as to the amount. I think that the Seven Colonies of Australasia, as well as some of the other books might be revised, and if we are contributing towards the cost of any of them, I should certainly advocate the adoption of that course. Above all things, it is necessary that in books of that kind the indices should be copious and complete. for Yarra has anticipated an inquiry I bad proposed to make in regard to the expenses in connection! with the administration of the Electoral Act. of all the items having reference to that matter, and I cannot understand why this item should appear in its present place, instead of under the head of the Electoral Office. No doubt the Minister will explain that. There is one item to which I should like to direct attention, namely, that which relates to the expenses of the by-election for East Sydney. 1 Estimates. that liability has already been liquidated? thing more to say upon that point. I hope that we shall be fully informed with regard to the expense incurred in administering the Electoral Act. pleased to hear from the Prime Minister that the Government intend to appoint a Commonwealth Statistician. The need of such an officer has been felt in the past, and I do not know how we should have lan had not been available for us. very desirable that such an officer should be appointed as soon as possible, and if the Commonwealth can secure the services of Mr Coghlan they will act wisely in doing so. with the Electoral Department show what a large spending Department it is. We .find that, although ,£46,923 of the vote for last year was spent in connection with the last election, an item of ,£1,500 appears on the present Estimates. I should like to know whether this additional sum will be sufficient to meet the whole of the remaining claims in connection with the election. to cover them; they come dribbling in. the honorariums which have been mentioned ? matter will receive consideration later on. I should like to know when it is expected that the report of the Electoral Act Committee will be printed and placed in the hands of honourable members. It was laid upon the table some time ago, and I understand that authority for printing it has already been given. If the report is to remain in the hands of the Government Printer until after the close of this session it will lose a great deal of its value. I would I thought we had disposed urge the Minister to expedite the printing. I notice that provision is made for one item which is apparently transferred from last year. It relates to the expenses of the inquiry into the charges made against Mr McDowell, the Commissioner for the division of the State of Queensland into electorates. I should like to know whether the gentleman who had charge of this inquiry, who was sent '^rom .New South Wales, was one of those responsible for the terrible muddle which occurred in connection with the electoral arrangements in that State. gard to the inquiry of the honourable member for Canobolas, I can only say that, as I was not a member of the Electoral Committee, I cannot say from my own knowledge who was mainly responsible for the muddle which occurred in New South Wales. When the report is printed,' it will doubtless be seen that the Committee have indicated where the responsibility lies, so far as they have ascertained the facts. deal with this matter at all. derstand that the honourable member is asking whether a certain officer is responsible for the electoral -muddle which occurred in New South Wales.

Then a considerable portion of the £2,600 which is provided for books, printing, stationery, and ballot box equipment, will not be an annual expenditure, because preparation has been made to furnish every ballot-box with the forms requisite for the conduct of an election. with ithe exception of ballot-papers. ballot-boxes have been supplied with all the papers which can be anticipated. The outlay for maps will be a recurring expenditure only when a redistribution of seats takes place. tend to publish maps of the existing constituencies in Victoria? would further point out that the £7,700 which is provided to cover the cost of the police canvass will recur only when such canvasses are necessary. Altogether, about £10,000 out of the £20,000 provided upon these Estimates will recur only at intervals. The balance will be an annual expenditure. to ascertain when the scheme for the redistribution of seats is likelv to be submitted to Parliament? Everybody is aware that the present position of parties in this Chamber is very uncertain. Personally, I am of opinion that Queensland is entitled to another representative, and, if that be so, Victoria will probably be entitled to one less. Under the provisions of the Constitution the numerical strength of this House must be practically twice that of the Senate. I am strongly of opinion that Queensland is entitled to an additional member. promised to that matter at an earlier stage in the debate.' ment endeavour at theearliest possible moment to ascertain the exact population pf each State, in order that we may decide upon' a scheme for the redistribution of seats ?

As the service is to take place on Monday next, and as it seems. unlikely that we shall be able to obtain a statement from the Minister upon the Defence Estimates before that date, I should like the Prime Minister to convey I to him the gist of my remarks, and to ascertain if the document to which I refer cannot be made available to-morrow.
