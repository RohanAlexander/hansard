Before resuming my remarks upon the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson), I desire to withdraw and apologize to the House for some remarks I made last evening during a heated passage,, and which I think were uncalled for. I express, also, my gratitude to the Treasurer (Sip Joseph Cook), who was leading the House last night, for having given me an opportunity of continuing my remarks to-day, and the Committee an opportunity of discussing fully and adequately the very important question which is now before Parliament and the people. I make no apology for continuing this debate, because I am convinced that, although I may be told that the numbers are up, and that the debate will not influence a single vote, this Parliament is designed by the Constitution, and desired by the people to bo the place for full and open discussion of all matters of public weal. There is only one question before the Committee, and that is, whether three items of expenditure on the Federal Capital site, totalling Â£150,000, shall be included in this Bill. This is not the time to discuss the relative merits of Canberra or' any other site. The only matter we have to consider is the raising and spending of certain sums of money. I am quite prepared to admit freely that in the compact made between the various States and the people of Australia, it was agreed that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales, but not less than 100 miles from Sydney. Later, this Parliament decided that the site should be at Canberra. I do not attempt to reflect upon any of those arrangements or decisions. Every honourable member will admit that these are national agreements which must be fulfilled. But the question we have to consider to-day is whether, in the present financial condition of Australia, we should spend Â£150,000 for certain services connected with the establishment of the Federal Capital. I am afraid that the people of Australia-to what extent their opinion is reflected by honourable members. I know not-d o not realize the very serious financial position which the country now occupies. There is a belief that everything is worlds, that we are all right, and can continue spending money as unconcernedly as we have done in the past. But it is my conviction that those who hold that view are living in a fool's paradise. They do not realize the financial dangers with which we are faced. Only on Wednesday, last the Treasurer, in reply to a question by the honorable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), informed the House that in spite of the amount that has been raised by taxation and loans, tbe Commonwealth has floating liabilities, which must be met within a comparatively short time, with other payments to make in the near future, amounting, according to my calculations, to not less than Â£110,000,000. Imperial Government a sum of Â£47,500,000, which is practically payable on demand. There are outstanding Treasury bills amounting to Â£9,000,000. The approximate amount still to be raised to finance soldier settlement is Â£33,000,000. It is estimated also, and I think honourable members will admit that the estimate is reasonable, that a further sum of about Â£25,000,000 will be required in connection with advances for War Service Homes* There is a general belief that we are enjoying such a state of unbounded prosperity that all such sums as these, and also the Â£150,000 which tbe Government",23,Personal Explanation

31,Mr Jowett,"We still owe to thepropose to spend at Canberra, ean be raised without tbe slightest difficulty. There is, however, one aspect which the public have not yet begun to realize, namely, that to a very large extent the overflowing Treasury, and the overflowing purses'of a-considerable number of people, are due to the fact that our primary products and, indeed, all products, are now selling at inflated values. So far from the production of Australia increasing, there is evidence that it is actually diminishing. We are only deceived regarding this apparent prosperity by the great inflation of values. The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, referred to the increase of 89 per cent, in the value of exports, to which a very large measure of our present prosperity is -due. He continuedUnfortunately, statistics of values alone do of the country at that time. not furnish a true record of trade movements. In themselves they are to-day utterly misleadlatest figures available do not show that ing. A very careful analysis would be needed to ascertain hflw much of these values is due to actual bulk increase, how much to a change in the character of .the goods, and how much to higher prices. Almost simultaneously with the delivery of that speech a statement was published by Mr C. H . Wickens, of the Commonwealth Statistician's Department, that since 1913 production in Australia has decreased, despite the fact that in the case of manufacturers, the amount of horse-power expended has increased. He .gave details as to the decrease in the number of stock, and the output of the dairying industry, and the reduction in the production of gold from 2,207,433 ounces in 1913 to 1,273,188 ounces in 191S, and of black coal from 12,414,822 tons to 10,883,146 tons, and of copper from 52,566 tons to 41,402 tons, during the same period. was that information published? the evidence given by Mr Wickens before Mr Justice Higgins on the 20th September, and published in the Melbourne Herald of that day. I believe the same information was published in the morning press. It may be thought that this enormous decrease in the quantities of our primary products since the beginning of the war has been made up for by increases in manufactures. Those who look merely to figures concerning gross values may find something to justify their views, but Mr Wickens makes the following statement upon that phase of the matter:Adjusted to the 1913 basis by means of wholesale price-indexes the value of manufactures in 1013 was Â£65,153,2S6, as against Â£44,753,512 in 1018. The total value in 1918, however, was Â£79,571,745, as against Â£65,153,2S6. The actual total value was considerably higher, but the difference is entirely due to increase in prices. As regards the number of hands employed in factories, Mr Wickens said:In 1913 there were 15,536 factories in Australia, and, in 19il8, 1,5,421. The average number of hands employed was 337,101, as against 328,049. that 300,000 of our young men were out we have gained to any considerable extent, particularly, so far as many primary products are concerned. thing yesterday about wheat which does not confirm that view. teresting statement, but it did not clash with anything I have just said. At present, we are expecting an unusually good harvest. decreased. tralia's financial position, and remembering our practically stationary production, and not forgetting also tbe prospect of our having to raise, at very short notice, a sum reasonably estimated at Â£110,000,000, the great test which we must apply to all the proposed items of expenditure is, ""Are they absolutelynecessary "" ? Whatever may be said in favour of ultimately carrying on the work at Canberra in order to make a home for the Federal Parliament and Administration, there is no necessity to spend money there at present. I recall an illuminating statement delivered by Mr Watt, in this chamber, on 16th October last year.

I nrge honorahle members to consistently search and. examine this proposed outlay of Â£150,000,, and to apply as a test the question whether or not the project is absolutely necessary ito-day. people of Australia were provided with another opportunity to consider the creation of a Federal Capital they would be opposed to expenditure upon it. It is absurd to proceed to build a costly city at Canberra in order to house politicians and public servants only. For many years huge expenditure from revenue would be entailed, and I do not think the Australian people to-day would approve of the project if given an opportunity to indicate their views. With our small population we should wait for many years before indulging in the construction of a capital city. Circumstances have considerably altered since the people originally expressed their views; and, for that reason, it is the duty of the Government to consult the people again. Much has been heard about the Convention to be held early next year. In connection with that, there should be afforded an excellent opportunity for the people to express their opinions about proceeding with Canberra. Until the population has very materially increased I hold that the Government will not be justified in going on with the building of theÂ« Capital. For many months there has been an organized effort, on the part of those in this Parliament, who advocate the completion of the Federal Capital, to have a sum put on the Estimates in order that work shall proceed. Unfortunately, those wbo are opposed to the proposition have not similarly organized in order to prevent the placing of an item upon the Estimates. However, I intend to register my vote against the proposal. -My sole reason for opposing this proposed expenditure is a financial one. There is not an honourable member who can challenge the statement that Australia is in a seriously embarrassed financial position just now. With much difficulty w j bave just raised a loan of Â£25,000,000. There was anxiety concerning whether we would succeed in that effort, and we are aware that it is not the last loan to be raised. Possibly, it is the last this year, but, certainly, it is not the last to be. raised in order to meet the legitimate financial obligations of Australia. And, at a time when the people are demanding economy, it is unwarranted that we should commit ourselves to this item of Â£150,000. I am ready and anxious to honour all obligations, and this, in respect of the Federal Capital, among others. When we reflect upon our financial situation-as revealed in the Budget-w e must be impressed with the good reasons for hastening slowly so far as expenditure upon Canberra is concerned. We have to provide additional taxation to the extent of nearly Â£4,000,000, and I want to know how this Parliament can justify the imposition of additional taxation to that extent at a time when we are committing ourselves to the piece of wasteful and extravagant expenditure involved in this item of Â£150,000? I have many relatives in New South Wales, and certainly a large business connection with Sydney, so that I have had the opportunity of meeting many representative men from that city, and some few weeks ago I expressed the opinion that there was no demand whatever on the part of the people of New South Wales for the creation of this Capital at the present time. I went on to argue that all that the people of New South Wales are concerned about just now, and the people in all the other States, is that there should be a reduction of taxation, and that every legitimate opportunity should be taken to bring it about; and I gave the assurance that, so soon as we could reduce our taxation to anything like a normal character, I would gladly join with others to honour the obligation to create a Capital at Canberra. But when I made the statement that New South Wales was quite apathetic on this subject. I little expected to have confirmation so rapidly from one of the highest authorities in New South Wales, Mr Justice Heydon. He is a gentleman for whom I have the highest personal regard, as every one must who knows him or knows of him. Therefore, when I find that he has committed himself to certain malicious falsehoods in a circular, I can account for it in only two ways.",25,Personal Explanation

My point is that, as the people of New South Wales, as I have said, are quite apathetic on this subject, a league has had to be formed for the purpose of beating up any interest whatever in it, and a pathetic appeal is made by Mr Justice Heydon for Â£1,000 for a propaganda fund. Subscriptions are invited from all and sundry, falsehoodI repeat that-whe n and the object is to secure the sum of Â£1,000 for the purpose of propaganda in order to galvanize the people of New South Wales into taking some interest in this question.

53,Sir Robert Best,"The honorableStates, to protest against this piece of extravagant folly; but that is not a society of Melbourne conspirators formed to defeat this item. But what about the conspiracy of the Canberrites? In any case, if the honourable member is merely referring to a meeting of some of my honourable friends, which was convened for the purpose of protecting the fair financial name of Australia 'at the present time, and avoiding a gross piece of extravagance, it is quite another matter, -and illustrates clearly the misrepresentation of which I am complaining; but I want to know where these "" ample funds"" can be found. However, this method of employing malicious misstatements is the .process by which certain gentlemen hope to inflame the provincial animosity of the people of New South Wales, and stimulate interest in a subject in which the people have practically no concern. As I have said, their sole interest is to secure a reduction, in the 'burden of taxation, and not wasteful expenditure of vast sums of money in tlie establishment of a bush Capital at the present time. Then this circular proceeds to say, referring to MelbourneWhat she contemplates is a gross and cynical breach of the spirit of Federation. That statement is not correct, and is, indeed, another gross misrepresentation. The real objection to the establishment of the Capital at Canberra, at the present time, is that no money is legitimately -available for tbe purpose. I say, moreover, that, when we hardly know where to turn for revenue, and are deliberately imposing taxation, a proposal to indulge in such wasteful extravagance is utterly unwarranted. What is the scheme? The idea, apparently, is to erect a few shanties or shelter sheds at Canberra. Nothing could lend itself to greater waste of money than a proposal for the temporary erection of buildings. nothing temporary suggested. is that a 'Committee which has reported on the subject, said that even to supply temporary buildings would cost Â£3,250,000. years ago. that the cost of material and labour has increased by 100 per cent, since then, we are asked to indulge in this wasteful expenditure. It would be a gross mistake to erect a few temporary shanties or shelter sheds to represent nominally the Capital of Australia. If we are to have a capital, let us build one worthy of Australia on broad and proper lines. It would, no doubt, involve many millions of money; but we would enter upon it with our eyes open. That would be legitimate expenditure. We have the right to know from the Government what they contemplate doing with this Â£150,000; whether it is part of a scheme to supply temporary buildings, or part of a 'broader scheme which has for its object the building of a permanent capital worthy of the Commonwealth. We have the right, also, to learn from the Government when the Commission which is to advise on this matter is to be appointed. what? Minister promised to appoint a Committee, or Commission of experts to investigate and furnish us with estimates in regard to the cost of building a capital at Canberra. The appointment of such a Commission should necessarily precede the carrying out of the actual work of construction. When is this Commission to be appointed? Is it to precede the expenditure of this money? If not, it adds weight to the argument that what is now proposed on the Estimates will be a deliberately wasteful piece of expenditure. The honourable -member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) and others can afford to smile at any opposition to this item, because they have the numbers. I have been in the same happy position at times. I have also been in the reverse position, as at present, of putting up the best fight I can. In this regard I have a bitter complaint against the Government. When a deputation waited on him recently, the Prime Minister said that this would not be a party question, and that everyone would be free to vote as he liked, but we learn now that he has refused to permit the members of bis Government to vote as they like. are they?",27,Personal Explanation

72,Sir Robert Best,"I have neverthe pre-war rates for labour and material, and at the same time would deliberately enter into competition with those who are seeking to build, homes for themselves. The lack of housing accommodation in all our big cities is a very serious problem. There is a great shortage of nouses, and a most serious scarcity of building materials. Why, then, should we enter into competition with those who are anxious to build homes for themselves? We certainly shall not get full valne for our money, and I would put it to the Committee that, instead of sanctioning wasteful expenditure of this character, we should direct our efforts to a reduction of the burdens of taxation. As soon as we return to conditions approximating to normality, I , and others who think with me, will gladly vote for the building of a capital worthy of Australia. I enter this debate with some diffidence. When the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) and I entered the Victorian Legislative Assembly some thirty-one years ago, the electorate of Delatite was represented by Mr James Howlin Graves, a much-respected man, who from the Ministerial corner in this very chamber, declared one day that, given the support of such a mighty, newspaper as the Age, he, old man although he was, would be willing to fight any electorate in the State. Having listened to the speeches jietitiongineers in Australia respectfully and urgently made by representatives of Victoria in opof professional experts to inquire into and position to this proposed vote, the Comreport upon the general administration relamittee will be inclined to think that that tive to the building of Canberra, and to newspaper still exercises very great powers review in Victoria. I am convinced that if it by Colonel W. L. Vernon, V.D., F.R.I.V.A., in published to-morrow a leading article the June issue of ""Building Magazine."" setting ont that it was the duty of this Parliament to carry out the pledge that attitude the Federal Capital should be established him in New South Wales, the attitude taken we recognise in the fortunate turn of the poliup by a number of Victorian members tical wheel, an opportunity for yet saving Auswould be very different from what it is tralia's capital city from the grave constructo-day. I am going to support the protional posed vote. First of all, because a solemn cised in opposition, you now have the opporpledge was made on behalf of the Comtunity of putting into effect as Prime Minister, monwealth that the Capital would be and we can established in New South Wales. I re.power gret that the site selected is not what I should have liked it to be. In connection with the choosing of a site, the of the greatest architects, engineering and Age published some trenchant articles reotherwise, in Australia. I have to thank garding the treachery of certain Victorian members who departed from their promises, and helped to secure the selection of Canberra. Canberra, however, was the ultimate decision of the majority of the Parliament of that day, and that is sufficient for me. In the second place, I understand that nearly Â£250,000 has been wasted on the Federal Capital. If that is so, it has been due to incompetence. I desire to. give credit to the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) for the action he took to prevent the selection of a composita design for the Federal Capital. But for the right honourable gentleman thc capital city would have been an. abomination, built on lines laid down in a composite plan, prepared by a man who had never won a prize in any great town-planning, or even township-planning, competition, Colonel Miller-God knows where he got his Colonelcy-and Colonel Owen-who ever heard of anything that he did-wit h others, were contemptible and mean enough to steal the brains of the men who submitted plans in the competition for the best design for the Capital. They took a little from this plan and a little from that, and had not the honesty to give credit to the architects of the world whom they had robbed. The following petition was presented to the present Treasurer, who was then Prime Minister of the CommonwealthSir,-!We the undersigned architects and enyou to appoint a Royal Comniission the present built-up design to which so much expert objection has been taken, notably You are well aware of the uncompromising adopted by the ex-Minister for Home Affairs towards the professional counsel offered at various stages of the competition, and disaster that threatens it.

No t a dog's chance. MrB l a c k e t , w h o was appointed a E o y a l Commissioner to in q u i r e in to the expend it u r e at Canberra, said in his r e p o r t . The causes that . 1 have mentioned are, I think, mainly responsible for the waste in construction at Canberra. But, in my opinion, tens of thousands of pounds would have been saved if , from the outset, tliere had been proper consideration for the comfort of workmen. The men who had been employed at Canberra, in almost every instance, had made large savings out of their wages, because there is neither need nor opportunity for much expenditure. If comfortable cottages had been available, efficient workmen would have been anxious to go there and stay there, and no need would have arisen for the engagement of 167 men from Melbourne, and the return of 117 of their number with fares paid, because of inefficiency. MrB l a c k e t also saysUpon all the evidence, and particularly upon that which has been stated or referred to in the report, I find that the reasons why Mr. Griffin, between 18th October, 1913, and 15th November, 1915, performed no substantial part of his duties under' his contract w it h the Commonwealth are as stated in four of the five charges advanced in his behalf, viz.. charges 1, 2, 3, and 5, and are as under:1. That necessary information' and assistance were withheld from him and his powers were usurped by certain officers That is the gang of which I spoke a little while ago2. That he and his office were ignored, his rights and duties under his contract denied, and false charges of default made against h i m ; 3. That the Hon. W. 0. Archibald and members of the Departmental Board endeavoured to set aside his design and to substitute the Board's own design; and 5. That tliere was in the Department a combination, including the Hon. W. 0. Archibald and certain officers, hostile to Mr Griffin, and to his design for the capital city. The promise or pledge to build the capital city in New South ""Wales ought to be kept. Had we gone there long ago, the expense involved in the renting and purchase of public offices in Melbourne, Sydney, and the other capital cities would have been saved. It is now proposed to make the old Turn Verein, in Victoria-parade, [12.40] I propose to refer very briefly Melbourne, into a printing office for printto one or two of the arguments used ing the Commonwealth notes, and for by the honourable member for Kooyong was made of Â£10,000 previously for the property as it stands. All such public offices as this ought to be built at Canberra. We owe a great deal to the Parliament and people of Victoria for granting the Commonwealth Government the use of this Parliament House; and yet v,e have not hai the grace to spend Â£200 or ; Â£300 in making a decent garden, just outside, of what is one of the biggest blobs on the beauty of the city. As to the cost of temporary buildings at Canberra, I may say that, by the Works Department of the StateI have been informed that the fittings of the State Parliament House, the interior of which is almost a replica of these Chambers we noAv occupy, cost Â£30,000; and these, no doubt .could be purchased for a much smaller sum and utilized at Canberra. As.a matter of fact, the temporary State Parliament House in the Exhibition building ds infinitely more comfortable and convenient than this building. I think that the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Bobert Best) is wrong in, his ideas regarding temporary buildings. There is not an architect of standing but would advocate permanent buildings at Canberra, even if only the Town Hall of tbe city were built and utilized for legislative purposes for the time being. Personally, I do not desire to see temporary buildings erected, and, as I said before, much money would have been saved had we got to Canberra long ago. No doubt, the change would mean much to the Melbourne press, but if the Seat of Government were removed to Canberra, those who conduct the daily journals could have special telegraphic arrangements, just as has been the case with the newspapers of Sydney and other places for the the last twenty years. Such an expenditure could not matter to the newspaper proprietors of Melbourne, in view of the large profits they have made in the past, and are said to be making now. If we did as the Swiss Government do, we would be more worthy of the people who send us here as representatives, and be the better able to do our duty to. the country.",30,Personal Explanation

I shall quote to the Committee the remarks made by Mr Alfred Deakin on the Australasian Federation Enabling Act Amending Bill in the Victorian Legislative Assembly on the 29th June, ^1899. Mr Trenwith had said, that he could congratulate the Premier on having secured an arrangement by which the Capital would remain in Melbourne for all time. In the course of his speech, Mr economy w ill prevail, and that the Federal Deakin saidWith regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Footscray, who I am sorry to observr is not on his place, I w ill not say they were carefully devised for a malicious purpose, but they w ill certainly have the effect of furnishing fuel to the flame of suspicion, already fierce in certain quarters, in reference to the Capital. I desire, therefore, to offer a few words in regard to it . In the first place, I agree with the Premier that the reasonable proposition in this matter would have been simply to exclude the Capital cities, and any place in their immediate vicinities. It is a desirable thing, from a national point of view, that the Federal Capital of Australia shall be independent of the control 'of the people of any one Capital of any one Provincethat it shall be stationed on its own'territory, and entirely free front local influence, so as to give the best guarantee of its impartiality. If the Federal Capital were stationed in or near one of the great cities, there would be a difficulty in persuading the rest of the Continent that proposals which added buildings and gave employment in the Capital were not designed for the benefit of that Colony rather than of the Commonwealth. Therefore, I should always oppose the establishment and maintenance of .the Federal Capital in any great city, including the city and Capital of Melbourne. Yes, much as 1 owe to Melbourne, my native city, wliere X have spent my life, and to which I owe all possible loyalty and obligation, I shall vote, as an elector of the Federal Parliament, against any proposal to retain the Federal Legislature here more than its due time. I do not think it w ill be attempted to be so detained. Our people are .too proud to rely upon mere adventitious advantages, and are confident that their metropolis can f u l f i l its destiny in face of any fair comhas been set apart for the Federal Capital, I may say that, so far as I have any knowledge of the feeling of the electors of Melbourne, and of the feelings of the members of this House, as well as of the Victorian representatives at the late Convention, there w ill be no attempt to keep the Capitali n Melbourne one single day longer than is necessary. I believe this Colony would feel that such conduct constituted a breach of faith. The people of Victoria would be ashamed to cherish such a prospect, and would resent any such statement as an aspersion on their honour. Be that as it may be, there stands in the B ill a provision that the Capital shall be within New South Wales, and I take it that the Parliament w ill be removed tluther as soon as a site can be selected, and that w ill be before any lengthy period has elapsed. As the honourable member for Footscray says, the .Federal Government w ill not have sufficient money to build a palatial edifice of this kind, and I trust that half-a-century or a century w ill be allowed to pass before it lavishes its funds in the erection of a permanent Parliament House such as this. We may rely upon it that a spirit of Government w ill take, a lesson from the example of tlie Queensland House of Parliament in Brisbane, and construct a far more convenient and far more suitable building than this for one-tenth of its cost. The Federal Capital, I hope, w i ll be created at an early date, on the most suitable site, not situated as to be under provincia' or metropolitan in fluences, but sufficiently in the interior to give a guarantee to the great bulk of the people of Australia that their interests w ill be considered apart fro m the overshadowing in fluences of any town, class, or caste. I believe that the Federal Capital can be founded in temporary fashion within three or four years of the establishment of the Commonwealth, and I hope to see it during that period able to"" accommodate the Federal Parliament and its Executive.

MALONEY -I Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. journment I waa endeavouring to make my first point, namely, that a vote given against this item would not involve on the part of those who so voted any violation of any pledge given to New South Walesi n respect of the Capital site. leave that. the matter is this: . Since the pledge was given circumstances have completely changed. tered, necessitating and justifying a postponement of the fulfilment of the pledge originally given. Let us consider what has been done by this Parliament in f u l filment of the original pledge. Parliament about nine years to fix on a Capital site. made in 1908. great deal of difficulty, the present site was decided upon. Then the Parliament began to lay the foundations of the Capital and do a certain amount of preparatory work; and I understand that since then there has been spent on the Capital site something in the neighbourhood of Â£2,000,000. In 1914 the disastrous war occurred, and it and its consequences have overshadowed everything else ever since. In company with several other honourable members, I visited the Pederal Capital site about two years ago, so that I am not open to the charge of the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) that those who speak from the Victorian point of view have never seen the site. I noted tbe shameful-the criminal-wast e of monev that had gone on there; and I mingled my tears w it h those of the honourable member for Illawarra as we gazed upou the lamentable spectacle. orable member suggest that it could make his companion weep? dled us with an almost intolerable, burden of debt. It is constantly insisted on, and stressed in this House, when any question of snending money arises. Our debt is such that every honest man and every honest Government must be determined that not one penny shall be unnecessarily spent until this debt has been discharged. There are various pressing claims which are not properly recognised in this community, withdraw it. but which we would like to see adequately met; claims which are being constantly P r i o r to the adpressed-the claims of the aged, the blind, and the invalid. Whenever appeals on behalf of these interests are made we are told that Australia cannot afford more. -We are told, "" W a it until times are a l it t le better, and we wil l see that all these I now things are put r i g h t . "" We have had to The way in which I view cut down our Defence vote very drastically; and adequate defence, after all, is the guarantee of. our national safety. The situation is entirely alExpenditure has been cut down--w e are told by our experts, on whom we must rely-to the lowest possible point consistent with national safety. Now, what are we asked' to do ? We are desired to It took spend Â£150,000. For what? There is not a single 'honourable member who will be voting to authorize the expenditure of this sum who can say that he knows how it is to be spent. an opinion, and I am judging, for the most part, from, the top or of the speeches hitherto delivered on the subject. I repeat that not one member of this Committee knows how that money is to be expended. When information has been sought of the Government we have been referred to the Estimates. There, I find that Â£90,000 is to be spent on in it i a l settlement. Is there an honourable member who knows what that means, or what it involves ? What is intended to be done with that Â£90,00 0 ? We are told that another Â£60,000 is to be expended in preparatory works. Preparatory to what? The grand total of Â£2,000,000 , to date, has been spent in preparatory work, has gone in initial settlement. And what does it amount to? To nothing, so f a r . We have not been given a single word of explanation by the Government concerning what initial settlement means, and what preparatory works are to be undertaken. The last time. I heard, in this The war has sadHouse, any justification for expenditure on the Pederal Capital site was when an explanation was tendered by MrW a t t .

But, staggering, as we are, under our burden of accumulated debt, and determined, as we are, ' that, nothing shall be spent which is not absolutely necessary, we are nevertheless asked to agree to the expenditure of another Â£150,000 upon this precious Capital site, for ""initial settlement"" and1 "" preparatory works."" are merely kept alive the honourable member is content? the time arrives when, in the estimation of honourable members, we shall be justified in incurring further expenditure in .regard to that site. arrived.

The one string on which he played was that we were, and are, in honour bound to fulfil a pledge. It is a matter of common knowledge that if a man honorably incurs a debt and finds, subsequently, that circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible for him I now insist to meet that debt, no one would say that he was in honour bound to pay. And, if he were haled before a Court of Justice, what would be the procedure? His circumstances would be inquired into, and if it were satisfactorily shown that since incurring the debt his circumstances had so changed as to render it impossible for him to meet it, the Court would say, ""We will not insist upon your paying, but will wait until your circumstances are such as to permit you to meet your He quoted honourable obligation."" The debtor would not be repudiating his obligation, but would be simply postponing the hour That was the honourable of his meeting it. That is the position of the Commonwealth to-day.

I said, a few weeks ago, upon my return from a. visit to New South Wales and Queensland, that, in conversation with all sorts and conditions of men, I had found no anxiety for the removal of the Federal Parliament to Canberra. has received striking corroboration from the letter read by the honprable member for Kooyong( Sir Eobert Best) to-day. When we find that it is such a burning question in New South Wales, this anxiety to have the contract fulfilled to it . us up to it. I do not care how the honourable member phrases it. The anxiety of the people of New South Wales is so great that it has been found necessary to -form a league whose function is to try to whip the people of the State into a condition of taking interest in this question. What rendered the formation .of that league necessary was the fact that the people of New South Wales did not care a snap of the fingers whether the Seat of Government was removed to Canberra or not; and when we are told that the league was formed for the express purpose of reawakening interest in the question, all I have to say it that it shows that the people of the State are nothing like as ento do about Chapman? We cannot stave thusiastic as are their parliamentary champions. It has been rather interesting to compare the attitude of honourable members of the Opposition in respect of this vote of Â£150,000 with their attitude on the vote for defence purposes. When the Government came down and told us that their experts had been through the Defence'Estimates, and, after considering them carefully, had cut them down to the lowest possible point, and that every penny on the schedule submitted to us was necessary for the defence of Australia, what was the attitude of honourable members opposite in regard to a question of such vital interest to the whole Commonwealth? They said, ""We want to know how that money is to be spent. You have of not given us any information; and, on the score of economy, and because of the debt we have to face, we ought to cut the vote down, not by Â£1, but by Â£2,000,000."" One could understand and appreciate that attitude being assumed by honourable members who claim to be economists, and say, ""We are out for economy. We believe, as every honourable member does, that everything ought to be done for the proper defence of Australia, and if it can be shown that this expenditure is necessary for that purpose, we are willing to That opinion grant Supply."" But, while honourable members opposite submit the Defence votes to most careful scrutiny, they do not ask for any information when the Government come forward with a proposal to spend Â£150,000 at Canberra on "" initial settlement"" and ""preparatory works."" They do not say, "" What are you going to do with the money?"" but at once say ""Certainly. We will give you every penny of it, without a word of explanation."" And the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr McDonald) pertinently interjected, ""Why, it is not half enough."" Of course it is not. What is the use of spending Â£150,000 in this direction? It is a mere drop in the bucket. instalment. after we have already spent about Â£2,000,000 !i I can imagine the Government getting into their room and discussing the question of the grant for Canberra, and saying, "" What on earth are we him off with promises all the time. We have been promising him something for a long time, and now we must give him something."" Some one probably suggested, ""Â£150,000 is neither here nor there. Let us put down that amount for Canberra. It will please Chapman, and will do no harm."" But the next difficulty facing the Government was how to explain what they proposed to do with the money; and I do not know who was the bright genius in Cabinet who suggested this very ingenious way of covering the purpose for which the money was to be voted-""initia l settlement; preparatory works."" This might mean anything or nothing. However, here is this item of Â£150,000a mere drop",36,Personal Explanation

I last night objected to the expenditure of Â£2,000,000, not merely because of the great burden imposed on the country, but on the ground that it was a sheer waste of public money, which there was nothing in the immediate future to justify. has been said about workmen's cottages; but workmen's cottages appeal more to me than does a dock-yard or an arsenal. A workman's cottage is at least a home, but what kind of a home will a dock-yard locality or an arsenal furnish? Railways are a public ultility, and open up the country; What are and I feel more inclined, on national grounds, to vote for a railway than I do to vote for an instrument of destruction. WhatI f , in the interest of the country, I am called on to vote Â£5,000 for a railway or Â£5,000 for a war-ship, my vote will go for the railway. The completion of a railway turn is useful work, and septic tanks and sewers are conducive to the health of the community; whatever the value of the argument may be, these -are public, utilities. Honourable members wish to know how I am going to vote. In view of the support of the press, or the press denunciation which might be avoided, I might as vigorously oppose this expenditure as I did the Defence expenditure last night. There are honourable members who are no longer politicians, whose utterVictoria; ances and votes are formulated for them, The not by the necessities or by the pros and cons of the situation, but according to purely local circumstances. If the Government is wise, and wishes to please everybody, they will see that this Â£150,000 is voted. That will please those who I can justify the posidesire the expenditure; and tbe honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) will be able to show, that he has ""perished in the attempt"" to secure the creation of the Capital; it will also please honourable members from Victoria when they find that the Government really do nothing when the money has is only Â£150,000, been voted. Tbe Government could just These remarks as easily bave put Â£2,000,000 on the Estimates, for when it is passed, they need not spend it, but may go on to build a surplus out of it. That would be masterly finance, for it would secure the approval of all, although we had been given an assurance that the Government was going to spend this money. Honourable members have heard what I have to say, and will know afterwards how I propose to vote. When I heard that the Government really intended to spend money on the Something Pederal Capital, I realized the truth of the old saying that "" Those whom the gods would destroy, they first make",41,Personal Explanation
154,Mr Anstey,"mad."" I warn the Government that this",42,Personal Explanation
155,Mr Wienholt (Moreton) [3.7],"is the second measure, since I entered Parliament, which arouses strong resentment outside. I think I can say there is not a member of the Country party more sympathetic than myself to the Government, or more inclined to give them fair and generous support in carrying out their policy; bnt when they propose expenditure of this sort, they seem to me to resemble that honest but uriromantic animal which, when thrown into the water, finds that, in its efforts to swim, it only succeeds in cutting its own throat. Amongst the proposed works at the Federal Capital is the erection of theatres; and when I mentioned that fact at my election meetings I could judge, by the ironical laughter, what the Queensland people thought of the idea. ""We have heard of a certain historical personage, well but unfavorably known, who is said to have fiddled while Rome was burning; and it would appear that the Government are going to watch musical comedies in a theatre at Canberra while Australia goes bankrupt. I heard some wild speeches last night; ancl while I do not agree that, in order to defend ourselves, we ought to throw away our arms, yet I observed and agreed with those honourable members who, in 'dealing with the Defence Estimates, drew attention to the serious debt hanging over AustraliaI am prepared to do what I do not think many members of the National party are prepared to do, namely, give my support"" to the Government in any proposal for a fair and reasonable wealth tax, in order to reduce that crushing burden. But to spend money in the way proposed on the Federal Capital under present circumstances is the greatest piece of folly of which I ever heard. An owner of a property may for very sound reasons desire to remove his house and homestead to another part of his land, but he will wait until he is clear of his mortgage and can afford the money. has made no preparations for clearing off her mortgages before moving her house, bnt ip getting eyen. more heavily into debt. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr connection with the Federal Capital axe Anstey) says that he would rather vote for a railway than for a war-ship; but I am afraid if we do not vote for the war-ship, we shall only build the railway for somebody else's use. However, I hope the House, by a big majority, will refuse to sanction tbe proposed expenditure, and that we shall hear no more of this sort of nonsense. have no desire to see the compact made with New South Wales broken, but I protest against the proposed expenditure at this present time. I see no breach of compact in postponing this work still further, now that twenty years have lapsed since Federation was inaugurated. It would be simply frittering away money to spend it in the proposed small annual grant. I have no objection to the building of the Federal Capital; but, before it is undertaken, a proper scheme should be outlined, and we should have a reasonable prospect of completing it . If this Territory were handed over to a commissioner, or body of trustees, there might be some chance of success; if such a body had power to pledge the area and. raise sufficient money, and went to work in a proper way, the Seat of Government might in a few years be at , Canberra. But the mere expenditure of Â£150,000 this year, and a similar amount in ' the next year, will not ever get us to Canberra. The time has come, and nobody should know it better than the Treasurer, when no money should be expended for other. than necessary work. This is not the time for looking about to see what projects can be started; rather should the Government be endeavouring to discover what expenditure >they can do without. Por all the good that the expenditure of Â£150,000 will do to benefit New Soutli Wales, or advance the fulfilment of the compact to establish the Federal Capital in that State, we might as well not vote the money at all. The country is faced with the responsibility of finding so much money that I hope the Treasurer will realize the necessity, if not in regard to this item, at any rate when other items Australia, however, on the Estimates are reached, to reduce expenditure so that no obligations shall be incurred that are not absolutely necessary. The only items I shall support in those which the Government declare are necessary for the maintenance of works . already carried out. The amount of Â£150,000 will not do much more than that. The initiation of new works and",42,Personal Explanation
156,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot) [3.13],"Ibuildings at such an inopportune time will mean absolute waste of money, and will not contribute one iota towards honoring the compact that was made with New South Wales before the Federation was established. I intend to support the amendment, and I desire to state, briefly, my reasons. I stand for honouring the compact w i th New South Wales. It was included in the terms upon which the States federated, and I will not sanction any delay with the mere object of avoiding our constitutional obligation. But , having regard to the financial position of the country, and the great burden of debt and taxation under which we are labouring, due, no doubt, to the obligations contracted in connection with the war, I feel that we should not at this period enter upon the proposed expenditure. The time is inopportune for the proposals that are before the Committee, and for that reason only I shall vote for the amendment. Until this afternoon I was not aware that A t the same time, the pledge does and the Federal Capital was a matter of such w ill remain until in a deliberate way this interest to members.

Whilst they are against becoming the property of the land monothe Government, an'd the Government polist and speculator. are against them, there must be some embarrassment in the situation, although it is not without its compensations. It is said that we should keep the pledge that was embedded in the foundation work of the Constitution to establish the Federal Capital on New South Wales soil and at a sufficiently respectful distance from the sacred person, so to speak, of Sydney. I do not recognise this claim about honouring a pledge, if by it is meant that this Parliament is bound by any legislative Act, or, for that matter, by any constitutional limitations of twenty years ago, provided this Parliament, or the people, as the case may be, decide upon a new policy. This Parliament never binds future generations; neither d i d the founders of the Commonwealth. The pledge in regard to the Capital remains what it was-a n expression of the opinion of the people at that time-and let us be thankful that our constitutional obligations, as well as our parliamentary obligations, may be discharged by registering at any time the altered views of the people. So that the claim in regard to the honouring of a pledge does not appeal to me.

158,Mr Brennan (Batman) [3.18],"that rapidly follows the advance of civili zation, I have abundant confidence that the Federal Territory w ill shortly become, with the transference of the Federal Government, not a burden, but an asset, and a productive blessing to the people. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) has directed our attention to the obligations which we owe to the old and infir m in respect of pensions, and, generally, to the tremendous financial burdens which rest upon the country. I recognise those obligations, and it is for that reason that I oppose some proposals for the creation of additional debts. But I am bound to remind the honourable member that he has the doubtful political honour of belonging to a party which has been very slow in supporting honourable members on this side in their endeavour to do a greater measure of justice to the old-age pensioners and others. In the Federal Terri tory we have an area of no less than 583,660 acres, equivalent to about 900. square miles. A t least, it is country of f a ir average quality, and as it has the advantage of one of the deepest ports on the Australian coast at no great distance, I have very little doubt that it w ill United States Steel Corporation, showed a fivedevelop into an asset worth all that is calculated to be spent upon it . And ' there is something in the claim that the National Parliament should legislate from its own home, from a* national house. I am not one of those who are ^greatly influenced by the allegation that we are too pre3S-ridden in the city of Melbourne.

I am indebted to Mr Frank Cornwall, a publicist of Melbourne, who has taken great interest in political questions, particularly land settlement, for a lengthy circular, illuminating in a very interesting way the advantages which have accrued from the establishment of municipalities and cities controlled by the people for the people, and where the unearned increment on the land has flowed into the popular coffers instead of into the pockets of private speculators. In that circular, amongst other things, he says' It is not only ultimately that the Capital may be considered an economic factor in Australia, for, from the moment of its establishment 200 nuiles from the nearest industrial centre, it will open up for profitable production a tributary area of 200 miles diameter, with the deepest of all the ports on the continent, and attracting thousands of agricultural settlers tending to loosen a little .the stranglehold of the metropolitan capitals which are centralizing all advantages and forming an artificial development at .the expense of the country districts, which latter cannot and will not receive their fair share of legislative .interest and assistance so long as the propinquity of the great city operates to fill the whole perspective of the people's legislative and executive representatives.

All we now ask of the Government is that they shall postpone any further outlay until Australia shall have placed her house in order. .""We have just emerged from an ordeal which, until the war was precipitated, had been undreamed of, and we have been compelled to enter into more sacred compacts than that with the people of New South Wales concerning the Pederal Capital. While it is not desired that we should dishonour any pledge given, we do plead that the fulfilment of this pledge should be put off until a more convenient day. We ask the Government to say that no further money shall be spent upon Canberra at the present stage. So far as the compact with New South Wales is concerned, it was deliberately decided that Parliament would sit in Melbourne until such time as the Parliament decided otherwise. The people of the Commonwealth are not at all anxious-irrespectiv e 'of the arguments advanced from New South Wales-to be laden with further and unnecessary burdens.
