There is no real effort down on interest rate rises they went up on required to generate the surplus in their average 0.3 per cent per month.

Thursday, 15 May 2008 ----Franchises subject that has been raised before in parliament but which still continues to be a problem in my electorate of Swan, in Western Australia, as well as in other states of Australia-that is, franchising. Last month three franchise owners in Western Australia came to my electorate office in a state of distress as they were on the verge of financial ruin after purchasing and continuing to run a franchise business from a company called Michel’s Patisserie. They came to my office as a last resort, feeling they had nowhere else to turn for help. They are in a state of despair and stand to lose all they have achieved in their working lives, including their family homes, and they may have to endure the embarrassment of bankruptcy. These are not wealthy Australians by any means but middle-class, hard working Australians who have placed their homes and financial lives at risk on a franchise business model. After meeting with them and seeing the documentation for the proposal of that model, I was appalled that they had been convinced by the franchisor to purchase this model. I was soon to learn that at least five out of the 16 franchisees in WA are in the same position. I learnt as recently as yesterday that there are at least another 10 in Queensland in the same position. Soon after meeting with the franchisees I, with Luke Simpkins, the member for Cowan, and Don Randall, the member for Canning, had a meeting with John Martin and Sam Di Scerni from the ACCC to discuss franchising and churning. I have now sought a further meeting with John Martin and I have also written to the chairman of the company that owns Michel’s Patisserie seeking a meeting. An article appeared in the Courier Mail on 10 May entitled ‘Pie in the sky: not everyone makes money buying a franchise’. The article was written by Des Houghton. The article was primarily about struggling and pressured franchisees of Michel’s Patisserie and how they could not make money. The article also stated that only one franchisee had terminated its agreement in the past three years. Michel’s Patisserie seemed to be the only ones convinced that there is money to be made in their model. The article also failed to state how many franchise agreements had been terminated by the franchisor and how many franchisees had to leave with only a token payment to walk away with-and then the franchise was resold, to the benefit of the franchisor. Graeme Samuel, Chairman of the ACCC, told a recent federal parliamentary inquiry there were grave concerns with some aspects of franchising. Mr Samuel also told the hearing that action could be taken through section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act, which relates to unconscionable conduct. I and three of my parliamentary colleagues, who have constituents with similar problems, will continue to highlight franchising in Australia until we can get a satisfactory result for the franchisees. I urge the new minister for small business, the Hon. Dr Craig Emerson, to join us in this pursuit to assist Australian small businesses who are operating franchises and to review current legislation on franchising and the protection of franchisees.

256,Mr Irons (Swan) (9.30 Am),"I rise today to bring to the attention of the parliament aCarers Ms CAMPBELL (Bass) (9.33 am)-I have an enormous respect for the contribution made by carers in my community. In my electorate of Bass we have a tremendous number of carers, each and every one of whom deserves our thanks and our deepest appreciation for the tireless work that they do. Chief among my priorities when I was elected was providing support and respite for people with disabilities and for those who care for them. During my campaign, I was fortunate enough to meet two people, Jo Ryan and her son Ben. Ben has fragile X syndrome. He is a vibrant, unique and utterly charming young man. His mum, Jo, is unstinting in her love, affection and care for him. I met Jo when she was concerned about the end of a pilot program run through St Michaels Association Inc. in Launceston. The previous government funded it in its pilot stage and then callously chose not to renew it, despite a clear need in northern Tasmania. This program provided weekend respite for Jo and an opportunity for Ben to learn life skills away from home. He learnt how to cook and he learnt how to cleanpractical life skills which would help him to break away from the family home. The difference which this program makes to both Jo and Ben cannot be overstated. That is why, when Jo came to me, I promised her I would fight for funding to see that this program was continued. Last week I was able to tell both Jo and Alex Huntir, the CEO of St Michaels, that the Rudd Labor government is committing an extra $423,979 to the program to see it continued until at least June 2010. I understand, and clearly the Rudd Labor government understands, that without respite carers burn out. The demands placed on them at times are just unimaginable. That is why, in my capacity on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth, I moved a motion in support of an inquiry into better support for carers. I am passionate in the belief that we as a community must do all that we can to support those who in turn support the most vulnerable in our community. Let me say also that I am proud to be part of a federal government which is committed to extending 555 funding agreements for respite and carer support services through until June 2011. Eight such services are in my electorate of Bass and I look forward to them sharing in almost $440 million. I look forward also to drafting the terms of reference for the parliamentary inquiry into better support for carers. I look forward to hearing from those on the front line what we as a Commonwealth government can do to assist them to make the lives of people like Jo and Ben Ryan as positive as they can be. Gilmore Electorate: Fiona Lodge Ronald McDonald Beach House cial type of house located close to Bateman’s Bay, in my electorate of Gilmore. It is a special place because it provides free holidays to families of children and adults who are fighting a life-threatening illness. Fiona Lodge came about through a partnership with McDonald’s Australia and Des Phillips, Rachael Sweeny-Johns and Jim Johns, who in the late 1990s established the Bay of Dreams committee. From there commenced an active fundraising campaign, with the result that work began on the site in July 2000. Sadly, one of the instigators of the project, Des Phillips, the man who united the community with his passion to help people, was diagnosed with a terminal illness and lost his own battle with cancer. Over $1 million was raised in just four years. This is a remarkable effort from the community for a facility that offers respite to the families of children blighted by cancer. It is a chance for them to forget their woes, at least for a short time, and have a sunny holiday in the midst of gloom. MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Statements By Members
257,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.36 Am),"Fiona Lodge Ronald McDonald Beach House is a speIn late February this year I had occasion to be invited to visit Fiona Lodge, and the memory of that visit will stay with me forever. I was invited by Jim Johns, who is the owner of Bateman’s Bay McDonald’s and one of the founders of Fiona Lodge, to come down to have a look around and to join them for a lunch with visitors from China. The visitors included three orphaned Chinese children, two boys and a girl, who had been abandoned at birth because of their physical defects and whose chance of adoption was very slim because of those defects. The Chinese police had found them lying in the streets and had taken them to an orphanage, where they have lived since. The children earned the sponsorship of Fiona Lodge to come to Australia for a holiday by behaving well and working hard at their studies. New Idea helped sponsor the trip and will be doing a story on them. The intent of the gathering was to welcome the children into our community but not to seek their adoption. In fact, the Chinese government had issued clear instructions that this was not an option to be canvassed. Fiona Lodge is situated close to a private beach called Nuns Beach, at Rosedale near Batemans Bay, and has to be seen to be appreciated. It is really more of a retreat than a beach house. Part of the house has been specifically set up for families. The second section of construction is more suited to adults who are suffering the after-effects of cancer treatment. The concept of Fiona Lodge is that of a community partnership sponsored in conjunction with a corporate entity, and it was the first of its kind in Australia. There are now four other similarly styled facilities in Australia. One will soon be built in New Zealand and another in Canada. A banner of thanks was presented to Jim Johns and to Fiona Lodge, and I was very humbled by the fact that I was thanked as well and actually given a copy by the Chinese delegation of Mr Rudd’s book, a biography written in Mandarin. There was some embarrassment when they heard that I was from the other side, but I was flattered when someone told them that I was a very good community politician and that it would be okay to give me the book. I was very honoured to accept it and have since had Mr Rudd sign it for me, and I am practising to read it. In return, I proudly exchanged an Australian flag, which I hope will be flown in China. In the letter of invitation that was sent to me, Jim Johns wrote: Your handshake will not replace a lifetime of love and affection these kids have never had, but it will show them that there are people who are willing to take the time to come and visit them to show they care. In closing, I would like to draw attention to the organisation that has been created to assist orphaned and needy children in China. Aldinga Aero Club Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (9.39 am)-I rise today to congratulate the Aldinga Aero Club for the terrific services they provide to southern Adelaide. On Sunday, 30 MarchI experienced first hand how the Aldinga Aero Club touches the lives of the community with their remarkable service. The club has for many years been running special days for the Leukaemia Foundation where they take children on joy flights. Sunday, 30 March was no exception. It was touching to see the joy the Aldinga Aero Club brought to many children diagnosed with leukaemia, and their families, on that day. The statistics surrounding leukaemia are devastating and demonstrate why it is so vital that we have community groups such as the Aldinga Aero Club. It is estimated that every two MAIN COMMITTEE hours someone loses their life to leukaemia. Sadly, many of these are young children. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the sponsors who helped make this day possible: LJ Hooker, Aldinga; Bakers Delight; Janas Hair; and the City of Onkaparinga. The Aldinga Aero Club’s commitment to the community, though, does not stop there. In the past year the Aldinga Aero Club has been involved in supporting Angel Flight Australia. The aero club has over time coordinated with Angel Flight Australia to achieve a number of nonemergency free flights for financially and medically needy people in the southern Adelaide community. The club and its pilots have now flown many times to rural and regional areas of South Australia, making life just that little bit easier for those people with sick family members, to make sure that they receive medical treatment so desperately needed. One such Angel flight was for Jamie of Loxton. Jamie is seven years of age and her medical condition thus far has not been diagnosed. She suffers from a range of medical conditions, including low muscle tone and severe intellectual disabilities, and is required to be fed through a stomach tube. Jamie’s mum, Trish, has lost count of the number of trips Jamie and her family have made to Adelaide for ongoing medical support. Since Jamie was four months old, she has been taking a painful 4½-hour drive to the Adelaide Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Now with Angel flights it only takes 45 minutes. In Adelaide she is welcomed by the friendly faces of the ground angels, who take her and her family to the Adelaide Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Jamie’s family has been touched by the efforts of the Aldinga Aero Club. The club’s commitment has made such a difference to this family. The Aldinga Aero Club consists of hard working volunteers who have helped so many in our community. Volunteers like the members of the aero club are the glue that strengthens our society. I commend all the volunteers, pilots, businesses and community groups involved in supporting the fantastic services that the Aldinga Aero Club provides. Fadden Electorate: St Stephen’s College Chaplaincy Program the same chamber. I rise this morning to acknowledge some of our great school captains and school leaders within the schools in Fadden, the fastest growing electorate on the Gold Coast. From St Stephen’s College, let me acknowledge prefects Amber Forbes, Ryan Hunt, Jessica Law, Monique McCurdy, Matthew Beddard, Katie Chae, Nicola Demler, Jaiden Kennedy, Melanie Maclure, Katya Oldfield, Lyndon Pforr, Michael Schmidt, Bridgitte Yap, Melissa Nikolich and Tara Trezise; house captains Robert Cozier, Jackson Vilic, Amber Forbes, Joshua Te Tai, Kara Vaughan, Damien Yates, Ricky McGuinness, Lara Perkins, Jenna Blackbeard, Tahitia Chang, Justin Erasmus and Jessica Law; the sports captain, Ryan Hunt; and cultural captains Paige Edwards, Alexander McLachlan and Monique McCurdy. Our children are 100 per cent of our future. I acknowledge and support these great leaders and look forward to following their journey as they progress through their school years. I would also like to bring to the attention of the House the issue with respect to the chaplaincy program, which the government is proposing to change come 1 July this year. The chaplaincy program was implemented as a faith based program. It was not there to replicate the role of the state in providing social work; it was to provide pastoral care and chaplaincy. MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Statements By Members
258,Mr Robert (Fadden) (9.42 Am),"Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, how pleasant to be inThe federal government is now looking to change that to a more secular program. When the chaplaincy program was implemented, the then Prime Minister John Howard said: My assessment of the Australian community is that whatever its view about formal and religious adherence, it does hunger for additional ways of looking at the spiritual and pastoral side of life. Education Minister Gillard’s office has confirmed that the program will be changed into a secular scheme when current contracts expire-a chaplaincy program changed to a secular scheme. It is the role of the states to provide social work and support, not the role of the federal government. Australian Education Union state president Mary Blewett, clearly in a state of depression, rolled out: The overwhelming majority of government schools didn’t go near the program. She continued: Given the multicultural mix in many … schools, to go down the path of the chaplaincy program would have been incredibly divisive. Clearly no-one has told the union movement that 2,630 schools took up the program in 2007. The program also allowed for schools to choose the role, faith or denomination. It appears that the federal government may be going down the same route as the Queensland state government did when they tried to amend voluntary religious education to allow any faith or secular group to come in, including spiritualists and witches, to teach children. The level of public outrage was, of course, huge, and the state government of the time backed down. I would hope that the federal government sees sense and realises that it is a chaplaincy program, not a state based social program, and backs down from the lunacy of changing chaplaincy to something secular based. Robertson Electorate: After-Hours Medical Services Ms NEAL (Robertson) (9.45 am)-I rise this morning to draw the attention of this House to the concerns of a group located at Kariong in my electorate. Kariong is a relatively new suburb, first settled about the time. I actually moved to the coast, which was in about 1986. Approximately 3,000 people reside there. It is essentially a dormitory suburb. The vast majority of people there are either young families-who commute to Sydney, which is about 1½ hours away-or people who are recently retired. A petition has been presented to me that has been signed by 268 people. It draws attention to their lack of after-hours medical services. In fact, the closest after-hours medical clinic for this group of people is approximately 40 minutes away, which is a major inconvenience, particularly bearing in mind the difficulty with public transport when travelling from Kariong to Erina. Of course, this group of people is very concerned. For really relatively minor ailments that need attention but not necessarily emergency attention, they should not be blocking up the facilities at the nearby emergency department of Gosford Hospital. They are very concerned and want to see that there are after-hours medical services provided. I have had the opportunity to speak with Minister Nicola Roxon’s office. It appears possible that, under the program provided by this far-sighted government, an after-hours clinic in Kariong or in the nearby Mangrove Mountains-Somersby area can be provided. Certainly I am working with her office in the hope that this can be achieved. For many people in what we MAIN COMMITTEE might call the regional areas of Australia, access to medical services is quite difficult, and they really do require some assistance. I would now like to present that document. tions committee for its consideration and will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with standing orders. McPherson Electorate: Lions Youth of the Year chairperson of the judging panel of the Lions Club of Palm Beach-Currumbin’s 45th Lions Youth of the Year contest. I was joined this year on the panel by Mr Ken Lydiard, the Principal of Currumbin State Primary School, and Mr Alex McColm, who was representing the National Australia Bank, a major sponsor of Lions Youth of the Year nationally. The seven contestants this year were Jaeden Haas, Lachlan McCarthy, Sophie Hoffman, Timothy Gear, Thomas Litfin, Georgia Gardiner and Luisa Di Pompo. All these students came from schools on the southern Gold Coast. This annual event, which is sponsored by the Lions Club, aims to foster youth development in community speaking. Contestants were examined on local and international topics over several hours during the day and then had to come back at night to speak in front of their family, friends and the local community on two questions posed by the judges and on one topic of their own choosing. The high calibre of the youth participating certainly showed that these young people will be the leaders of tomorrow, and I can assure the House today that Australia will be in safe hands in the future. Five of the seven contestants were school captains, and all contestants showed a remarkable array of academic, personal and community achievements. Sixteen-year-old Georgia Gardiner, from Elanora High School, was the overall winner, and she will go on to represent the Lions Club of Palm Beach-Currumbin at the next level of the competition. Georgia is a true all-round achiever. She has received academic awards, including junior dux in 2006, as well as cultural, sports, citizenship and speaking awards. The competition was extremely close, with Georgia only winning by one point. Special commendation was awarded to 15-year-old Luisa Di Pompo from Marymount College, and 16-year-old Thomas Litfin from Somerset College won for best-prepared speech. The national ceremony for the Lions Youth of the Year Quest will be held in Darwin in May, so sometime this month we will have a national winner. I would like to put on record my thanks to Lions president Brian Mattingley, secretary Terry Gunton, and Merv Rose, who looks after the media for the Lions Club, along with all members of the Palm BeachCurrumbin Lions Club, for what is a wonderful event that they host every year. I would also particularly like to thank Harvey Crooks, a Lions Club member who is the coordinator of this event each year. The Lions Club’s continued support of young people locally is truly inspiring. It is certainly a great event and something to be looked forward to in my electorate every year. I join the Lions Club of Palm Beach-Currumbin in wishing Georgia well at the zone finals. She will be an outstanding contestant and a great achiever for the southern Gold Coast. We wish her well in the national finals this month. She will be a worthy opponent to all other competitors. MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Statements By Members

260,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (9.48 Am),"Earlier this year I had the privilege once again to beGlenelg to Adelaide Pipeline project within the electorate of Hindmarsh that was announced as part of the budget on Tuesday night-the Glenelg to Adelaide water-recycling project. The project comprises expanding the Glenelg Wastewater Treatment Plant and establishing a 30-kilometre pipeline network, which will be laid from the plant, past the Adelaide Airport, through the electorate of Hindmarsh, into the city centre and on to North Adelaide. This will free up stressed groundwater resources and the much stressed River Murray water that is now used to water our parklands and supply industry and developments in the city. I recall being lobbied in the early time of my candidature for Hindmarsh, in 1997, by the West Torrens City Council. They wanted to see this project come to fruition-in fact it was their idea. I would like to congratulate John Trainer, the current Mayor of West Torrens, and the outgoing CEO, Trevor Starr, who lobbied way back in 1997 and 1998 for this project and sought my support. This was the beginning of a great campaign to secure the future water supplies for the western suburbs of Adelaide. I held many meetings with community groups. I had meetings with the state minister for water and the then Labor shadow minister for water, Anthony Albanese, and tried to speak to the then federal minister-because this pipeline was a revolutionary idea. It was a project that would not only save water but also protect the Gulf of St Vincent by reducing the discharge of nutrients into the gulf by 50 per cent. On the face of it, pumping cleaned, useable water out to sea seemed pretty strange and wasteful when we were in a situation, as we are now, with water being in such demand. As water is becoming increasingly scarce and valuable, it should be judged on its quality and reused as much as possible. Adelaide’s water supplies need to be protected. The streets of Hindmarsh remain very dry, with water becoming a resource that many of us use ever so sparingly. The pipeline could potentially return as much as one billion litres of high-quality recycled water to irrigate the Adelaide parklands every year. With this in mind, the project seemed so logical and was only hampered by financial constraints. But I am pleased to say that, when the Rudd Labor government came to office, important projects such as this pipeline were completely supported. We wasted 10 precious years, and the development of water-saving initiatives that are so vital to the further prosperity of our nation suffered. Water is a national priority for the Rudd Labor government and will continue to be for years to come. This is a government that I am proud to be a part of and one that is planing for the future prosperity of our nation. Health: Drug Abuse Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.54 am)-We are all very well aware of the terrible toll that the abuse of legal and illegal drugs has on Australians. It is not just the deaths and the debilitated mental and physical health of drug users but the extra costs to our health, police and prison systems. Even worse is the harrowing price extracted from families and friends of addicts. Parents are driven to despair as they see sons and daughters degenerate into gaunt shadows or desperate, aggression fuelled travesties of the children they raised. The good news is that there is an amazing treatment happening in Dr George O’Neil’s naltrexone clinic in Perth.

Less than five per cent of opiate users will reuse drugs again within six to nine months of the implant. This treatment was originally used to treat heroin addiction but is now being used against other illegal drugs and to help alcoholics kick their addiction. Dr O’Neil gets funding from the Western Australian government of around $1 million but needs at least $10 million from the federal government to be able to treat all those who come to his door, many of whom are from interstate. This treatment offers the first ray of hope for drug addicts. It would also make a huge dent in the illegal drug industry, which is crippling our country financially and socially. I cannot stress too much the importance of Dr O’Neil’s work and the commitment he and his team are making on a daily basis. We should appreciate the many thousands of dollars of his own money which Dr O’Neil has already put into this amazing procedure. The clinic employs several highly qualified young people who no doubt could earn much more money elsewhere. It also has many volunteers, who do a great job in assisting Dr O’Neil in this work. Dr O’Neil’s program does not just treat the addiction but also provides postimplant counselling and short-term housing. It has given new life and hope to addicts of both legal and illegal substances and is helping save the rest of society from suffering the inevitable consequences of drug abuse. We will not just be saving millions of dollars but thousands of lives from early death and disease, and Australian families from endless trauma. I urge all members to support the funding of this truly remarkable treatment program. Budget The Rudd Labor government’s first budget has delivered on a number of election commitments for my electorate of Charlton. During the election campaign, a commitment was made to fund a GP superclinic in the Westlakes or Southlakes areas of my electorate-that is, on the western or southern side of Lake Macquarie. The funding has been allocated for the superclinics, and we will now work assiduously to develop a funding application to deliver on the clinic in the region, where there is a critical shortage of general practitioners. The current ratio of GPs to the population sits at around one to 2,000, and there is extreme need for such a commitment in the area. There are a number of other commitments that have been delivered in the budget. Another is the allocation of $118,000 for the development of a Police-Citizens Youth Club outreach program at Morisset, which we will be doing in partnership with the PCYC and the Lake Macquarie City Council. That will be extremely important for youth in the area. We are also hopeful of achieving funding for black spot treatment of the intersection of Dorrington Road and Wangi Road. I hope to be able to say something more about that in the immediate future. The budget has also provided something important for the Wallsend region of my electorate: the installation, in partnership with the Newcastle City Council, of a flood early warning system. People may recall that, in June last year, there were serious floods in the area that caused enormous property damage and dislocation. At least the installation of a flood early warning system in the area is going to provide people with the opportunity to evacuate an area, for reasons not only of safety but also of saving stock for small businesses and a number of other things, of course, in people’s homes.

My electorate has within it seven or eight coal mines and a large power generator known as Eraring Energy. The establishment of a $500 million Clean Coal Fund, which includes within it $50 million for the development of carbon capture and storage capability, is extremely important for the Hunter region. It will enable the investment in research and development to take place to try and establish improved clean coal technologies, which is extremely important for the job security of families who depend upon the coal industry within the Hunter region. These are just some of the important initiatives that directly impact upon my particular electorate. Another is the establishment of the funding for a PET scanner at the Calvary Mater Hospital in Newcastle. We are in an area where there is a high incidence of cancer, and this will be an important piece of diagnostic equipment which will help people of the region. the time for members’ statements has concluded. Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 March, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. occasion to speak to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Bill 2008 and the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. The purpose of the bills is to give effect in Australia to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, internationally known as the bunkers convention. The bunkers convention establishes a liability and compensation regime for pollution damage caused by spills of bunker oil. Bunker oil is any hydrocarbon mineral oil, including lubricating oil, used or intended to be used for the operation or propulsion of a ship. It does not refer to oil that is carried as a cargo. Bunker oils are carried by large commercial ships. They are often heavy fuel oils, which are highly persistent and viscous. They can potentially travel great distances as a result of wind and the action of currents and cause widespread contamination. Heavy fuel oils are generally not amenable to many of the clean-up techniques used for oils that float. This legislation when passed will bring into effect the bunkers convention on 21 November 2008. The bunker oil bill ratifies the international bunkers convention. Australia introduced legislation in 2001 to require ships with a gross tonnage of 400 or more entering Australian ports to have documentation on board demonstrating they have insurance coverage. However, under that legislation accountability for spills exists only if the shipowner is found to be at fault. The consequential amendments will maintain the current Australian legislation relating to ships with a gross tonnage of 400 or more without duplication of necessary certification. MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Statements By Members
263,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),Order! In accordance with standing order 193,155,Protection Of The Sea Civil Liability For Bunker Oil Pollution Damage Consequential Amendments Bill 2008
264,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (10.00 Am),"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise on thisAs the member for Kalgoorlie, I represent approximately one-third of Australia’s coastline, including the Pilbara ports of Dampier and Port Hedland. I also represent some of the most pristine coastlines in Australia and, indeed, the world. I have, according to GIO Australia, some 16,000 kilometres of coastline, most of it extremely pristine. I submit in my contribution in this House that it should be kept that way. The legislation before the House today is also supported extensively by the industry umbrella groups, Shipping Australia and the Association of Australian Ports and Marine Authorities. I was very pleased to find out when researching this legislation that all of the umbrella groups representing the shipping industry here in Australia are only too pleased to support this legislation also. They have for many years now expressed an increasing concern about the maintenance of our marine based industries, given that the livelihoods of those who occupy coastal towns and cities so often depend upon the bounty of the sea. Australia’s commitment to the ratification of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, known as the bunkers convention, through the protection of the sea bills is very important. Almost all of Australia’s international trade is carried by sea. More significantly, Australia is in fact the largest shipping nation in the world when one considers the tonnages that are sent from and arrive in Australian ports. From the earliest days, when Australia rode on the sheep’s back and wool was transported around the world, to now, when we are exporting vast tonnages of coal, iron ore and liquefied natural gas to Japan and China, ships have been a vital link in the supply chain. The Australian public are all too familiar with the sight of ships off our ports, waiting to be loaded. In some cases they are waiting too long to be loaded. I have in mind some of the coal ports of the eastern seaboard. I am pleased to compare that circumstance with the extremely efficient circumstance of the loading of iron ore vessels off the Pilbara coast, in my electorate. There it is pleasing to see half a dozen large vessels waiting to be loaded. It assures some of the larger iron ore companies in my electorate of a guaranteed supply to their overseas customers. But if you are seeing ships numbering 30 or 40 all paying demurrage then it is a very expensive view. The primary ports in my electorate are Broome, Port Hedland, Dampier and Esperance, as well as the minor ports of Wyndham, Derby and Carnarvon. Dampier and Port Hedland vie for the position of largest tonnage port in Australia from year to year. There is a very strong rivalry between those two port authorities as to who is going to knock the other off in which particular year. Currently the prize is held by Port Hedland. It seems to me that it is a reorganisation. By including smaller outlets in the greater Port Hedland harbour authority area, it seems they are going to be hard to beat in years to come. They currently have a port capacity of some 140 million tonnes per annum. Dampier has about the same. By comparison, Gladstone, on the east coast, has a capacity of about 60 million tonnes per year. Australia is not a manufacturing nation. Nearly all of our household goods come into Australia as imported goods by sea. Our refrigerators, computers, televisions and cars all come in on large sea freighters. These cargoes, on which our economy is so dependent, have almost doubled over the past decade. It is over the past decade that the previous Howard government’s shipping policies have been so encouraging of that growth. International sea freight increased from some 450 million tonnes, valued at approximately $120 billion, in 1996-97, to almost 700 million tonnes, valued at about $250 billion, in 2005-06. MAIN COMMITTEE During the past decade the Howard government took a range of initiatives aimed at reforming and enhancing the competition in the marine sector for the benefit of users of both international and domestic shipping and to ensure that shipping meets community standards in safety, marine environment protection and security. These days the area of security is more and more important. Also, the previous government took seriously the issues of marine safety and the care of the marine environment. Pleasingly, Australia has a reputation internationally for being one of the more vigilant conductors of port state control inspections. There was a succession of maritime incidents in the early 1990s, and some of those incidents occurred off and around the coastal area of my electorate. On 21 July 1991 the Kirki, as it approached Lancelin and Cervantes-a little further south than my patch-lost its bow section in fairly heavy seas and spilled a quantity of light crude. She did not go down, fortunately. With some exceptional work, a very brave young man jumped onto the deck of the Kirki and secured a line. She was put under tow and finished up in the waters off Dampiervery calm waters, perfect for the salvage operation. In fact, I was fortunate-I think fortunate is the word-to be on board the Kirki during the salvage operation. It was a time. I will not forget. Speaking of port control inspections and necessary certification in relation to ship safety, I add that the deck of the Kirki was a 25-mil plate, and an inspection of the forward section where the focsle had snapped off revealed a product like metal chantilly lace that had been rusted through in just 20 years of operation and poor inspection. After a great deal of careful and well-recorded salvage work, the Kirki’s cargo of light crude was offloaded-and a valuable cargo it was. Despite aspirations that she would become a floating storage facility somewhere in the Singapore area, the Kirki was in fact dragged up on the beach and eventually cut up for scrap steel. In February 1991, the Sanko Harvest went down off the coast near Esperance. She struck a reef and broke up, and some 700 tonnes of bunkers were lost and ended up on the beaches of the Cape Le Grand National Park. A successful clean-up operation of the foreshore continued for some nine weeks-a lot of hard work. Between January 1990 and August 1991, six bulk carriers sank after loading iron ore in northern Western Australia. We may reflect on that now in total amazement-that we could allow such a thing to happen and that many lives and valuable cargoes were lost. We have to keep in mind, when we think of the necessity for this legislation, that clean-ups are very expensive. Clean-ups that are successful are very expensive, and the clean-ups that are less successful are even more expensive because they damage for a very, very long time our marine environment. Following all of those incidents, of course, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and-at the time-Microeconomic Reform carried out an inquiry into ship safety. That was carried out, I am pleased to say, by the then member for Shortland. That was the rather famous-I think I can extend ‘famous’-Peter Morris, who was the member for Shortland from 1972 to 1998. I came in in 1998 and never had the pleasure of knowing Peter. Ms Hall-He was here yesterday. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Protection Of The Sea Civil Liability For Bunker Oil Pollution Damage Consequential Amendments Bill 2008
265,Mr Haase,"We lost the opportunity.Ms Hall-Next time. I will make sure you meet him. nal report handed down by that committee, known as the Ships of shame report, was a turning point in Australian maritime regulation and safety. I think it is perhaps why we can acknowledge that that period between January 1990 and August 1991 is now a thing of the past. Six ships going down in such a short period of time was not to be heard of after the Ships of shame report. The report recommended that Australia take a more active role in the International Maritime Organisation in promoting international solutions to ship safety issues. Acting on those unanimous recommendations, the Howard government achieved an outstanding list of changes. We realised that, to be effective, Australia needed to influence other nations, particularly flag-of-convenience states. It is apparent that all nations concerned with ship safety present a united front in progressing ship safety initiatives through the International Maritime Organisation. From the Ships of shame report came changes to legislation, and it was the 11½ years of the Howard government that ensured that this work was achieved. Some 17 acts and some 38 sets of regulations were made. Australia contributed to 51 separate amendments to International Maritime Organisation conventions and five new conventions. In 2001 the Howard government introduced the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill. This bill created offences and increased penalties in relation to oil pollution. Changes were made to legislation regarding compulsory commercial ship pilotage in and around the Great Barrier Reef. In 2005 various amendments to various pieces of maritime legislation relating to ship safety, marine environment, general maritime navigation and miscellaneous administrative matters were made. Also, amendments were made to require ships of 150 tonnes or more carrying bulk noxious liquid substances to have a marine pollution emergency plan. In 2006 the Howard government introduced the Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships) Bill 2007. The main purpose of the bill was to amend maritime pollution legislation to enable ratification of annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from ships-commonly known as periodical survey of Australian registered ships to ensure that ships are constructed in accordance with the annex VI requirements and for the issue of an International Pollution Prevention Certificate. Foreign-registered vessels are required to have certificates issued by their own flag states when visiting Australian ports. The bill also amended the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to define the operational measures required in relation to the carriage and use of fuel oil on board ships, including the sulphur content of fuel oil and fuel oil quality requirements. Limits were set on sulphur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ships’ exhausts and deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting substances were prohibited. The annex also included a global cap of 4.5 per cent on sulphur content of fuel oil. The provision of annex VI of the convention allowed for special sulphur oxide emissions control areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulphur emissions in these areas. The sulphur content of fuel oil used on board ships must not exceed 1.5 per cent. Alternative ships must fit an exhaust gas clearance system-that is, a cleaning system-or use any other technological method to limit MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Protection Of The Sea Civil Liability For Bunker Oil Pollution Damage Consequential Amendments Bill 2008
266,Mr Haase,"I recognise that interjection from the current member for Shortland. The fisulfur emissions. Both the Baltic Sea and the North Sea are designated sulfur emission control areas. This legislation was supported by the Labor government. In 2006, the Howard government amended the Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships) Act. The bill implemented changes to the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, the HAFS convention, to prohibit the use of harmful organotins in antifouling paints used on ships and additionally prevent the potential future use of other harmful substances in antifouling systems. Again, that was supported by Labor. In 2006, again, the Howard government amended the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981. The amendment made it possible for the Commonwealth to effectively respond to threats of serious marine pollution arising from maritime incidents. The bill provided greater clarity to the current terms of the legislation to ensure that those in the maritime industry know their obligations and responsibilities. It also ensured that officers of state governments and the Commonwealth are able to make confident and quick decisions in environmental emergencies. Notwithstanding the importance of this legislation, and the necessity for our marine and coastal environments to be adequately looked after, like most industries international shipping is dollar driven. The decline in quality standards of shipping vessels is a direct result of industry cost cutting from commercial pressure. Sound, strong legislation is essential to drive a responsible international performance. The Ships of shame report examined the role Australia played as a port state and the role Australia could play to influence improvements to the international marine conventions and observation of those conventions. Australia, as a developed, progressive country, needs to lead by example. The IMO-that is, the International Maritime Organisation-provides a valuable role establishing conventions and codes of conduct to regulate international shipping. IMO standards are recognised as being sufficient, as agreed by the industry. The setting up of a convention can and does take time-up to five years for a convention to be approved and then many more years to be ratified. The process is time consuming. That is why it has taken since 2002, when Australia signed the convention, until now for this ratification. The bunkers convention, as I said, will come into force on 21 November this year and, with the passing of this legislation, Australia will be part of that convention and contribute to the international example being set. Safety is of paramount importance at sea. The sea has taken far too many lives and it is necessary for ship owners and operators to be responsible for both the operating efficiency and the effect of their orders at sea, in the safety of their crew. Ratifying the bunkers convention will ensure that Australian victims of bunker oil pollution will no longer have to prove that the shipowner was at fault in order to receive compensation. Until now, shipowners have only been liable for payment of compensation if it is proven that the owner was at fault. The bunkers convention ensures that compensation is available even in the most accidental spill of bunker oil. The consequential amendments bill will ensure that there is no duplication of insurance requirements between Australia’s legislation and the bunkers convention, and amendments to the Admiralty Act 1988 will confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court and state and territory supreme courts to hear and determine matters arising under this bunker oil bill. MAIN COMMITTEE Amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 will ensure that there is no duplication of insurance requirements between that act and the bunker oil bill, in view of this act already applying to vessels 400 gross tonnes and over. Amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981 are intended to ensure that, even if the owner or master of a ship is the subject of a direction under that act, the registered owner of the ship will remain liable for compensation costs under the bunker oil bill and there will be no effect on court proceedings under the bunker oil bill. As I said, I have consulted widely with the Australian shipping industry, and the passage of these two pieces of legislation is strongly supported by all three umbrella groups representing the industry. All of those that depend on the bounty of the sea need to protect it. This legislation will further add to the protection of our marine environments, and the alternative government supports both these bills. It is very sensible legislation that I am proud to say was contributed to primarily by the previous Howard government. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.25 am)-It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Bill 2008 and the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. I would firstly like to acknowledge the comments of the member for Kalgoorlie, who recognised the enormous contribution that my predecessor, Peter Morris, has made to shipping not only within Australia but internationally. He was involved with the Ships of shame report as well as ICONS, who prepared a report into shipping from an international perspective called Ships, slaves and competition, which dealt with all those issues that have been important to shipping. I must note and would like to put on the record the fact that the current minister has given terms of reference to the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government to look at shipping-to look at some of the issues that Peter Morris raised in the past when he was chair of the transport committee and transport minister. Those issues relate to the impact that the continuing and the single permit visas have; the plight of those people that serve on ships, which over the years has contributed to the lowering of standards on ships; and the fact that we have ships of convenience sailing around our coastline here in Australia. The purpose of this legislation is to implement in Australia the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage 2001-the bunker oil convention. In accordance with the bunker oil convention, the legislation will establish a liability and compensation regime to apply in cases of a spill of bunker oil from a ship other than an oil tanker to ensure that, if there is a spill, victims of pollution damage are able to obtain prompt, adequate and effective compensation. In accordance with the bunker oil convention, the proposed legislation will provide that shipowners are strictly liable for pollution damage resulting from the escape or discharge of bunker oil from ships. Shipowners can limit their liability depending on the size of their ship. Ships with a gross tonnage greater than 1,000 will be required to be insured to cover the owner’s liability for pollution damage resulting from the escape or discharge of bunker oil and will be required to carry evidence of that insurance. Persons suffering pollution damage will have a right of direct action against the insurer. That is, they can seek compensation directly from the shipowner’s insurer rather than be required to submit the claim to the shipowner, who in some cases may have no asset other than the ship. MAIN COMMITTEE This is good legislation, and it is good legislation for the environment. The electorate that I represent in this parliament is a coastal electorate, and I understand only too well the impact that pollution can have on our vulnerable, precious coastline, the impact that pollution can have on our environment. You only have to look to the June storms last year in Newcastle to see just how vulnerable we are to maritime incidents. The Pasha Bulker was grounded during those storms in Newcastle, and at any time there could have been pollution damage resulting from the leakage of fuel oil. But because of the assistance that was available at the time-and good luck, to a large extent-that did not happen. If there had been a major incident associated with the grounding of the Pasha Bulker, this legislation would have ensured that there would be compensation. The other side to that is that having legislation like this in place makes shipowners very much aware of the fact that they must ensure, and are liable to make sure, that they take account of our environment. Shipowners will be strictly liable for the pollution damage resulting from a spill of fuel oil, which will mean that, even if a spill is an accident, the shipowner is liable. That goes to what I just said a moment ago. To ensure that shipowners are able to pay compensation for pollution damage, there is a requirement that ships over 1,000 gross tonnes be insured, and every ship entering an Australian port will be required to have evidence that it is insured. This legislation will ensure that, if again there is an incident like that of the Pasha Bulker, the ship owner is liable. Imagine if what happened with the Pasha Bulker had been worse. If ships that travel up and down our coastline, including the coastline in the Shortland electorate, do have a major incident, if they do pollute our coastline, if there is an environmental issue, then they will be liable. This legislation will ensure that Australian ships entering the ports of overseas countries are subject to the same insurance requirements as when they enter ports in Australia. The very important thing for us here in Australia is that foreign ships entering our ports will also be liable. The system that exists in Australia involves single voyage permits and continuing voyage permits and that means that those shipowners will be liable. I refer again to the legislation. This is good legislation and I am very pleased to support it. Australia) (10.32 am)-I would like to thank members for participating in the debate on the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Bill 2008 and the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. It has been a short debate but a debate of the highest quality, participated in by those members of parliament who have significant coastal trade interests and a massive interest in the safety of our coastal shipping. This legislation will provide for compensation following a spill from a ship that is not an oil tanker. Since 1970, accidents have resulted in nine significant spills around Australia from such ships. The member for Kalgoorlie mentioned the Kirki, the Sanko Harvest and the Ships of shame report. I remember as if it were yesterday watching the Iron Baron sink off the coast of Tasmania, something I remember principally because the Iron Baron was built in my home town of Whyalla in South Australia; it was one of the last ships to have been built there. Fortunately there have not been any major spills in Australia on the scale of incidents such as that of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in 1989. However, there is always the possibility that such a spill may occur. MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Marpol The Bill Added A New Part To Division 12 Of The Navigation Act 1912 To Provide For
267,Mr Gray (Brand,"Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and NorthernAustralia has a comprehensive arrangement in place to respond to an actual or threatened oil spill, but there is still the potential for significant pollution damage. We need to ensure that prompt, adequate and effective compensation is available to all victims of bunker oil spills. These bills provide for such compensation. This legislation requires ships carrying bunker oil to be adequately insured and changes the onus of proof in regard to compensation bids relating to oil spills. It complements the high safety standards applied to ships trading on the Australian coast and entering Australian ports. It was interesting to hear the member for Kalgoorlie referring to the way in which the Kirki was secured in 1991. Having spent six or so years working for an oil company, I know that that very brave young man who jumped from the tug to the Kirki would have spent the next considerable period of time, if at my old firm of Woodside, explaining himself to the occupational health and safety officers for having undertaken that act. Safety is extremely important in our maritime industries. This legislation is good news for people concerned about the risks to the environment from oil spills. It is also good news because, like all legislation before it, it has bipartisan support; it has been supported by all sides of both houses of this parliament. That shows not just great consideration by our parliament of the importance of these measures but also the deep level of interest and the ability to make safe our sea lanes for the environment and for those working in them. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 March, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

I want to say how overwhelmed I felt as I witnessed that welcome. I was a member of the Procedure Committee which reported to this House on the desirability of-and in fact firmly recommended-an Indigenous welcome to commence the proceedings of a new parliament. I am sad to say that the then Leader of the House, Mr Abbott, ignored that report and could not bring himself to respond to it for two parliaments before finally-and, I suspect, reluctantly-indicating that the governMAIN COMMITTEE",161,Marpol The Bill Added A New Part To Division 12 Of The Navigation Act 1912 To Provide For
268,Mr Price (Chifley) (10.38 Am),"Firstly, I want to record the privilege of my participament rejected the proposals contained in the report about the opening of parliament and, in particular, the Indigenous welcome. I should also place on record the feeling I had about the apology and about being a member of the parliament in the House of Representatives when the Prime Minister made that apology to the stolen generation. CouldI also, in congratulating the Prime Minister on both these events, acknowledge the important role that the Leader of the Opposition played in offering bipartisan support to both events. I must say that, without that bipartisan support, those events would have been the lesser. Deputy Speaker Schultz, as you would be aware, there was a momentous, record-breaking sitting on the first day of parliament-some 15 hours in duration-around the government’s proposals to provide for a sitting Friday. Was this something that was revolutionary and had not been seen on the continent of Australia before? That is not the case. The state the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the Manager of Opposition Business come from has had sitting Fridays since 2002. While there are some departures in important respects from the New South Wales Legislative Assembly sitting on Friday, I note for the Hansard record that the opposition leader in New South Wales, a coalition member, has announced no such policy of having question time on private members’ sitting Fridays. So, whilst for us in the Commonwealth it is perhaps a significant departure, there is at least precedent in New South Wales-the state that you, Deputy Speaker, come from too, I might add. I should also acknowledge your illustrious prior service in the legislative assembly before to coming this great House, Deputy Speaker. concerns of the opposition that led to a 15-hour sitting of the parliament on its first day? The principal concern was that there was no question time on sitting Fridays. I do not think the founding fathers would have envisaged that we would have had a proposed parliamentary sitting day devoted exclusively to private members-that is, no government business whatsoever. I do not think the founding fathers, with great respect to them, would have envisaged the dominance of the executive over the parliament itself. Certainly there is not a provision in the Constitution for private members’ sitting days, although they are constitutional-and I will get onto that. What sitting Fridays represented was a degree of generosity and reform by the Rudd government, in trying to balance up the power of the executive over private members. Who would have benefited? We would have had under those proposals committee reports being tabled in the House when it started on Friday, and then at 10 o’clock every committee member who served on the committee-in addition to any other member, for that matter-having the opportunity to give their version of that committee report. I do not apologise to this place for being one who champions the role of parliamentary committees. I value the contribution of all those who serve on parliamentary committees. It is a frustration of this place that those who do serve on parliamentary committees do not in a timely way get the opportunity to record their considerations of the issues confronting their particular parliamentary committee and why they may have recommended or not supported different proposals that went to make up the parliamentary report. So the big winners would have been those backbenchers who had served on parliamentary committees. They would have had the opportunity to present a report when there was no MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Governor General S Speech
269,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Aj Schultz),I am humbled by your kind words.,163,Governor General S Speech
270,Mr Price,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. So here was the precedent. What were thecompeting government business. Committee members and other members would have been able to go straight into the Main Committee and give their contribution the very morning that the report was tabled in parliament. The other big winner, apart from private members having more opportunities to have private members’ motions debated in the House, was the opposition shadow ministry, because they could have developed private members’ motions-may I say, perhaps designed to embarrass the government over one issue or another. They could have had their remarks recorded in the Hansard, again without any competing government business. I thought there were considerable advantages in these proposals. It is also true that, if they were not participating on private members’ Fridays, members could have devoted themselves to other aspects of their parliamentary life here or, indeed, returned to their electorates. But what were the arguments used in that record 15-hour debate? The first proposition was that the standing orders were designed to have no starting quorum. A starting quorum is a constitutional requirement for every parliamentary sitting day and you cannot actually start a parliamentary sitting day without a starting quorum. In other words, if this morning there had only been 28 or 29 members in the House, the Speaker would have been forced to adjourn the parliament. Every parliamentary sitting day requires that starting quorum and nothing in the proposals that the Leader of the House put could have given the slightest suggestion that we were trying to obviate a starting quorum. The other proposition was in relation to deferring quorums and divisions to the next sitting day. There was an interesting argument consistently presented by the opposition that somehow this was breaching the Constitution. The Manager of Opposition Business said that the dinner breaks on Mondays and Tuesdays, the other precedent for that, were consensual-that is, there was agreement that there be no divisions and no quorums. I have to say that, if something is ultra vires the Constitution, it is ultra vires whether it is consensual or not. But the Manager of Opposition Business was mistaken. That is to say that standing order 55(b) and standing order 133 permit the deferring of quorums and divisions. So there is nothing consensual about it. Any member of the House on the opposition side or the government side can within the standing orders rise during the dinner break and call for a quorum. Divisions are automatically postponed, but they certainly can call for a quorum and that quorum must be counted, but it is deferred. So there was ample precedent. It is true that the Leader of the House referred to the government obtaining a legal opinion, and much was made of the fact that the legal opinion was not tabled. I think the opposition would have had more credibility had they had a consistent track record of tabling legal advice. Of course, that was not the case. AndI will defend the clerks of the House, if I may. I do not believe that the Clerk or indeed the Deputy Clerk would, without the greatest protest and argument with the Speaker, agree to any proposition that they felt breached the Constitution. I thought it was rather sad to see the former leading law officer of the land, Mr Ruddock, the former Attorney-General, suggest that privilege was somehow at risk because of the issue of deferring quorums. CanI point out that, if the former Attorney-General were correct and even if you accept that the deferring of quorums and divisions in the dinner breaks on Mondays and Tuesdays was consensual-which is false-the alleged consensual nature of that deferment would not protect privilege. MAIN COMMITTEE Indeed, a member of the opposition did ask the Speaker about the possible loss of privilege because of the deferring of quorums and divisions on a sitting Friday. I will quote from page 829 of Hansard. The Speaker said: The Clerk is not aware of any case concerning parliamentary privilege in respect of either house which has been decided on the basis of whether a quorum had been present when words were spoken or actions taken. Standing order 54 requires that the Speaker cannot read prayersso we are talking about the commencing quorumto commence a meeting of the House unless a quorum is present. This provision will apply on scheduled sittings on Fridays. So here you have the former first law officer of the land raising an argument about privilege which is unsupported by the Speaker on the advice of the Clerk. The other point I should make is this: during the Howard government we had sittings of the Senate where there has been no question time. If question time is a requirement of accountability, why was it that the Howard government was happily sitting the Senate on Fridays? Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, you know that in past practice the House has sat on Fridays without a question time and without an MPI. And what was the device that was chosen by the former government? We have not yet used it, and I hope that we will not-that is, that we sat through a Thursday and into a Friday at the end of session but called the extended session a Thursday sitting only. We have even broken on a Thursday and reconvened on a Friday but still called it a Thursday sitting. If the passion for a question time and an MPI on Friday was so great, why did the members of the former government, the ministers of the former government and, indeed, the leaders of the House in the former government, not have a question time and an MPI on those Fridays? In conclusion, can I make a couple of points. The Rudd Labor government proposed not to decrease any question times. We still proposed to have four question times, exactly the number each week that the Howard government had. It was the same with MPIs-three MPIs a week, just as the Howard government had. But in that victory of killing off sitting Fridaysand I might observe that in the six months it has been the only thing that has unified the opposition-what have they now achieved? They do not get a private members’ day free of government time; they do not allow backbenchers to comment on parliamentary reports in a timely way. In fact, it is all being done in the evening. I referred to the leader of the Nationals, and I think he will be rising at 8.30 in the evening. I am sure that, notwithstanding his illustrious office, sadly, there will be very few media persons around to listen to proceedings. So we have killed off the opportunity of more backbenchers participating in private members’ time and we have really killed off the effectiveness of the opposition shadow parliamentary secretaries and shadow ministers to use private members’ time, as they legitimately can, to make points against the government. This has been a great victory that the opposition has had, unifying them at least on one single issue in six months and devoiding themselves long term of opportunities to make points as they should as an alternative government. Instead they must do it in the evening when everyone has gone home and no-one is interested. Personally, that is the decision that you have to live with, but I am rather sad. I am sad for the parliament, I am sad for backbenchers and really it was a pathetic effort by the opposition. MAIN COMMITTEE tance) (10.55 am)-In speaking to this address-in-reply so long after the election, I will not address my remarks, as I usually would, so comprehensively to the issues of my local area but principally respond to some matters in the budget. But I do want first to take this opportunity to thank the voters of the electorate of Fraser. I acknowledge their support; I am very grateful for their support. I accept without question that all the other things that I have the opportunity to do are dependent upon their continuing support. I have never taken it for granted, I do not take it for granted and I intend never to do so. I also take very seriously my primary obligation as a parliamentarian. I am proud to be a parliamentary secretary. I enjoy the work in executive government, the policy development and policy implementation. But all of that is secondary to the obligation I have as a member of this parliament. I enjoy being a parliamentarian and I take it seriously. BeforeI get to the principal matter that I wish to raise, which goes to the issue of development assistance, I also wish to support the remarks of the Chief Government Whip. I was out of the country on the day of the Friday sittings so I cannot comment on the detail of what took place on that day, but I have always thought that the initiative of a non-government Friday was a significant enhancement of the rights of parliament and parliamentarians. The parliament does not just serve for the executive or for the front bench of the opposition, which I have just spent much too long being on. It serves the interests of members of parliament. The Friday without government business, which gave members who did not wish to participate the right to go back to their constituency, which is a geographic reality of our huge country, but others who wish to be here the opportunity to participate, was, in my view, a significant enhancement of the rights of members to raise issues-issues of concern to them or concern to their constituency or both. That it was destroyed in the way that it was is a great pity. I hope that we may be able to come back and rescue it on a future occasion. But today I primarily want to take this opportunity to express my pride and optimism arising from the initiatives in this budget relating to the development assistance portfolio and to put them squarely within the context of the broader strategy of the Rudd government and then talk about the international context. If you look at the features of the initiatives in this budget, they are very responsible. There may be people commenting who wish we had done a lot more, and of course there is so much more to do that you cannot argue with the principle behind what they say, but we need to proceed with measured caution, consistent with efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure. So the budget accords with that responsible economic management and responsible government. It fits the budget and the Rudd government’s projection of the long term. This initiative with regard to enhanced development assistance is not about transforming our relationships overnight, although in some countries we have done so already, or about transforming the living standards of the poorest people of our region overnight; it is about a long-term perspective. It is about new priorities against the old, tired politics of division and seeking to use international issues as domestic political wedges. It is about a new way of governing, about opening ourselves up to new ideas, as flowed from the 2020 Summit and as we are trying to do through the development assistance program-opening ourselves up to more people and more comment-and it is about fresh new ideas about how we might take AustraMAIN COMMITTEE",163,Governor General S Speech
271,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser,"Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assislia forward in the world. I am very proud of the initiatives and of the governance context in which they occur. As I have said, some people have indicated that they wish we had done more-and let me quote one of the critics, not to attack them but to agree with them. Oxfam Australia are one of a number of very fine institutions doing great work in Australia’s name on behalf of the poorest people around the world, and the headline of their press release on budget night was ‘Rudd delivers on aid promises but Australia remains below international standards’. You might think I would be a bit upset about that; this is my area of responsibility and they are critical, but they are right. Both statements are correct: that we have delivered on our aid promisesand I am proud of that-but that we are starting from so far behind international standards that not only are we still behind them but after we make another increase next year and the year after, and the year after and the year after, we will still be below international standards. Oxfam say: The Rudd government has honoured its pre-election commitment and delivered a modest increase of $500 million this year in its contribution to making poverty history ... The sum of $500 million is not exactly right but it is broadly correct, and they are right: we have acknowledged-in fact, exceeded-the specific commitment we made about a first-year budget increase. But they go on to say: However, Australian aid continues to lag behind other rich countriesand that is right. The average effort of OECD countries contributing development assistance is 0.45 per cent of their gross national income. Even after this significant increase, we have got to 0.32. Let us recognise-and it is very significant when you think about the dates-that this increase to 0.32 of gross national income, so far behind international best practice as it is, is the highest level Australia has achieved since 1995-96; that is, since the last Labor budget. The government’s declared commitment, for which we are on track with this initiative, to reach 0.5 per cent of gross national income, when achieved, will be the highest level since 1974-75. It is in each instance a Labor government with an internationalist perspective and a recognition of the humanitarian significance and the national interest issues involved in commitments to development assistance that has set the benchmarks. We aspire to get back there and ultimately to go beyond it, but we are starting from such a low base. Oxfam went on to say: ... the budget will lift us off the bottom of the ladder of rich countries performance, but won’t get us anywhere near the top eight, let alone being top of the ladder as befits our leadership position in the region. I could be offended by that but I in fact support it. They are right. We are starting a long repair job. It is going to take us a long time to repair the damage that has been done, but we have started the task. I want to embed our initiative centrally within the international campaign to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. They are the international standards that the world has set for itself. The goals provide a clear vision for halving extreme poverty by 2015 and represent a unanimous intent by the international community to rid the world of poverty and improve the lives of those most in need. The milestones set down in the Millennium Development Goals provide a common focus for policy dialogue on poverty reduction efforts between developing country partners and donor countries. This helps to ensure that donor aid programs MAIN COMMITTEE remain focused on achieving reductions in poverty. We want to make a new commitment to the achievement of those goals and to contributing what we can as a proud and developed country to assist our neighbours to achieve those goals. What might have slipped past my description of the Millennium Development Goalswhich was a fairly standard, orthodox description-but which is noteworthy is that these goals are a unanimous commitment by the world community. That means Australia signed up to them. But we did virtually nothing about contributing to this outcome. I do not want to say they did nothing, because for the first years of the Howard government we did less than nothing; we went backwards. But in the latter years two positive things happened, and it would be unfair of me not to acknowledge them. One was the white paper, which had some good ideas in it and was a step in the right direction. I do not agree with everything in it; it is not the signpost to the future that this government will use, but it was a substantial and positive contribution to the debate in this country about development assistance. The second was the commitment made in 2004 that by 2010 we would double our aid budget. Given the rate of our economic growth, that actually was not a very significant contribution but it was a step in the right direction. It reversed the long-term trend of decline, and I welcomed it. But it does not change the fact that we finished the period of the Howard government behind where we started. This budget for the first time gets us back there. Let us have a look at these Millennium Development Goals. Everyone talks about the eight goals, but there are many more targets and a vast number of indicators. There are up to 18 targets and 48 indicators. I do not have time to talk about them all, and in my view they are not all equally important, but we need to have a more comprehensive look at the issues we are focusing on. At the core of it, it is about the fight against global poverty. That should be core business for Australia. Under the Rudd government it is core business for Australia in its own right. It is a fundamental obligation of a decent, developed country in the 21st century that we accept that we are part of the global campaign against world poverty. It is not a peripheral interest; it is not cause for occasional gratuitous commentary. It is core business for modern, 21st century developed countries and governments and we intend to restore Australia to that vast array-the majority of modern, Western, developed countries in the 21st centurymaking the commitment to those Millennium Development Goals. It is unashamedly in our national interest. There is no reason to apologise for the fact that, while we are doing good, we are serving our own interest. There is no reason to apologise for that. The Prime Minister himself has commented: It is in our own interests to tackle poverty in our region, as part of a wider strategy to deal with the impact of terrorism, climate change, pandemics and refugees on Australia. It is unquestionably in our national interest. That would probably be sufficient motivation to do it. But we should never lose sight of the fact that primarily it is a contemporary obligation of a modern nation to be a part of the campaign against global poverty. The second thing to recognise is that, even if we are to achieve the millennium goals by 2015-and globally we might, although regionally we will not-it is only the beginning of the task, not the end. Meeting target No.1, to ‘Reduce by half the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day’, would be a very significant achievement-and we might get there-but the obvious corollary is that half would still be left behind. We will have more to do after 2015, even if we achieve the goals. MAIN COMMITTEE As we began the task of restoring Australia’s standing and our commitment to the global goals to which we were a signatory in 2000-which we were notionally committed to for seven years, and which we are now absolutely committed to and engaged in-the Prime Minister committed us to the global call to action for the Millennium Development Goals. On his most recent trip, we joined that MDG call to action to galvanise widespread support, momentum and concrete action for the Millennium Development Goals. We are committed to it, and it fits within the context of our broader foreign policy, where we have the three pillars: the US alliance, our Asia-Pacific regional focus and our commitment as a good international citizen to multilateralism. The last two of those three pillars lead us to the Millennium Development Goals and to setting ourselves on the path to increase our development assistance from 0.3 to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015. That will take us in this budget to 0.38 per cent-approximately $5 billion-by 2011-12. We are at about 0.36 per cent this year and we have scheduled in this budget close to a 50 per cent increase, to be achieved by 2011-12. That is a big opportunity and a big responsibility. I will talk about the budget measures in detail in this House and outside subsequently; today I want to emphasise that we have made this commitment because, as a government, we think the goals set down and adopted by the international community, including Australia, in the year 2000 remain valid today. We acknowledge that in the Pacific no country is on track to achieve all of those goals and at least one is not on track to achieve any of those eight goals. So we, as a nation in our region and the leading country in the Pacific, have failed, and it is time we acknowledged it directly and took seriously the task of remedying that failure. These are not extreme propositions: eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women; reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV-AIDS, malaria, TB and other diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a global partnership for development. This is not a revolutionary framework. This is about core common decency, applied internationally. Our government will take a strategic approach to the entrenched causes of underdevelopment and instability, particularly in our region. We want Australia to become a leader in the fight against global poverty. We strongly support the millennium goals and our government is committed to helping developing countries achieve them. As I said before, on his recent trip Prime Minister Rudd announced that Australia has joined the MDG call to action-at last-to galvanise widespread support, momentum and concrete actions for the Millennium Development Goals. An important part of this will be an increased emphasis on basic education and on improving water and sanitation services. These are both focuses of the initiatives and funding allocation in this year’s budget. We have, for example, committed to increase funding for water and sanitation by $300 million over two years from 2009-10. In this budget, sectoral increases are targeted very directly at the core Millennium Development Goals. Education programs are estimated to increase by five per cent to over $540 million; health programs are estimated to increase by eight per cent to over $440 million; expenditure on environment and climate change is estimated to increase by seven per cent to over $130 million; rural development expenditure-an area I think we will need to give more attention in future-is estimated to increase by seven per cent to over MAIN COMMITTEE $160 million; and infrastructure assistance will be substantially scaled up to an estimated $380 million, an increase of 17 per cent. It is not just about money; it is not only about making the program bigger but about making it better. But I am very proud that this 2008-09 budget lays the foundation for implementing the government election commitment to increase Australia’s official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015-16. It is a building block in the government’s scaling up of Australia’s development assistance, with a projected nine per cent real increase in total ODA over the 2007-08 budget figure. The budget includes a package of new measures designed to take forward the government’s development assistance priorities. In particular-a source of great pride to me-the budget gives effect to our election commitments about climate change, about eliminating avoidable blindness in this region and about improving access to clean water and sanitation. I am proud of the initiatives in the program. I am proud of the context in which they have taken place and I commit the government to an increasing focus on achieving the Millennium Development Goals. TodayI would like to use the first part of my address to express my deepest regret and sorrow on the passing of two public figures, and very important people to me, in the Northern Territory. They were people I knew well and both were very good friends. The first person I want to refer to is Frances McKechnie. I knew Frances for a long time-certainly for the last 25 years-and she was a very dear friend to me. It was extremely saddening to hear of the passing. Her funeral was held yesterday at the Uniting Church in Alice Springs. She devoted her life to social work in the Territory communities and rural Australia more broadly. She had a stronger affinity with the pastoral sector and the Indigenous people of outback Australia. Frances was originally from Victoria’s Western Districts-Port Fairy. After completing year 10 at Camperdown High School she decided to train to become a deaconess in the Presbyterian Church at Rolland House in Carlton in Melbourne. Her brother Jack recalls asking Frances what made her decide to be a deaconess. At a Presbyterian fellowship camp at Warrnambool, Frances and others were sleeping in a church hall on palliasses. During the night she awoke and her eye was drawn to an unusually bright light in a stained-glass window. On the window were the words ‘Follow me’. Without flinching, Frances took the words to heart and decided to serve God as a deaconess. In her training she specialised in teaching and social work. She was posted firstly to Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, where she stayed for nine years, before moving to Warrnambool for 11 years. In 1968 she took up a position in the Melbourne office of the Australian Inland Mission, an organisation she gave over 40 years of her working life to. She worked primarily in the field of children’s and women’s services. In the course of her work she travelled extensively around outback Australia, from the Pilbara, the Kimberley, to Cape York, western Queensland and northern South Australia. Her love of the Territory brought her back to Alice Springs in an active retirement which included seven years as chaplain in St Philip’s College. Frances was the college’s first chaplain and the author of the college prayer. So great was the school’s respect for her that McKechnie House, a boarding house for rural students, was named after her. She worked tirelessly all her public life and in public life. She served on a number of committees in Alice MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Governor General S Speech
272,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (11.16 am)Springs which reflected her interest in and concern for social justice and the preservation of the history of Central Australia. These included the National Trust, the Old Timers, and the Older Australians Advisory Committee, which was established by Carmen Lawrence as Minister for Human Services and Health in the Keating government in 1994-96. Frances was also President of the Alice Springs Branch of the Australian Labor Party and a life member of the Northern Territory Labor Party. She was a regular and very much welcomed attendee at ALP and government functions right up until the last few months before her passing. She was a great friend to me in her role in the party and a great contributor to discussions about the issues of the day. She was a very important person in the life of the Alice Springs Labor Party community. She was chairperson of the Adelaide House Management Committee, which has responsibility for keeping historical records of the first hospital in Alice Springs, built by the Reverend John Flynn. Frances was deeply committed to the Central Australian community and lived out her retirement years in a place very dear to her heart. ‘I love the place and the climate,’ she said. ‘Where do you get a retirement village like this?’ Frances said of the Old Timers nursing home in Alice Springs, where she lived in a quiet self-contained unit, a unit in which we passed some time sharing stories, having cups of coffee and a little natter. It is with great sadness that we must say farewell to this great and gracious lady. The second person that I wish to pay tribute to this morning is Dr Marika. Dr Marika was a Yolgnu woman of the Rirratjingu clan, Yirrkala, in north-eastern Arnhem Land. She was an extraordinary woman who devoted her life to education and to bridging the gap between the English-speaking mainstream and her own society. I knew Dr Marika well. For more than 30 years I visited north-eastern Arnhem Land and watched her become an important and respected community leader. She helped to found the land management group Dhimurru, which applied the practices which Yolgnu people have employed since time immemorial. Her life was not an easy one. She overcame cancer in her early 20s and was troubled by heart problems. Despite this adversity, she was never happier than when she was retelling the traditional stories of her community or going through the details of the clan systems of north-eastern Arnhem Land. She could compare their insights with the ideas current in the Western world. She had truly a two-way vision. The number of people who have paid tribute to Dr Marika is testament to not only how much of a public figure she was but also how well liked she was. I was particularly moved by the words of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, who commented that Dr Marika was the embodiment of reconciliation. Her genuine commitment to her people, particularly through improving the education and reconciliation, was recognised through her 2006 title of Territorian of the Year and last year’s title of NT Australian of the Year. It is a comfort to know that she spent her final days with her family in the stringy-bark forests of her country. Dr Marika was a truly brilliant Australian whose talent, dedication and passion will be sorely missed and forever remembered. On a happier note, today marks the 80th birthday of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, which has consistently provided a vital lifeline to Territorians and others in remote areas. On this day in 1928, the very first flying doctor flight took off from Cloncurry to answer a call for help from the remote town of Julia Creek. On board the single-engine de Havilland, the Victory, was the very first flying doctor, Dr Kenyon St Vincent Welch, and the first flying doctor MAIN COMMITTEE pilot, Captain Arthur Affleck. The Victory had the most basic instruments and no radio. On that day, the Reverend John Flynn’s extraordinary vision-I referred to Reverend Flynn in terms of Adelaide House and the work that Frances McKechnie was doing in Alice Springsto alleviate the isolation and suffering of people living the harsh outback life became a reality and a quintessential part of the fabric of Australia. In 2008, we celebrate not only Reverend John Flynn’s dream but the incredible technological advances in medicine, aviation and communications which have allowed the Flying Doctor Service to bring the bush and coastal cities closer. We also celebrate the spirit of Australians whose courage continues to inspire the RFDS to provide excellence in aeromedical and primary healthcare across Australia. We must acknowledge the professionalism and the dedication of those who worked for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, because it is without doubt that they have delivered life-saving treatment to many Australians over the period since the twenties. Without that sort of creative volunteerism, which stimulated the first royal flying doctors’ efforts, there is no question in my mind that our community would be far worse off. So, to those people who are currently engaged and employed by the RFDS, I say ‘thank you’ for your continuing service. Recently this Australian parliament did something which I did not think it would ever do. The 13th of February was a momentous and memorable occasion and a long time in the making. This was the day that the apology was given by the Prime Minister to the stolen generations. Much work remains to be done, of course, after the apology, but there are clear undertakings that the government has made-and Tuesday’s budget demonstrates our commitment to those undertakings-to improve health, education and employment outcomes for Indigenous Australians wherever they might live. The Indigenous health summit held in this place in March was a timely reminder of this. Over 40 Indigenous groups and national bodies converged to pledge, along with the government, to campaign for Indigenous health equality. Again, Tuesday’s budget demonstrates our commitment to that pledge. The apology was an extremely important milestone in our nation’s history and a very important gesture which carried great meaning for all of those affected by the policies of past governments. As we know, we cannot erase the record of the past; however, we can acknowledge our past failures, express sincere regret and work towards establishing a better future. It may come as some surprise that something has gone unreported, at least to date, in the Australian media-that is, the apology currently before the United States congress to its indigenous people. On 26 February this year, not two weeks after the apology in this place, the US Senate passed the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007. The ostensible purpose of this bill is to improve access to health care for Native Americans. It would boost programs of the federally funded Indian Health Service, prompt new construction and modernisation of health clinics on reservations and attempt to recruit more Indians into health professions. Importantly, attached to this bill is an apology amendment moved by a Republican senator from Kansas, Sam Brownback. The stated purpose of the amendment is: To acknowledge a long history of official depredations and ill-conceived policies by the United States Government regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States. I believe it is worth observing some of the content of this proposed US apology, especially in light of the recent apology here in Australia. It is quite comprehensive-in fact, very detailed. MAIN COMMITTEE It begins by recognising the ancestors of the Native Americans as inhabitants of the land of the present-day United States ‘since time immemorial and for thousands of years before the arrival of peoples of European descent’. It speaks of their ‘powerful spiritual connection’ to the land and their ‘deep and abiding belief in the creator’ as reflected through their customs and legends. It goes on to detail actions the federal government took against American Indians, including violations of treaties with Indian tribes; the forced removal of Indians from their traditional homelands; attempts to assimilate children through their forcible removal; armed confrontations and massacres such as those at Sand Creek and Wounded Knee; condemnation of Indian traditions, beliefs and customs; and unlawful acquisition of tribal land and theft of tribal resources and assets. It recognises that there have been years of official depredations, ill-conceived policies and the breaking of covenants by the federal government regarding Indian tribes. The amendment goes on to apologise: ... on behalf of the people of the United States to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by citizens of the United States. It expresses: … regret for the ramifications of former wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive relationships of the past and present to move toward a brighter future where all the people of this land live reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward and protect this land together; … It also: … urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the United States against Indian tribes in the history of the United States in order to bring healing to this land … This is clearly a statement with content and an apology which would be welcome amongst American indigenous peoples. The bill is currently at a committee stage in the lower house and may not come up for debate for a number of weeks or months. I think that, although this particular apology, unlike the one in Australia, is words on paper-little more than a footnote to an appropriations bill-as far as apologies go, it does not meet the standards we have here in Australia. Nevertheless, it is an extremely important starting point. It has always been a thing of interest to me that the US government has acknowledged that its policies of the past have had a detrimental effect on its indigenous people. As yet there has not been an official apology made by the government to the Native American people. This bill, which will appear before the congress in the near future, represents an important opportunity to say ‘sorry’, and I hope that that course is followed. As in the Australian instance, it does not sideline the importance of improving substantive outcomes. This is always the primary focus. But an apology, as we have discovered in this country, is an important step. Its role is not to wipe the slate clean, to forget the past and move on; it is to recognise the misdeeds and misgivings of the past and to act as a pledge to work together towards a reconciled future. What many people have failed to understand over the past decade has been the emotional harm that has been caused in this country by the refusal to say ‘sorry’. On the face of it, it is a simple act, described in denigrating terms by some as merely a symbolic action. For many of the stolen generations in this country, it is much more than this. We saw clear evidence of that on the day of the apology in this place. The refusal to apologise previously had amounted to a denial of the life experience of many of the stolen generations. They have not been able to tell their story in order to heal. MAIN COMMITTEE In less than two weeks, on 26 May, Australia will again pause and reflect for National Sorry Day. As much as it is a day for looking back, it is also a day for looking forward to the future and working towards a reconciled Australia. I have to say, though, that I think the national apology here in Australia has given great encouragement to the peoples of the world. I know from the observations which have been made by colleagues here who have travelled to international fora-and, indeed, by the Prime Minister; it is an issue which has been raised with him by heads of state-that it has been a major issue for discussion with them. It is a matter of pride that I can stand here as a member of the Australian Labor Party and a member of this government to say that I was part of that process and to say that here we all sat in this place as part of that apology. I hope that we will see the same thing in the congress of the United States some time in the near future. But I have to say that, in my own communities, the impact of the apology cannot be underestimated. That is the thing. For many of us it is an abstract notion, but the reality is that, for those who were the subjects of the apology, it is not an abstract notion. In the meetings I have had with people over many years about this issue, there was no question about the very real pain and hurt that people have suffered as a result of previous government policies. To be part of a process where this parliament apologises to those people in a bipartisan way-and I commend the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition parties-has indeed been a great privilege. the beginning of last December is committed to building a modern Australia for the 21st century. In doing so, there are many areas in which this government has had to make up for the neglect, complacency or mistakes of its predecessors. In the short time that Labor has been in office, we have made rapid progress in addressing many of those issues, including the measures announced in this week’s budget by the Treasurer. In the Governor General’s speech at the opening of this parliament, he highlighted the importance of a new productivity agenda to the country’s long-term economic prospects, and it is productivity that I want to speak about today. Increased productivity is the key to generating economic growth without the disastrous consequences of rising inflation. Yet for all of the rhetoric about responsible economic management from the former Howard government, productivity growth was woeful under its watch. The Prime Minister outlined this disastrous record in a speech some time ago to a business leaders’ forum at the Queensland University of Technology. Productivity growth had averaged 3.3 per cent a year in the five years up to 1998-99. In the following five years to 2003-04 it fell by one-third to 2.1 per cent a year, and now it is running at just 1.1 per cent a year. This is just one-third of the rate that the Howard government inherited from Labor in 1996. This collapse in productivity growth has been a major contributor to rising inflationary pressures in Australia, and among the main reasons for the decline have been the failures to invest in human capital, technology and infrastructure-failures to invest at a time when we had unprecedented budgetary opportunities from the proceeds of the current resources boom. Government spending certainly increased under the previous government, to unprecedented levels in fact, but very little was directed at addressing the constraints in our economy, including lifting productivity. As the Business Council of Australia notes in its 2008-09 budget submission: MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Governor General S Speech
273,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (11.35 Am),"The new Labor government that came into office atOf the $87 billion per annum that economic prosperity has delivered as windfall revenue to Canberra since 2002, all but $2 billion has been spent on income tax cuts and new spending. At the same time, despite high commodity prices giving us the best terms of trade in more than 50 years, export growth over the past decade has fallen to half the rate of the decade before. Our current account deficit has reached record levels and foreign debt exploded threefold during the term of the Howard government. The need to redirect the proceeds of the resources boom into the future productive capacity of the Australian economy could not be clearer, and the Rudd Labor government is rising to that challenge. Skills Australia has been established to lead an integrated response to the skills crisis, and the government is committed to creating an additional 450,000 training places over the next four years. Secondary schools are being invited to apply for funding for the construction of new trades training centres. I am pleased to report that I have initiated discussions with the seven secondary schools in my electorate about how their allocations of this fund can best be deployed to make Bendigo a shining example of modern trades education. To provide national leadership on infrastructure development-including transport, energy, communications and water infrastructure-legislation establishing Infrastructure Australia has passed through the parliament and its inaugural chairperson has been announced. An expert panel has been appointed to assist the private sector proposals for building the national broadband network and construction is planned to start by the end of the year. For the first time in Australia’s history, the federal government, a Labor government, has taken a national leadership role in planning for our long-term infrastructure requirements. At the end of the day this country’s future prosperity depends on our meeting the challenges of globalisation, and all of the government’s initiatives that I have outlined will contribute to that goal. But if we are going to respond to these challenges we need all of our businesses, large and small, to be world class. Unfortunately, the Australian Industry Group’s World class skills for world class industries study of 2006 shows that Australian industry is not yet world class, and not world class by a long way. This is not only the opinion of some academic or consultant but the view of the industry itself. Only 18 per cent, less than one in five, of more than 500 businesses surveyed by AiG say that they are currently world class. While this result is disappointing, it is encouraging that at least many do recognise the need to lift their game. Of those firms that are not already world class, 85 per cent thought it was important for them to become so in the next three years. So the imperative is clear. There are, however, real questions about how Australian businesses become world class. How can we as a nation best invest to position ourselves for survival and prosperity after the current resources boom? It is essentially Australian management who must step up to the plate. While it is appropriate for us to celebrate the achievements of the few Australian businesses that are succeeding on the world stage, we must be ruthlessly realistic about the performance of Australia’s managers. We have to question, for example, why this country has almost no global leader in any market except for the resources industry and some niche sectors in the financial services industry. Where are our world-class manufacturing companies? Where are our world-class information technology companies? The Sydney Morning Herald reported in March that at the CeBIT conference in Hanover, which is the largest information technology fair in the world, just five exhibits out of 5,800 were from Australian companies. MAIN COMMITTEE This was less even than from New Zealand and hardly the representation one would expect from what is supposed to be the clever country. So what is world class when it comes to business? A 2001 study by Dr Darryl Hull and Vivienne Read at the University of New South Wales found that excellent Australian workplaces are characterised by world-class performance, competitiveness and innovation. But being world class means more than maximising short-term profits, more than high returns to shareholders. A fundamental tenet of Western capitalism is the free market, a market where competition and the threat of oblivion produce economic growth and increasing prosperity for all. But unfortunately, despite their rhetoric, many of those who are responsible for making capitalism work-business owners, board directors and executive management-do not much like the idea of a competitive marketplace. In fact, they spend much of their time working to dominate or eliminate any competitors. Why? Because they can make more profit if they operate in a market that is a duopoly or oligopoly than they can if there is real competition. More profit means higher dividends, a booming share price for investors and bigger bonuses for fat cat executives and directors. One of the many problems of oligopolies is that they allow managements to get lazy. They forget how to innovate, they forget how to get the best out of their people and they forget how to compete. They are anything but world class. Unfortunately, many Australian industries are just duopolies or oligopolies, and we have to ask ourselves if this contributes to our lack of world-class companies and our woeful export performance, particularly in manufactured goods. Australia’s businesses have to make some fundamental changes to the way they operate and manage their people, not least because of the changing nature of work in advanced economies. For example, Professor Frank Levy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Professor Richard Murnane from Harvard University predict that future employment growth will be dominated by jobs that they refer to as ‘expert thinking’and ‘complex communication’. These are jobs requiring creativity, design, problem solving and innovation and involving more face-to-face communication. They predict that there will be little or no growth in repetitive manual jobs in developed countries. Professor Richard Florida, a United States economist, estimates that what he describes as the ‘creative sector’, which includes these expert thinking and complex communication jobs, grew from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the US workforce in the period 1980 to 2002. These trends mean that Australia can no longer rely on being able to perform simple unskilled jobs as competitively as developing countries. These include routine manual jobs, such as in call centres or in routine software coding, as well as those that follow well-defined rules, such as assembly-line manufacturing. These jobs have declined considerably in advanced economies and they are always highly vulnerable to automation, outsourcing and offshoring. Indeed, a 2005 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that up to 19 per cent, almost one in five, Australians were employed in jobs vulnerable to offshoring. In this global environment the organisations that will be successful are those that look after their people and ensure that their working environments foster and reward creativity, new ideas and risk taking. The research by Dr Hull and Ms ReadI referred to earlier, which incidentally was funded by the Business Council of Australia, tried to identify the very factors that distinguished ‘excellent’ workplaces from ‘very good’ workplaces. They concluded that quality working relaMAIN COMMITTEE tionships are the central pivot on which excellent workplaces are founded. They found that in all excellent workplaces there was an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. They said: We became convinced ... that to produce quality work in Australia, one must have quality working relationships ... which requires constant renewal and reaffirmation by all parties. They said that these relationships are underpinned by ‘trust, respect, self-worth and recognition’ and that the fundamental importance of trust ‘couldn’t be over-estimated’. Importantly, and fortunately, there is no magic in this. They say that the characteristics of excellent workplaces are ‘identifiable, quantifiable and manageable’. They found that management practices that promote respect, recognition and self-worth directly impact on business performance. They found that workplace leaders in excellent organisations, whether supervisors, team leaders or more senior managers, were aware of the impact that their behaviour has on the way people feel about the workplace and their job. Of course, all this people management stuff is a bit too touchy-feely for some of our more macho managers who are driven solely by the bottom line. Current accounting standards must share some of the blame for this situation. How many times do we read in annual reports that a company’s greatest assets are its people? Yet, when we turn to read its balance sheet, there are plenty of assets listed but no human ones. In fact, every dollar that a company spends on hiring, training and improving the capabilities of its employees is reported as a cost, not as an investment in its most important asset. It is no wonder that managers spend so much time trying to reduce the cost of their people and it is no wonder that training and a whole range of people management spending are among the first things to go when a company is trying to cut costs. This accounting treatment also leads to poor public policy. The Howard government’s Work Choices legislation, which was so strongly pushed by our peak business bodies, was clearly designed to reduce the cost of labour to Australian business in a short-sighted attempt to compete with labour costs in developing countries-an unnecessary attempt, according to a recent study by KPMG. Despite all the bleating from the big end of town about the cost of operating in Australia, KPMG found that we are one of the least costly locations in the industrialised world in which to do business. Their 2008 competitive alternatives survey found that Australia is already ranked fourth in terms of competitiveness after Mexico, Canada and the US. And, what is more, there is less than one per cent separating Australia from being the second cheapest place in the world to do business. So further driving down wages is not what this country should be looking to in order to increase business profitability. There is ample evidence that increases in both productivity and profitability are best achieved by better management of the workforce. In fact, research from the UK has found that there is a greater payback from improved human resource management than from giving more attention to business strategy or to product quality or to new technology or even to research and development-and Australian employees know when they are not being well managed by their bosses. Research released in March this year by recruitment consultants Hudson shows significant gaps between what workers want and what employers offer. More than one in two employees are currently thinking about changing jobs or are ready to walk out the door. In my own state of Victoria, two-thirds of employees are dissatisfied in their current role and are thinking about taking or are ready to take a new job. This is why I believe that, if Australian business is going to be world class, it has to be world class in the management of its human resources. MAIN COMMITTEE I have already given notice of my intention to move a motion in private members’ business to this effect. I will be proposing: ... the establishment of a National Commission for Workplace Innovation and Excellence that will, in conjunction with the business community, trade union movement, professional associations and education providers: (a) identify workplace factors that positively impact on workplace innovation, excellence and productivity including human resource management practices and organisational culture; (b) develop policies that promote workplace innovation, excellence and productivity including best practice models, codes of practice, awareness programs, business exchanges and awards; and (c) support research, management education and training in conjunction with higher education providers and professional associations. I would like to take a few minutes at this point to acknowledge the research on this subject conducted by my late chief of staff and good friend, Richard Clarke. Richard tragically and unexpectedly passed away last month at the young age of 50. He was an inspiration to all who knew him. That is a cliche perhaps, but in Richard’s case it is definitely a true one. He spent most of his working life striving to make things better for others. Selflessly, and seeking no accolades for himself, he succeeded in that objective and improved the lives of thousands of people. Whether it was those with mental illness, whose plight he was strongly committed to, or designing and implementing a pioneering workplace agreement, his paramount concern was for the well-being of his fellow human beings. Richard drew on a wealth of experience from his work as a ministerial adviser to former Victorian health ministers Tom Roper, David White and Maureen Lyster and later as a senior health administrator both here in the ACT and in Victoria. He served on the board of management of the Bendigo Base Hospital in the late 1980s and later again as a director of Bendigo Health. He believed strongly that substantial increases in productivity followed from enriching the working environment for employees, and his groundbreaking work at the Casey Hospital is just one example of this. He wanted to understand how differences in relations between employers and employees distinguished the world’s outstanding corporations and government agencies from those that are merely successful. He was convinced that Australia’s national productivity and profitability can be significantly improved by identifying these differences. Richard was acknowledged as a successful change management practitioner and was highly regarded by both employer organisations and trade unions. He understood more than most the need for continual change in workplace practices, as our national economy responded to increasing globalisation. Not for Richard the pointless industrial disputes that left only one side still standing. He was far more interested in the practices that resulted in everyone being better off than they were before and constantly striving for the win-win scenario. Richard Clarke was not just a visionary manager but a good friend for almost 30 years, and I will miss him greatly. In conclusion, the election of the Labor government provides the opportunity for new thinking about Australia’s economic performance, for new thinking about what our businesses-both large and small-need to do if we are to be competitive in the global market and maintain a high standard of living for all Australians and for new thinking about how we should manage our most vulnerable resources, our people. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (11.53 am)-At the outset, I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land upon which we stand, the Ngunawal people, as well as the traditional owners of the land of my electorate of Chisholm, the Wurundjeri-their elders past and present. One of the most outstanding parts of coming back to this parliament was definitely the welcome to country ceremony performed in this great parliament building. It was an honour and privilege to be part of that after so many years, and it was an incredibly moving ceremony. It was an honour to be part of not only the sorry apology, which I think got an inordinate amount of attention, but the opening of parliament the day before. The very moving and I think poignant ceremony of welcome to country is something that we should all treasure for a long time. It was too long in coming. I would like to acknowledge at the outset also my great appreciation to Professor Joy Murphy, one of the elders of the Wurundjeri clan, who did a welcome to country to my office when I took possession of it some 10 years ago. We did not have the smoking ceremony because we thought that DOFA would not appreciate us setting fire to a newly acquired electorate office, but we certainly did go through the ceremony of welcome to country. It was a very moving experience and one that I would really like to encourage, if members have not held one in their own electorate offices, as something that they can do to connect with their communities. gardless of what the numbers now say. Chisholm is a great place to represent and probably not associated hugely with an Indigenous community, being in metropolitan Melbourne, but there is an Indigenous metro community, who we often overlook, whose issues are often put aside and ignored. Professor Joy Murphy of the Wurundjeri clan ensures that we remember that there are metropolitan Indigenous communities that we need to respect and we need to think about, and we need to look at their specific plight. So it was indeed an honour to be part of that process when this parliament was formally endorsed at the beginning of the year. I would like to finally put on the record my great appreciation of the terrific people of Chisholm, who have again bestowed upon me the honour of being their local member. I do feel like the address-in-reply debate has been a long time coming, so I am feeling a little silly that it is now months down the track and I am doing it. But, now that I have the role of Deputy Speaker, actually getting a chance to speak is fairly difficult. So it is with great joy and pride and honour that I can say that I have had the privilege to be elected again to this House. This is my fourth term. I am now the longest serving member-it did not take long to be the longest serving Labor member for the seat of Chisholm, but I am actually now one of the longest serving members for the seat. It is a great honour indeed. Certainly the first member for Chisholm was there for a very long time, but I have now outdone the time of my predecessor, Michael Wooldridge, within the seat of Chisholm. He swapped seats at the 1998 election when I first ran. It is a great honour to have that privilege bestowed on me. When I first ran for parliament back in 1998, I distinctly remember saying at the time to my husband: ‘It’s all right; I won’t win. I’m standing. I’m going to fly the flag for the ALP. I’m going to do my bit as a good local member, having grown up and lived in the seat all my life and having association with it, but don’t worry; I won’t win.’ Lo and behold, Dr Michael MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Governor General S Speech
274,Mr Melham,It has kept you safe for the last 10 years!,179,Governor General S Speech
275,Ms Burke,"It has kept me safe for the last 10 years in what is a very marginal seat, reWooldridge swapped seats, and I had to ring my husband and say: ‘You know how we had the renovation plans? Perhaps we need to put those on hold.’ Ten years later, I am still here. Not only this time, winning was a great joy, but to finally be part of government is indeed a great honour and something that I have been looking forward to for a great long time. A change of government has happened on just six occasions in the past 60 years, so it was indeed a momentous occasion. Clearly there was a mood of change. There was certainly a mood of change within my electorate. Within my electorate, climate change was the No. 1 issue on people’s minds, followed closely by health and education. So there certainly was a mood out there, and it was a thrill to be part of government. Since elected in 1998, I have spent 10 long years in opposition, which, whilst a great apprenticeship, was a tad tedious and incredibly frustrating. But now starts the hard work of government. Everybody keeps saying, ‘What’s government like?’ I say, ‘Well, it was really easy in opposition; you just blame the other side.’ Government is actually much harder, a greater responsibility but a great joy to be part of because now we can actually drive. We can bring through the change, and I do not have to sit there feeling frustrated with a Howard agenda, which I was totally opposed to on so many fronts. I would like to thank all those in the Chisholm campaign who ensured I got here: my local branch members for their unstinting faith; my family, friends and committed locals, who are great supporters of the Labor Party but will not join; and particularly the Young Labor volunteers who were out there in force. Indeed, my staff-Fiona, Jason, Rick, Janet, Louise-and those who came on board during the campaign-Paul, Liana, David, Di and Raff-were all of tremendous support and help. I would like to particularly offer my thanks to Kerry Piva, who came and volunteered full time for the campaign. She was there day and night without a single pay and then turned up on election day with her husband and son to hand out all day for me. It is the likes of Kerry that make campaigning worthwhile, and I really did appreciate her help. I need to thank my family: the endearing Steve, who makes it all worthwhile and achievable, because without him I just could not do it, and Madeleine and John, who already know what it is like to letterbox and to hand out-they are my greatest fans and my greatest supporters. Mind you, at the last election Madeleine did say to me that she did want me to lose, because she had worked out that, if I lost, Mummy would not be so busy. This time around, John, who was five at the time, was getting very concerned about all the posters, because I was pictured standing next to Kevin Rudd. John looked at me very seriously and said, ‘Mummy, how long are those posters going to be up for?’ I said: ‘Till after the election. It’s two weeks off-two swimming lessons away.’ He said, ‘I’m getting very worried. People will think you are married to that man, Mama.’ So here he was very concerned that people in the electorate were thinking that I was married to Kevin Rudd and not to Daddy-the things that go through your children’s minds. They are fantastic human beings and I need to thank them for all their great support. I need to thank my mum, Joan, who not only babysat but sat for numerous hours on the pre-poll, and my dad, Bernie, who also sat on the pre-poll and convinced everybody in his new accommodation that they had to vote for me. It was the first time in that home that my vote went up. I think he badgered them all into voting for me personally. I thank my brothers and sisters-Tony, Nina, Sophie and Paul-and their respective spouses and children, who MAIN COMMITTEE also all had to letterbox and hand out on voting day. As most of them actually live in the electorate, they also had to vote for me. I want to say thank you to them. I also want to put on the record my great thanks to the numerous volunteers out there, particularly Howard and Marie Hodgins; Joan and George Edwards, who were not as out and about as much because of their ill-health but were certainly there; Adele Mach, the world’s greatest letterboxer; Allen Clausen; Peter Chandler; John Burke; David and Lorie Werner, who are the backbone of many of our campaigns; Kirsta Durham; Kathleen Brasher; and Senator elect Jacinta Collins, who I had out doorknocking, which I did assure her was going to help her in her senatorial candidacy. She did not believe me, but nevertheless she was out there doorknocking. I thank all the state members within my electorate, who gave terrific support and assistance, and I thank their staff as well. To all those in Bob’s and Ann’s office: it is always a joy to work with you, and I thank you very much. It was a terrific occasion. I also want to welcome and express my appreciation to the member for Deakin, Mike Symon, who has been brought into our fold. It was terrific to work with Mike’s campaign and it is lovely now to have a neighbour in the eastern suburbs bordering my electorate. To Mike and his team, congratulations on a terrific win. It was an amazing effort. They worked incredibly hard and they worked an amazing community campaign with all the local residents out there. I am proud that this is a government that has already apologised to the stolen generation, which the Howard government refused to do. I am proud that this government has already ratified the Kyoto protocol, which the Howard government refused to do. I am proud that this government has brought down a budget that is friendly to working families and aims to restore the balance that was lost during the Howard years. All election promises made by the Rudd Labor government have been honoured within this budget. I do not think too many governments before could make that claim. This is significant, because past governments have not always followed through on election funding promises. As the Governor General said in his speech at the opening of the parliament on 12 February this year, this is a government that is ‘committed to bring a fresh approach to governing’ and that ‘has a vision for Australia’s long-term future’. This includes listening to and consulting the Australian people and being up-front with them on the problems it can solve and those it cannot. It also means actually tackling problems that need solving, and doing the hard work-not putting them in the too-hard basket and hoping that by ignoring them they will go away. Compared to the previous government’s arrogance and lack of an evidence based approach to problem-solving, this is a breath of fresh air. My constituents overwhelmingly wanted a government that would listen to them and address the problems of concern to them: climate change, health and education. They voted against a government that sat on its hands in relation to climate change, pulled millions of dollars out of the public health system and let our universities go to rack and ruin because it did not have the foresight to invest in them. They voted against a government that would not invest enough in education to create the skilled workers who we now so desperately needand now we are paying with higher inflation and higher interest rates. The Howard government had no long-term vision and people were tired of having the wool pulled over their eyes. The Rudd government has wasted no time in going to work on these problems, with the aim of building a modern Australia capable of meeting the challenges of the future. MAIN COMMITTEE The very successful 2020 summit held in Canberra was a sign of the government’s intention not only to consult but to consider new ideas for Australia’s long-term future. Parliament House literally became the people’s house for a weekend, where delegates from all walks of life and all parts of Australia came to voice their opinion. People were delighted that the government finally wanted to hear what they had to say and, more importantly, take note and act on those ideas. Locally, a 2020 summit for the south-eastern and eastern regions of Melbourne was held at Monash University, in my electorate, in April this year, with the six local Labor MPs in the area attending-the member for Holt, the member for Bruce, the member for Hotham, the member for Deakin, the member for Isaacs and me. One hundred and forty delegates attended. Six groups discussed climate change and water, education, health, the future of our economy, national security, and community and Indigenous issues. It was a phenomenal day and I want to thank all those who participated and all those who were involved. Most particularly I want to thank the summit co-chair, the Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, Professor Richard Larkins, who added an enormous note of intellectual rigour to the day and made it all run more smoothly and more professionally. Monash University were very supportive of this venture and donated facilities and services for the event, which we were grateful for. Among the delegates were school principals, small business people, doctors, community leaders, academics, environmental activists, CEOs from community health services and many, many others. The groups were co-chaired by MPs along with people who had considerable expertise or background in that particular field. This made for some very well informed, well guided and often very loud but very harmonious discussions. Everybody came along willing to participate with their ideas, and the day did not actually have one disagreement, with everybody prepared to listen and put forward what I think was a great vision for our area. For example, the national security group, co-chaired by the member for Holt and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International) of Monash University, Stephanie Fahey, had no less than eight experts in the field. At the end of the day we had a great discussion about the notion that in a security sense we have been ‘punching above our weight’ and how we wanted to take that term out of our lexicon because it just does not represent the way Australia should represent itself in the national arena. Apart from that, Richard Larkins, who was co-chairing and summarising, also said, as a health professional interested in preventative health, that as a nation we should not be supporting the art of boxing. My own group, which discussed strengthening communities, supporting families and social inclusion and the options for the future of Indigenous Australia, was co-chaired by Wurundjeri elder Professor Joy Murphy. This was a terrific group, with over 40 delegates representing various local communities and organisations. It was a very robust debate. The group discussed many issues around funding models, many issues around the notion of community groups not being listened to and many issues around the funding formula under which we come along with a package and say, ‘Apply for the funding,’ but do not actually look at the issues that the various communities are supporting and working on. All these groups have been up and going and providing services for a long time and they find it really quite frustrating that year-in year-out they have to go cap in hand and beg for new project funding, when what they really want to do is just continue doing the great work they are doing. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the group’s issues that was fairly vigorously discussed-and it is a big issue in my area-was the notion of skilled migrants. WhilstI welcome in the budget the report about increased skilled migration, skilled migrants need more support. One of the issues I have been dealing with, particularly over the last five years, is skilled migrants arriving in the country and not being able to get work in their chosen field. There is nothing more frustrating than packing up your home and coming to a promised land as a skilled migrant who has lived and worked in an area and for internationally recognised organisations and not being able to get an equivalent job in this country. They come to Australia, they have promised their families a better life and they are not finding the work, they are not finding the assistance that they need. There is no support given to those individuals. I think that is something we seriously need to look at. The area that I represent attracts huge numbers of skilled migrants, particularly from India and Asia, and growing numbers from African countries are coming here as skilled migrants, and we need to be giving them more support. This whole 2020 process was great-to have so many people from so many different backgrounds, interested groups and parts of the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne represented. Often we overlook the notion of regions in metropolitan areas because we are also talking about regions in rural and remote communities. My community is a community-it is an area, it is a region; it should be recognised as such, it should be valued as such and it should be funded as such. So there was a discussion about putting the metropolitan areas on the map. I do not denigrate in any way, shape, size or form the difficulty that regional and remote areas have, but my area is a community, a vibrant one, and should be recognised and respected as such as well. I know that MPs were delighted to be able to chair these groups and be involved in some very interesting and proactive discussions. Each group produced a summary of two to three items which were later fed through to the 2020 summit in Canberra. It was a great success and we have received excellent positive feedback from delegates. Some MPs have said they are interested in having follow-up discussions with delegates on these topics. Monash University is interested in becoming more involved in development issues for the south-east, including an innovation precinct. The notion of clever communities was canvassed on the day and is something I am willing and happy to support and progress within my electorate. I have Monash University, one of the largest universities in the country. Next door to Monash Uni is one of the largest CSIRO precincts; across the road, in the member for Bruce’s electorate, is the Synchrotron; down the road is the Telstra’s big research area; and dotted around them are small areas where many manufacturers are doing research. We need to be supporting research and development and a manufacturing base within this country. Earlier today I listened to the member for Kalgoorlie say that we do not manufacture in this country. No, we do not, and it is a great tragedy. We need to get back into manufacturing or producing or designing. Sitting within my little niche in ClaytonI can see that it is an amazing resource, and if we could harness those resources together, we could do great things for our nation, our community and the country. So we look forward to engaging on this idea of clever communities. We welcome greater engagement by our universities in local and regional development issues and in policy development. With so much expertise on our doorstep we would be crazy not to use it. As I said in my speech on the higher education support amendment bill in the House yesterday, with both Monash and Deakin universities in Chisholm, I have many uniMAIN COMMITTEE versity students, staff and graduates living in my electorate. This makes for a well educated, politically aware electorate-my constituents are generally very conscious of issues affecting them at local, national and global levels-and they let me know about it fairly regularly. As I mentioned earlier, from the emails, phone calls and letters I regularly receive in my electorate office, climate change, health and education are the issues of primary concern to my constituents. Coming out of the forum and from the electorate is the issue of transport related to health. Within the suburbs, we need to be actively looking at issue of providing public access transport to the regions in the area. I want to put on record my long-term commitment to seeing the train extended from Huntingdale train station to Monash University and out to Rowville. It has been too long coming. We need to do it to make access easier for students to get to Monash and to cut down on car usage in the area. I would also like to put on the record the need for greater train transport within the eastern suburbs, which also came out of discussions at the local 2020 summit that we held at Monash University-they are depleted-and the need for a commitment from the state government to rebuild Box Hill hospital. I believe the financially responsible budget provided by the Rudd Labor government goes a long way to addressing the numerous concerns of my electorate in the areas of climate change and education-I welcome the additional funding for the universities-and in the area of early childhood education and the need to lift year 12 or equivalent education rates. Additional places within and funding for aged care are also greatly needed in my electorate, and I commend their inclusion in the budget. Prior to the election I had a fundraising dinner at Box Hill where Alastair Nicholson, who was a previous Labor candidate for the seat of Chisholm, spoke. Other previous Labor candidates for the seat of Chisholm also came along, two of them being John Button and Helen Mayer. Tragically, since that dinner and since this parliament last sat, both John Button and Helen Mayer have died due to cancer. I want to thank them for their support over the years and I know this parliament was greatly blessed by their presence. We will miss them greatly. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (12.14 pm)-On 24 November last year, voters across the country put their trust in Labor to make a difference. They had had almost 13 years under a Howard government, and during that time, it is fair to say, their trust in government, their trust in democracy and their trust in each other had diminished. We have done more in the first months since coming to office than the Howard government did in the last 11 years of its government. Since the election, we have signed the Kyoto protocol, we have made a formal apology to the stolen generations, we have introduced legislation to abolish Australian workplace agreements and we have initiated a white paper on homelessness in Australia-the first white paper of the new government. It is about the issue of homelessness in Australia and how to tackle it. We have established Infrastructure Australia, a body that will provide advice to government about infrastructure gaps and bottlenecks. In the most recent budget we set aside $21 billion to make some of that become a reality. We have established a social inclusion unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to tackle poverty and address social exclusion. Before the recent investment in the budget, we invested $150 million to assist state and territory governments in cutting elective surgery waiting lists. And of course there is additional funding set aside in the budget for hospitals. We have set up a timetable for eliminating discrimination against sameMAIN COMMITTEE sex couples from Commonwealth legislation. Again, for this most recent budget, we have contributed information aboutA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.16 pm to 12.30 pm Debate (on motion by Mr Slipper) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Zimbabwe journment debate in the Main Committee today. I would like to highlight the tragic events which are unfolding on a daily basis in Zimbabwe. I have had a lot to do with the Zimbabwean community on the Sunshine Coast. I get a lot of information coming out of Zimbabwe, and none of that information is good. We have a situation where for many years there has been a dictator, Robert Mugabe, who has had scant regard for the rule of law. Black and white Zimbabweans have been tortured, they have been arrested, they have been maltreated, they have been thrown out of their properties and their businesses have been stolen. It is a tragedy that a country that once was the breadbasket of Africa is now a country which is on the brink of famine. Despite that, an election was held recently. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission declined to release the official results. Unofficial results showed that Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, was well ahead of the incumbent President Mugabe, but this went on for quite a considerable period. Application was made to the court in Zimbabwe. The situation is that ultimately it has transpired that even on official figures Robert Mugabe has lost the election and Morgan Tsvangirai has been announced as the winner of the first round. With respect to elections for the parliament, the ruling party for the first time in living memory has actually lost control of the Zimbabwean parliament. We have a situation where, under the Zimbabwean law, there is a requirement that there ought to be a run-off election within a very short space of time. I was particularly concerned to read in the Age of 6 May: Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said ... that the run-off may take place in three weeks but could take up to a year ... Under Zimbabwean law, the run-off is supposed to take place within three weeks of the original election, held many weeks ago, but the commission has the power to extend the period between the votes. You also have to ask yourself: what are the United Nations and the world community doing about the tragic situation in Zimbabwe? What is South Africa, the major power in the region, actually doing with respect to the ongoing unfolding events in Zimbabwe? One has to be pessimistic that there is going to be any action from southern America or, for that matter, from the United Nations to see that the rights of the people of Zimbabwe are respected. I want to publicly call for more sanctions against Zimbabwe.

If you live in Zimbabwe, you have the same right to have your human rights respected as we who are fortunate enough to live in Australia. The world has not done enough to bring pressure on Mugabe, on the regime and on Zimbabwe to ensure that the democratic will of the people of Zimbabwe, as expressed at the ballot box and as belatedly released by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, can in fact be implemented. It is simply unacceptable that in 2008 we have this leader, who has reduced his country into a country that has the highest inflation in the world, a country where there are no human rights, a country where even independent people who were working for the Electoral Commission during the election were attacked because they would not come out in support of the ruling party. Enough is enough. It is time for the run-off election to take place. Morgan Richard Tsvangirai has said that he is prepared to compete in that run-off election. I believe that the world ought to ensure that that election occurs as quickly as possible, and once and for all the world will see the end of Robert Mugabe, aid will be able to flow into Zimbabwe, the lives of people in Zimbabwe will be improved and their rights, like the rights of other people around the globe, will be respected. Human Rights Sudan marks on Zimbabwe and note that the Human Rights Subcommittee of this parliament will be holding hearings on Zimbabwe, Darfur and Burma in Sydney on 12 June. We hope that a number of prominent people from around the world will participate in these hearings. I want to speak on an equally tragic situation, in Darfur, where a quarter of a million people have been killed, a million people are in exile and away from their homes and, the United Nations estimates, over two-thirds of the local population is entirely dependent upon humanitarian aid, with violence affecting half a million civilians beyond the reach of such humanitarian operations. Before the parliament resumed, 27 April marked a particularly terrible anniversary. A year ago international arrest warrants were issued for two Sudanese leaders involved in the massive ongoing atrocities in Darfur. They are the former state minister for the interior, Ahmed Harun, and Ali Kushayb, a key leader of the Sudanese backed militia, the Janjaweed. Both are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Evidence in the International Criminal Court cases against both men is overwhelming, including evidence from numerous eyewitnesses as well as compelling documentary evidence. Yet Khartoum refuses to extradite or lift a finger against either man despite an explicit request from the International Criminal Court-no surprise here. As the leading expert on Darfur, Eric Reeves argues, were Haroun or Kashayb to testify in the Hague, members of the Khartoum regime would be at obvious risk of being charged themselves as they could point the finger far up the chain of command in Sudan. It is a grotesque irony, Mr Haroun has even been promoted to the position of state minister for humanitarian affairs, with major responsibility for the millions of desperate victims of the very crimes he orchestrated. I want to commend the international actor Mia Farrow and the academic Eric Reeves, who wrote: More than five years have passed since the Khartoum regime and its Janjaweed allies launched their campaign of destruction against the non-Arab populations of Darfur. The savagery of the attacks upon civilians, the torched villages, mass murders, rapes, abductions and mutilations have made the word MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Adjournment
278,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.36 Pm),"I commend the member for Fisher on his reDarfur synonymous with human suffering. More than 2.5 million people have fled from their burning homes in terror, seeking tenuous refuge in wretched camps across Darfur and eastern Chad. The International Criminal Court’s role is to investigate and prosecute cases in which a nation’s courts cannot render justice even in the face of the most horrific crimes. The International Criminal Court on its own cannot do anything about it, so it relies on others to execute arrest warrants. In the case of Darfur, the International Criminal Court has an authority from a United Nations Security Council resolution. The refusal of the government in Sudan to arrest the subjects should be superseded by the UN Security Council’s authority in international peace and security. The Security Council members have unfortunately shown too little interest in forcing compliance with this resolution. As long as the regime in Khartoum shows its contempt and the Security Council continues not to enforce its will, Mr Haroun and his cohorts will operate with impunity in Sudan. Those nations who have committed their support to the International Criminal Court must understand that a green light to Khartoum’s defiance on these indictments is a green light to the men in Khartoum who are in defiance of international demands. The large protection force will to pursue international arrest warrants for these two people, it just encourages the authorities in Khartoum to ignore the international community and to continue to ignore the dying in Darfur. This will continue to grow apace. Last December, Louis Moreno-Ocampo, Chief Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, issued a devastating reprimand to the Security Council, when he said: We are witnessing a calculated, organised campaign by Sudanese officials to attack individuals and further destroy the social fabric of entire communities. All information points not to chaotic and isolated acts but to a pattern of attacks. and his terrifying indictment of Sudan and has not done anything to circumvent the Security Council paralysis in this area. Justice will only be served if the nations of the world place justice before serenity in relation to these international war crimes. This is a very difficult issue but one where we all have to do something because we must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Budget slap in the face for the working families that the Rudd government promised to fight for. The working families in my electorate of Greenway are feeling the effects of incompetence as they experience higher prices at the checkout and the bowsers. The first budget of the Rudd government is one of arrogance. The Treasurer can do as he wants with his ministerial salary, but the hard-earned savings of the Australian people ought to be off limits. Working families have been let down by the Rudd government and the Prime Minister-and he, the self-proclaimed champion of working families, has been let down by his inexperienced buddy, the member for Lilley. The changes to the Medicare levy show the failure of the Treasurer to understand the economic consequences of his actions. Sydney Morning Herald’s Mark Metherell identified the straightforward concept that our Treasurer could not understand: ‘the loss of many young, low-risk members is likely to push up premiums and add to public hospital pressures.’ It is MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Adjournment

280,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (12.41 Pm),"Labor’s high-taxing; high-spending budget is anow predicted that private health insurance premiums will rise by six to 10 per cent, taking away the choice for Australian families by pushing premiums out of reach of the typical household budget. These are mums and dads who previously had the choice to do what was best for their families, mums and dads who are now forced onto the ‘waiting forever’ list in New South Wales. This is the very same government that requires additional federal funding just to fix its desperate hospitals and other strained medical facilities. The Rudd government’s $10 billion health and hospital fund has been earmarked to fund the development of health infrastructure and medical equipment, but the government does not understand that there is no point in funding additional infrastructure and equipment if there is no-one to operate it. New South Wales Rural Doctors Association President, Dr Ken Mackey, rightly points out that there is no point in funding this infrastructure in a budget that makes cuts to training programs for enrolled nurses in regional Australia. I will be writing to the Minister for Ageing requesting that the additional funding made available for the ACAT program be directed to Greenway in the form of a sub-ACAT team to be based in the Hawkesbury. The ageing population of the Hawkesbury is an issue that this government must address. The closest ACAT team is in Penrith, almost two hours drive from the remote parts of the Hawkesbury district. This high-taxing, high-spending budget delivers successive blows to young families trying to establish a future in an uncertain economic climate. The first strike is the Treasurer’s plan to exclude some families from receiving family tax benefit B. By placing a means test on the family tax benefit, Mr Swan shows his ignorance of why it exists. It is a recognition not only of the communal social value of families to the nation but also that significant expense is incurred on the part of those providing the social good. Rising interest rates, petrol prices, grocery prices and inflation in general seem to be all Mr Swan can talk about. Why then has he forgotten the challenge they pose to his championed working families? Mortgages now take up to a third of most family’s incomes in repayments, groceries are constantly increasing, and petrol costs hit harder than ever as mums and dads taxi their kids around. The family tax benefit is an acknowledgement of these difficulties that face families and is society’s way of contributing something to the production of social value. The double whammy on working families is the restriction of the childcare benefits. The Rudd government is once again all bark and no bite as it drums up the increased childcare rebate but fails to mention the restrictions in place. This discriminatory policy is an attack on stay-at-home mums. Mothers who do not work 25 hours a week do not get any childcare rebate, making it hardly worth working at all. The third prong to this government’s vendetta against families is the new payment arrangement and means test for the baby bonus. Our Treasurer has introduced fortnightly payments of the bonus, once again demonstrating he simply does not understand. All families ought to be supported. Hard-working families pay their tax and they deserve some of that tax money back. This budget not only fails working families but also sneaks through reforms that will hurt the young and vulnerable in our society. These reforms are straight from the union movement. The Work for Dole program has been effectively terminated, as job seekers now have a year before they must take part in the program. The Labor Party seeks to encourage dependence on welfare rather than giving job seekers skills and confidence they would otherwise not have had: a handout, not a hand up. At least 40 per cent of people who have been in the Work for MAIN COMMITTEE the Dole program have entered into full-time employment. In light of the Treasurer’s apparent inability to understand basic mathematics, I will personally guarantee that 40 per cent of participants finding full-time employment is a much better result for Australia than zero per cent. As a growth area in Western Sydney, Greenway has many working families with young children, and parents are legitimately concerned about their future. The Rudd government is also clearly not committed to the environment. The Hawkesbury River is in desperate need of the funding package of $132.5 million promised by the Howard government, which includes amounts for recycling, desalination and maintaining the health and sustainability of the South Creek catchment. Nowhere is this to be seen in the budget. (Time expired) Renewable Energy: Nichols Poultry just any chickens. These are chickens that have been air chilled-and not just air chilled but air chilled through a process that is fuelled by renewable energy. A government member-That is wonderful. is in my electorate. I have seen personally in Sassafras that if you put a toenail in the ground it will grow a foot. It is so fertile, so beautiful and so green. On Friday, 9 May, I had the privilege to be invited to Sassafras, where my former colleague, now the minister for the environment in Tasmania, Michelle O’Byrne, actually commissioned a Vestas 225-kilowatt wind turbine. Nichols Poultry have used the wind turbine to fuel their process, particularly the air chilled process. It is not just for chickens; it is also for turkeys. I can tell you that because they were kind enough to give me one of these chickens, unsolicitedthis for a mission statement for a company, in the words of Mr Robert Nichols: Nichols Poultry has an ongoing commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and preserving natural resources by harnessing the wind to produce our energy requirements. Nichols Poultry aims to be Australia’s leading environmentally sustainable poultry producer through the completion of our wind turbine project. I think that is a fantastic mission statement for any business, let alone the premier poultry business in Australia. Mr Melham interjectingyears ago as a farm cottage industry, originally supplying fresh turkeys for Wrest Point Casino. Since those early days, it has progressed to become Tasmania’s only premium producer of air chilled poultry. This unique process of air chilling helps to produce chicken meat so that you can taste the difference. Now it is the preferred choice of Tasmania’s consumers-so much so that it has enabled the company to grow to supply 25 per cent of fresh poultry sales annually in Tasmania. They now employ 40 full-time employees and they support many subcontractors in my community. Going to the premises of Nichols Poultry truly is a clean, green experience. It is a beautiful place, very clean, air chilled, as you could imagine, and of course we now have this magnificent wind turbine which you can see from the great Bass Highway, MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Unamid For Example Has For Nine Months Been Obstructed By This Regime If We Lack The

Indeed, I was happy to announce the final $42 million phase of construction recently. AndI got to get my name on a plaque, which is really good! But, anyway, here is the wind turbine from a distance-a great example to others as to how to use renewable energy. WhatI found really interesting was that the invitation to attend the opening of the turbine-it is a lovely invitation and I will no doubt copy the concept of it myself-was based on a coloured painting of the Nichols family farm in Harby in the UK, and there of course was the windmill. It was the inspiration to Robert Nichols and his family to put in a wind turbine. They went to Denmark and dismantled it and brought it over. With just their local knowledge they put this wind tower up. Now not only does it produce enough energy for their business but also it has power going into the Tasmanian grid. It really is a great story. The other great thing about the family’s business is that they have a great concern for occupational health and safety and they have a wonderful quality assurance program and believe in the training of their staff. They are an excellent model of business and an excellent corporate citizen in their community and, of course, they are helping with the environment. I thank them for their kind invitation-it was very enlightening for me. One particular thing they do is invite local schools to come in. They have done projects around wind energy and the science of it and shared that with the schools. They come out and look at the other processes involved in the business. Nichols Poultry is a first-rate business and I thoroughly recommend it. Of course, they live in the beautiful area of Sassafras. It is a great privilege to tell their story. La Trobe Electorate: Burrinja Cultural Centre this year I spoke about the importance of the redevelopment of the Burrinja Cultural Centre in Upwey, in my electorate of La Trobe. In August last year I announced that the Shire of Yarra Ranges had succeeded in applying for around $2 million in federal government funds to go towards a $10 million upgrade of the Burrinja Cultural Centre. The $2 million was requested by the state Labor minister, James Merlino, as an SOS call for the project, and also by the council itself. Late last year, representatives of the Shire of Yarra Ranges met with the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for preliminary discussions. However, as I understand it, the formal contract was not signed off. I was therefore extremely disappointed to read recently in the Age newspaper that the Regional Partnerships program has been axed and that ‘existing contracts will be honoured but all uncontracted applications will be dumped’. The Burrinja project represents the culmination of many years of work by the local community, including local schools, to establish a regional performing arts venue. Federal funding was a fantastic result for the arts community everywhere from Ferntree Gully and all the way across the hills to Emerald and beyond. It came about after the dedication of people like Elizabeth Connally and Ross Farnell of Burrinja and Chris Dupe of the Shire of Yarra Ranges. The application had strong support from the state Labor member, Minister James Merlino; the Mayor of the Shire of Yarra Ranges, Tim Heenan; Councillor Noel Cliff; and former Councillor Louis Delacretaz. It had great community and bipartisan support. A number of local people, organisations and community groups also wrote to me to express their support, including: the Belgrave Community Arts Partnership; the Hills Film Group; Utassy Ballet MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Unamid For Example Has For Nine Months Been Obstructed By This Regime If We Lack The
286,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (12.51 Pm),"In this place on 14 February and again on 3 MarchSchool in Sassafras; St Joseph’s College Ferntree Gully; Olinda Primary School; Mater Christi College in Belgrave; Belgrave Heights Christian School; Sassafras Primary School; and the Probus Club of Belgrave. The funding was to be used to build a 400-seat performing arts centre, upgrade Burrinja’s existing facilities and construct a new Indigenous cultural education garden. This was the only Indigenous project in my entire electorate. Prior to the last election the Labor Party made a number of allegations about the Regional Partnerships program, but even the most partisan Labor member could see that the Burrinja project was a terrific project and was bipartisan. As one might expect, withdrawing federal funding from Burrinja was not raised by my Labor opponent in the election campaign last year. It so happens that my Labor opponent and the new Labor arts minister, Peter Garrett, held a morning tea at Burrinja during the election campaign on Friday, 2 November 2007. Needless to say, there was no mention at that morning tea that a Rudd Labor government would jeopardise federal funding and therefore the entire Burrinja upgrade. If the Labor Party wants to withdraw federal funding, and it now appears that it has for Burrinja, it and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, will be guilty of deceiving the Burrinja Cultural Centre and using it for their own political gain. That is a disgrace. Also disgraceful is the arrogance shown by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, and Parliamentary Secretary Gary Gray, who have failed to respond to repeated attempts by both my office and the Shire of Yarra Ranges to gain information about the status of the funding of this and other projects. The appalling way in which Labor has handled this matter has galvanised the local community, and I intend to fight as hard as I can on behalf of the local community until the $2 million in funding is restored. It is very sad to see funding cuts in my electorate of La Trobe, especially in the hills. The two major areas loved by those in the hills are the arts and the environment, and there has been a funding cut of $2 million for Burrinja Performing Arts and of $450,000 to tackle weed control, a biological control for wandering trad. When Minister Garrett was in my electorate he discussed both issues. He never mentioned that the weed funding would be cut nor that the funding for Burrinja would be cut. It is now almost six months since Labor was elected. I hope Labor learns quickly that there is a real world that exists beyond Kevin Rudd’s political agenda, and that it is grossly unfair and utterly gutless to keep community organisations in limbo for months on end until budget night comes around and then to cut existing funding commitments made by a previous government. Green Corps Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (12.56 pm)-RecentlyI had the great pleasure of representing the Minister for Employment Participation, Mr O’Connor, at graduation ceremonies for participants in two local Green Corps projects. One was the Illawarra Rainforest Remnant Corridor and Education Project and the other was the Ngaraba-aan Educational Trail and Restoration Project. These projects were facilitated by a number of local organisations-namely, Job Futures, Warrigal Employment and the Wollongong City Council. I commend those organisations for their continuing support for what is really a fantastic labour market program. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the great things about the Green Corps program is the partnerships that develop between community organisations and government at all levels, particularly in an area like the Illawarra, which has very high rates of youth unemployment. I think these Green Corps projects show exactly what can be achieved when the community and government organisations work together to achieve sustainable and common outcomes. The graduates at that ceremony were very delighted with the 26 weeks they had worked on the two local projects. Over that period, their team leaders advised, they were involved in planting 4,000 trees, collecting and propagating seeds and constructing walking tracks. They were also involved in the removal of weeds, undertook fauna and flora surveys and collaborated with a range of local and nongovernment organisations to create information brochures and reports. I was told at the ceremonies that the experience gained would be instrumental in assisting the young participants to move on to careers in occupations as diverse as horticulture, garden maintenance and landscaping and design, employment in nurseries and florists, apprenticeships in mechanics and web design, and, for those who were interested, further study, particularly in the areas of resources and environmental science. We know, when we look at labour market transition programs, that the Green Corps program is one of the best in terms of the outcomes for people going on to meaningful paid employment. As a direct result of participating in Green Corps projects, a recent survey identified that 88 per cent of participants said their self-esteem had improved, and 87 per cent believed their motivation to find a job had increased and their chances of getting a job had improved. One of the most pleasing aspects of the Green Corps program is that a significant majority of former Green Corps participants are in employment, in education or in training within three months of completing their placement in local projects. Of course, in this day and age, there is no better time for Australia’s young people to get involved and become proactive about environmental issues, and certainly participation in the Green Corps projects provides our young people, particularly in the Illawarra, with the perfect opportunity to get involved. When you look at the Green Corps projects on a national basis, one of the good things about the program is that a lot of it is targeted at regional and rural Australia, and it has been a very important program for Indigenous young people. Green Corps participants have made a significant contribution to Australia’s natural environment as well as assisting in the protection of heritage sites, including places of Indigenous significance and the sites of early European settlement. In my own area, one of these projects has been involved in restoration work at Hill 60, a significant site in the Illawarra’s Indigenous history. During 2008, more than 1,700 young people will make a significant contribution to around 174 Green Corps projects across Australia. It is a great program. I commend the young people who have participated in it. They are certainly leaving a legacy for future generations in the efforts they are making in looking after our nation’s environment and our nation’s heritage.
