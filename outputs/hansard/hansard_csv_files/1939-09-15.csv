Candidates found to be suffering from a complaint which would entail rejection, but is curable by operation, will be marked unfit by the Medical Examiner, but the Examiner may recommend re-examination after operation. The following wounds, injuries, and operations require special mention:(i) HeadA history of fracture of the skull definitely disqualifies for air work. (ii) Nerk -Scars, the result of removal of tuberculous glands, will not be considered a cause for rejection. (iii) Chest -The chest must be well formed and the lungs and bronchi free from disease. (iv) Abdominal Operations --Evidenc e that an abdominal operation has been performed will not, in itself, disqualify a candidate, provided that no hernial protusion or marked weakness of the abdominal wall has resulted. (v) Height Standard -Fo r admission to the Air Force there is no minimum height standard, but candidates for flying must possess a minimum length of leg of 39 inches. This measurement is taken in the sitting position with the leg and thigh in a straight line, from the surface of any object against which the buttocks are firmly pressed, to the boll of the foot in the fully extended (i.e., plantar flexed) position. 8. The candidate must be possessed, particularly, of sound lungs, heart and nervous system. Owing to . the importance of these systems they will, in addition to the usual clinical examination, be tested by special tests employed by the oxaminer. The urinary system must be healthy, and the urine must be free from abnormal constituents. In the circulatory system, valvular or myocardial disease will disqualify a candidate. liave reason to believe is tbe case, that under tbe new regulations controlling civil aviation, the department insists upon applicants for positions as pilots or ground engineers being of British stock? if so, will he have that regulation reviewed, so that Australian-born men and women, some of whose forbears, as, for instance, their grandfathers, were of foreign nationality, may be appointed? refer to the regulation, but to the best of my knowledge, the only requirement is that applicants shall be British citizens. That, of course, includes all Australian-born men and women. term ""British stock "" is used. cise wording, the regulation has been read as meaning persons born in the British Empire. standard is required of applicants for admission to the air force? If the standard is high will the Minister explain the reason,' in view of the fact that some of I he best air men of Australia, and of the world, were men without high educational attainments from country districts?

The budget, he said, had three distinguishing features: it was his first budget as Prime Minister No more refugees and Treasurer, it was the first time in the history of Australia that a budget, for £100,000,000 had heen presented, and it was only a tentative budget because, very shortly, supplementary estimates would have to be brought down to meet war requirements.

If the Government is not careful, this shoddy material will be used in the making of military boots. It is a remarkably good imitation of leather, although it is only pressed paper; but of course, as soon as it comes in contact with water, it is of no use whatever. The wealthy patriots must not bu allowed to get a bond rake-off this time. This war must be financed differently from tlie last war. Prom the very beginning the Government must make it clear that there are to be no tax-free war loans, and that interest rates arc not to be inflated in order to induce wealthy patriots to part with their money. With little, if any, prospect of imperial assistance, the Loan Council will be compelled to meet almost immediately to consider measures for the raising of money for war purposes. Never again must the money profiteering of the 1914-18 war period be repeated. The Government has in the Commonwealth Bank to-day a much stronger institution than was at the disposal of the War Cabinet of the last generation, and we are no longer bound to the gold standard. Unless the people are again to be loaded with an intolerable wa'r debt, all internal expenditure must, be financed by the vise of the national credit on a cost basis, free of interest. The experience of the years since the depression has demonstrated the degree to which credit expansion can be used for this purpose, and if the present Commonwealth Bank Board stands in the way it must give place to a board prepared to do its part. After obtaining £50,000,000 on loan in Britain at die beginning of the last war, the Australian Government raised in seven separate internal loan* no less than £213,000,000. but so sluggish was the patriotism of those with .money to invest that by the time the last loan was raised the rate of interest had sky-rocketed to 5 per cent., and the loans were made free of both State and Federal income tax. These huge interest rates remained as a burden for years after the war, and were not reduced until the Labour party, rn 1933, forced the general interest reduction of all government loans, Meanwhile, by a strange transaction under which the Government gave the private banks £3 hi notes for each sovereign held in gold, those banks, by special arrangement with the Treasury, made advances up to 90 per cent, to investors, and s-eenred themselves for a steady 4 per cent, interest for as long as they held-'the bonds as security. A.s the result of these transactions the Commonwealth has already paid £3,i0,000,000 in interest and sinking fund ori the war debt, yet it still owes approximately £500.000,000. although tlie four years of war were staled to have cost only £\S0 p00.000 a year. In addition to these ; payments the Government for years lost the whole of the income tax that should have been paid on dividends from Avar bonds. Tax-free loans on this occasion must he resisted from thu outset. The maximum interest rate to be paid on loan money that cannor he obtained from the Commonwealth Hank should be fixed by the Federal Parliament, and 3hould not exceed 3 per cent. Workers serving in the army have their rates cut to'6s. a day, and investors in war loans should be prepared to make a similar sacrifice. The private wealth of Australia is officially estimated at nearly £4,000,000,000. and the Government, must, call upon this reservoir of financial strength. If the "" patriots"" -ire not prepared to do their best, without, claiming exemption from income tax and excessive interest rates, the Government has it clear duty. Kt;s policy on this aspect of the war must be defined without delay. I. well remember an advertisement exhibited throughout Australia., when, an effort, was being made to induce the people to unload their private wealth. A poster depicted a soldier in action, and in large type were the words "" LtmcK the way they fight;"" but -the soldiers received no interest. F claim thai the Government has definitely sold out on the question of unemployment. This week T drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the position of the wool and basil workers in Sydney, and to the fact that 500 men would finish their employment to-day if action was not taken by the Government, to obtain wool for scouring and carbonizing purposes. I. received a letter to-day from the secretary of the Wool and Basil Workers I'YilerHiion, ' K > told nit* that 500 men had W ic -e.ived notice of termination of their employment, Minister could arrange for a supply of woo! sufficient t<> carry the works over next week, thesis men would be assured of continuity of employment, because it is hoped that by the time the forthcoming wool sale is held a sufficient supply will lie available at the scours. The Prime Minister promised to treat the matter as urgent, but I emphasize the fact that these men are finishing work to-aiight. The Government should act at once to enable the men engaged in wool washing at Botany and in Melbourne to re'tain their employment. It is a tragedy that ."">00 men should lose two or three weeks' work. should be made whereby a quantity of wool could be allowed on commission to the companies concerned for scouring and c.a rbonizing purposes. The problem of employment has never been seriously grappled with by the present Government. subject has occupied more space in the newspapers, more time and thought, or so much attention as a useful political football by the opponents party, as has that of unemployment. will be recalled federal elections, the United party used unemployment issue. We remember the slogan: "" Vote, United Australia party and get a job"". At, the 1934 elections apparently body had not. got a job. despite slogans, because the story then was that a Minister for Employment appointed and all worries would disappear. ment was not a popular issue with the Labour failed to put, all of our people back to work under decent conditions and on a living wage.

It Afr. Sheehan. means a breaking down of morale, a sapping of all the desirable attributes which if , however, the Prime go towards making a democratic citizen, useful to himself and to the community. But this stark tragedy means nothing to the anti-Labour Government in this Parliament. It hopes that, for the present time, the expanded defence programme will absorb large numbers of the unemployed. But what of tlv; future? It has no plan to meet the situation. It had no plan in the past, and it goes blindly ijito the future while thousands of our people are in misery. The Labour party has a comprehensive programme, designed not only to provide employment, but also to make provision for the relief of the unemployable. A t Some temporary arrangement the 1936 triennial conference of the Australian Labour party, held in Adelaide, it was resolved that the problem of adequately feeding, clothing and housing the unemployed, in default of the provision of remunerative employment, was primarily the duty of governments. Since 1930 no otb«r ' In July last the Sydney Sun published a report indicating the seriou* effects of unemployment in my electorate. It pointed out that, of nearly 350 boys of the Labour between the ages of six and eleven years, It assembled in the yard of the Erskineville that, at the 1931 public school, a third were without boots, Australia and nearly all of them were without coats. as its main Many of the girls were in threadbare cotton frocks and were without petticoats, whilst not one-neithe r boy nor g i r l everywore an overcoat.

So rather than tlie rule, and other underunemployclothing was of tbe cheapest kind, and had been worn for so long that it had losr To-day thouall its warming qualities. Similar conunemployed. ditions are. to be found in tbe schools in Alexandria. Newtown and Botany. We One cannot realize, until one are supposed to be building a glorious nation, but school children are being havirg stunted and starved, and will have no chance in life, because this Government Las decided not to assist the unemployed to tlie degree that they are entitled to be helped. The Treasurer stated that last year the expenditure on civil aviation was £736,000, and that the Government is budgeting for 1939-40 at £1,435,000, which is almost double tlie sum expended last year. I hope that there will be improved administration of airports duriDg the ensuing year. It is regrettable that .statements appear in newspapers such as that published in the SydneyM o m m y Herald of the 16th August, to the effect that four of the most efficient control officers of the Civil Aviation Department are believed to be seeking positions outside the service because of dissatisfaction with the administration and with the conditions of employment. These men are receiving low wages, and their services will no doubt be sought after in other countries. No encouragement is given to these men to rise to high positions in the air force, because the Government is adopting a niggardly policy in one of the most important arms of the defence force. On the same day the following parathe representations that had been made, graph appeared iu the Sydney Morning but I find that no provision whatever has Herald:It is proposed to open and phut the huge l!4of pay for these men, so apparently the ion sliding doors of the new Rose Hay hangar with a hand winch, instead, of an' eluctric Government has simply been engaging in winch, because the latter will cost an addikite-flying.

The whole would cost £8i50, and tliat an electric winch could be obtained for £1,060. It is deplorable that the Government should revert to the old days of hand winches in order to save a few paltrypounds. I again draw attention to the plight of Government. The review of service contbe old-age pensioners. It is stated in the ditions did not provide for the re-appointbudget, speech that invalid and old-age ment of the welfare committees. I admit pensions are estimated to cost this year that what: was done was better than no£16,700,000, an increase of £70S,000. ""The thing, but it was uot, enough. The men Government claims that it i.s doing everydefinitely prefer tlieir welfare committees thing possible for the pensioners. When to the arrangements tliat are now in asked yesterday if he had been invited to force. Their major request, however, is attend a demonstration in the. Sydney that their rate of pay shall be increased, Domain with regard to the conditions of for it is totally inadequate as most of the pensioners, the Prime Minister them, are married. Although they are replied in the negative, and said that the doing vitally important work, under our Government had no intention of giving an iucrease to the pensioners. I claim that owing to the increased cost of living the present payment of £1 a week is quite insufficient. When a pensioner goes into a hospital he receives only 6s. a week, and this imposes a grave hardship.' If a male pensioner happens to have a wife, who is probably also in receipt of the pension, it means that she receives only 26s. a' week on which to maintain herself, to supply her husband with the comforts to which he is entitled during periods of illness, and to pay rent, which would be about 17s. 6d. a week. In presenting the 1938-89 budget, the Government stated definitely that it intended to bring about a reciprocal agreement with the Government of New Zealand for the purpose of regarding residence in New Zealand as equivalent to residence in Australia for pension purpases. I regret that the Government do not intend to f u l f i l the promise contained in the 193S-39 budget. I wish now to refer to rates of pay in the Navy. The Government promised some time ago that it. would look into been made in the budget for an increase to give effect to its undertakings it omita naturally expect the Government to give subject has been a bone of contention with tbe naval ratings for many years.

During last year the Government, collected nearly £60^000,000 by means of customs duties and sales,tax, and we have just passed legislation which it is estimated will increase the receipts from sales tax from £9.000.000 to £11,000.000, whilst Treasurer hinted that an even f u r ther increase might be necessary. A t any rate, a few days ago a statement appeared in the press to the effect that the sales tax was being fully investigated, so it appears that: when tbe supplementary war budget, i« brought.down a further extension of the sales tax to lines at present exempted will be announced. proportion of the burden of the sales tax is placed upon the ordinary citizens of the Commonwealth. members w ill no doubt claim that, many items are exempted from the sales tax for the benefit of the workers, but that is only partly true, and that small benefit may be even less if the range of the tax is extended as suggested. One of the biggest items of expenditure, especially among large families, is clothing. I ask honourable members how many lines of ordinary clothing are exempt from sales tax at the present time? There is only one line that I know of, and that is footwear. I challenge any honourable member to name any item of drapery used by the working people that is exempt from sale"" tax. The taxation policy of this country should be so adjusted that those who are best able to pay should bo made to pay.

Mr Spurr. It is also true that, direct taxation is passed on, but my experience of business is that direct taxation is not passed on to nearly the same degree as indi reel taxation. I. urge the Governiueni, in reviewing the financial position and devising ways of raising revenue by taxes, to , in his budget speech the take into consideration the fact that, this form of indirect taxation imposes a heavy burden upon tin; workers of the country, well beyond their capacity to pay. In my electorate there are married men with families working for 25s. a week and double rations, and they have to pay sales tax on almost all of tbe necessities of life they buy. If the intention is to A greatextend the field of sales tax as was hinted in the Treasurer's budget speech, then apparently the workers will have t.o pay Some honourable sales tax on commodities which aro at present exempt. How. can people living on sustenance-afford to carry that burden? Eather than ask the poorer people of the community-thos e on the lowest rungs of the social ladder-to pay more taxes, the Government should obtain the necessary revenue from people with higher incomes. It is only right that those who hold the wealth of this country should be prepared to make sonic sacrifice in order to finance the war. If the workers are taxed any more they will have nothing left to them. One other matter which strikes me as being very important at the present time is the general question of financial policy. The policy outlined by the Treasurer in the budget speed) is in keeping with the general trend of policy applied by this At the present moment sound Let me finance is essential to the welfare of the A business is genpeople of Australia. A f t e r all is said customs contribute to the wealth of a countryhalf as pay all taxation. From the last, war we Government. debt is increasing year by year, and which we are faced at the present time? If one can .visualize the cost of 'the last war in wastage of money and man-power, aud in the suffering of the people, then one can appreciate what our obligations will, be during the present conflict. The war will not increase the wealth of this country; in fact, we shall be very lucky if our total wealth does not'decrease considerably. A t the present time, the combined annual interest commitments of the States and the Commonwealth amount to £46.000,000 a year, and in some States the annual interest commitment exceeds the direct revenue. We wonder, therefore, if the Commonwealth Government is doing its duty to the people of this land. It is its responsibility to introduce some scheme to ensure that after this war is over and we have won the victory which we arc all confident we shall win, the. workers of this country will not war poverty, amounting almost to serfdom. I repeat that the workers produce the wealth of this country, and knowing how they suffered during and after the last war, owing to the dislocation of industry and increased prices for the necessaries of life, I earnestly appeal to the Government to give careful consideration to the financial position in order to prevent a repetition of conditions that obtained after the last war. It should take action to keep interest rates at a low level and use the credit of the nation to the best advantage, as the Parliament of Canada is reported to be doing at the present time. When we say that the Government should tap the reservoir of social credit, we do not mean that it should print an endless supply of notes, thus causing undue inflation of the currency, with its attendant consequences, because we fully realize that a government cannot inflate the currency beyond certain -limits without inflicting hardship on the people. But under existing methods of finance Australia's credit is being used solely for the profit of private finance and banking institutions. All that Labour now asks of the Government is that it give earnest consideration to the utilization of that, grea.t reservoir of credit in the interests of the nation. Unless this ia done, the: workers will be' apprehensive lest their laving standards be further reduced and greater demands be made upon them for the upkeep of the nation. If the Government does not face its responsibilities, it will not be long before the workers decide that a Labour government must occupy the treasury 'bench. Any dislocation -of the export trade in apples and pears would affect Tasmanian growers more than producers in mainland States, approximately 3,000,000 bushels of apples and pears being exported annually from the island State. Following the outbreak of the war. the growers have been notified that all shipping space for f r u it has been cancelled. This announcement has caused great dismay among producers. Representatives of Tasmania in this Parliament will recall that during the last war, owing to the difficulty of obtaining freight space on overseas ships, f r u it was allowed to find that they have won the rot on the trees. Growers now fear only to live in a state of that that experience will be repeated. WhilstI realize the extraordinary difficulties confronting the Government in. this crisis, I appeal to the Ministry to use all its influence to secure u reasonable amount of shipping space for Tasmanian f r u it during the coming season. As all honourable members know, it is essential that such perishable products as f r u it should be disposed of quickly, and that the market be stabilized so that approximately half of the Australian crop may be exported. If it be impossible to obtain adequate shipping ' space, the only alternative is to can the f r u it . Certain varieties of apples and pears are suitable for canning and w i ll remain in a state of preservation for four or five years. They could bo used to augment food supplies for British soldiers on active service. Canning facilities are available in Tasmania, but suitable containers must be provided and the growers must be financed so that they may hold the canned product for 2 or 3 years before marketing it . I trust that the Government w ill give favorable consideration to my representations in this matter so that fruit-growers throughout the Commonwealth will not be penalized as they were during the last war. Honourable members will understand that the work of orehardists must be carried on uninterruptedly in order to prevent deterioration of the orchards. Unless orchards are properly cultivated and trees pruned, future yields will be uncontrolled and the orchards will run wild. Potato-growing is another important primary industry in Tasmania. Lately it has been given a good deal of prominence in the press, owing to the high level of prices reached in mainland markets a few months ago and ""the decision of the Government to remove the ban on the importation of potatoes from New Zealand. I appreciate that that was done in the interests of consumers. It should be realized, however, that producers in Tasmania have experienced many poor seasons, and for many years were compelled to dispose of their crops below the cost of production. Therefore, it is only fair, when relatively high prices possible the sources of supply of war prevail owing to climatic conditions, that the growers should be allowed to recoup themselves for losses sustained, in other years. It was unfair on the part of the Government to l if t the embargo on New Zealand potatoes. I concede that the Australian market was not flooded with New Zealand potatoes last season, but that was due to the coincidence of a poor New Zealand, crop. I , and other representatives or four little children, while their of the producers, have tried to obtain an assurance from the Prime Minister regarding the Government's proposals for the marketing of potatoes, but so far we have not obtained a definite answer. It is not right, that potato-growers should be kept in suspense. They do not know whether to increase their acreage or not, and so far as I can see, the Government has not taken any action to assure them that tlieir interests will be protected. I hope that the Government will make a clear statement, of its policy in this matter. When the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Casey) visited Tasmania recently, he stated that he favoured 'the decentralization of the sources of defence supplies, and that the work of his department would be spread over all of the States. That must have been an attractive form of speech intended to tickle the ears of the Tasmanian people for propaganda purposes. return prepared by the Department of Supply and Development proves the inaccuracy of the Minister's statement. It shows that expenditure on defence supHfr. Spurr. plies during 1938-39 was allocated as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £250,000; Victoria, £2,0S3,000; Queensland, £2,250; South Australia, £2,200; Western Australia, £2,700; and Tasmania, £300. I wonder that the Government was able to spare even that amount for poor little Tasmania which always receives scant consideration. I realize that the business of the Supply and Development Department cannot be distributed evenly over all States, but I regard the allocation of £300 to Tasmania as an insult to the enterprise of that State. A much larger proportion of the expenditure could have been allocated to it. I appeal to the Government to distribute as equably as materials during the coming year. It is regrettable that the budget makes no provision for widows and orphans' pensions. During my travels in Tasmania, I have come in contact with many poor people and I know of the hardships they are experiencing. In some homes I have seen girls of thirteen or fourteen years of age mothering as many as three widowed mothers have hired themselves out for scrubbing and washing in order to earn money for tlie education and maintenance of their children. Honourable members may say that the Social Service Department of Tasmania will care for such people, but the amounts granted by that department are not sufficient for large families. I cast no reflection on the Tasmanian Government in this connection, because it is hampered by the finance made available to it by the Commonwealth Government. Many unfortunate women have to supplement their allowances from the Social Services Department by doing washing and scrubbing work. I have no intention pf belittling these people; on the contrary I admire their determination to help in the maintenance of their families in decent conditions. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government, even in wartime, to ensure that mothers are kept in their homes to give the care which A they only can give to children at tihe impressionable period of their development. I do not expect the Government to provide luxuries for these people, but I do ask it to give them sufficient of tlie necessaries of lifeto make the children happy and contented so that in future years they w ill feel that they belong to a country worth fighting for.

128,Mr Spender (Warringah,"-Assistanti f I may say so-is that allegation. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr that this year the sum of £62,850,000 will Curtin) drew attention to the amount raised liy way of direct taxation in 193132, arid compared it with the estimate in the budget now before the committee. May I say, first, that the honourable gentleman took as his -starting point thf; depression years, for a rea3o:i which I suggest is obvious-so that the contrast might be the more distinct. Again, he presented to the committee only one-half of the picture. Every 'member of the committee knows that bit. by bit the States have invaded tlie field of direct taxation. The States have a limited field in which to tax; they have a very small field of indirect taxation. Further, if one compares the years taken, by thLeader of the Opposition, one finds that in 1931-32 the direct taxes imposed by the States realized £25,95S,000, whilst in 1937-38 the amount so raised was increased by nearly £14,000,000 to £39,540,000. Although these direct taxes are imposed by the States for different services, they fall on bhe same set of taxpayers. In order to get a. true picture one must look to see what amount of direct taxation is imposed throughout the Commonwealth by both the Commonwealth and the State. Parliaments, and one musthave regard to the fact that the States occupy practically three-quarters of the field of direct taxation. But the matter is not finished there. Every honoraMe member knows how harsh were the conditions in 1931, at the depth of the depression. The Leader of the Opposition, has chosen a year when the purchasing powerof money had increased by reason of the drop of prices in respect of both services, and commodities, and the burden was easier for those upon whom it was cast. In this year of grace, prices are rising, and I expect' that during the years that are ahead of us there will probably be a tendency for thorn to rise still further. With any increase of prices, there will be a lessened purchasing power of money, and consequently a greater burden, even if only the same amount bo collected as when prices arc low. The matter does not stop there, however. During the last three or four years the Commonwealth has increased direct taxes as compared with Mr ftpemler. indirect taxes. The budget contemplates be collected from indirect taxes compared with £52,020,924 collected in 1935-36. That-is an increase of a little over 20 per cent. Direct taxes are expected to yield £17,160,000 in 1939-40, compared with £11,596,382 in' 1935-36-a n increase of 50 per cent. That is to say, for the same period it is expected that' the yield from indirect taxes will increase by 20 per cent., whereas the yield from direct taxes will be about 50 per cent, greater. If we compare last year with the current financial year we find that indirect taxation . is being increased by 7 per cent, and direct taxation hy 12 per cent. Therefore it cannot be suggested that this Government is seeking progressively to load the burden on the general wage-earners. Reflection will show that there are only three fields of indirect taxation-first , customs and excise; secondly, the sales tax; and thirdly, the flour tax. Honourable members will not need to be told that the substantial increase of indirect taxes derived from customs and excise is due to the increase of imports. During the years 3 931-32, the period which was chosen by the Leader of the Opposition, imports fell substantially; but since that time there has been a marked increase of imports, with a correspondingly increased yield from customs and excise. Having regard to the real situation, the allegation that the Government is seeking to protect the wealthy by keeping direct taxation low cannot he sustained. In order to increase further the yield from direct taxes the only substantial field which may be attacked is one which includes the field of middle incomes between, say, £400 and £S00 per annum. should keep in mind that some taxes can be passed on. rate of income tax which is imposed upon the highest incomes from personal exertion, we find that in Queensland upon the maximum incomes the total imposition by the Commonwealth and the Statu roaches 15s. in. the £1. figures for the Commonwealth? to show the residue of the field that can",36,Questions Without Notice

The maximum rate in respect of income from property in. Queensland is 16s. 2d. in the £1. The comparable figures for Tasmania are 13s. 7d. and 14s. 9d. in the £1. In the light of these figures, it is idle to say that mucb more money can be extracted from person.? with the highest incomes.

A study of these figures will show that the largest available field of direct taxation is substantially the middle range of incomes, but no member of the Opposition has been prepared to urge the Government to enter that field. So much for the contention that the Government should concentrate on the man who is already carrying the burden which I have indicated. 1241 It is also stated -by honourable members opposite that customs and excise duties hear most heavily on the wage-earners. Again, reflection will show that, although in in any instances these duties are passed on, there, are substantial imposts on many luxury items, such as motor cars, petrol, the better classes of textiles, wine and spirits, and machinery which do not touch, or barely touch, the wage-earners. I invite members of the committee, particularly those who have declared that direct taxation can be increased, to show precisely how effect could be given to their contention. It is not sufficient to say that heavier direct taxes should be levied; the onus is on those who make that claim to show that such a field exists. It is certainly not my desire to impose taxes upon those persons in the community who are on the breadline, for I know how difficult life is for them. If the sales tax touches this class, then I say that the present Government Property. learned from a Labour government how to obtain additional revenue by its imposition. When first imposed, the sales d. s. d. tax was at the rate of 6 per cent. During 11 8 12 10 the intervening years, the rate has 8 6 10 9 15 0 16 2 fluctuated; it is again 6 per cent.

I should like honourable members opposite to show what effective way is open to increase direct taxation substantially other than by a method which In contemwill increa.se the burden upon the middle incomes of between, say, £400 and £800 a year. I come to another matter, the method of financing tbe programme that lies ahead of us this year. It is said that, we are not carrying enough on what is loosely called the credit structure of the country. I admit quite definitely that money is not for the purpose of determining how people shall live; I believe that the credit structure should be such as to permit people to live and to live properly. But it is just as idle to say, for example, that war is a reason for inflation as it is to say in time of peace that there is no reason why we should use the credit structure of r.he country.

It is easy to say in general terms that the resources of the country shall be used within economic limits, but it. is another thing to say preThis Governmeiut does not dispute that cisely where the process shall finish. The Leader of the Opposition (. Mr Curtin) says, "" Look at Germany. It has used the credit -structure with the result that there is no unemployment there, or substantially no unemployment"". That may be perfectly true, but again the Leader of the Opposition has not given the full picture. prepared, and I doubt if the honourable member is prepared, to go to the lengths which are involved in the full picture. If we did we should have to peg wages, as they have been pegged in Germany, control exchanges, ration essential supplies, and impose high taxes right down the scale. Finally, we should have to do as Germany did when. Dr. Schacht said, "" The credit structure will bear no more "" ; we should have to take the responshould be entrusted to private financiers. sibility of ""sacking"" the man who said that, because he said it, and appoint some one else in his place. I cannot understand why members of the Opposition, who represent and advocate very strongly and genuinely the interests of the workers, say that our problems may be met. hy the si mine expedient of making more money available, since once the stage of inflation was reached, as it would necessarily be. reached unless a limit were set, the people on the breadline would be taxed because their purchasing power would be reduced.

If the problems which confront us were capable of such easy solution as that, I could not understand any treasury or any bank resisting such a temptation. If prosperity automatically follows the expansion of credit, obviously no bank or government would resist it as the easiest possible method of attacking a problem.

I , for one, would be very pleased to he illuminated on that point. If they are not prepared to do that, it is not exactly courageous of them to shelter behind a solitary statement in the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, and to contend that according to that statement the Government is not doing its job.

That suggestion will receive the earnest consideration of the Government. However, lest it should be suggested that if that course be not pursued by the Government, it is not as desirous as is the Opposition to help Great Britain, I point out that ultimately it is a question of making a g if t of money to that amount. Our foodstuffs are going overseas as fast as the available ships can take them, it is not a matter of the supply of foodstuffs, hut of freight space. In the ultimate analysis, it is :i that, Government decision will can assist Britain better by spending that money in another way.

As far as we can see at present, GreatB r it a in is not. in need of finance, but I compliment the Leader of the Opposition on the spirit that prompted the suggestion, and I assure him that it will receive the earnest consideration of the Government. The Government has endeavoured to spread the burden of this budget as equitably as possible. It w ill not shrink from placing further burdens if practicable on those persons who are alleged to be best able to boar it, but before the war is over it w ill be found that the burden will be thrown on all of us, and we shall have to hear it. justice to the Opposition, I desire to clarify one or two points which the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr. Spender) rather succeeded in clouding. In the main 1 agree with the honourable gentleman, who has made a very interesting contribution to this discussion, but, in my opinion, his speech failed, when he endeavoured 1 to introduce political propaganda, and by implication and accusation, to misrepresent the. views of the Opposition. He invited us to state our views. I challenge the honourable gentleman to declare where the Opposition has said that credit could bo expanded without limit . He asked us to state in precise to suggest that the Golanguage where the limit should be, and I invite him to do the same. He has declared on behalf of the Government which has all the machinery at its disposal for making calculations and surveys of the resources of the country, whilst we have not, that the Government w i ll utilize the credit structure of the country for the carrying on of essential services. I invite him to give a precise definition of what he considers the proper limit. The Labour party has never said that a government should use the national credit, or the credit structiire, as the Assistant Minister called it , without, limitation, and I have never prematter of money. It may be sumed to be ahle to say where the actual after consultation with the limi t is; but when I held a. responsible of Great Britain, a position in this country, and when price be reached that we levels were fallin g drastically, when deflation was the order of the day, when people were starving, not because of high prices, but because, due. to the f a l l of prices, there was no employment, we attempted a small measure of credit expansion, in order to provide employment and assist wheat-growers. Even then, however, we took the precaution of saying that we would watch price levels carefully, and would not let them rise above the price levels of 1929. ""We did not fix that l i m it by chance.

The primary industries all over the world were almost destroyed because of the greed and selfishness of the rentier class. We declared as a government-and the real test is what one would do as a government-that we would not allow any expansion of the credit structure to raise prices beyond the 1929 level. I admit at once that the power of a government successfully to use the national credit is greatly restricted unless it also has power to fix prices. The present Government is assuming that power under the ""National Security Act, and I am glad. I am not at all jealous that our thunder has been stolen. I do not want any thunderI want justice for the people. I emphatically refute, however, the suggestion that the Labour party stands for unlimited expansion of credit and inflation.

The interests that benefited most by inflation were the private banking institutions, and they were allowed to do so. We all know that, they practised inflation. more you give them as a basis of credit the more they will inflate, and they were encouraged to do it during, the last war. We know that any one depositing £10 with a hank was able to buy a Government £100 bond, and pay the rest over a period of years. The whole process was one of inflation, and it was practised in every country, with the resulft that the war was fought at the expense of the masses of toilers. It was not until 1929 that the basic wage, which had for years been chasing the cost of living, finally caughi up with it. Knowing that, our party would not stand for a policy of inflation, which is an indirect and ruthless method of reducing wages and other purchasing power. We say this, however: Where the credit structure can he used within sound limits, which must -be ascertained from time to time financial advisers of the Government. Insofar as the credit structure of the country can be safely used, we say that it should be used, but only hy the Commonwealth Bank-the people's bank. That is where we stand. When we speak in general terms about utilizing the credit resources of the country through the Commonwealth Bank in order to bring idle man-power and natural resources into production, we mean that we shall do so to the exclusion of the private banks. I desire to make clear an observation on tbe note issue. I do not believe that a gold reserve is of any value in restricting the expansion of the note issue. The only worth-while restriction-and there should be a restriction, because it would be dangerous not to have one-is a statutory provision limiting the amount of the note issue. Of what use is it to say that the note issue must have a 25 per cent, gold hacking, and to expect that such a provision will prevent inflation, when the bank board, if it so desired, can print a million pounds worth of notes, buy a million pounds of gold with them, and on that basis print another £4,000,000 worth of notes, and go on repeating thai process? The note reserve is a fetish, a superstition. Its only value as a note reserve is the psychological effect it has in inducing the people to accept notes as The legal tender. I would not abolish the reserve as it has a value as a national reserve. reserve for? international accounts when the balance of trade is against us; when we cannot pay for imports with exports.

The reserve we have in London to-day is held in sterling, or, in other words, British securities of a liquid nature. That is the only place where the reserve could be of any value. It is of no use whatever in restricting the expansion of our note issue.

It has also a psychological (.'tTcot upon the minds of those who accept our notes as legal tender, but they would have to accept them in any case.

When I am challenged to say whether 1 would abolish the reserve of the note issue, I say tliat I would not. If the nation experienced a crisis in which it could not balance payments hy an excess pf exports over imports, and could not meet its obligations without borrowing overseasa wrong method that was adopted for a number of years before my Government took office-it would be compelled to call upon that reserve in order to prevent default. Therefore, the .reserve has a real value. I do not complain about having a reserve; but in my opinion it is not large enough. In 1927, when Mr Bruce was Prime Minister, I pleaded with him from the very place wliere I now stand to stop the flood of imports into Australia, to cease financing rhe in by means of overseas loans, and, instead, to build up in London a reserve of £30,000,000 or £40,000,000, so that we should have it there when, the value of It was lying there idle our exports would not meet our imports and other charges. I little thought that it would fall to my lot to be the responsible Minister to face a crisis such as I then predicted; but many others had given similar advice that went unheeded. I mention this fact to show that the Assistant Treasurer is not justified in giving the impression to the people of this country that members of the Labour was .a Labour Government that rescued Australia from the reckless financial dealings of the preceding Government. This war should he prosecuted without profiteering in either goods or money. The most shameful thing done in the last war was to say to people who had money to lend on the credit of the nation that they could get practically double the rate of interest that was obtainable in time of peace, although our soldiers who had been earning 15s. or £1 a day went into tlie trenches for 6s. a day. That was a scandal, and I hope that it will not be repeated. Whatever methods of finance are employed-and I suppose that every method will be employed, including loans, Yet my Government had not taxation and the utilization of the credit of the nation through the Commonwealth RankI hope that the Government will see that those who have money to lend It shall receive, at most, the normal rate of interest if they are not. patriotic enough to lend at a lower rate when other men are called upon to make much greater sacrifices. I rose merely to make the position of the Labour party clear. Progress reported. , BILL (No. 5) 1939. Treasurer) [3.12] I move That the bill be now read a second time.

It will be realized that exchange is taken into account by the merchant, together with other costs, in arriving at the price for which the goods are sold, and upon which tax is payable. On the other hand, however, a retail merchant who imports goods for sale by retail is required under the existing law to pay sales tax in respect of those goods at the time of entry for home consumption, upon values which arc not, in fact, expressed in terms of Australian, currency.

The scheme will not necessarily who imports comparable goods and pays be applicable to all entries of goods on sales tax on values which are based on and from that date, as it will definitely sterling. Mr Spender. It may be explained that the provision in the existing law for the addition of 20 per cent, to the sum of the value for duty and the duty to ascertain the taxable sale value for sales tax purposes was not designed to cover the exchange factor. It was designed to arrive at a figure which would include other importing cos.K. together with a reasonable measure of profit to the importer, and which would, in general, represent the fair wholesalevalue of the goods if sold in Australia. It must be admitted that in respect of some classes of goods, the addition of 20 per cent, may be too low to reach a fair wholesale value, whilst in some few cases it may be a little high for that purpose. In the vast majority of cases, however, and taking the taxable field of goods as a whole, it is considered that the 20 per cent, originally decided upon does no more than cover the costs,' charges and profits, exclusive of the exchange involved, which would normally form part of a fair wholesale sale price. It would, of course, be impracticable to attempt to prescribe varying percentages for all the different classes of goods affected. It view, that 20 per cent, is fair for general action is now taken to require exchange It will be noted that, the bill provides of the goods from the country of export.

The port of final discharge of such goods may 1x3 a coastal port at which the importing vessel does not call, and, therefore, the goods must be landed for transport by land or sea to the coastal port for final discharge. In such a case the date of the arrival of the goods at the coastal port is the date of their importation into Australia. I commend the bill to honourable members as a measure which will result in the removal of a definite anomaly by placing retail importers on more even terms with wholesale, importers from the point of view of their liability for sales tax.

In its report latest year for which complete statistics fov that year the commission expressed are available. It has been complained the view that, in times of prosperity, a that the calculations made by the commisclaimant State should take action to imsion are based on figures which are, in prove its financial position which it caneffect, two years old.

There are view to drawing the attention of the disadvantages attaching to this procedure claimant States to their duty in that as the conditions two years ago may not respect. The items particularly examined truly reflect the circumstances of the were: In the case of South Australia, present time, but any inequality which the failure to recover debts due to the might result from the use of figures of a Crown; in the case of Western Australia, previous year is not cumulative, as difthe expenditure of loan moneys on unferences will balance out. over a term of productive projects; and in the case of years.

In its present formula should be evolved so that the report the commission expresses the belief amounts of the grants could be automatithat its criticism of last year has not cally fixed for a term of years. In the been adequately met, thoueh in certain view of tbe commission, a fixed formula accounts improvement is noted. In parcould not take full account of the relaticular, the commission has mentioned the tive effects of changes in prices, wages, heavy loan fund expenditure on unprofluctuations of trade, unemployment, the ductive road works, notwithstanding the effects of droughts, floods and bush-fires, greatly increased Federal Aid Roads and movements of population, as well as grants from the Commonwealth, the danthe effects of external influences on on land settlement in Tasmania. After considering all these factors concerned the commission decided to make general deductions from the grants of the three South Australia 22,000 Western Australia .. 22,000 Tasmania' .. 23,000 I think honourable members will agree The calculations by the commission for the purpose of assessing the grants for the present year are based on the financial It has been sometimes urged that a the economy of the nation. Another factor to be borne in mind is the changing position caused by the uneven growth oi Federal and State responsibilities in relayears, and it has decided to accept the tion to their financial resources. The commission considers that, in'view of flucinstance. I commend the bill to honortuating financial and economic conditions, financial adjustments in the form of special grants cannot be fairly assessed without a searching annual review of the finances and economic conditions of all the States. T shall now refer briefly to the variations of the grants now proposed from those recommended and paid last year. The reduction of £45,000 in South Australia's grant is due in the main to improved economic conditions in 1937-38, the year upon which the present grants are based. The total revenue and the taxation revenue of the State constituted records and a surplus was achieved for the fourth successive year. Whilst the grant recommended for Western Australia is £25,000 in excess of that recommended last year, actually the normal grant now recommended is £117,000 greater than the normal grant of last. year. The normal grant for last year was £614,000, but a deduction of £44,000 was made to adjust an advance made in 3 936-37, the grant actually paid being £570,000. The normal grant recommended for this year is £731,000, from which is deducted a special advance of £136,000 made in 1937-38 on account of drought. The increase of the normal grant is therefore £117,000. This increase is due to the effects of drought, which had just prior to or since the outbreak of the serious repercussions on the income year 3936-37, on which the taxation assessments for 1937-38 were based. The grant recommended for Tasmania ii£20,000 greater than that of last year. This is caused mainly by changes in the relative financial positions of the States. There is ample evidence that the commission, which has been set up as an independent body to investigate the claims of the States for financial assistance, has discharged its duty with thoroughness and in a wholly impartial manner. The Oovernment therefore considers that it must mended by the commission as special grants as bona fide recommendations to adjust the financial needs of the if r . Spender. claimant States. The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Grants Commission in all past commission's recommendations in this able members. Debate (on motion by Mr Foam) adjourned. Treasurer) -by leave-The Treasurer ( Mr Menzies) in his budget speech on the Sth September, indicated that, because of the large increase of expenditure to carry out tlie Government's defence programme, the tax proposals then submitted could not be regarded a* «ita.tic, and that it would be necessary later to submit additional proposals for increased taxation in the present financial year. During the last three or four days (iabinet has given consideration to the matter, and it is thought desirable that an announcement should be made as early as possible as to further imposts which have been decided upon as immediately necessary. In the time that has been available to us since the budget was introduced, we have not had an opportunity completely to review the whole of the tax field, but certain important factors affecting the hudget have made necessary an immediatesurvey at this early stage. Increased expenditure involved by measures taken war is about £6,000,000, and there can be no doubt that, in the year that lies immediately ahead of us, further expenditure will be inevitable. It is also anticipated that, as a direct result of the war there will be substantial reductions of customs revenue. It is yet too early to say what will be the amount, but no one can doubt that it may be substantial. It is not, unreasonable to expect a loss of £5,000.000 or more.

Tho Government has reviewed certain tax fields for the purpose of ascertaining what it can do immediately. It is advisable, as I have indicated, that any additional tax proposals should be made known as early as possible after they have been decided upon, in order that the taxpayers will have some knowledge of their precise liabilities. Honourable members will remember that the budget contains proposals to increase income tax collections by £2,360,000, sales tax by £1,420,000, and customs and excise duties by' £2,1.30,000, making the total of additional tax collections £5,910,000.

Another new tax proposal relates to certain profits of gold-mining which, honourable members, I am sure, will appreciate when I have placed the facts before them, are due solely to circumstances and conditions arising out of the war. Because the price of gold has increased solely because of the outbreak of Avar, the Government believes that the increase of the price of gold represents in substance on unearned increment and should be taxable for war purposes. It was suggested that it might he possible to fix 20s. a fine ounce as the approximate amount of the increase. I think that honourable members will, however, regard as a fairer basis, a tax of 75 per cent, of the amount hy which gold exceeds £9 Australian currency an ounce of fine. gold. A t present profits of gold-mining are exempt from Commonwealth income tax, both as to profits in the hands of gold-mining companies and dividends in the hands of shareholders. These profits are also exempt from most State taxation except i u Western Australia and Tasmania. H i g h prices for gold have benefited the industry for several years. The. war has caused the with the result that the price of gold has risen considerably in the last ten days. For instance, in 193S-39, the average price of gold, was £9 Is. 2d. an oz.; in July, 1939, it rose to £9 43. l i d . ; in August, the price was £9 8s. 7d. The price to-day is £10 10s., an increase of nearly 30s. an oz. over the average for 1938-39. Similar legislation is contemplated in the Union of SouthA f r i c a and Rhodesia, but the Government does not know whether that legislation has yet been implemented. Announcements have appeared in the newspapers that both of these governments intend to appropriate the proceeds of gold over £7 10s. sterling a fine oz. The Union of South Africa in 1933 taxed gold profits heavily when the. South African currency was depreciated to the level of sterling in that year.

The amount of tax collected w ill depend upon the price of gold. If the price averages £10 10s. a fine ounce, die Government will receive about £1,500,000 for the balance of this year. Tlie remaining 25 per cent, of the excess price over the £9 will remain with the companies and shareholders to provide an offset against a rise of mining costs, and will probably provide some additional benefit.

I take this stand, because I remember that, during the Spanish civil war, quite a number of persons left Australia to participate in it.' I understand that the Foreign Enlistments Prohibition Act is still in operation. I should like to know, so soon as the Minister is able to tell me, what the attitude of the Government JS.

In. this matter, we have to be very careful tn see that only the necessities of the situation govern internment. The internal security of Australia is a rather important matter. In view of the peculiar circumstances, I ask the.

I further invite the Prime Minister to make next week a statement which will show how many persons have been released from internment under conditions similar to thpse that operated in the case to which I have referred, and, if the information may lndisclosed by the competent authorities, bow many of those whom it was thought advisable to re-intern have eluded reinternment since instructions to that effect were given.",51,Canbebba Residentia L Accommoda

The honourable gentleman has not yet answered the question as to whether some of those who were released cannot now be located. J. should be glad if he would explain the matter more fully. Mi-. MAKIN (Hindmarsh) [4.3] Some weeks ago, I drew attention to anomalous situations that were arising in respect of certain provisions of the repatriation administration, particularly by reason of the rigidity of the act. The Minister( Mr Harrison) will remember that I said that certain medical decisions were very conflicting and were rather inexplicable at times. I informed him that cases had been brought to my notice of men who had returned from active service medically unfit, had been adjudged as having a disability either due to, or aggravated by, war service, and had been granted pensions which had subsequently been withdrawn although they were still suffering from the same disability. The Minister asked me to cite a specific case which would give a clear idea of the nature of my complaint and substantiate my contention that injustice was being done. I have had brought to my notice a case which I think comes within this category. The man in question approached the repatriation authorities for the accepsuffers from certain abdominal injuries, tance of his disability. It was accepted upon his return to Australia, from active service, and he was given a half-rate pen1919. Almost immediately on his return sion as well as medical treatment. Later, the doctors decided that his disability was discharged as medically unfit and was not to be regarded as due to war. There is nothing more that, this man can do; unless he can bring fresh evidence in support, of his claim, he has no possible hope of obtaining redress. The department already has in its possession all the evidence that he can supply. It would appear that there have been some remarka.hle misunderstandings regarding certain aspects of the case. I shall not disAlthough that was the report of the close any confidences by giving details of this case, for I have not seen the file. All of the information that I now present to the House was obtained from the man himself, Mr R. E. Cragg. He enlisted in August, 1914, at Gawler, the doctor at the recruiting station. He was drafted to Morphettville, but when he presented himself for a second medical examination, he was rejected because his teeth needed attention. Evidently he did not persevere with his enlistment at that time. Instead he went to Port Augusta, where he worked for the Commonwealth Government as a fireman. While there, he was taken ill , while still in the employ of the Commonwealth Government, and was operated on for appendicitis. After his discharge from hospital, he worked with the BrokenH ill Associated Smelters at Port Pirie. There seems to be some confusion as to the cause of his first rejection. Dr. Griffiths, the department's doctor, said that this man's rejection for active service was due to his condition arising from appendicitis, whereas it was due to his dental condition. Mr Cragg enlisted again in January, 1917, and embarked for overseas in May of that year. During the voyage he had the misfortune to be injured in one eye as the result of a hammock stick falling down a wind chute. The accident necessitated several stitches in the wound. Even in regard to that injury, the records appear to be confused, because I understand that they assert that appendicitis developed immediately upon embarkation. The operation for appendicitis was performed in 1915, before his second enlistment. To-day Mr Cragg which have been the cause of much discomfort since his return to Australia in he was treated in hospital. Later he was sent to the Torrens Park hospital by the Medical Board, which certified that his disability was aggravated by his active service. The report statesNoticed trouble as above in right abdomen in France. Still has similar attacks, but otherwise feels well. Discharged, but to return for further treatment if he has any further trouble. Incapacity half. Medical Board, this man has been denied tlie treatment that he should have received in accordance with the board's direction. Two years later D r . Griffiths, who was the Divisional Medical Officer in Adelaide, statedI t is difficult to connect up present disability with war service. Mr Cragg had had some heated word* with Dr. Griffiths, and it is evident that the doctor had not forgotten the incident. Although Dr. Griffiths said that it 'was difficult to connect Mr Cragg's disability with his war service, he recommended that he be supplied with a surgical belt. The case was referred to Dr. Corbin, of Adelaide, for an opinion as to the advisability of an operation. that the man suffered from an old appendicitis trouble, which was not due to war service, and drew attention to the fact that Mr Cragg weighed 15 stone. A t no time was he of slight build ; when he enlisted, at the age of 32 years, his weight was 13 st. 5 lb. On the 13th May, 1921, D r . Griffiths certified that his disability was not due to war service, and cancelled the order which he had previously given for a surgical belt. His report ""statedDisability not sufficient to make him eligible for training and he is fit to work at pre-war occupation. Mr Cragg then endeavoured to do as the doctor suggested; he returned to work, but after two or three months he had to discontinue his employment. He went back to Gawler, where he was examined by Dr. Lewis, who reported, that he was suffering from shooting pains in the right side, which had developed in tions in Canberra was given by the Director France, and that the pain occurred first of the Canberra Tourist Bureau( Mr W. J. H. with heavy l if t in g , and had since been getDunbar) before the Public Works Committee ting more frequent and severe. He said yesterday. that the man was normal except for a large appendicitis scar thickened and was tender. Mr Cragg's cost case was then reported on by a specialist, house in Canberra WHS occupied by fourteen who gave an adverse decision, and sugboarders, some of whom slept in the garage and gested that an increase of 4 stone in others in tents iu the back yard. weight was the cause of his disability. dation,"" Here, again, there seems to he some conand yet tourist services have often to advise fusion, because examined, Mr Craggi n 1921, his weight possible to secure accommodation anywhere."" was 1 st. 9 lb. above his weight at enlistment.

Dr. Lewis then returned to the case and reportedThe above condition is the result oi the strain of war service upon operation scar. Condition not due to his default. Dr. Griffiths again made a recommendation to the department in which he strongly advised rejection of the appeal. This man has now exhausted all possibility of his securing justice unless the Minister takes a personal interest in the case. ter for Repatriation) [ 4 . 1 6 ] I am glad that the honourable member for H in d marsh ( Mr Makin) has brought this matter before me in detail, but, as the Dr. Corbin reported honourable member remarked, he has not seen the departmental file. I think that he w ill agree that, notwithstanding the amount of detail he has put before me, it w ill be necessary for me to acquaint myself with the facts on the file. I shall make this case a personal matter and see what can be done. to urge upon the Prime Minister( Mr. Menzies) the necessity for the application in Canberra of the appeal made by him that business should be carried on as usual. I appeal against any slackening of the works programme in this city. My inspiration for speaking on this matter to-day lies in two reports published in the Canberra Times this morning. The first report isFourteen in Fuur-roomed Ilouse. Evidence of unsatisfactory housing condiThe committee is investigating a proposal which had to construct a new hostel in Canberra at » of £42,500.

181,Mr Collins,"Mr Dunbar admittedmember for Hume( Mr Collins), a member of the Public Works Committee, says that the witness admitted that that case was isolated. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the people of Canberra have difficulty in obtaining residential: accommodation, either houses or lodgings, and within my lifetime 1 hope to see tlie disparity between the supply and the demand made up. The position has become worse every year since I first came to Canberra as a member of Parliament five years ago.

If any individuals have offered their services in this direction, I imagine that they are few. At this juncture, the Government, I think, would take no action to prevent such enlistments.

The honourable member is informed in connection with the matter that, at various times since the inception of the present sales tax legislation, the effect, of changing over to a multiple turnover tax has been considered.

Some of them are(u 1 the costs and difficulties of administering such a tax would greatly exceed the costs and difficulties o'. the present form of sales tax.
