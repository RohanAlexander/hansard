Second Reading Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories) (10.01 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Commonwealth funding for the vocational education and training sector for the years 1994 and 1995 has already been appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill provides for supplementation to these amounts in line with price movements. The bill also appropriates funding for 1996, in accordance with the Commonwealth's undertaking in the heads of government agreement to establish the Australian National Training Authority to provide triennial funding for the vocational education and training sector. The year 1996 also sees further evidence of the government's commitment to expansion of the vocational education and training sector through the provision of a further $70 million in growth funds. This brings total growth funding since 1993 to $1.1 billion. The Commonwealth, in turn, expects states and territories to honour their undertakings in the ANTA agreement, including maintaining their own effort in vocational education and training. This bill also provides funding-$25.9 million from 1994, including $2.4 million for monitoring purposes-to ANTA for support for off-the-job training provider assistance under the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships, including assistance for both public and private training providers. As the government announced in the white paper, we are committed to the task of achieving 50,000 additional entry level training places by 1995-96. An integral part of this is achieving an additional 16,000 trainees in that time. In 1995 and 1996, an additional $12.8 million and $22.7 million respectively is available for this purpose. When this is combined with the $70 million growth funds that the government is providing in each of 1995 and 1996, as well as the transitional funding of $20.4 million in 1994 and $10 million in 1995 provided in the budget, the government expects these costs to be more than adequately met. The government expects ANTA to report separately each year on progress towards achieving a target of 35,000 trainees by 1995-96, under the $2.4 million being provided to monitor these grants. The bill provides that these additional funds will only go to those states and territories that are able to demonstrate to ANTA that they have achieved additional trainees. This bill also adjusts funding to ANTA from July 1994 to allow the ACT to enter the national infrastructure program for vocational education and training. This places the ACT on the same footing as all other states and territories in terms of national planning for vocational education and training facilities.",111,Vocational Education And That Most People In This House Would Have Training Funding Amendment Had Some Personal Experience With

473,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for956 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 I present the explanatory memorandum to this bi11 and commend the bi11 to the House. Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to seek your guidance. The government also intends to move one amendment which, if it is possible, I would not mind moving at this point. initiatives on the national training wage and the initiative to increase funding for off-the-job training under the Australian traineeship scheme and career start traineeships. The government amendment relates to the proposed new section 9A, which deals with the Australian traineeship scheme and career start traineeships. Clause4 of the bi11 proposes to insert a new section 9A to empower the minister to increase funding to a state where participation in traineeships in that state increases as a result of initiatives in the government's white paper and, as a result, the demand for off-the-job training in that state increases. The clause refers only to the Australian traineeship scheme and the career start traineeship. It is necessary to amend the proposed subsection 9A(l) because the proposed national training wage award wi11 general1y subsume the Australian traineeship scheme and career start traineeships and provide for future traineeships to be under that award. Therefore, the proposed subsection 9A(I) wi11 extend eligibility for funding for eligible off-the-job training to a state. A new subsection would be added to define eligible off-the-job training. Eligible off-the-job training would now include the national training wage traineeships as wel1 as the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships schemes, which the minister considers should be taken into account for the purposes of determining that there has been an increase in the number of people receiving off-the-job training in a state. Training Funding Amendment Bi11 1994. The background to this bi11 is that the Commonwealth provides grants to the states and territories for the provision and support of the vocational education and training, primary and technical and further education system. Prior to 1 January 1994, grants to the states and territories were provided in accordance with the provisions of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989. These grants contributed to general operating costs and recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants. From1 January 1994, the funding arrangements under the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989 were replaced by funding arrangements under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Under the new arrangements, a single pool of funds comprising the previously separate recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants is passed to ANTA for al1ocation amongst the states and territories. The Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 gave effect to an agreement announced by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) on 21 July 1992. That is over 27 months ago. This was an agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories for the establishment of ANTA. I would like to remind the committee of the objectives of the agreement. They included the fol1owing: the establishment of a national vocational education and training system; closer interaction between industry, vocational education and training providers; an effective training market; and, improved cross-sectoral links. That is the background to this debate which I think is very important at this stage when trying to meet those objectives. I wi11 be drawing this debate back to those objectives which have been set out and which have been agreed to, particularly the objectives of an effective training market and a national system.",113,Representatives Main Committee

476,Mr Miles (Braddon) (10.05 A.m.),"I rise to speak on the Vocational Education andThursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 957 Within this bill, the main provisions are in clause 4. It will insert new sections 9 and 9A and, I think, 9A(I)-it is the latest one which has come in-into the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Section9 currently provides for payments to ANTA for allocation under the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 of $638.96 million in 1994 and $719.741 million in 1995. The effect of the new section will be to amend the amounts payable to ANTA in the following manner: it will increase the amount payable in 1994 from $638.96 million to $673.612 million and the amount for 1995 from $719.741 million to $755.71 million. It will set out the amount payable for 1996. It is a very substantial amount which we are putting into this part of education in Australia. That figure which we are dealing with in this discussion is $835.52 million. So we are not talking about a small amount of money; it is a substantial part of the appropriations for 1996. There is a lot of money involved. Australia is going through a tremendous amount of change in this sector of the educational area. In this area of administration a lot of difficulties are surfacing. The real issues that we need to face are: what are the intentions of the federal government; and what are its strategies as outlined in the white paper? Is the government really focused on increasing and improving the skills of Australians or is it more interested in trying to pull down the unemployment figures just for a gloss effect out there for public perception purposes? I raise that as a very important point: what are we about? It would appear to me, from my reading and from talking to the state ministers who are in negotiations on various aspects of training and skilling in Australia, that there are some deep concerns. I come to a report which the government at the moment does not want to provide to the public. It is a report by Vince Fitzgerald. A copy has been provided to me. One of the chapters is entitled, 'Successful reform'; the heading is 'Inadequate performance planning and reporting.' It says: Continued reliance on Frameworks, Guidelines, Policies, Procedures, Protocols, Memorandums and the other paraphernalia of government avoids the central question of what is the performance target, what is the work and business plan and where are the annual reports against reform targets for each of those agencies or organisations actually responsible for the reforms. We are dealing with millions and millions of dollars here. As I said, in 1996 it was over $800 million. These funding proposals are in place at the moment and we support them. We could really label this debate 'funding for failure' or 'funding without focus'. I am not sure which one we should adopt. It certainly can be described as 'funding without focus' at the moment. We are not going to skill this country and we are not going to develop a more competent work force unless this money is effectively used and unless there are administrative arrangements in place which set up clear measurable targets that are identifiable publicly and that are achieved. At the moment, all the evidence indicates that money is being allocated by the parliament, but the progress is not very great. There is deep concern out there by a whole range of people, organisations and industry who are involved in this area. This report says that there are 'confused accountabilities and responsibilities'. We are at the very early stages of trying to re-skill and up-skill Australia. We have an in-depth report which says that it is two years since the Prime Minister announced changes in this area and that there is total confusion in regard to accountabilities. It says: Below the level of the Ministerial Council, it is difficult to draw clear lines of accountability for the implementation of training reforms. 958 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 If we are going to make progress and if there is not to be so much red tape and bureaucracy in this field, the government has got to give some clear direction to this whole field. The report says in conclusion to this particular chapter: Our assessment ... relates to both the substance of the national training reforms themselves and to their strategic management. In both areas they have been found wanting. So the very nature, the essence, of what the government says the reforms are about is found wanting in a report that the minister is too concerned to make public because the providers, business and industry are deeply concerned about the way in which this whole thing is operating, because the very nature of the program which is being envisaged is, some people would say, a sham. The report finds the reforms wanting with regard to strategic management. The whole direction for ANTA really comes back to the federal government. I know the state minister is also involved in the set-up of the council, but it is this government that is driving the agenda and has responsibility to make it work and, clearly, there is lack of direction from the government. It does not know which way to go now. It wants to go in a certain way. It wants a top-down approach to government. It wants to have centralised control over so many things in this country. Again we see a dynamic tension among the goals I mentioned earlier about the establishment of ANTA. Let us consider the goal of a 'closer interaction between industry and vocational education training and training providers'. The fact is that industry out there is saying that there is not this genuine interaction. There might be in a few cases, but it is not substantial and it is not right across the board. There are literally thousands of people out there in businesses who are ignored, one could say, if not locked out of the training procedures. The act also sets out the goals of an effective training market and other objectives which the government and the council have agreed to but they are simply not being realised. I move on just to make two more key points. One is a concern that these proposed funding levels as set out are unrealistically low, and that the government is really trying to force an agenda onto the states which is going to cause problems. The agreements between the states and the federal government have not yet been made, and I suspect that at the end of the day we may be back here having to allocate more money, because what the federal government has done over the years in other areas it is now doing in this area: it is palming off certain responsibilities to the states, giving them a certain amount of money, but expecting them to do far more than that money will ever achieve. I can relate that to education and to lots of other fields, such as health and law and order. They are state areas of responsibility that the government keeps cutting the real funding for, while still expecting the states to do something about them. It is about to do the same, I suspect, in regard to vocational education and training. The third thing which I want to highlight is that this bill is also notable for giving the Commonwealth minister power to determine whether states are meeting targets for new trainees rather than leaving that task to the ANTA board. Why does it have to be the federal minister who has the power to determine whether the targets have been met? Why can it not be left to the ANTA board? Of course, this parallels the eleventh-hour amendment to the ANTA act in December 1993 which allowed the Commonwealth minister to overrule the ANTA board and the ministerial council in determining whether states have succeeded in meeting maintenance of effort requirements. It is a pure set-up-nothing more and nothing less. There Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 959 is a centralising of power and control by the federal minister in this area which is totally unsatisfactory. It is interesting to look at a few figures in this area. The white paper talks about a target of 46,000 apprentices in 1994. In 1990 there were 162,600 apprentices. People might say that we have got traineeship schemes, that we are going to have apprentices and a whole host of other schemes brought in, and that that means people are going to become diversified, they are just not going to be in apprenticeships. But when we look at that target it is stiII about 20,000 less than the 162,600 apprenticeships we had in 1990 in this country. What is going on in this area of training? This is an area where those opposite feel extremely vulnerable and guilty because, over the decade they have been in government, they have done little in regard to TAFE education. These figures indicate their paucity of action and total lack of administrative focus. They may talk about the Australian traineeship scheme-a great brainwave, a great idea. Did it work? Were the targets reached? What was the outcome? The outcome was that from 1985 to 1993 there were 80,291 students who commenced traineeship schemes, but fewer than 70 per cent finished. This government says it is about action but at the end of the day, when we have a look at whether it is meeting its targets, we will find it is usually failing. I want to go into more detail about what is in this report because it goes to the heart of where TAFE education and training is. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the Main Committee is of the view that the Government should be condemned for the lack of direction in its approach to training reform and its mismanagement of this vitally important area"". I want to go through some of the comments which are being made about this reform process. There are eight key elements to training reform and where this money, about $800 million for 1996, which we are allocating here today, will go. These areas cover competency based training, about which we have heard in the past, competency standards, national recognition of training, curriculum delivery and assessment, entry level training, training market, access and equity, and funding for training. Some of those words sound pretty highfalutin and that is about where they have been left. To give you a few ideas of the problems we see arising in this area, the report which was done for the government by a highly professional group of people says, in regard to competency based training, that there is conceptual confusion, a lack of understanding, poor marketing and promotion, high costs, failure to integrate, failure to convert and inadequate strategy. It is interesting that, in some of these areas, even the results are very hard to identify-for example, in regard to competency based training. Let me refer to the report and give you a few ideas as to the problems that are likely to arise in this area. It says that there is conceptual confusion, lack of understanding, poor marketing and promotion, high costs, failure to integrate, failure to convert and an inadequate strategy. It is interesting that in some of these areas even the results are hard to identify. For example, with regard to competency based training, the report says that the 'results are difficult to define with any degree of precision.' Therefore, not only are there no results, but all of these weaknesses have been found in the processes involved in developing a new training system here in Australia. It is totally unsatisfactory. 960 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 I will now move onto the second area of competency standards. It is pretty important in this area to have certain standards of competence for the people involved in training. What are the weaknesses in this area? ANTA says that the weaknesses are far more complicated and resource intensive than initially thought and that they will take up a lot more money and effort than ever we expected. Will this money achieve good competence levels and standards? Industry standards are being developed by bodies which are unrepresentative of the key enterprises in those industries. We are finding that some standards are being developed out there, but they are being developed on the fringe and certainly not in the heartland of the very important industries of Australia. Where are we going to end up if the standards are being set by people who are not in the mainstream of the industry? The report goes on to say that the eight-level ASF discourages labour flexibility. The practical relationship between the NTB endorsed standards and the Mayer competencies is unclear. And this is a report commissioned by the government. The report further says that as competency standards in their current form are conceived as a series of tasks, their translation into a flexible curriculum is difficult, if not impossible. Are we getting a more flexible training market or are we getting a more rigid market? In other words, are the users of this system going to have great difficulty in getting the types of courses that they want? What does the report say about the national recognition of training? Are we making good progress in the national recognition of a nationwide system? The report says that there has been a failure to convince enterprises of a value adding capability and that there has been inadequate involvement of industry. I thought that one of the key goals of setting up ANTA was to get interaction between industry, business, training and TAFE colleges and that it would be a cooperative, collaborative partnership. It is not happening. Two years after the Prime Minister announced this, it is not happening. It is said to be inadequate: in accreditation, certification and in the recognition of processes. Fundamental problems are arising with the government's strategy in this. It really opens up the question of whether the working paper strategy on training in Australia is about training or whether it is about trying to reduce the numbers of the unemployment figures. The report also says that one of the weaknesses in this area is a bias towards inputs rather than outputs. But what about the curriculum? What is the nature of the curriculum for the people who are going to be involved in this area-the delivery and the assessment? With respect to this area, the report says that 'national curriculum initiatives take too long to become operational', that they get bogged down, and that they do not get out and have an effect in the areas where thousands of Australians, mainly young Australians, want to increase their skills. The national curriculum effort is too institutionally oriented. It fails to deal adequately with the needs of enterprises. In other words, it is a top-down approach, with centralised control by the government, and the government does not listen to Australians to find out what sort of training they want. The government does not listen to industry or enterprise. It says, 'We know what to do. We are going to impose our approach on them, and they can just take what they get.' That is the approach that the government is taking. The government has got to make a decision in regard to training in Australia as to whether it is going to continue to have a top-down approach, or whether it will have a bottom-up approach, where the users have some say about what they want to be trained in, rather than being told by bureaucrats and getting caught up in red tape. To give clarity to our administrators in this area, real responsibility must come from the government. The government Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 961 is sitting on its hands. In a couple of years time, I suspect that we are going to be looking at a disaster in this area. The government is on notice to get it right. The report to the government on curriculum delivery and assessment says that no-one is clear about how far a national course can be varied in content to meet the specific needs of an enterprise, while retaining integrity as a course leading to a qualification. This leads to rigidities in training. In other words, in regard to flexibility, there is no-one at this stage who knows how to slightly modify a course and still have it accredited. That is absolutely disgraceful. Here we are today talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, and yet no-one can tell us how there can be flexibility in these courses. The report says that the take-up rates of the national curriculum are apparently poor. The government has been saying that there are lots of people out there taking it up. That is not true. The report says that they are not really taking it up. The coverage might be good, but nobody is taking it up. Another point of weakness, according to the report, is the lack of responsiveness by TAFE providers to the needs of enterprises. Again, the problem in this area is that it is a top-down approach by the government. I could go on. There are distinct weaknesses in the area of entry level training, but time does not permit me to go into detail. There are enormous problems in the training market. With access and equity it is the same, as it is for funding for training. There is a list of areas with problems and weaknesses in managing the reform process. The government has a total lack of direction and focus in regard to training. We are debating the allocation of millions of dollars worth of extra funding, but the government has not put in place the due structures and processes to ensure that Australians are adequately trained and skilled. There are tens of thousands of Australians out there who want to go into vocational education and training. They do not want to go on to university. This is a very important area, and yet we are throwing money at it without putting in place the due processes. This report indicates that the government has to act, otherwise businesses will not have trained people, and enterprises will not be able to compete in world markets because they will not have the skills in their work force. I urge everybody here to accept my proposed amendment to this bill. Bendigo has seconded the motion. Funding Amendment Bill replaces the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989, and will set the level of Commonwealth vocational funding for the period 1994-96. Nothing that I have seen or heard in the House or in this place can convince me that the opposition has any serious thoughts about vocational education and training in this nation. The opposition, it appears, has yet to grasp the fact that a well-trained and skilled work force can more ably compete in the international trading community. Individual members of the opposition and, of course, the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Miles), referred to a number of reports. I intend to refer to a number of reports as well, so I hope that he stays and pays attention to what I am about to say. There are a number of people who contribute regularly to education debate, but the number of people on the opposition side who contribute can be counted on the fingers of one hand. If you count those who contribute in a constructive manner, the number is far less. It is a",114,Representatives Main Committee

478,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (10.35 A.m.),"The Vocational Education and Training962 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 exception this morning, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we have 11 speakers on this particular bill. Perhaps that shows some progress in terms of the coalition, but unfortunately-and sadly-the coalition position on education is one of indifference. The policy position of the coalition can only be described as irrelevant and out of touch with the needs of our schools and our institutions. Why do those at the cutting edge of the delivery of education and training services in this country believe that the coalition is totally extraneous and that it has lost the plot when it comes to policy matters? One could argue that the level of informed debate in the House has actually dropped over the last three or four years. People would not have to look past the number of questions without notice that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the then shadow minister, put to the government about employment, education and training in the last term of government. The answer: four-a miserable number-plus two questions that he asked a few days ago. To put it in perspective, that means that the former shadow minister asked a total of four questions about education and training over a three-year period. Not a bad average for a party which claims to be serious about employment, education and training in this country! It is no wonder that we on this side consider members of the opposition beneath contempt when they come into the House or this place ranting and raving about something that they really do not understand. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Downer) time and time again becomes confused about the policies of the coalition, so what chances do his backbenchers have? The coalition's policy is even more unrealistic in vocational education, in meeting the current and future expectations of business and the community. The effect of the coalition policies that are speJt out in the policy document Fightback, in comparison to our own stance on TAFE funding, would result in an overall reduction in funding of $27 million. In fact, the minister pointed out that it would actually add up to about $30 million in resources made available to the national TAFE system. Just remember that that $27 million hole was on expenditure prior to the commitments that we made to this year's Working Nation document. Over the last few years this government has put TAFE and vocational education high on its priorities within the employment, education and training portfolio. Over a four-year period we have seen three major reports produced by the government on this subject. We did not produce the reports so that they would sit idly on a desk somewhere accumulating dust; indeed, we have adopted many of the principles espoused in the reports. The first, of course, is the report of the Deveson Training Costs Review Committee, which was released in 1990. This is a very important document because it sets the agenda for future reforms and it also makes the states acutely aware that they could not go it alone. The major recommendations are wide-ranging in terms of the way in which the whole approach to training needs to be reformed. Importantly, it stresses the need to provide a greater consistency across the state systems in respect of the development of curriculum and accreditation and in recognition of the skills already obtained. Further recommendations are set out in the Finn report, which was released in 1991. I do not know how many members have read the reportcould be described as the benchmark for reform for post-compulsory education in Australia,",119,Representatives Main Committee
479,Mr Miles,That's all history.,120,Representatives Main Committee
480,Mr Sawford,"It is not history for you, because you do not know about it. The reportThursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 963 and it sets targets for the government to achieve in secondary, tertiary and vocational education for young people. The targets recommended in the Finn report are, admittedly, ambitious, but they are certainly highly desirable for the creation of a highly skilled and competitive work force. The final targets which it set are that, by the year 2001, there should be: a level 2 traineeship or progress towards a higher level vocational or academic qualification for almost all 20-year-olds; and at least a vocational or academic qualification above level 3, or a diploma or a degree, for at least 50 per cent of 20-year-olds. The principles of these reports have been adopted by the government. With the cooperation of the states, many of the recommendations are already in place and many more are well on the way to being achieved. Then came the report by the Employment and Skills Foundation Council headed by Laurie Carmichael. The Carmichael report recognised that education and training should be a lifetime process, rather than a one-off process at the beginning of or before a person's working life. The principles of the Carmichael report are based on competency rather than time or process. The recommendations have, importantly, set the groundwork for the introduction of the training wage as outlined in the white paper. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training( Mr Crean) recently pointed out, the importance of the training wage cannot be underestimated. It will introduce for the first time an adult wage, in line with the Carmichael principle, based on competency rather than time or process. Once the relevant skills have been acquired, a person then moves on from a training wage. The training wage will also simplify the complexity of rates which apply to youth. This would not have been possible without the involvement and agreement between the ACTU and the peak bodies of employers. Those peak bodies of employers include: the Metal Trades Industry Association, which, I might add, recognised the importance of what we are trying to achieve at a very early stage of the negotiations; the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; the Business Council of Australia; the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry; the Retail Traders Association-and, of course, we would not forget the National Farmers Federation. If, according to the Liberal-National parties, our position on vocational education and training and the general thrust of the white paper on employment and growth are fundamentaIly wrong, why is it that they are the only odd ones out? Persons receiving training on the job will also qualify for the training wage, which, in tum, will add force to the process of enterprise bargaining. Enterprise agreements are now very much a part of everyday industrial relations, although it did take employers quite a while initiaIly to be comfortable with the ideas of these agreements. Both employers and employees now see a benefit in enterprise agreements. More than one million workers under federal awards are now covered by workplace agreements. All of them have been finalised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission since October 1991. Half of those 2,000 agreements have been registered in the past 12 months. Almost 50 per cent of workers under federal awards are now covered by agreements, and 90 per cent of businesses with 500 or more employees in the federal system have workplace agreements. In the next 12 to 24 months, I expect there will be a steady increase in the number of enterprise agreements signed, particularly from the small and medium enterprise sector. What the members of the opposition do not realise is that there is a revolution going on out there in the workplace. They are still arguing about the merits of the Stone Age industrial relations document of the member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), 10bsback, not realising that time has already passed them by. The policy hole left by the out-of-date and out-of-touch 964 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 10bsback policy document is yet to be addressed by the opposition, with many still adhering to the teaching of 10bsback like lemmings over the cliff. The training wage is a watershed achievement in the skills formation agenda of this county and is essential to avoid skill blockages which, in the past, have dogged Australian industry in every economic recovery. It is competency based. It will overwhelmingly provide greater assistance for the long-term unemployed to obtain gainful employment. The government has recognised that economic growth alone wiII not reduce the overall number of people enduring long periods of unemployment. An active policy was needed to intervene and reduce the wasteful nature of long-term unemployment. Now the training wage is aimed directly at that very problem. In previous recoveries, six out of every seven jobs went to new entrants to the labour market and not to the long-term unemployed. The long-term unemployed are not normally jobs ready, so the training wage goes a long way to help solve this problem, along with other active employment programs administered by the government. TAFE in Australia has undergone a major refocusing and expansion in real terms to meet the changing needs of employers. To reach the achievement levels set by the Commonwealth, states and territories, the Australian National Training Authority was created. The objectives of the agreement included: the establishment of a national vocational education and training system; closer interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers; an effective training market; and improved cross-sectoral links. These changes were prompted in particular by the recommendations of those government reports which I have already mentioned, and the government has firmly resolved to bring excellence into the training area. As TAFE is now more relevant in providing the skills for a person to become more employable, it is a real alternative to other forms of post-secondary education. Although TAFE has expanded the number of places available, the heavy increase in demand from students is outstripping the ability to meet those needs. money into the construction and upgrading of TAFE facilities. The Commonwealth realised that the states would not be in any position to deal with the expected increase. While some states, early in the piece, believed the Commonwealth was attempting to take over their traditional role in TAFE services, they now realise that the TAFE system which existed at the time would have buckled under the strain. As a result, the states are now quite happy to cooperate and take the money from Canberra. The Commonwealth is, and has always been, happy for states to have major control over TAFE, on the understanding that they act in cooperation with the Commonwealth and the other states. By 1996, the Commonwealth contribution to the states in respect of TAFE funding will have reached $858 million, which is double the funding of the early 1990s-and a considerable outlay, in anybody's language. The fact that applications to universities have fallen in recent times can be directly attributed to the increase in the number of placements offered and the number of students now applying to TAFE colleges, and to the realisation of young people themselves that the needs of the future are in fact for technical and operative skills. Unfortunately, I suspect the number of unsuccessful applicants will increase until the Commonwealth, together with the states, is able to increase the physical capacity of our TAFE colleges. The problem is that, whilst the Commonwealth is providing the funds for expansion, there is a considerable inert period after the funding is made available: that is, from the time",120,Representatives Main Committee

That is why this government is pouring large sums ofThursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 965 a state government approves an individual project-with reference to all the relevant parliamentary committees-until the completion of the construction. In the first six months of this year, in my own state of South Australia, about 6,000 people were unsuccessful in their attempt to access TAFE education and training. Although that lack of 6,000 places is unacceptable, South Australia is in fact better placed in TAFE than are most of the other states. Of course, South Australia has always been considered a leader in the provision of vocational and TAFE courses and, although we currently have an odd collection of members who make up the Liberal state government, the current state Minister for Employment and TAPE, Bob Such, has so far shown credible leadership in this area-despite the state Liberals' ambivalence in alI matters educational. Under the new arrangements, a single pool of funds-comprising the previous separate recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants-wiII be passed to the Australian National Training Authority and wiII provide for greater flexibility in the funding of the TAFE system. The functions of ANTA include allocation and remission of funds to state and territory training agencies, and the administration of any programs requiring national delivery, on the basis of guidelines determined from time to time by the ministerial council. The biII also provides for the creation of an additional 50,000 places, comprising the following: 14,000 new apprenticeship places; 15,000 ATS/CST traineeships; 1,000 Commonwealth trainees; 5,000 off-the-job training places; and 10,000 new places within the current labour market. These places are a direct result ,of the government's white paper process, and are part of the government's strategy for a falI to an unemployment rate of five per cent by the tum of the century. The coalition is arguing that we wiII not get the economic growth needed to meet those targets, but economic commentators now not only believe that our forecast is achievable but are also confident that we wiII exceed this anticipated growth. The Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force figures, released for the month of July, reinforce our belief that our targets are very much obtainable; and, of course, that good news was reinforced in the Australian Financial Review this morning. Employment in July grew to a record 7.97 million jobs, with growth in employment for the month of July standing at 90,000, which, I stress, is the third largest monthly increase on record. The unemployment rate for July fell to 9.5 per cent, down half a percentage point in just one monthMrs Crosio interjectingrecent times. I thank the member for Prospect for her interjection. Mrs Crosio-They can't stand it! considerable amount, but the participation rate also increased by 0.3 per cent to 63.2 per cent. These are very good signs, which suggest sustainable employment growth. Without the presence of inflationary pressure to impede Australia's economic prosperity, the outlook is indeed promising. The coalition's response in relation to the unemployment problem is that our proposals wiII do nothing but hide the number of unemployed in training places. When year 12 retention rates in 1983 went from 36 per cent to over 80 per cent, as they are now under this government,",122,Representatives Main Committee

Not only did the unemployment rate drop by a966 MAIN COMMfITEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 one would have thought this was also a good thing, but the coalition's response was much the same. The only response was that they would hide the unemployed. It is a pretty shallow argument, without much thought attached to it. Members of the opposition forget about all the barriers which stop the long-term unemployed from getting a job. They forget that without the assistance of the measures contained in the white paper, the long-term unemployed would have Buckley's chance of landing a job. It is clear this government is on target to meet its commitment to vocational education and to the unemployed in this country, contrary to anything that members opposite may claim. In concluding, it is appropriate to reflect on comments made by Mr Ivan Deveson. Responding to the white paper on behalf of the Business Council of Australia, he said: There is a wide spread belief in the community that Australia should not be prepared to live with high unemployment. The white paper responds to this belief. It is welcomed by the Business Council. His rationale addressing the problem of long-term unemployment from a business point of view is quite simple, and could not be disputed by any member of this parliament. There are sound economic reasons why long-term unemployment needs to be tackled. Unemployment wastes talent and skills. I think it is time the opposition realised this. We understand that this week members of the opposition have not have a good week. Many issues that were raised in the House were confused, and strategies were confused. But this particular bill, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994, has received the support of the parliament, and it needs the support of this Main Committee. I commend the bill to the committee. Education and Training Funding Amendment BiII 1994 and to support the amendment moved so ably by my colleague, the member for Braddon( Mr Miles). I am pleased that the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford) is present in this chamber, because the member for Port Adelaide sees himself as perhaps one of the leading education people in the government ranks, and I have a particular matter which I wish to draw to his attention so that he can raise it with the minister. It is quite obvious that people in education in my area recognise the inadequate attention that is being given by the government to linking vocational training with academic studies. I refer, Mr Deputy Speaker, to a program which was forwarded to me which is called the Bendigo EDGE project: E for education, D for diversity, G for gains and E for employment. The Bendigo EDGE project is intended to give Bendigo students the edge in future employment. It has been recognised by the schools in my area that there is a huge gap between vocational training and academic studies, and they have put forward an excellent submission. The schools that are involved in the Bendigo EDGE project are the Catholic College Bendigo, Bendigo Senior Secondary College and Girton Grammar School, and the training providers involved are the Central Victorian Group Training Company and the Loddon Campaspe College of TAFE. They have had several meetings, which were facilitated through the Central Victorian Group Training Company Ltd with the Bendigo Senior Secondary College and the Catholic College Bendigo Senior Campus, and they have confirmed a joint desire and a joint will to institute two pilot programs in 1995. It is intended to enable the establishment of a three-year VCE course that will incorporate a retail training scheme and career start traineeship through the",123,Represent Atives Main Committee
485,Mr Reid (Bendigo) (10.52 A.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to comment on the VocationalThursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 967 Catholic College Bendigo, and a hospitality or similar training program through the Bendigo Senior Secondary College. What it has planned to combine with the introduction of these two pilot programs is the linking of vocational training with academic studies. The current thinking from the schools that are promoting this course is that each program would involve up to 20 students in the initial intake. Those schools have recognised that there is a huge gap which the government is giving insufficient and inadequate attention to and they have also enlisted the support of a number of regional organisations. Amongst those organisations supporting this vocational training are: the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Affirmative Action in Training, the Bendigo Regional Development Board, the Small Business Association, the Bendigo Tourism Board, Bendigo Central Traders, the Bendigo Chamber of Commerce, Eaglehawk Traders, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Hotels Association. The object is to include the students in this vocational training and to link it with their VCE studies. The project objective is to implement integrated courses of study and training models across the three VCE providers in Bendigo. This will test a combination of school and work based pathways across a range of different industries including retail, hospitality and office clerical traineeships over an extended three-year period. In other words, it is extending the VCE course to three years and it is including vocational training in this VCE course. Included in this objective is the opportunity to cross-match students from one VCE institution to another and also to bring back students who have left the VCE course and are at risk of receiving no formal education and training. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, you have young people in your community who have drifted away from VCE studies because they do not think that the government is giving adequate attention to vocational training and really equipping them for employment after they have completed their studies. That has been recognised by the educational authorities in my region and it has widespread support. They are looking for funding from the government because the administrative bodies who will be involved in this with the schools include the following: the Directorate of School Education, which is a Victorian state department; the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which is the federal office; the Office of Training and Further Education, which is a state body; the AVC Joint Task Force, which is a federal and state responsibility; and the Catholic Education Office. The project conveners, Central Victorian Group Training Co. Ltd, have approached me and also the government to have a pilot program which will involve a minimum of 50 students. These students will be selected from Catholic College, Bendigo Senior Secondary College and Girton Grammar. I do not believe the funding they are seeking for this is unreasonable; I think it is quite reasonable. They are seeking $60,000 to implement this pilot program in 1995 over those three secondary colleges in Bendigo to enable those students to take up these traineeships and get vocational training as well as including their academic studies. I think that what we have seen here is a first-class initiative by a group of education authorities which have recognised the difficulties the government is experiencing in giving adequate attention to linking the two programs-linking vocational study with their academic studies. Too often the focus on training is restricted to one area; it is restricted either to academic studies or to vocational studies. The linkage between the two is often inferior and is not subject to a government 968 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 directive and a government influence that would give adequate attention to linking vocational training with academic studies. The submission objectives on which this program is based are important. Some of the objectives are: the ability to show how students and trainees can be interrelated; to confirm the sources of ongoing funding; to clearly show how competencies are to be addressed in general key competencies and to demonstrate the development of key competencies and how they will be assessed; application of the program across the many curriculum areas; clearly showing that the funding will be required for only this first year of the three-year pilot program; consideration about designing a training record book for each student participating in the pilot program; and the appointment of a project officer to manage the program, responsible to a management committee. The aim is to clearly state the guidelines for the pilot project: where we are starting from, what the pilot program will do and the changes within the objectives of the AVCTS. It must also clearly show that this project is a progression from the THRIVE feasibility study. General equality must be present. I think that the organisation has done a thorough job of research of the local needs of the students. It has stressed the objectives which it hopes to achieve for this training program, bearing in mind what the requirements are of the participants and what the requirements are of the prospective future employers. I mentioned some of the organisations earlier. Most of those organisations, such as the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Bendigo Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Hotels Association, are major potential employers of these young people who would receive this blend of vocational training and academic studies. It is important that the support of those groups be maintained. They have given their support to the organisation and to the pilot program. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the member for Prospect( Mrs Crosio), would be interested in this project to extend the VCE course to three years and include vocational training interlinked with academic studies. That has not been undertaken by the government at the moment and I wish that the member for Prospect would take this on board, because I know she is interested in education. I think this has a lot of merit. A lot of young people drop out of the VCE course because it is too narrowly focused on academic achievements rather than vocational training which will equip them for a job. I am pleased that the member for Prospect has taken note of that and obviously will be referring it to the minister. There is not a great deal of money involved in this course, $60,000 as a pilot program. Those leading schools in Bendigo, Bendigo Senior Secondary College, Catholic College Bendigo and Girton Grammar School, have been leaders in Victoria in educational training for a number of years. In fact, Bendigo Senior Secondary College was the first college in Australia that had a senior level, just years 11 and 12, and that was started by my former colleague, the Honourable Lindsay Thompson, when he was Minister for Education in Victoria. It was really a pilot program for the development of senior secondary colleges throughout Australia. WhatI am putting to the chamber is that here is an innovative program put forward with the joint cooperation of Catholic College Bendigo, Bendigo Senior Secondary College and Girton Grammar School, with the backing of a whole range of employer organisations, to link vocational training and academic studies over three years in the VCE course. I cannot see any reason that that project could not be eminently satisfactory and give many students the opportunity to broaden their base of understanding of what happens in the real Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 969 world of work and employment. They can link that understanding in with their academic studies, gain the practical experience out in the work force and therefore equip themselves to deal with a whole range of situations. The institutional based pilots that they are seeking approval of have tested one of the foIlowing features: firstly, a combination of time spent at work and study, including continuing education in key competencies for school leavers who have completed year 10 or year 11; secondly, vocational training and work experience provided within upper secondary schools; and, thirdly, a vocational year consisting of vocational training and work experience provided within institutions such as schools or TAFE colJeges up to year 13. The comment from the group is that it is breaking new ground, but it believes the concept of the three colleges working together in different industry groups with the group training company has captured the imagination and support of people who are involved in future employment opportunities for these people. What we need to do now is have the support of the government to fund this pilot program and ensure that it sees this as an exciting new pilot program for young people and as an opportunity to provide them with employment opportunities and a broader based educational program linked in with different vocations. I have principaIly mentioned two areas. One is the hospitality industry, which is obviously one industry that is growing quite rapidly and, with the advent of the Olympic Games in the year 2000, an industry which we need to train young people in so that they gain the professional skills. The second area I have mentioned is the retail trade. There is always a constant demand for people with retail skills to participate in that work force as well. I ask the member for Prospect to take up that issue with the minister and ensure that he looks at that submission favourably. I believe that it is an opportunity for young people to gain a very broad based educational experience, an opportunity for them to participate in vocational training at the same time as they pursue their academic studies. a.m.)-I am particularly pleased to speak on this Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill. While acknowledging what the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Reid) has said, I am particularly concerned at a motion before this committee from the previous speaker for the opposition, the member for Braddon( Mr Miles). Quite frankly, this bill before the House is really all about improving the skills of our Australian work force and, by doing that, it is also about training. While the bill itself contains amendments, it reaIly is complementing what we have brought down as a government with a white paper. It is a decision that was not taken lightly; it foIl owed extensive consultation. I really believe that such an inane type of amendment before a bill such as this coming before this Main Committee needs a lot of investigation. The bill that we have here now delivers on the commitments and particularly on the promises made by our government following that Working Nation white paper. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford) had already referred to the Finn report. Certainly, the Finn report's recommendations are what really this bill is all about, and I also would like to touch on some of that. There have been many words written on training during this decade. The Finn report and the Carmichael report have provided a framework for our government's actions. Indeed, this bill provides growth funding to help achieve the participation in training targets for our young people following that Finn report. By increasing the number of career style traineeships",124,Representatives Main Commitfee
486,Mrs Crosio (Prospect,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (11.08970 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 available, this bill also takes us that one step closer to the introduction of the Australian vocational certificate training system. One third of the residents of the City of Fairfield, which makes up most of my electorate of Prospect, are younger than 18 years of age. I have seen at first hand the obstacles faced by our young people in a world economy which is rapidly changing. I have also seen the benefits to my electorate of our government's training and education policies. On many occasions in the past I have enthused to the House about the massive increases in the number of young people within my electorate who are undergoing education and training. We are making our society fairer and our economy more efficient by encouraging our young people, particularly those from low income families, to attend university and to further their education. But it certainly would not be desirable, and it would certainly would not be sustainable, for all or even most of the improvements to education to be funnelled through our university process. The traineeship system has played a major role in re-skilling our Australian work force. This bill expands on the traineeship system by providing 16,000 extra places, and it helps achieve the Finn participation targets for young people. The Finn report set several targets for the participation of our young people in post-school training. That report, which was released in 1991, noted that Australia's record in training was certainly a sorry one. I cannot help wondering whether perhaps that came about because of the 40 years we were seen to have been riding on the sheep's back; and we seem to have had a lack of policy and direction from successive governments. It was undoubtedly a major structural problem. In 1987 Australia ranked 14th out of the nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in the number of 17-year-olds in post-compulsory education. It was easy to see then that the more economically successful nations knew the importance of training. It is interesting to note that in that survey, the nations with the most 17 -year-olds in training were, in order: Japan, West Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. To rectify this, the Finn report recommended that by 1995 all 18-year-olds should have attained sufficient vocational skills to achieve at least a base level traineeship or year 12. It further recommended that by 2001 almost all people should have obtained at least a higher level traineeship or progress towards a higher level vocational qualification by the age of 20. I am certainly pleased to note that we have come some way towards meeting those targets; but we have still got a long way to go. The Australian Bureau of Statistics report Australian social trends found that in 1983, 27 per cent of our 15to 24-year-olds undertook full-time education. By 1993, fortunately, this had risen to 39 per cent. The committee on employment opportunities noted that in February 1993 almost half of the work force had a post-school qualification, an increase of some eight percentage points from February 1985. As they relate to suburbs within my electorate, the figures are particularly satisfying. A comparison of the 1986 and 1991 censuses for the City of Fairfield found a 61 per cent increase in the number of students attending a TAFE college, and a 110 per cent increase in the number of people engaged in some other educational activity. In coming up with the reasons for this increase I cannot go past the explanation given in Fairfield City Council's excellent publication called Fairfield City: community profile, which, talking about the wonderful 61 per cent increase in students attending TAFE and the 110 per cent increase in the number of people engaged in some other educational activity, says: Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 971 This increase could be explained by a number of factors including the growing national trend for all those wishing to stay in the workforce to continue to seek further education, the increase in the early 1990s of the number of federally funded employment training centres in Fairfield, the emergence of the University of Western Sydney in the region and by our population growth. The Australian traineeship scheme is a particularly proud achievement of this government. Since 1985 more than 63,500 people have commenced traineeships and 90 per cent of the participants in the scheme are still employed in their chosen fields two years later. This is one of the most impressive success rates for a labour market program that I have ever seen. The traineeship system is particularly important because Australia is almost alone in the world in its continued reliance on apprenticeships. Australia and the Germanic nations are the only countries where apprenticeships are still a dominant form of training. The traineeship scheme complements the apprenticeship system and ensures that we have a training regime that caters for all aspects of our society. Traineeships cater very much for service industries, whereas apprenticeships have traditionally been for manual labour training. With the service sector employing an ever expanding percentage of the work force, the importance of the Australian traineeship system is plain for all to see. The days of large numbers of people working in a service industry with no training are, I am pleased to say, over. Computers now dominate design and information. The prevalence of computers and the achievement of multiskilling through award restructuring mean that our workers in services undertake a wide variety of tasks and must be highly skilled. Traineeships have also opened up formally structured training to females. Apprenticeships have, of course, traditionally been male domains. As recently as 1991, more than 90 per cent of apprenticeships accounted for half of teenage male employment. The traineeship system has formalised training in fields traditionally dominated by females, where on the job experience used to be the only training and there was no recognition of those skills obtained. Much emphasis, I am pleased to say, has been given to encouraging women in the upper echelons of business and the public sector, and this is justly important. But more important for the majority of women is the opportunity for females to gain entry level training in the field of their choice. I am glad that the Australian traineeship system is assisting in this regard. The situation for females will improve even further when the Australian vocational training certificate system is up and running. The introduction of the vocational training system was a major recommendation of the Carmichael report. Some of the additional places provided under this bill are career start traineeships. Career start traineeships are a bridge. They are a bridge between the Australian traineeship system and the vocational certificate trainee training system. The career start positions are more versatile than the normal traineeships. They allow recruitment from a very wide age group and certainly enable more industries to tailor the traineeships to their needs. Career start traineeships allow young people to enter the work force while obtaining accredited training. The trainees can spend as much as 50 per cent of their time in training in their second year. The career start program shows the potential of a vocational certificate training program. The introduction of the vocational certificate will, I believe, be an improvement to the training system and certainly is of major importance. I am particularly impressed with the concept of pathways that will be introduced with the Australian vocational certificate training system. A pathway is a combination of training, education and work experience that leads to a qualification. A pathway is what we need. It gives persons about to finish compulsory education a broad choice of ways in which to reach their particular goals. 972 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, I September 1994 Perhaps more importantly, the Australian vocational certificate training system will allow trainees to switch between pathways to suit their needs and the needs of their particular employers. For example, a person who studies until year 12 and does not wish to go on to university could undergo three years of training and work experience, or could first undergo a vocational year at a TAFE or senior college. This could comprise training for about 60 per cent of the year, and structured work experience for the remainder of the year. If someone does not complete year 12, the AVe will provide vocationally oriented education, equivalent to the last two years of school. Apprenticeships and traineeships will be merged into one qualification-the Australian vocational certificate. There will be four nationally recognised levels of attainment: AVe levels 1,2,3 and 4. By 2001, the government hopes to have 90 per cent of our 20-year-olds completing Ave level 2 or proceeding to a higher level; and also to have 60 per cent of our 22-year-olds holding AVe level 3 or higher, or be proceeding to a higher qualification. That is not a bad goal. One important change from the current system is that the new certificates will be competency based, not time based. So trainees will move on to the next level when they have achieved competency at the previous level. This system is much more efficient than the current time based system. It allows trainees to work at their own pace and ensures that they do not graduate until they have proved competency in all of the fields they will need to call on in their future vocation. The other major improvement to be introduced with the Australian vocational certificate training system is that it will be available to people of all ages. Unlike our normal traineeships and apprenticeships, people who wish to be retrained and adults re-entering the work force after some time will be eligible to become trainees. Thus, Australia will have an integrated trainee and education system to meet the demands placed on us by our ever changing world economy-a world economy that will be much more service orientated and where information will be the primary commodity. The term 'information superhighway' has probably been overused. However, it is an undeniable fact that the ability of our work force to capitalise on high technology will be the major determinant of our national wealth over the coming decades. We will need a work force which is highly skilled in the information technology which increasingly is dominating the service industries. This government has improved Australia's training system beyond recognition. The introduction of the Australian traineeship system itself in 1985 was a major innovation. The 16,000 new traineeship places created in this bill will be of invaluable assistance, both to our young people seeking employment and to the drive to increase the skills base of our Australian work force. The steps toward the Australian vocational certificate taken in this bill are steps in the process of making the Australian trainee system equal to the best in the world. That is not a bad thing to achieve, and that is why I commend this excellent bill to the Main Committee and to the House. participate in this debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994. The opposition has no real problems with the basic thrust of the bill. A year and a half ago, the government made a commitment to shift funding from the tertiary sector to the training sector. It made a commitment to energise the vocational training market in Australia. It made a commitment to vocational training far beyond any national commitment that had ever been made before. I support, in general, the thrust of those moves.",127,Represent Atives Main Committee
487,Mr Charles (La Trobe) (1l.23 A.m.),"I am delighted to have the opportunity toThursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 973 Under the Prime Minister's direction, the government made a fundamental decision to increase the funding to vocational education and training without establishing either a clear goal or the mechanisms to be able to accomplish it. ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, was a compromise. The concept of ANTA was that it would act as a bank. It would take the government's expanded funding and the state's funding for vocational training and send it back to the states to allow them to fund TAFE and other institutions. This concept is a difficult one to come to grips with. I must admit that I still have some problem with the concept and in coming to grips with how this really works and how the central bank concept will, in fact, encourage additional training. I will be pleasantly surprised if, in fact, it works. It seems to me that the training market in Australia is really at a crossroads. This is a complex issue, because there are many players and there are not necessarily clear outcomes specified in my view at the moment. We have a system of technical colleges called TAFE; these have grown up across Australia over a very long time. We have some private providers of vocational education and training; in particular, the ACM facility in Richmond comes to mind as being an excellent private provider of vocational training. We have senior secondary schools or secondary schools around the country, many of which provide some degree of entry into vocational training and/or direct competing vocational education courses. Also we have industry itself. There are not only industry bodies like ACM who supply vocational training but also other companies-generally larger companies and some medium sized companies-who have their own training facilities, their own training personnel and run their own training agenda. At the moment there is no consistency within the system. The honourable member for Prospect( Mrs Crosio) spoke in the debate before me about the apprenticeship system and how it had fallen out of favour around the world, but that it was still in general use in Australia. One of the reasons it is in use in Australia is that employers value it. It is valued not only by employers but also by apprentices themselves. These are the people who wish to work in trades: they value the apprenticeship and they value the certificate that they get as a result of their apprenticeship which generally takes four years but sometimes less. There are a number of competing interests. As well there are the industry training advisory boards. There is a Department of Employment, Education and Training in Canberra; there are training departments of one form or another in the states; and there are other bureaucratic organisations that impinge on how all this operates. Theoretically, ANTA is supposed to bring it all together and make it work under the new Australian vocational certificate system. In concept, that system itself is rather simple. There are four levels of certification. But once we get beyond that simple level of certification, the system, as it exists today, is really quite complex. In reviewing the system, the so-called Fitzgerald report of the Allen Consulting Group has said that it is so complex it is not going to work. Rather than being driven by the market-that is, by the people who want the training, by the institutions who are there to provide it and by the industry which will use it-it is so bureaucratic and so top-driven that the system is in danger of not even getting off the ground. It is like trying to load a Boeing 707 with five elephants and expecting it to make it off the ground at Mascot. At this point, I refer to a portion of the summary of Dr Fitzgerald's report and his letter to Mr Brian Finn. It says: 974 MAIN COMMfITEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 We encountered a wide range of attitudes and experiences and some strongly held and conflicting views of the reformsthat is, the reforms in the vocational education and training systemWhile much has been achieved, we were left in no doubt that there are significant implementation difficulties. We agree with the recent statement by the Honourable Ross Free that, without decisive action by all parties to rectify the difficulties, the reform process is in danger of stalling. From my contacts in the training market around the country-indeed, as I have participated in inquiries with the Deputy Speaker in the chair today, the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Fitzgibbon), into group training in various states around the country-it seems to me that what is said in that letter I have quoted is inevitably true: everyone seems confused abut the great range of initiatives that are available and how they should work. If you think about it in simple terms, it seems to me that we need a relatively simple system that will allow young people in secondary school to decide on some general career path and to be able to take courses that will direct them in a technical or a vocational direction rather than for 100 per cent of those students to be directing their energies at a totally general academic education designed as an entry point to university. Certainly, we are never going to be able to afford to educate every Australian at university. Mr Barry Jones-But you want them to keep options open? afford it but also whether it is appropriate for every Australian. The jobs that are available today and will be available in the future will not be able to support a 100 per cent tertiary educated population. I refer to the country that I was born in where a decision was made a long time ago, back in the 1950s, that industry would do the training if the school system in the States supplied young people with 12 years of high quality general education in a general academic degree. But that system has not worked well because the industry has not provided the vocational education and training that it might have. Technologically, in many instances, that country has not grown to the heights it might have, had it adopted more of a dual stream approach along the lines of Austria or Germany, or some combination of those approaches. Australia is finally coming to grips with this matter. We have finally decided as a nation that we value education. So young people are staying on at school in greater numbers to year 12 and finishing 12 basic years of primary and high school education. Many want to go on to university and there are not enough places for them. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.24 to 11.48 a.m. through the training system. It would be highly desirable if we could offer a broad range of technical and vocational courses across the country in our secondary schools. Those courses, the skills that are gained and the qualifications gained should be certified and transferable. People could continue their education at a TAFE or at a private training institution, or go on to a university, or whatever. People could stop the training at any point, but they would be able to have a record of the modules that have been studied and the competencies that have been gained.",130,Representatives Main Committee

489,Mr Charles,"Before the suspension, I think I was talking about the normal progressionThursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 975 However, the system that we have now set up is so highly bureaucratised and so difficult to manage that it is not going to work. That, essentially, is what Dr Fitzgerald has told Brian Finn, the Chairman of ANTA. I will continue quoting from Dr Fitzgerald's letter to Brian Finn. He said: The lack of strong commitment to the reforms by business-many enterprises of aJl sizes and many business organisations-is a key concern. At the core of this concern is what we feel is the key problem: that the reforms to date have lacked any strong focus on the demand side-that is, on what is actuaJly needed to deliver to Australian enterprises, especiaJly smaJl and medium sized enterprises, the skills they need in order to compete in the new more open market environment. The reforms cannot succeed unless business values them. engages with them and leads them. The fundamental point is that there is no sense in adopting the attitude that we, as trainers, know better than industry what skills we need to teach trainees now and in the future. It is a nonsense; it has always been a nonsense. However, there is still that ingrained attitude in some of the training bureaucracies that the bureaucracy itself knows better than industry what industry needs. Unless industry is given a strong voice in the development of a simple system, the system will fail. There is no way that the system can operate properly. We cannot just abandon apprenticeships or the emerging traineeship system. They are well accepted throughout the business community. If we abandon them in favour of a certification system, which business has not accepted and does not understand, we will likely destroy the training market altogether. That will be of no use to anyone. These industry training advisory boards are a real mixed bag. Some of them are very goodthey have good industry people who understand the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, and they try to work on simple solutions in terms of course structure, curriculum and certification-but some of them are just an absolute nonsense. They are driven totally by bureaucrats and/or a union agenda, or whatever, to the point that they are failing their constituency. Dr Fitzgerald's letter goes on: In our view, the key to successful reform is to re-configure the reforms starting from the demand side, and to re-design them around a richer concept of the training market (than has so far been in use), centred on direct client relationships between enterprises and individuals and trainee providers. That is the key and it is what I have said. Dr Fitzgerald's next sentence is very interesting. It reads: Introducing 'User Buys' -aJlowing enterprises and individuals investing in recognised, contractual training to direct public funds for off-the-job training to a provider of their choice-is, we believe, a critical step to shift the drive to the demand side and to lift the performance and responsiveness of trainee providers. That is a very simple concept. We can call it a voucher system. Basically, if we empower those who are going to be trained to take their Commonwealth-state contribution-the money that they receive from ANTA-to a training institution of their choice, we will find that the institutions develop courses that are wanted by the clients. And why do the clients want those courses? Because industry says, 'This is what we need to be able to give you a job.' It seems to me that we have to move in that direction, regardless of the ideological difficulties of, say, the Australian Labor Party. If we do not consider funding the student, we are unlikely to get the best mix of course structuring curriculum that the student needs for real certified training that means something to employers. Dr Fitzgerald goes on: 976 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 With the same demand side perspective, we feel that a new national competency standards framework is needed, which is less detailed and prescriptive and gives considerably more flexibility to enterprises and individuals to meet the skill formation needs they require to compete, but within a nationaIly consistent system in which skills can be widely recognised and portable. This is especiaIly important at entry level. Boy, is it ever! During our tours around the country, we spoke to group training companies, employers, trainees and apprentices employed by group training companies. Everywhere we went, they told us about the importance of pre-vocational training. People in small businessbe it a hairdresser, a motor mechanic, a car wrecker or whatever-told us that if a person comes to them as a first-year apprentice with pre-vocational training they are ready to go to work and they are useful to the small business. The small businesses can then afford to hire apprentices and help train the people that their industry will need in the future. It is important that our system is nationally consistent. Earlier this year I used study leave money to go to Scotland and Austria to examine their vocational education and training systems. Some might say that Scotland and Austria are a strange mix. I went to Scotland because my understanding was that in the English-speaking world the Scottish have developed a system supervised by Scotvec-the Scottish Vocational Education Council-which is possibly the model that Australia might use to fabricate a simple system. Scotvec is the certifying authority: it says that the course structure is satisfactory and the curriculum is all right. Then it certifies the certifiers. It says that this individual is now qualified to certify people who come and say, 'I have had this kind of training.' So Scotvec certifies high schools, the national training institutes like our TAFEs, industries which train themselves and private providers. It also certifies the course structure or curriculum. It is made up in modules. If people in Scotland who have been through the system in the last few years want to tell a prospective new employer what skills they have, they simply ring Scotvec and ask for a fax. The computer then prints the sheet that says, 'John Jones who lives at this address has had these courses. He has passed them all.' There is no A, B, C, D. It is, 'You are competent in this or you are not. You can weld mild steel or you cannot.' People can get a complete printout. One assumes that in the future it will be cradle to grave so everything will keep adding to it. It is a simple system; there is one piece of paper to tell every employer what the person has been through, what qualifications they have, what range of skills they have and what mix of skills they have. It seems to me that we should look very closely at the Scottish system. I think it might offer us some advantage. Mr Deputy Speaker, I could speak on this bill and on this topic for hours. Mr Barry Jones-Do you want an extension? simply make a plea about the group training system in Australia which is unique to Australia and which is so valuable to us. I strongly believe that it should be expanded and used further in order to advantage both apprentices and trainees. This would give us a base to supply small and medium-sized business with trained people and would allow them to participate in the training market and in training people for their own future needs. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (11.59 a.m.)-It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak on this bill before the committee, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994. MightI commend some of the previous speakers who have spoken in this debate",132,Representatives Main Committee
490,Mr Charles,"Thank you very much, but I think probably not. BeforeI quit I wouldThursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 977 on their contribution to the committee and the debate on this topic. I think it is one where we can genuinely have a bipartisan debate about the training needs of the Australian work force. There may well at times be some controversy about the means by which we go about training our work force and educating our work force but the baseline is that all members of this committee have a very strong interest in providing the structures, the institutions and the systems that will provide their electors with the maximum opportunity to participate in the economic system. I was very interested in some of the comments that were made by the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Charles) and the contribution that he has made to this debate. As he said himself, it is an area of particular concern. He does come from a business background and he is very weB qualified to speak from a business perspective on these sorts of issues. I will take up some of those matters that the honourable member raised a little bit later in the debate. If we go back to basics, economic growth is simply about the production of goods and services and the employment of human beings in the process. To be a productive unit in a modern industrial society requires a great degree of skill and, to acquire the required skills in that economy, one must undertake substantial education and training. In the society that we have at the moment, you can acquire those skills yourself, undertake a discrete training course which sets out in a programmed way the paths to the acquisition of those skills, or do on-the-job training within an enterprise and develop some specialised skills within that enterprise. Indeed, you can have a combination of all of those methods. The massive investment that Australia has made in education and training over the past two decades is absolutely necessary if this country is to maintain its competitive advantage in the international marketplace. It is up to every individual to develop skills in an ongoing sense. I came into this parliament in 1993 and, once I had got over the initial shock wave of being in the national parliament, I had to sit down and make an inventory of the skills that I had and the skills that I would require to merely survive in this job, let alone to be an effective representative of my constituents. I believe that the honourable member for La Trobe was on the speed reading course that many members undertook to try to get through the volume of paper that was coming across our desks. I have had to look at my organisational skills. Being a global thinker, as is the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Barry Jones), I find that sometimes the itsy-bitsy details of things require some organisation and attention, and I have had to look at my own organisational skills. I have certainly had to pay some attention to my public speaking skills and, of course, my people handling skills have had to be worked on, as well. So even in the job of parliamentarianMr O'CONNOR-I handle people, but not with an iron bar! Whatever occupation we are in, be it as a member of the national parliament or as a young person entering the work force, we really do have to assess the skills that we require to perform the tasks that we are asked to do, and we have to set about acquiring and improving those skills. Therefore, I am very pleased that the federal government is putting resources into vocational education and training. We have made a substantial commitment over the past decade in the resources that we have provided to up-skill the Australian population and to give all Australians an adequate opportunity to be educated and trained and to participate in the work force.",134,Representatives Main Committee
491,Mr Charles,"You handle people, do you?978 MAIN COMMIITEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 But I must express some disappointment with the Victorian government for the way that they have handled the education issue in that state. There may be elements of what I am about to say that the honourable member for La Trobe might disagree with. But, in essence, Victoria's competitive advantage has always been in the high quality of its educational and training institutions. What we are seeing today in the state of Victoria is a very dangerous running-down in the educational assets of the state. The numbers of very experienced teachers who have left the education system, and the loads that are now being carried by teachers in those institutions-and, indeed, the way in which the government has gone about its rationalisation process-have all left me with some deep concerns about the future of education in the state of Victoria. I am not saying that the educational system, from time to time, does not need reform. I am not saying that it ought not be examined by the government of the day, nor that measures should not be taken by that government to achieve its expressed, legitimate objectives. I would say this to the Kennett government: 'Think very carefully about the way in which you institute your rationalisation of this particular sector because, if you do not, you may well destroy the economic advantage that the state of Victoria currently enjoys.' We are, if I might be so arrogant to say this, the intellectual powerhouse of the Commonwealth. IndeedI have, sitting beside me, one of the nation's priceless intellectual assets who I hope will participate in this debate-and, of course, the honourable member for La Trobe is doing his apprenticeship in that regard. If we look at Australia in the 1990s and beyond the year 2000, it is very clear what sort of work force Australia will need to maintain that competitive position that I alluded to before. Now these are words that educationalists fling about, politicians fling about and business leaders fling about with gay abandon-if I might use that particular word these days in the HouseMr Barry Jones-Not in Tasmania. Mr O'CONNOR-Not in Tasmania. I am glad the honourable member reminded me that I do have the licence to say that in the national parliament. These people say that we do need a highly skilled work force; we do need a flexible work force; we do need an adaptive work force. Now they are very fine words, but what do they mean in practice? We do need a stock of human capital that is very comfortable with the new technologies that are emerging in industry. We need a work force that is capable of developing the new workplace attitudes and the workplace relationships that are absolutely critical and vital to progress the economic future of the enterprises in which people work. So we know the sort of work force that we need, and we have some very strong educational and training assets in this country that position us well for achieving those sorts of qualities and skills for our work force. This particular bill before the committee today, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994, really sets the level of Commonwealth vocational and educational training funding over the years 1994 to 1996. It provides payment to ANTA for additional trainees under the Australian traineeship system and under the career start traineeships. The Commonwealth provides grants to the states and territories for vocational education. Prior to 1 January 1994, that funding was provided under the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act, the act which was replaced by the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act that we are debating here today. Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 979 This act directs all funds to ANTA, which was established by the Australian National Training Authority Act. The functions of ANTA are, quite simply, the allocation of this funding and the administering of national training programs. The object of the Australian National Training Authority Act is to establish the national vocational educational and training system and to develop closer interactions between industry, vocational education and training providers. I will take up that particular point in a minute, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the act also has other objectives of developing effective training markets and improving cross-sectoral links in the economy. Now the member for La Trobe, who preceded me in this debate, made some reference to and comment on the need for industry to participate to a greater degree in identifying training needs and communicating these to training institutions. I do not think anybody would disagree with the basic premise that he articulated here before the committee. But, in saying that, he ought not confuse short-term and long-term considerations. The education system-indeed, education itself-has whole-of-Iife goals. Industry tends to concentrate on the here and now. We need to encourage flexibility in providing training and education to our work force. I think, though, that the honourable member for La Trobe makes a very valid point. I was in Western Australia recently, and I had the good fortune to visit Oceanfast, one of the premier boat builders in this country at the moment. In talking to the proprietor, John Farrell, about how the company has developed a young and very skilled work force, there is a very interesting story. Mr Farrell made some very interesting comments about youth in the work force. As we travel out through our electorates and speak to employers, we often hear people saying that young people today are lazy, that they talk back and give a bit of lip, and that really they do not want to work. That is a common view which is often expressed by employers when they are talking about the young people who are coming out of the educational institutions into the work force. Mr Farrell said that he employs a lot of prima donnas in his enterprise-long-haired prima donnas, with rings through their noses and bells in their ears, and all sorts of things. However, he then went on to say that he produces an exotic product and so he needs exotic workers. He said that the problem that he faced in developing the skills over time of the young people that he now employs in his enterprise was the fact that they did not want to undertake apprenticeship training. They preferred to be in his enterprise. Those young people loathed going to the TAFE institution in Perth because the curriculum that they were encouraged to undertake at the TAFE had them learning how to plane wood when the enterprise itself was working with rather exotic metals. So the training that the apprentices were undertaking in these institutions did not match the demands and the needs of the enterprise. Ocean fast is an enterprise that is going to double its productive capacity over the next three years. The exports from that particular industry will, according to Mr Farrell, be worth a billion dollars by the tum of the century. This is the sort of niche productive area of manufacturing that we need to be in, but it took a rather long time for Ocean fast and the TAFE in question in Perth to negotiate an appropriate training set-up for the young people who are employed in that enterprise. That highlights the point that the honourable member for La Trobe was alluding to when he talked about a bureaucratised and difficult to manage training system that will not work. 980 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 It is very important that industries' needs are correctly identified by the training institutions and the training providers. It is very important that that communication occurs between them. The Working Nation statement makes quite clear the objectives of the government's training reforms. The bill before this committee and the House provides for extra payments to ANTA. Clause4 of the bill inserts a new section, section 9A, which provides for additional funding in 1995-96. In 1994 there will be an increase from $639 million to $673.6. In 1995 there will be an increase from $719 million to $755 million. In 1996 a set amount payable will be made at $835.5 million. This funding will be made available to ensure that the Working Nation promise of 50,000 new training places is achieved. In Geelong, a very interesting training experiment is being undertaken by both Alcoa and the Gordon Technical College. The Australian vocational certificate is being developed there in partnership between Alcoa and the Gordon Technical College. That is in keeping once again with the problem that the honourable member for La Trobe raised about the need to provide alternative pathways for young people to get into the work force, and those should really begin at years 11 and 12. The Alcoa-Gordon TAFE partnership in the Australian vocational certificate program provides that VCE students get on-the-job engineering training. Some 16 students from James Harrison Secondary College in Geelong are currently participating in the program. The students complete a two-year traineeship at Alcoa's Point Henry plant. The program is, indeed, a first. Teenagers earn industry qualifications during their VCE and they also earn award based wages. This scheme is subsidised by the federal government and it greatly enhances the work prospects of the young people who are engaged in it. When completed, the students have two-thirds of an engineering production certificate and their VCE. They can then choose their future paths, either university or apprenticeships, with a degree of confidence in the skills that they have acquired. The benefits are quite clear for the students. When I visited Alcoa quite recently, I was greatly encouraged by the enlightened management at Alcoa. I was also greatly encouraged by the attitude among the young people who were undertaking that vocational training certificate. BeforeI close, I would like to pick up on some of the training issues that were raised in As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite occupies the electorate on the other side of the Barwon River. He made some very interesting comments. I was very surprised at the comments that the honourable member made. In his speech, which generally dealt with training issues and the case management system, he said: The initiatives dealt with by this billhe is referring to the Employment Services Bill here, but it relates to trainingare simply more costly and bureaucratic attempts to diffuse the political issue of unemployment in time for the 1996 federal election. Let me say that that is not the government's intention in that bill or this bill. Our intentions in the education and training area are quite clearly stated in the white paper and have been articulated by ministers in the House. If, indeed, unemployment was an issue at the last election, one would have expected that I would have suffered a decrease in my vote and that he would have experienced an increase",135,Representatives Main Commitiee
492,A Speech Given By The Honourable Member For Corangamite ( Mr Mcarthur) On 25 August 1994.,"Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 981 in his, but the opposite was the case: I got an increase and he suffered a decrease. The reason that the honourable member for Corangamite suffered a decrease in his vote was that he went to that particular election articulating policies that would have created more unemployment in the Geelong region. He certainly is a disciple of Fightback. He is reaIIy into the sort of backwards industrial relations policy that we do not need in this country. He was also into massive cuts to government expenditure. On the issue of the case management system, he said: The case management strategy represents a total misunderstanding of what is required to create new employment opportunities and reduce the impact of long-term unemployment. Jobs are created when the government provides an environment in which businesses want to invest, expand and employ people. I suggest that we have a very good economic environment here in Australia today that will encourage firms to invest and to provide employment opportunities. The case management system is not simply a focus on the long-term unemployed to the detriment of the short-term unemployed. It is an attempt to come to grips with the human needs of those who find themselves in unemployment. (TIme expired) had a job and education and training was not as important as it is today. I am stiII old fashioned enough to believe that three per cent unemployment is desirable and, hopefuIIy, over the medium term, achievable. I am somewhat bewildered when I hear the continuing discussion about vocational education and training over the long term. My first contact with the political realities of education came when I was chairman of a school council, then in local government and then in my industry association. When I was a member of the Rural Training Council of Australia. I had many visits to Canberra during which I had to find my way around the maze of the various training authorities and industry bodies. However, I stiII cannot overcome that nostalgia I feel for that three per cent figure-that fuII employment figure. That is where I am coming from and I offer those remarks as a preface to the main body of the issues I want to discuss. While the coalition supports the amendments contained in the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994, it does not support this government's attitude towards training. I fuIIy support, of course, the motion of the member for Braddon( Mr Miles), to condemn the government for its lack of direction on training. It is clear that this government does not live up to its rhetoric on the importance of training and education. I refer, for example, to my speech earlier this week, outlining the financial differences between Austudy and the jobsearch aIIowance. People on Austudy are clearly worse off in the short term than are their counterparts on unemployment benefits. If the government really wanted to match its claim to support training and education, it would make Austudy match the jobsearch allowance. Sadly, the government is more concerned with public perception. Of course, alI governments and oppositions have to be concerned about that, but it is that emphasis on public perception which sometimes distracts all of us away from the real job that we should be doing-that is, getting this unemployment rate down, particularly the rate of unemployment amongst young people. Take another example: the government proposes to abolish the jobsearch alIowance for 15to 17-year-olds, from January next year, and replace it with a youth training alIowance. What will be the difference? Unfortunately, not that much difference at alI. It is just a name change,",138,Representatives Main Committee
493,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (12.19 P.m.),"I grew up in a period when pretty weII everybody982 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 and part of this government's continual marketing campaign. I can just imagine the government press release in the middle of next year: 'So many thousands of young people are receiving the youth training wage. Training in this country is really taking off.' Of course, it is all smoke and mirrors. These will still be young people without jobs on the training treadmill. The coalition supports the funding of ANTA to enable it to carry out its roles and responsibilities. We also support increased funding to provide further places for traineeships. However, we are disappointed with the Labor government's record on vocational education, particularly apprenticeships. Here, we must look at the figures. I am sure they have been much quoted, but they bear quoting again. I had to get them checked to satisfy myself that they were right. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 1990 we had 162,600 apprentices. What is our target for 1994? It is only 46,000 apprenticeships. It sounds a lot, but when we look at the needs of Australia it is nowhere near enough. While the 1995-96 target of 60,000 new apprenticeships is an improvement, it will still not meet the level seen in 1990. We believe that ANTA needs to be given more direction from this government, as does training in this country in general. ANTA, itself, has requested more direction and re-examination of government training policy. The Fitzgerald report, commissioned by ANTA, is extremely critical of government training reform policies. The report concluded that the current approach to reform will not bring about the fundamental outcomes desired. However, the government does not seem to want to listen. It has, of course, sought to bury this report. The government has had this report for some time, but whereas the government can respond to a Bulletin article immediately, it takes time to respond to matters of urgency such as training for our million unemployed. ANTA's criticism does not sit well with the government's rhetoric on Working Nation and the training initiatives which Working Nation supposedly contains. Some Labor ministers are quite fond of quoting from the press, so I might follow this trend myself for a moment. Here are some newspaper headlines which followed the release of Working Nation, headlines which are undoubtedly echoed in the ANTA report which the government is trying to hide: 'Working Nation: a crutch or a cure?', 'Grand plan: but how sound is the planning?', 'Results unlikely to match the claims,' 'Jobs, for how long?' and 'White Paper draws a costly blank on new jobs.' Let us have another look at the rhetoric of Working Nation. It introduced a youth training initiative, another program to crow about. And what does the youth training initiative offer? It will offer intensive case management so that people under 18 will have the assistance of a case manager in the search for suitable work. My question is: what has the CES been doing for the past couple of years? Correct me if I am wrong, but is it not the role of the CES to assist people to find suitable jobs? This is just more smoke and mirrors, more potential publicity for the government next year to announce that it is taking action on training. The government has been in power for 11 years. It has been there so long that it does not seem to think that it needs to implement policy any more. This government believes it can fool the Australian people if it continues its relentless publicity campaign. The government thinks that all it has to do to keep the Australian people happy on the unemployment issue is change the names of its training programs. That is the constant theme that I hear around the country. Are we just going to be recycled? When are we going to see those real jobs? Personally, I wonder when Australians will have the employment security that my country gave to me. I guess I took it for granted then and I have to feel for those young people now. Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMIITEE 983 I do not believe that Australian people are so silly that they cannot see the lack of effect that government policies are having on their own lives. Australian families can see that increasingly their children, their parents, are out of work. They can see that it is increasingly difficult to get into university or get an apprenticeship. The government's treatment of the ANTA report is typical of the government's approach, typical of a government that has been in power for too long and does not know how to fix the mess it has created. I fully support the motion of the member for Braddon( Mr Miles) that the government be condemned for the lack of direction in its approach to training reform and its mismanagement of this vitally important area. but I will not take quite as negative an approach as some of my colleagues. I think that there is, within this whole regime-albeit skewed somewhat by some of the hype of the white paper-the ability to achieve quite a number of outcomes for training and apprenticeships in Australia. We are examining today the Vocational Education and Training Amendment Bill of 1994, which sets the level of vocational education and training from the years 1994 to 1996. As several members have stated, this bill in essence takes over from the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act of 1989 and supplements the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act of 1992. The bill appropriates funding to 1996 in accordance with the Commonwealth's undertakings to the heads of government agreement I have no problem with the general thrust of the bill, but I have several reservations about implementation and the government's real commitment to the vocational training outcomes. There have been massive changes in training in Australia over the last two decades, which have been influenced by technological change and mistakes made in block training and apprenticeships. Block training became a tum-off to employers, and the states that had sevenweek block training will know just what I mean. Employers just got to the point where they would not take these kids but, strangely, the system persisted with it. Rather than adapting to needs of industry, it persisted with it and, to my way of thinking, that became the point from which apprenticeships started to drop off. Balanced with this has been the need for competency based training and the need for training in areas not necessarily associated with the formally recognised trades. All those things began to impact on apprenticeships and what we know today as traineeships. As the member for La Trobe( Mr Charles) has said, training needs to be demand driven, and that does not happen in many areas. Some of the apprenticeships are driven-this might be a bit of an outrageous statement, but I will make it nonetheless-by some of the politically correct agenda setters, especially in the fields of conservation programs. I am not knocking conservation programs and I think traineeships in this field can be quite appropriate, but I think some of them have become an end in themselves rather than being the basis of some real training. Some other traineeships are driven by pressure groups and by those pressure groups' expectations rather than the outcomes for the students or the clients in the programs. A great deal of development still needs to go into traineeships if they are to be relevant to business and to industry. It says something about the program that only 70 per cent of traineeships, which are generally only one year in length, come to fruition. Without in any way disparaging them, there is not a hard intellectual edge to traineeships; and if kids and even mature adults",139,Representatives Main Committee
494,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.27 P.m.),"I would also like to add my voice in this debate984 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 who take on traineeships are pulling out before they get to the end of their programs I think we have to say there is a lack of expectation in their minds and perhaps a feeling that they are on Mickey Mouse courses. That then begs the question as to who is the most appropriate deliverer of traineeship schemes. I have had a lot of experience in this field over 10 or more years, and during that time. I have seen TAFE almost lose direction in most of its fields. I know there are some very highly focused TAFE colleges around Australia, but I know there are others that seem to have totally lost focus. I can cite the fact, for example, that in Queensland the state government now tends to put all the diesel courses in one TAFE college, the plumbing courses in another and the automotive courses in another. While there may be some short-term financial gains in that, we are seeing the slow erosion of the idea of a TAFE college being a repository of the skills of the particular community or region. On the other side of TAFE training there are some excellent courses in secretarial studies, computer technology and management in general. Sadly, I think that has possessed some of the TAFE colleges to want to become what the CAEs were. They want to become de facto colleges of advanced education. I have even heard senior personnel of those TAFE colleges speak disparagingly about vocational training. That is part of the crisis. If the recognised deliverer, the TAFE college, is now starting to move away from its prime role as the deliverer of the technical side of vocational training, then indeed we have a crisis. I notice, too, that, because of this void in some areas of Australia, skillshare has picked up the role in many traineeship areas that a decade ago one might reasonably have expected would have been carried out by TAFE. This is not said with any criticism of skillshare. I think it is a marvellous program. Earlier, the member for Prospect( Mrs Crosio) outlined the government's expectation of this program. I cite the 50,000 places that she spoke about: 14,000 apprenticeship places, 15,000 for the ATS and CST traineeships, 1,000 Commonwealth trainees, 5,000 off-the-job training places, 5,000 new pre-vocational places and 10,000 new places within the current labour market programs. I think that is quite a worthy objective, but again it is all a bit soft. It requires the Commonwealth itself to pick up 1,000 of these traineeships. A chart that is available to coalition members in an additional explanatory paper shows that between 1990 and 1994, apprenticeships in Australia had dropped from 162,600 to an anticipated 46,000. The thing that really staggers me, Mr Deputy Speaker, is to think that in just five years apprenticeships have gone down to less than a third of what they were. To me that says there is a crisis in vocational training. We have to ask ourselves: what organisations around Australia have done something about arresting that problem? Group Training Australia, which has some official and unofficial affiliates, has done a great deal to consolidate the position of apprenticeships. At present, Group Training Australia delivers 32 per cent of all the apprenticeships in Australia. We might ask: why has it been successful? It has increased its apprenticeships by 21 per cent whereas other apprenticeships are going down at a rate of 21 per cent. As I have said, perhaps technology, block training problems and the economic downturn of the last four or five years have all played a part. I think group training is more successful because it offers its clients a greater depth of experience. A person is not saddled with one builder, one plumber or one automotive workshop for the whole of his or her three or four years of training. In Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 985 group training, the apprentices have the experience of moving from one employer to another, so their breadth of experience is increased. With this comes the responsibility that someone has to oversee the clients and make sure that they are not just moved physically from one employer to another employer. Their general well-being and their focus as a student, as well as the fact that they are an employee, all have to be nurtured. To do that, group training is required to have quite a few employees; it has to have appropriate staff. It requires apprenticeship masters and a basic administration structure if it is responsible for their salaries. It is responsible to government to see that salaries, tax, workers compensation, tool allowances, and a whole raft of things, are properly paid. One of the reasons employers find the group apprenticeship scheme attractive is that they can take over a group apprentice and know that all that sort of work is being handled by the scheme. The scheme bills the employer on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis and it takes the responsibility and worry away from the employer. The other thing that the group apprenticeship scheme offers is pastoral care. I think that is another reason that it has such a great strike rate in getting its apprentices through. Finally, there is another feature, and those of us who have been on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, and who have been interested in the field, will know that the group apprenticeship scheme is now at the forefront of delivering meaningful-and I stress the word 'meaningful' -competency based training, to the point now where it has a form of accelerated training that is delivered on site by TAFE teachers. What they are now doing is on the site with TAFE and other teachers. Take building, for example: they are learning the whole minutiae of the trade in their first year. All those blocks of six and seven weeks that bedevilled employers in the past are being done under the supervision of the group apprenticeship scheme. There are apprentice masters and contracted TAFE teachers, all in the first year. In the second, third and fourth years, all that work is behind them and they become a very valuable commodity to the employer. I am sure that that is the field where the government should be directing its funding. That is the proven field. It is proven for a number of reasons. Firstly, the clients are better cared for. Secondly, they are being better trained. Thirdly, they are receiving a variety in their training. Fourthly, they are getting their block training and their general academic work condensed into one year's intensive training. As I said, it is on-the-job training. If a problem crops up in the classroom, the young people can be taken immediately from that classroom on to the site and shown the problem first hand. They can look at it, understand it, come back into the classroom and move on. At the end of a year of doing that, that particular student is very valuable to an employer. The other thing is that it means that the employer knows that, for the second, third and fourth year, not only are clients or students better trained but they will have no distractions in carrying out their duties. Because of this accelerated form of training, it is possible now for an apprentice, say, in the building industry-and I am talking about a bright apprentice; I am not just talking about run of the mill-who wants to commit himself or herself to some pretty hard work to get through the course in 23/4 years. That is a huge saving to government and a huge input into the vocational skills profile of Australia. I would recommend to the minister or to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and 986 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories ( Mr Snowdon), who is here today representing him, that that might be the way we should go. Without being a killjoy, I will bet pounds to peanuts the government will not get 14,000 new apprentices up this year unless it accesses something like a group apprenticeship scheme. In fact, I think it might be hard pressed to get more than a couple of thousand on. It is going to be no easier for it to get those apprentices into the system than it has been for individual kids to get themselves into the system over the last two decades unless there is another carrot, unless there is another conduit that makes life easy. Having said that-and this is where we start coming back to traineeships-there was a move two years ago to withdraw funding from group apprenticeship schemes. I am sure honourable members know that those schemes were set up jointly with Lend Lease in conjunction with the ACTU and called ACTU Lend Lease. It was a great combination of union and business in a very highly focused program. They would set up each scheme, get the mechanisms in place and, from that, the actual individual schemes around Australia merged. As honourable members are probably also aware, as well as delivering apprenticeships, these have also become the vehicle for traineeships. I must say it will be an outrage if the government withdraws funding from the core activity of those organisations, namely, the group apprenticeship program. There is a body of thought in DEET and in government that that should happen. I will again predict what will happen if that course of action is taken. I have been on one of these schemes through the recession. I know what it is like for a group of directors to be jointly and severally responsible for debts of $300,000 to keep a whole group of apprentices in jobs. That is a very stressful time for voluntary workers. If the government wants men and women of high profile in business to run these schemes, to be the white knights for the government, to deliver its programs because they cannot all be delivered through TAPE and through skillshare, it is going to have to rely on organisations like ACTU Lend Lease. It is going to have to fund their core activities properly. Par too often we see the work of the group apprenticeship schemes being diluted. This is because the schemes are spending more time trying to access the government traineeship programs, for which they receive fees and with which they subsidise their core activity of delivering apprenticeships. That situation is back to front, Mr Deputy Speaker. I accept that the employment, education and training committee is examining this problem-and I do not want to anticipate its report-but the core activities of group apprenticeship schemes, and apprenticeships in general, must be corralled from the other activities of traineeship schemes. When that agenda has been achieved it is not to say that the group apprenticeship scheme should not deliver traineeships. Once we secure the core activities, core focus and core outcomes of group apprenticeship schemes, it is quite appropriate that people should then bid on a performance and outcomes basis for government programs. I am quite in favour of that. However, I think it is a travesty to waste the skills and intelligence of those very committed people, and the focus of apprenticeship schemes, so that we can earn a few bob out of a traineeship scheme to prop up our other activities. That would mean that we were doing the whole thing back to front. I support the amendment moved by the opposition in this debate. Nevertheless, the bill has a great deal to commend it and, in that respect, I support its broad thrust. Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 987 Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill will set the level of Commonwealth vocational education and training funding for 1994-96. The bill will provide for payments to the Australian National Training Authority and it will also provide for additional traineeships under the Australian traineeship scheme and career start traineeships. The Commonwealth provides grants to the states and territories for the provision and support of vocational education and training. The grants are primarily in the technical and further education scheme through the TAFE system. Prior to 1 January 1994, grants to the states and the territories contributed to general operating costs and infrastructure. With effect from 1 January, the funding arrangements were replaced by a single pool of funds comprising those that were previously separated. Recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants are passed to ANTA for allocation among the states and the territories. The main provision is to enable the new section to be inserted in the act. There is currently provision for payments to ANTA for an allocation under the act of $638.960 million in 1994, and that figure will increase to $719.741 million in 1995. The new section will increase the amount payable for 1994 from $638.960 million to $673.612 million. In 1995 the amount payable to ANTA will increase from $719.741 million to $755.711 million, which sets the 1996 figure at well over $800 million. The second section provides for payments to ANTA for additional trainees. The payments are conditional on the minister being satisfied that there is an increase in the number of people receiving training in the states and territories. We have a performance condition operating there in order that the states and the territories ensure that they pick up some of the extra apprenticeships that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler( Mr Neville), may have been mentioning. In fact, the act is allowing for an increase in funds to be allocated to this very important area of education, but increased conditional to the states performing. Out of this money $20 million was provided to the states' adult literacy funds. All ministers agreed to split $13 million from the Commonwealth to use for language and literacy through the DEET labour market programs for people who needed or wanted to improve their literacy skills before seeking work in the marketplace. The remaining $7 million of that money went to ANTA on a population share basis, of which Tasmania received $182,336. A training profile was to be provided to address the use of this sum, and added to that was a sum of $50,000 in growth funds, making the total proportion of Commonwealth funds $232,000. Another allocation of growth funds is expected next financial year, taking the figure up to approximately $292,000. Overall, ANTA Tasmania is receiving $9,976,000 in 1994 for recurrent funding to the TAFE system. Of that, $5.25 million is for building and equipment. There is some major building construction work going on in the Launceston TAFE area. Further, the states are being given $1,688,000 for performance based training that can be allocated as they see fit, which is where the growth in funds fits in. So if the states are performing and going ahead, they should be able to increase their funds. Next year there will be a similar allocation along those lines. I know that the voluntary adult literacy program in Tasmania is being told that the Commonwealth has cut funds to adult literacy. This is simply not true. It is a furphy and a reflection on the political operations of the Tasmanian state government. Allocations to specific parts of vocational education and training have changed. Some $535,000 was formerly allocated to workplace programs and general community literacy. They appeared to share",141,Representatives Main Commiitee
495,Mr Adams (Lyons) (12.47 P.m.),"The major amendments proposed by the Vocational988 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 1 September 1994 administration and capital costs. Since the funding situation has changed, the state is saying that it has to put on specific labour market programs that are larger and require additional funds to run. It believes it has to spend more money to cover these costs. The tendering process requires it to be more open and transparent in what it is doing. The trouble is that this has caused the community literacy program to suffer. People were told that they had lost funding, and that is not so. Funds have been reallocated to cover the costs of those expanded labour market programs. However, these funds are now being built up again. Literacy is vital for people of any age to participate in today's world. In these times, without basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills, we are denied access to computers, televisions and all the electronic gadgetry that we have, with more to come in the future. Many people in our community have been passed by in the learning of these skills and realise that they need some help. Many adults who are not in a working situation, who are self-employed or who work on the land or in isolated situations have not been picked up by, or do not have access to, any training programs. This is where the voluntary adult literacy program comes in. It is a one to one program where people in the community take on one student and take him or her through to a stage where he or she can join a class or take on workplace training. The program requires only a few full-time staff to coordinate the overall volunteer system around the state, but its usefulness is enormous and we need to recognise that. Some of us do, but it looks like the state government in Tasmania does not. I want to quote to you from some letters received from students who were being assisted under the program. I have kept most of those letters that I have received but there are two that I would like to read into the record. The first states: I am getting help from ALBEthe local adult literacy programI have heard from my tuter that the money may be stopped. I think that a lot of people will be disivatiged and my self. I have started to learn to read and write. That is some think that I have not been able to do. UntilI heard about the ALBE program. I am a voleenter fire fighterso this chap is a really community minded individualand I need to read and write to fill out reports about the fires that I atend. AndI need to read and write to atend the training senter at Cambridge. I hope that the ALBE program can continue for my needs and other peoples. The second says: I wood like to keap doing liters program. It will help me to get work in the future at some time. I have truble filing out forms. I dont have much cofdens in my self. I would like to help my son with his hom work. But he hast to help me and I think if I was to lean to read and rite beater I wood give me a lot of cofdens in my self. The Tasmanian government puts $250,000 to $300,000 to cover the administration, wages, buildings and equipment in the area but, to cover the changes it has had to make, it is pretending it is not receiving the additional money and saying that the Commonwealth has cut back on the funds. That is not true. The figures speak for themselves. The money is there according to the need and the government can seek allocation through the tendering process if it feels that one area is particularly missing out. Thursday, 1 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 989 This program is one through which many people have been able to change the course of their lives. I know, because I am one of those people. Adult literacy programs delivered by any form is very important. The volunteer programs in particular have played a very big part in the state of Tasmania. I would urge all levels of government to recognise this and to make sure that this program does not suffer in the changes and restructuring that have taken place to maximise the use of the funds. Sometimes these smaller but vital programs can suffer in all those changes. I am very happy to support these bills as they make my argument much simpler. omitted stand part of the question.
