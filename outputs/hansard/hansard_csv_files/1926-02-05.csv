Debate resumed from the 20th January (vide page 193), on motion by Dr. That the bill be now read a second time. -During the second-reading speech of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), he made what I consider to be an unfortunate statement. He said that last year the Commonwealth had paid for various services in Western Australia £745,000 more than it had received from that State in revenue. If that were so, it would be unreasonable for Western Australia, to ask for a grant from the Commonwealth Government. If Western Australia were getting an advantage of £745,000 during the financial year 1923-4, she. ought to be in a highly prosperous position. wealth Government would not be. justified in making a grant to that State.. Australia, however, is really in financial difficulty. Before federation her finances were extremely buoyant. I recently asked the Treasurer how he made up his figures. He said that the statement was to be found on page 665 of the minutes of the evidence taken before the royal There have, however, been commission. That statement was put before the commission by Mr S'. G. MacFarlane, who was representing the Federal Treasury. It was successfully",17,Royal Australian Ai R Force Randwick Experimental Section

Westernrefuted by tbe representative of .the State Treasury, Mr Simpson, who produced to the commission figures showing in relation to the transactions between the State and credit balance in favour of Western Australia for the year 1923-4 of £4.48,000. He expressed regret that the Commonwealth Treasury officers who had supplied the figures were not there for examination. The accuracy of the item lane's statement was contested by Mr help the Customs revenue. Simpson. It showed that in Western Australia the postal revenue was les3 than the expenditure during 1923-4 by £133,000. Mr Brown, Director of the Postal Department, said that the loss was £87,000. The difference between the two amounts is £46,000. There may be some excuse for the discrepancy, because there is no separate method of bookkeeping to show the respective disbursements and receipts in each State. Farlane was quoting Treasury figures from the statement presented to Parliament, wherein moneys received by the post office are treated as revenue. MacFarlane's statement, in 1923-4, out of a total Commonwealth expenditure of £16,000 for new buildings for the Health Department, £15,000 was debited to Western Australia. Mr Simpson said that those figures were absurd. Mr State Department, mentioned one case MacEarlane also showed that the Trade and Customs expenditure for the whole of the Commonwealth was £1,158,000, of which amount Western Australia was debited with £112,000, or about one-tenth, although the population of Western Australia is one-sixteenth of that of the Commonwealth. On the other hand, although the figures of the Trade and Customs revenue, according to Mr not propose to contest that figure. Money MacFarlane, show that for every £ 1 expended in the Commonwealth £30.9 was collected, Western Australia was credited with only £15.7. supplied by Mr MacFarlane respecting per capita collections were equally sur 7 prising. They show that the collection £6 4s. 4^d. a head, Western Australia being credited with the amount of £6 0s. 3d. a head, a difference of 4s. i-Jd. in Mr Simpson's calculation. have his opportunity to reply later. I Farlane's figures. Western Australia should collect as much a head as the rest of the States, because she has a larger proportion of male population. The Treasurer knows that over half the Customs revenue Commonwealth Customs revenue is derived from narcotics' and stimulants, which are consumed principally by men. Mr MacFarlane's figures are also contested by the fact that during the period of bookkeeping the collection per capita in Western Australia was quite as high as in the rest of Australia. dealing with . taxation Mr Simpson pointed out that many companies in Western Australia are claimed, as branches by parent companies in .Victoria, and their profits are absorbed by the eastern State business in order to evade the high taxation which is levied on .the profits of companies in Western Australia. Mr Black, who acts for the Federal Taxation Department and the in which £50,000 in taxation had been collected by the Melbourne taxation officer which really applied to profits made by Western Australian companies. Mr Simpson claimed that out of an amount of £820,000 representing war service interest paid on behalf of the States, £209,000 was paid by Western Australia. I do was expended to assist our soldiers, and although a considerable loss occurred, still there was a desire on the part of The figures Western Australia to shoulder her share of the burden. Whatever may be the real position, we find that the commissioners themselves, in view of Mr in the Commonwealth was Simpson's statement, rejected the evidence of Mr MacFarlane.

The bill provides for a grant to Western Australia of £450,000, and it is brought forward because Western Australia has suffered as the result of federation. The amount provided is not so large as it appears to be, and the Treasurer d i d not try to hide that fact. Under the provisions of section 5 of the Surplus Revenue Act, Western Australia receives £100,000as this year, so that the actual monetary grant provided in this bill is £350,000. of the findings of the "" Royal Commission on Finances of Western Australia as Affected by Federation."" The Government's proposal differs essentially from the recommendation of the commission. A majority of the commission, Messrs. Higgs and Entwistle, recommendedThat until the State of Western Australia is granted the right to impose its own Customs and Excise Tariff, the Commonwealth shall pay to the State a special payment of £450,000 per annum in addition to the 25s. per capita payment made in accordance with clause 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910, the aforesaid special payment to include the special annual payment now being made to the State of Western Australia in accordance with clause 5 of the said act, the above special payment of £450,000 to commence on the 1st July, 1924. The Minister for Works of Western Australia recently expressed the opinion that that State would never control its own Customs; but it was, nevertheless, a recommendation of the commission that Western Australia should be given her own Customs, and, until that was done, that she should continue to receive the grant. recommendation, a sum of £500,000 is already owing to Western Australia, as the grant was to date from July, 1924. nent under which Western Australia labours, and to that extent it is extremely disappointing. I am not dealing with the question from a party point of view. I do Whatever Government may happen to be in power, it w ill always be the duty of Western Australian members to come to the Parliament and, without acting the part of mendicants, to voice the disabiliH e stated in his ties under which their State labours. The Treasurer saidAny further sum is to be left to a conference of the State and Commonwealth to consider the nnancial relationships between the Commonwealth .and all the other States. That is a very poor excuse. The conference will deal with other matters besides the disabilities of Western Australia, including the adjustment of the existing financialrelationship between the Commonwealth and all the States. Sena-' tor Pearce, in his opening election speech at Kalgoorlie on the 15th October last, saida special grant for The Commonwealth Government, having appointed the Western Australian Disabilities Commission, felt bound to give effect to the The bill is the result Commission's recommendation, and no matter what arrangement was proposed by the conference as .to the basis of future finance, it would be made clear that Western Australia needed and must receive this £450,000 a year, outside any other arrangements between the Common; wealth and the States. There was no equivocation about that statement; but when the Treasurer was asked by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), "" Are they on the same basis as is now proposed""-as Senator Pearce said they were-the Treasurer replied, "" No . "" I submit that Western Australia is justified in expecting, in fulfilment of the promises that have been made, more than is provided in the b ill .

I know that Western Australia has Che sympathy of honourable According to the commission's members. In no other State were the people keener for federation.

While the royal commission was sitting in Western Australia, the Western Australian Government appointed an advisory committee that submitted other claims by the State. There were about seventeen main claims, most of themj in my opinion, well founded: but, perhaps, from the point of view of tactics, it wouid have been wiser to drop some of the less important ones. One objection to the commission is that it did not contain a Western Australian. No one, however well-equipped as a business man, can properly understand the problemsof a State unless he lives there. All the members of the commission were not specialists in everything. biased. MrA . GREEN I readily admit that, but I would not expect the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) to accept a deputation of gold-miners, however unbiased they might be, as a competent body to investigate problems affecting the woollen industry.' Conversely, I would not expect him, without any previous knowledge of Western Australia, to give a correct judgment on' all matters affecting that State. The commissioners were absolutely fair so far as their knowledge went; but they disagreed among themselves about most things. The proposal for the gold bounty was rejected by Messrs. Entwistle and Mills. Obviously, technical knowledge has to be applied to solve the problems of such an industry. In. part 8 of the commission's report relating to the Commonwealth Customs Tariff, we find that the chairman and Mr Entwistle recommendedThat the State of Western Australia shall, during a period of 25 years, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, have the absolute right(a) To impose its own Customs Tariff as in pre-federation days, provided the State of Western Australia shall not impose higher duties upon the importation into the State of Western Australia of any goods produced or manufactured in or imported from other States of Australia than arc imposed on the importation into the States of Western Australia oi the like goods produced or manufactured in or imported from other countries; chief disability under which Western tt>\ to impose its own Excise Tariff From that view, Mr Mills dissented, but there waa a majority recommendation in favour of it . The chairman and Mr Mills made a brief reference to the difficulties resulting from overlapping industrial awards, but refused to recommend any disturbance of the present relationship, between the Federal and State Arbitration Courts; but Mr Entwistle thought that the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court should be confined to shipping and shearing. The chairman and Mr Entwistle favoured the proposed grant to Western Australia, but Mr Mills recommended a grant of £300,000 for ten years, so that even in the minority report a grant of £200,000 net, for ten years, was recommended. Indeed, Mr Entwistle said frankly that he considered there was no possible remedy for Western Australia but secession. Br. EABLE PAGE -Does the honourable member agree with him? people of Western Australia have the federal spirit, and while they remain loyal to federation, it is the duty of this and every other federal government to see that they are treated fairly. I quoted Mr Entwistle to show that in the mind of one whom the honourable member for Corio regards as an unbiased observer, the prospect of getting justice for Western Australia is so remote, and the difficulties' of the State are so great, that the only solution is secession. It will be seen that the proposal to make a grant to Western Australia, and the proposal to give that State control of its own tariff, are put forward as alternatives. The royal commission's recommendation is that until Western Australia has its own tariff, the grant should continue. Later on I sliall deal briefly with this matter, and also with the proposal for the payment of a bounty on gold. Another recommendation of the royal commission is th-p transfer of the control of the north-western part of Western Australia to the Commonwealth. That can be adjusted by a conference, between the Federal Government and the State Government. AlthoughI am convincedthat Australia must have a protectionist tariff, I recognize that the",19,Earle Page

TheAustralia labours is the effect of that tariff upon its industries. the value of imports into Western Australia from the eastern States, not taking into account goods from overseas landed in the eastern States and re-shipped to Western Australia, was £7,105,000, whereas the value of exports from Western Australia to the eastern States during the same period did not exceed £1,091,000. The eastern States would be very slightly affected by the imposition of a Western Australian Customs tariff, seeing that their trade with the western State is only £7,105,000 out £107,000,000. possible chance of industries being established in Western Australia, even if the population were five or six times what it is. The reason for this, as shown by the royal commission, is that goods from the eastern States are dumped on the Western Australian market. Our fruits are second to none in the world, but when Mr sary to impose such an onerous tax upon Rayner, an expert in the manufacture of jam, established a factory for making fig jam, Adelaide jam was sold in Perth at a price lower than it was fetching in Adelaide, and our little factory was put out of business. tries in operation prior to federation could not exist afterwards because of what we regard as unfair competition from the eastern States. I do not expect my free trade friends from Western Australia to agree with me on that point. the position. from their own point of view. When men of diverse political views risk the odium of being designated as State righters by standing up here for what they believe to be absolutely necessary for purposes before they could commence their State, there must be something in the claim they put forward. The effect of federation is reflected in the finances of Western Australia. Before the Commonwealth was established, its financial position was buoyant, but since then, no matter what Government has been in power, no matter what political party has been in control, the same depressing story has always been told at the end of each financial year-ther e is a deficit. The accumulated deficit is now £6,140,000. The average deficit over the last five years special treatment. It was an obligation of the has been £544,000. the Treasurer quoted figures for DecemI n 1924-25 ber to show that the State was apparently out of the financial wood, but according to the Argus of the 2nd February, the deficit for the present financial year wasi £505,000 at the end of the seventh month. Therefore the State is really in a worse position this year than in previous years. The people of Western Australia have tried hard to balance the State finances. The sacrifices they are making are reflected in the rate of the income tax, -the maximum being 4s. 7d. in the £1, whereas in the State of Victoriai t is only 6£d. in the £1. The effect of this heavy imof a total importation of post is that many people who have made There would be no money in the western State, possibly in pastoral pursuits, one of the most lucrative industries in Australia of recent years, send their money to Victoria for investment. It may be unpatriotic to their State for them to do so, but it is good business for them, and it is likely tc continue so long as the State finds it necesits people. Another disability under which Western Australia labours is .the fact that it has too large a territory for its population. Up to the 30th June, 1924, we had spent £3,680,000 on that Manufacturing indusportion of the State lying to the north of the 26th parallel of south latitude, and there is not very much to show for it. The development of the north of the continent is a Commonwealth problem. In that area, which covers 562,000 square miles, tliere is a white population of 5,147. MrM . CAMERON -What is keeping population away? opening up the Australian hinterland. In 1910, at Bencubbin, in the Swan electorate, the settlers were obliged to dig wells to get salt water to condense for drinking farming operations. To-day those men are a prosperous community of fanners. In the Australian hinterland it is difficult to open the closed fist of Nature; but we believe that ultimately the northern portion of Western Australia will be successfully developed. The population of Queensland, above the 26th parallel of south latitude, is 500,000. Speaking in the State House, on the 9th December, 1924, Mr P. Collier, the Premier saidThe north-west portion of Australia required The other evening Commonwealth to assist Western Australia",21,Earle Page

It was beyond the financial powers of the State to develop the rest of the State and the north-west as well the Commonwealth to assist the State in developing the north-west, just as it was its duty to find very considerable sums for the development of tbe Northern Territory. There was not much .hope of this State (Western Australia) giving the north-west much assistance for many years. BeforeI pass away from the problem of the north-west, which I have said previously is a matter to be dealt with by negotiations vernment and the State Government, me remind the House that there are many members of the State Government are not in favour of handing over this territory They are influenced in their attitude by the awful mess the Federal has made of the Northern Territory. is not my task at this moment to indicate methods that might prove successful in administering I want to show how much better ofT the State was prior to federation in respect of Customs duties upon commodities essential for the development of primary industries.

I believe that the people of the eastern States, if the matter were submitted to a referendum, would see their way to grant this concession, and the probability is, that after * 25 years the development of the State would be such that it would be in a position to walk side by side with the eastern States, thus enabling' one tariff to opebetween the Eederal Goratef o r the whole of the Commonwealth. let Meanwhile a grant should be made from year to year, as recommended by the who commission. One of the main causes of Western Australia's present disto the Federal Government. abilities is the decline of the. goldmining industry; A few years ago it Government employed 16,000 wage earners, their Itwages amounting to approximately £3,000,000 per annum. To-day the number of men similarly employed is about these distant territories. 5,000, their wages totalling about £.1,000,000 per annum. It has been said -and I believe truly-that every miner carries six other men on his back. The statement certainly is true of the eastern gold-fields, where the population is in ropes, and the region of 30,000. In those fields machinery were free, and there is property valued at £9,000,000; machinery paid a peppercorn but if the gold-mining industry is allowed of 5 per cent. Under the to become extinct-and it must do so Tariff now in operaunless measures are adopted by the Gomachinery pays a duty vernment to assist it-that property w ill not be worth ninepence. Western Australia's disabilities were increased greatly during the period between July, 1916 and February, 1919, when Australia's gold pays production was taken over hy the Commonwealth Government at the pre-war price of £4 4s. l l ^ d . per fine ounce. Every other industry benefited by the of manufacturing. Of the high prices caused by the war. Of the from gold valued at £15,000,000 which the gold producers of Australia were obliged to hand over to the Commonwealth Governmostly consists of boots, ment about two-thirds .came from Western tobacco, butter, and sugar. Australia. Previous to that commanthe exception of sugar, Wesdeering of our gold, the sum of could produce all of . £13,500,000 in sovereigns was sent I think there would from Australia toliquidate the liaQueensland bilities of the Imperial Government from in other countries, and to assist the Empire to prosecute tlie war successfally. Of the gold which was shipped Alf r o m the Commonwealth at the request of the British Government, £10.500,000 was sent to the Pacific coast of the United States of America, £1,500,000 to India, and £1,500,000 to SouthA f r i c a . Australia proved herself remarkably patriotic during the war. This country did not take even ordinary business precautions; other nations, particularly the United States of America and France, did not at any time forsake recognized business practice. tralia's patriotism, those engaged in the mining industry were called upon to make prodigious sacrifices. computed that the Australian gold producers lost from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 because of the action of the Commonwealth Government. is supported by the fact that since February, 1919, when the Gold Producers' Association was permitted to ship gold has distributed £ 3 j 0 0 , 0 0 0 by way of bonus. While gold remained at pre-war prices, the price of silver, copper, t in , and spelter increased by 100 per cent, over 1914 prices, and the price of lead by nearly 100 per cent; while prices for wheat, wool, coal, and coke increased to an even greater extent. As a result of the war, fifteen commodities used in the mining industry increased on the average by ""217 per cent. Yet the products from the mines had to be sold at pre-war rates. Isi t any wonder that the gold mining industry has declined? If the wheat farmers of this country had been treated in a. similar manner, there would have been a very vigorous outcry. Because of the higher cost of working the mines, selective mining became necessary. viously a 15-feet lode could be taken out, it became necessary to confine operations to the richest portion of the lode, and to take out from 3 to 4 feet only. Consequently large quantities of the poorer and lost for ever, and the life of the mines shortened. The cost of treating the ore, which in 1915 was 19s. 9d. per ton, increased to 38s. 7d. per ton in 1921. During the period 1913 to 1924 the value of the gold produced in Australia decreased from £9,376,573 to £3,131,583; in Western Australia the decrease in that period £2,258,440. All that the gold producers now ask for is a subsidy of £ 1 per fine ounce. That the Prime Minister him[88] self recognized that the recommendations of the commission regarding the goldmining industry were not altogether satisfactory is shown by his remarks, because, when speaking at Ararat on the 28th October last, he said that the whole of t h e ' evidence put before the commission was being! examined to ascertain whether the appointment of a special Because of Ausloyal commission to deal with the industry was warranted. The Prime Minister recognized that this matter should be It has been dealt with by experts. The British Government has subsidized the coal industr y to the extent of £10,000,000 up to the 1st May, 1926; indeed, one British CabiThat contention net Minister said that the subsidy might reach a total of £15,000,000. Some honourable members in the course of the debate have stated that gold is unnecesabroad without restriction, it sary. That remark might apply to the region which we hope to reach in the hereafter-althoug h we are told that there the streets are paved with gold, which, therefore, must be regarded as valuable . if only for. civic purposes-bu t in this work-a-day world it has been shown that those countries which have adopted gold as the basis of their currency are the only nations which have been able to stabilize their finances, and whose credit it is considered has stood good with other nations. The. Australian NotesA ct recognizes this fact, in that it provides that the Treasurer shall hold in gold coin reserves equal to not less than one-fourth of the note issue. If the Government substituted any other metal, or scrip certificates. fbF the basis of its currency, Australia would soon be in the position Where preoccupied by some of the Central and South American states to-day. When I was in South America, where there was no gold standard for currency, I sometimes received 6s. or 7s. a day for my labour, . whereas on the f o l ore have been buried lowing day, because of a fluctuation in the price of silver, my wages were possibly only 4s. 6d. Gold is essential to our national credit. It has been said in defence of its action that the Government made nothing out of the gold taken from the gold producers; in fact, the Government's action in sending sovereigns abroad has been acclaimed as an was from £5,581,701 to act of patriotism. The government of the day was so anxious to w in the war that it was prepared to rob the gold producers of Australia to do so. The then Treasurer found it necessary to increase the note issue, which iu June, 1916, was £9,590,000. to £55,000,000 by the 30th June, 1919-a n increase of nearly 600 per cent. done because Australia had to make greatly increased purchases, and because it was necessary to stabilize our finances. Our finances were stabilized at the expense of the gold producers: because' of their sacrifice, Australia to-day occupies a financial position which is the envy of other countries which also were engaged in the conflict. chairman of the commission to which I have referred, recommended a gold bonus. It is true that he recommended a bonus of 10s. an ounce only, which he considered should operate for a certain period of years, when .the question should be reviewed. The other members of the commission, Messrs. Entwistle and Mills, rejected the idea of a bonus. The reason for their rejection requires some explanation. Government, in order to assist the goldmining industry, appointed Mr C.. Kingsley Thomas, from South Africa, to make an investigation in an attemept ley Thomas reported that at that time the mines in Western. Australia were working with old plants, and adopting out-of-date methods. For twenty years those plants were among the foremost in the world, and for many years the mines paid enormous dividends. But, unfortunately, rhe London boards of control had regard only for immediate dividends, and in order to make them as big as possible they adopted a sequently, however much we may regret to admit it, the gold-mining companies of Western Australia have now no reserves with which to install new ma chinery. Gold-mining as 'an investment is not at present attractive. If the proposals contained in the report of Mr Thomas's report. I think that I have Kingsley Thomas are to be adopted, a gold bonus is necessary. In his report he suggested that in the South African mines one man did as much work as was performed by six men in the Western Australian mines. That suggestion is entirely disproved by the facts. Goldmining in South Africa and in Australia are entirely different propositions. In South Africa, they have what is Mr A. Preen. known as "" banket "" formations. Geologists can tell at what depth the banket formation may be reached over anydistance. Along the Rand there are 60 That was miles of that formation. As a result, companies. are prepared, in many instances, to spend enormous sums of money on a big shaft, knowing the formation they will strike, and how much it will b""e worth per acre. Another essential difference between the two countries is that in gold-mining on the Rand, in South Africa, there' are Mr Higgs, the 17,000 whites, and 181,000 coloured people employed. The gold mining industry of Australia is a white labour industry; that of South Africa is a coloured labour industry. In spite of the contention that the South Africans have the more up-to-date machinery, the miners of Western Australia do more per man than the miners -of South Africa. In 1923, according to the latest available South The Western Australian African figures, supplied by the Chamber of Mines, of Johannesburg, the output was 135 tons per man per annum. In Western Australia, ib was 163 tons in 1923, and was increased to 171 tons in 1924. This included the work of a large number of prospectors in various parts of the State. If we. compare the big industrial centres of the industry, whilst the South African output was 135 tons per man per annum, we turned out 297 tons per man -on the Golden Mile, in Western Australia, or about two and a half times the South African output per man. not so cheap! ' that, as we have always contended, white labour is the more efficient. The only reason. given by Messrs. Entwistle and Mills for turning down the gold bonus is the lack of efficiency in the working of the mines, as asserted in Mr Kingsley put up a good case for this form of assistance to the gold-mining industry; .but I go further. The Government is committed to two well-established national policies of Australia to-day. One is the protection of secondary industry, and the other the assistance of primary industries.

62,Short,"sighted policy, and conMr A. GREEN"" -The figures showtliat since 1916 the Commonwealth has spent £1,300,000 on bounties and similar forms of assistance for the production of sulphur, of iron and steel, and the export of meat, canned fruits, cattle, and wine. In the circumstances, I claim that the gold-mining industry is entitled to a bounty. I make the claim also on the ground of the observance of the White Australia policy. I can claim assistance for the gold-mining industry on the ground of what is being done for the sugar industry. I represent a State which has to bear its share of the large assistance paid to that industry. With thousands of people in Western Australia, I gladly assent to this, in order that sugar may he grown in this country with white labour, under Australian conditions, and at wages fixed by Australian Arbitration Courts. In Australia, in the various capitals, we pay 4£d. per lb. for sugar in order to support this policy. The import duty on white-grown sugar is £3 9s. 6d. per ton, whilst the importation of sugar grown by coloured labour is absolutely barred. We produce some 300,000 tons of sugar per annum in Australia, and yet the people of Auckland obtain Australian sugar from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at 3d. per lb., whilst in Australia the price is 4$d. served to the States, and I am always per lb. This country pays over £4,200,000' per annum practically by way of bonus to the sugar industiy in order that it may be kept a white man's industry. Just as we must have sugar, we must also have gold in order to stabilize our finances. We must get the gold we require from somewhere. We must §et it either from Western Australia, which has the largest area of auriferous country in the world, or from South Africa. If in dealing with the sugar industry we are prepared to pay a large bonus in order .that it may be maintained as a white man's industry under Australian, conditions and paying Australian rates of wages, so we may contend that the gold that is necessary to stabilize' the finances of the Commonwealth should be produced in Australia under White Australian conditions, and the 'Government shouhj. be prepared to pay the bonus necessary to assist the gold-mining industry under those conditions. speaking upon this question I should like the right of entry to other races. to say that what Western Australia is asking for is not charity hut justice, and I feel satisfied that it will be given some degree of justice by this House. I cannot commend the speech which was made by the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page). . He said that during last year the reveune received from Western Australia was £720,000 less than the expenditure of the Commonwealth in that State. The honourable gentleman, of course, adopted figures supplied by his department, but those figures were, I think, somewhat biased. The Treasurer of Western Australia in dealing with the same question showed, and I think with justification, that the amount received, by the Commonwealth from Western Australia was greater by £440,000 than the'amount expended in than State by the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green), suggested that some odium might attach to him for advocating something like State rights. I am a federalist. I helped to bring about federation, and to induce Western Australia to join it . Federation means the union of separate States in the Commonwealth ; but federalists are not unificationists, and, personally, I do not believe in unification. Under the Commonwealth Constitution certain powers are reprepared to fight for State rights, and to see that they are preserved. Those who are trying to bring about unification are doingtheir best to destroy the federation and to encourage secession movements, not only in Western Australia, but in some of. the other States as well. Western Australia joined the federation, and what it wants is that this Parliament shall honour the terms of the Constitution. Australia is a huge continent, as large as the United States of America, and Western Australia comprises one third of its area. I have in my possession a lithograph of a map of Australia, published in a Japanese magazine in the early stages of the war. It shows around the fringe of the Australian coast the full area of every country in Europe, with the exception of Russia. That storj without words was sent to all the peoples of the world and to the League of Nations, that it might be seen that we, in Australia, with less than 6,000,000 of people are holding this",25,Earle Page
63,Mr Gregory (Swan) [12.23],"In enormous country, and are refusingNo State has to a greater degree than Western Australia realized its obligation to settle people on the land successfully. Western Australia was in a practically moribund condition up to about 1892. I appreciate very highly the difficulties confronted by the early settlers who had little or no market for their production. Upon tbe discovery of gold at Coolgardie a change came over the scene. I was one who with others was attracted to Western Australia at that time. I do not suppose that Victoria was ever in a worse position than then. When I was leaving here, taking a few horses and a dray .to Western Australia to do prospecting, I had four bags of chaff and a bag of oats delivered at the wharf in Melbourne for 19s. lOd. Terrible distress prevailed in this place at that time. Old residents told me that they could get no one to occupy their houses. destitution was common in Melbourne at the time. of people and capital to Western Australia and the subsequent development that took place there, traders and manufacturers in Victoria were able to do marvellously well. afforded in Western Australia for the productions of Victoria, and to some extent also of South Australia, did much to build up the prosperity of those States. One cannot speak too highly of the great work performed in the early days by Sir John Forrest, who later became Lord Forrest, and was one of Australia's foremost statesmen. sible for the construction of railways, roads, and telegraph and for the supply of water to arid parts of the State. The Goldfields Water Scheme was a wonderful Western Australia was building itself up and becoming known to the world, and his position was so sound financially, that the Western Australian Government was able to borrow money for the Goldfields Water Scheme at par for 3 per cent. I do not believe that any other State in Australia has ever borrowed money upon such favorable terms. obtained because it was realized that the development of the State gave indications of great success. To show how desirous the people of that State were to build up Australia, I may inform honourable members that in the period from 1890 to Mr Gregory. 1901, when the federation was established, the people of Western Australia built 1,167 miles of railways, and spent £12,700,000 from loan moneys, and £2,000,000 from revenue on public works. They were spending loan moneys in the development of the country to the amount of £114 per head, whilst the average loan expenditure in all the other States of Australia was only £20 2s. 3d. per head. It cannot be contended that up to that period the people of Western Australia had not made every possible effort to build up the country. In 1896 and 1897 the people of the State began to seriously consider the proposal for the federation of the Australian States. The people of the eastern States were very keen about it. The people of Western Australia recognized, as did the people of the eastern States, that if they Actual joined the federation they must be prepared to make great sacrifices. They With the attraction did, indeed, make great sacrifices. Western Australia agreed to join the federation, and a special provision was inserted in the Constitution to enable the State to impose additional cusThe market toms duties for a period of five years. The Treasurer suggested that in . that way Western Australia imposed an extra penalty upon the Australian people, but he omitted to point out that the protection of that day does not compare with what is called protection to-day. The old protectionists would turn in their graves if they could hear of He was responthe extraordinary fiscal demands that are made in some quarters now. In comparilines, son with present-day duties the Western Australian tariff was free trade. To-day the yellow flag of prohibition flies at proposal. every port of the Commonwealth. The Braddon section of the Constitution provided that three-fourths of the customs revenue should be returned to the States during the first.ten.years of federation, but it was generally understood that upon the expiration of that period similar consideration would be extended to the States.. Before tlje Braddon clause expired, a conSuch terms were ference was held between the Commonwealth and the States at"" which a per capita payment of 25s. per annum to the States was agreed upon. The disabilities suffered by Western Australia were again recognized, and a special grant of £250,000, diminishing at the rate of £10,000 per annum, was arranged. I do not know whether the Treasurer mentioned that only half of that special grant is paid by the Commonwealth, the other half being contributed by the States. Probably that is . one of the reasons why the Commonwealth Government desires to confer with the State Premiers before any relief to the West is proposed beyond the grant for one year, to which this bill relates. tailed by the repeal of the Braddon section was followed by the Surplus Bevenue Act. tute was held to be constitutional, I am satisfied that it was contrary to the spirit of the federation. So also was the establishment of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The Constitution gave to the Commonwealth control of banking other than State banking, and there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that that limitation was intended, to protect the State savings banks. Australian Savings Bank suffered considerably as the result of the competition of the Commonwealth Bank. The fact is not generally realized that when the Commonwealth took over all the post offices it obtained also a certain amount of goodwill, in respect of the savings bank business. Thus, a good deal of the workers' savings which otherwise would have been deposited with the State bank, and been available to the State Government for the carrying on of public works, was paid into the Commonwealth institution. I consider that both the Surplus Bevenue Act and the intrusion of the Commonwealth into the field of savings banking were infringements of the Constitution and contrary to the true federal spirit. Up to 1914 Western Australia made very good progress, and was able to pay its way, although in 1913-14 there was a small deficit. The Great War did more harm to that State than to any other. In no other State did the manhood of Australia respond so magnificently to the call of the Empire. The response from'the goldfields was wonderful, and 'the exodus of young men to the theatres of war was a serious blow to the mining industry. of the miners enlisted. of the best type-youn g and able-bodied men. This meant, of course, a diminution of labour efficiency. The State was further penalized by the embargo on the export of gold, and the federal restrictions upon the base metal industry. Many mining companies were absolutely ruined by the Commonwealth Government's insistence that all base metals should be sent to the eastern States for treatment and realization. Tin had to be sent to Sydney, although a profit The great nnancial loss enof £40 could have been made by sending the ore to California. Copper ore, upon which a profit of £10 per ton eould Although that stahave been made by shipping it to Singapore, had to be sent to Port Kembla, and when freight, treatment, and realization charges were paid, not .one penny was returned to the mine-owners. The lead mines also suffered. In this way a very grave injury was done to tbe mining industry of Western Australia. That State was also at a disadvantage in that very little of the huge war exCertainly the Western penditure occurred within its boundaries. The total military and naval expenditure within Australia in connection with, the war was £156,615,000; the greater portion of that money was spent in Victoria and New South Wales, the people of which made huge profits. The war also greatly increased mining costs, and from 1920 onwards that burden has been further enlarged by the raising of the tariff dutiesPrior to the war the average working cost in the mines was 20s. 6d. per ton, but in 1921 it had increased to 38s. 7d. per ton. The honourable member for .Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) quoted figures showing the increased working cost and the enormous losses that have resulted in the mining industry. From 1914 to 1923 the earnings of the railways of Western Australia, which had been constructed at great capital cost, showed a decrease of nearly £2,000,000, whilst the revenue of the gold-fields water scheme was reduced by £481,000. Of course, the number of miners employed also decreased. During the war period the State Government fully realized the danger of economic disaster, and it may be truly said that no State ever made a more determined effort to settle its lands. The expenditure on public works for the purpose of assisting rural development between 1901 and 1923 was £40,000,000, representing",26,Earle Page

Thus, ever since it joined the federation Western Australia has been expending about £2 5s. per head above the average for the Commonwealth. The State Government has lent to settlers £19,500,000, of which £7,000,000 has been repaid. crop was only 201,000 acres; in 1911 that had increased to 855,000 acres; whilst in 1924 it was 2,323,000, an increase from 1901 of 1,100 per cent. A recent report shows that there are some 2,500,000 acres of light lands undeveloped within 12$ miles of existing railways, and we hope to make all this productive. What we need are people, capital, and lower producing costs. If honourable members will refer to the Commonwealth Tear-Booh, and study the statistics regarding land settlement, production, and expenditure on public works, they will realize the tremendous effort made by the Western Australian people to keep their State solvent. could do so much. borrowing. wasted there as well as elsewhere, but some losses of that kind are unavoidable. Certainly no other State of the Commonwealth has such a record of land development. I am not asking for charity for Western Australia, but I desire it to be built up as a portion of the Commonwealth. It is suffering very grave disabilities, and T realize that unless the policy of the Commonwealth is altered the man on the land will be placed in serious difficulties. Cheap production is essential to the future of that State. It is mainly a land of primary production, and is dependent upon the markets of the world where its products have to compete with those of all other countries. Moreover, Australia of all the primary producing countries, is most distant from the European markets. The cessation of primary production by this country would destroy our secondary industries and cause ruin and desolation. The average wheat production of Western Australia for the last five years has been 8.99 bushels to the acre, and of the rest of Australia for the same period 11.49 bushels; just 2£ bushels difference. The land in that State is cheap and can easily be cleared and cultivated. If the price of wheat were os. a bushel, the producers in Western Australia, compared with those in other States, would obtain, on an average, 12s. 6d. less for every acre of wheat sown by them. We must settle the people on the land and give them a chance of making a profitable In 1901 the area under living. If low prices for wheat were ruling, or if there were two or three bad harvests, the demand from Western Australia for secession would be so great that nothing in the wide world could stop it. I believe in federation, but we must settle people upon the soil under favorable conditions and with reasonable prospects of. success. The pastoral industry of Western Australia has made wonderful progress, and the fruit industry and the export of apples have gTown by leaps and bounds. I am hoping that, in the near future, we shall establish in that' State canning works, like those in Victoria. A special effort is being made, and huge sums of money are being expended in the establishment of group settlements in Western Australia, from which I believe a big dairying industry will develop. It is costing an enormous amount of money to clear those, forest lands, entailing high capital costs on each block, and it is essenI suppose money has been tial that we should make the means of production as cheap as possible. Since federation,the secondary industries of Western Australia have languished, because many large firms which had established factories there, found that it would be cheaper and more economical to establish them in Adelaide or Melbourne and to send goods to Western Australia by boat. establishing a branch, in Western Australia ? Lysaght's intend to establish works there. The pastoral industry of Western Australia has developed wonderfully. Huge areas of mining lands in the vicinity. ofKalgoorlie are now being bought at high prices by South Australian pastoralists, and enormous sums of money will be expended in wire netting that country. Rabbits are net so bad in the mining areas as they are in the agricultural areas, but wire netting is essential to keep out the dogs. I hope that honourable members will remember",28,Earle Page

The value per head of population in New South Wales is £ 6 6 ; in Victoria, £ 7 0 ; and in Western Australia, £ 3 4 . Owing to the tariff, the trade between Western Australia and the eastern States has greatly expanded of recent years. Prior to 1920 the trade between Western Australia and the eastern States amounted to £3,500,000, and during the last five yearsto £7,500,000 annually.

81,Mr Gregory,"It was lent for theof Western Australia. It sliould be recognized that the figures I in in Victoria and New South Wales show secondary industries in those States have benefited greatly from the policy pursued by the Commonwealth Government, and no one can say that Queensland has not also benefited enormously, although secondary industries have not been established on a large scale there. The embargo placed on the importation of sugar, and the heavy duties on bananas have been exceedingly beneficial to that State. But the policy that has been so beneficial to those States has been disastrous to the development of the industries of Western Australia. I believe that the only way to relieve Western Australia is to give her control of her customs tariff. If that were done, that State would, in twenty-five years, become one of the most prosperous in the Commonwealth. Honourable members must realize how essential it is for the defence of Australia to be able to show that we are making an effort to develop and people this country. I should like to quote the statement of Mr Keenan, who' is a federalist, and represented the Government of Western Australia, which is entirely opposed to a request being made to the Commonwealth to give Western Australia control of her tariff. In stating the case for his Government, Mr Keenan saidJ hold the very strong view that the fact that done its share towards its own developthe British Empire exists to-day is in one ment. It has spent more loan money in sense due to federation, because the war decided our fighting strength to the last breaking providing assistance to settlers than has strain, and any sensible man must admit that any other State of the Commonwealth; the effort Australia made must have been of but its progress has been retarded by the greatest value, as the very last ounce of strength was exhausted before we became vicoperation of the Navigation Act and by torious. Discounting the more extravagant the imposition of a high customs tariff. claims made by some Australians, no reasonable I was pleased to hear the honourable memperson can question the fact that, if the effort ber for Kalgoorlie ( MrA .

Remembering that, and remembering that has to be paid in Western Australia, that effort eould not have been made, as you people w it h money to invest are sending put it, Mr Chairman, if the States had been it away to Victoria, where taxation is all separate States, it is not possible to lightly conceive the possibility of federation being lower. destroyed. That is the view I take. But, notfurther evidence that the people of the withstanding the pride and value of federation, eastern States have benefited by the it might be purchased at too high a price, and it may be the view of many in this State that, policy of the federation, while Western although they favour federation, and still do Australia has suffered. I realize that so, the price they are called upon to pay for the Government is' justified in awaiting it is far too high. The price we are being called upon to pay various States, whose people might be for federation is much too high. . The called upon to share in any special paymethod of providing redress must ment to Western Australia; but the royal depend upon the good sense of gave members of this Parliament. I do regard to secondary industries not agree with the suggestion that the Commonwealth should take over the that since Federation, ' the north-west of Western Australia, unless it were for the purpose of creating a new State, although the population there might be too small at present to make a State. I do not think any one of sound sense would say that the Commonwealth should increase its territories u n t i l it had proved itself capable of building up the Northern Territory. But, although it is idle to suggest that the north-western portion of Western Australia should be added to the Northern Territory, it is the duty of the Commonwealth to do something substantial, even to the extent of making sacrifices, in an endeavour to people this great area in the north of the continent. According to the report of a Government officer, which has just come to hand, there is a magnificent area in the Kimberley district, close to Wyndham, which is available for closer settlement. Some years ago, Mr. Hobler reported that many new industries could be commenced in the north if only people were encouraged to go there by the provision of facilities for disposing of their produce. Railways are needed to open up this immense area, but Western Australia cannot afford to take the f u l l responsibility of'such an extensive work. No one can justly say that Western Australia has not While I regret this, it is only a conference of the Governments of the commission has already recommended that Those findings are now before us.

Western Australia's remoteness from tlie other States and the continually increasing cost of transport, coupled with the' impracticability of manufacturing on a large scale from lack of capacity to compete on competitive terms in eastern State markets, is in a great part responsible for this backward state of secondary industries.

They have taxed him from his feeding-bottle to his tombstone, -and I am afraid that with the weight they have laid upon him he will be unable to rise in response to the Angel Gabriel's last call. In dealing w it h this matter, the value of Western Australia to the Commonwealth must be. taken into consideration. agree w it h the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that the people of Western Australia desire to remain in the federation, but I point out that no State can continue to be penalized by a tariff in the way that Western Australia is penalized without the question of secession arising. People cannot live entirely on sentiment. The commission's report shows that in 1923 Western Australia purchased from the other States goods to the value of £6,465,557, whereas her importations from overseas were valued at only £811,756. Australia to be compelled to buy from the eastern Stalesi n order to enrich those States and penalize herself, and is she to be handicapped in her competition in the open markets of the world? I s the honourable Western Australia is penalized by a Navigation Act which places that State farther from Melbourne and Sydney than from NewY o r k or London These are the strangle-holds placed on Western' Australia by federation. I marvel that she has been able to exist at a l l under such a strain. The purchases of the eastern Statesf r o m Western Austi'alia amount to only £161,583 per annum. The eastern States, therefore, are useless to Western Australia as a market for her products. The honourable member for I understand that Hindmarsh ( MrM a k in ) said that the home market was the best market. I point out that Western Australia has no home market in the eastern States; the Australian market is no better for her than the London market. The effect of these disabilities on Western Australia must be evident to every thinking man. It may be claimed by the representatives of the eastern State's in this House that the high prices prevailing in Australia are of benefit to its people; that a protective policy is the right policy; that the Australian standard of livin g is not too high; but these contentions do not apply to . Western Australia. The commission says so. As pointed out by the honourable member for Swan, the State of Western Australia comprises practically one-third of the continent, whose area is 700 square miles greater than that of the United States of America. Prior to federation, there was no heavy burden of taxation in Western Australia, and the State was making steady progress. But as the tariff duties increased, her I difficulties increased. When the Prime Minister urges that loyalty and sentiment should make talk of secession i m possible, I reply that all Australian citizens, of whatever State, should be treated alike in matters of taxation. That is only fair. A £ 1 note should be as valuable in Western Australia as in any of the other States. Buti t is not. The evidence placed before the royal commission shows' clearly that it is not. When I gave evidence before the commission I invited it to call Mr Black, the Deputy Commissioner for Taxation Is Westerni n Western Australia, to appear before it. On page 83 of the commission's report we readI t will be observed that Mr Black is correct when he states that, on incomes in excess of £6,500. the rate of tax in Western Australia",34,Earle Page

93,Mr Prowse,"The statement of Siris higher than that in any other State of the blood into the body of an anaemic person Commonwealth. The difference between the tax paid on an income of £0,500 from personal exertion in Western Australia and the same amount of income in Victoria is remarkable£1,352 l is . 3d. in Western Australia, and £221 7s. Id. in Victoria. Yet we have Victorians laughing at Western Australian representatives, and suggesting that they should remain silent and say nothing about secession because of the federal sentiment. I am afraid that in this mundane world sentiment does not count, and governments charged with the carrying on of the affairs of the country recognize the importance of £ s. d. They are reluctant to impose upon their people heavier taxation than is absolutely necessary. I have shown the disabilities under which the people of Western Australia labour .as residents of a State that is part of the federation. They have to carry burdens that are not imposed upon the people of the other States. The Government should at least make the payment to Western Australia provided for in this bill, and, as suggested by the leaders of Labour during the election campaign, should continue the assistance, although I consider that if fiscal freedom were given to Western Australia., it would be very much better. would then have to adopt a system which the honourable member condemns. Western Australia, if given fiscal freedom, would adopt free trade. I am, and always have been, a revenue tariffist. Western Australia had her own tariff before federation. if given fiscal freedom, would determine what was good for them, and would not have to bear the crushing burdens which, according to the royal commission, have been imposed upon them as the result of federation. such things as tobacco and spirits, leaving implements used in production free, Western Australia could adopt means to develop its wealth. There are many ways of carrying on the government of a country without actually bleeding its people. T&e Treasurer has properly suggested that the treatment meted out to Australian citizens by the heavy taxation imposed upon them is like an infusion of from the left hand into the right handwith something lost in the process. Mr Black went further than to point out the difference between the taxation of money in Western Australia and in Victoria, and showed that it brought about naturally another very serious effect, and that is that people in Western Australia, with money to invest do not invest it in that State because the resultant profit would be so heavily taxed. One of the leading assessors of the Taxation Department said, to me on one occasion, "" Mr Prowse, I am surprised that you should have your money invested in Western Australia."" When I asked why. he said, ""Because""of the sound investments possible 'in the other States where the taxation, is not nearly so heavy as it is in Western Australia."" I put that before the royal .commission. At page 83 of the commission's report, it will be found that Mr Keenan saidOne thing is certain. It is not possible for this State to raise further revenue from her own citizens by taxation. Already the danger point has been reached in the burden of taxation placed upon the shoulders of the citizens of Western Australia. Capital is being frightened out of the State by this burden. To those who are conversant with the stringency of finance in this State, it seems ludicrous to talk of the capacity of Western Australia to .bear an increased burden of taxation. It is a matter of notoriety that those who have capital to invest-in ' many cases capital resulting from savings made during a life time in Western Australia-unfortunatel y prefer to invest tliat money in Victoria, despite all local sentiment, for tbe simple reason that they will obtain there a larger return with a less burden of taxation. Western Australians, This again causes another condition which I wish to bring under the notice of honourable members to show that they are not being asked to give a sop to Western Australia, but only partial compensation. The proof that this condition With a revenue tariff on is brought about is in the evidence given by the Western Australian Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. The head offices of many big manufacturing warehouses are situated in Melbourne, Adelaide, or Sydney. They have agents or branch houses in Perth. They have been known to sell to their agents or branches in Perth at prices which make a profit in the east, but no profit in Western Australia. If honourable members expect",35,Earle Page

95,Mr Prowse,"I do not say thatWestern Australians to remain loyal federalists, this Parliament will have to put them on the same basis as the people of the other States. The royal commission asked Mr Gillies, who was then Premier of Queensland, if he had anything to say. His answer was ""No, except that there are no disabilities suffered by Western Australia that are not suffered by Queensland."" I would not like to permit him to get away with a statement like that. Faithful to the federal sentiment, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) declared to-day that the sugar industry must be developed at any cost. Under that policy, Queensland benefits tremendously, and Western Australia suffers a great deal. In almost all the instances in which, as the result of the adoption of these policies, advantages, are given to the other States, Western Australia has to pay for them. If , like Queensland, we had in Western Australia a big industry that was being supported by the whole of the Commonwealth, we might have some cause for gratification. tralia develop such an industry, and we will support it . honourable member would not support it , but I am speaking of conditions as they exist, and dealing with the statement made by Mr Gillies. A constituent of mine wrote to me some time back from Bunbury. An important commodity of that district is jarrah timber. The people in Mauritius wanted two ship loads of jarrah or hardwood sleepers and called for tenders for their supply. The Bunbury people tendered and received a reply, "" As the ships would have to go out in ballast we are sorry we cannot accept your bender, but if you will take two ship loads of sugar at 2£d. per lb.""-w e were paying 6d. a lb. for the sake of Queensland"" we will take your timber."" We might have had a deal in sugar in Western Australia at 2$d. a lb. whilst making a deal with our local commodity, of jarrah timber. For Queensland's sake and to keep Up the federal spirit, our people had to forgo a deal in sugar and lose a contract for the supply of sleepers. One might quote instances ad infinitum to illustrate the position of Western Australia. If honourable members would read the report of the Western Australian Disabilities Royal Commission it would be unnecessary for the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), myself, or any other Western Australian representative, to speak on this matter at length; but if I were a betting man I should lay a good deal of odds that not 2 per cent, of the members of this House have read the report faithfully. MrM . CAMERON I have read it. the honourable member say so. If honourable members generally had read it much that I have said would be unnecessary. The principal industries of Western. Australia are wool, wheat, and fruit, and those industries are being rapidly developed. They are, however, greatly handicapped. Western Australia is trying to settle British migrants, but unless it can be done at a lower cost than is anticipated I am afraid the results will not be satisfactory. The wheat industry has progressed in Western Australia, not because of any legislative action by the Federal Parliament, but because of world conditions, and the increased price of wheat, largely due to the war and its aftermath'. If the price of wheat goes down in the world's market and costs of production in Australia are maintained-and they now amount to at least 4s,. a bushel -w e shall not be able"" to produce wheat for sale overseas. It must beadmitted that this question is of fundamental importance to the whole of Australia. Sir Frank Heath, on leaving this country, said that he did not make his report to Australia; but it should be interesting reading for Australians when he has made it to the Imperial authorities. He did, however, say to the people of Australia, "" Your main industry, your king-pin industry, is primary production. Without its development your secondary industries cannot be started. In England we get our money from manufactures; you get none of yours from that source. Your interest and sinking funds are paid with your primary products. Develop them."" That is the pronouncement of a man who was sent out here to inquire scientifically into our conditions. The production of gold in Western Australia is handicapped by conditions due to federation.

Previous governments have taken no notice of the position of Western Australia as a unit of the Federation. I give the Government due credit for the investigation by the royal commission. It has relieved Western Australian representatives of great responsibility, and should put an end to the jeering at the western State. The commission has declared, as a result of its investigation, that Western Australia does suffer from disabilities, and the question is: What is this Parliament going to do about it? I do not regard this measure as providing for more than a part of the compensation due to Western Australia. The Government, in pursuance of its promise to the people of that State, should hurry up with its definite and comprehensive policy to remedy the disabilities under which they labour because of Western Australia's partnership in the Federation. do not like this bill or the principle upon which it is founded. The State of Western Australia has to its credit a magnificent performance in the development of its natural resources. partners in the Commonwealth, it has faced and solved its problems with the true spirit of the best pioneers. am bound to say that I could not discern in the speeches delivered by the honourable members for Swan and Forrest anything of the optimism and breadth of vision of the late Lord Forrest. He was a great Australian statesman, and an ardent supporter of fiscal protection in the interests of the whole nation. was nothing little in his political composition. He took a comprehensive view of the nation and its needs, and no man in the history of Australia has done more for the development of any State and said so little about his deeds. I do not wish the House or the country fco think that I am opposed to granting assistance to Western Australia; I am quite prepared to vote for a scheme which will aid that great State to solve its problems, but I do not think that the royal commission has laid down a sound basis upon which such help should be founded. It has merely suggested the payment of an arbitrary amount. However, in order to honour the promise made on the hustI t used to be very much lower. ings by my leader, I shall vote for the compliment the Government on bill. I regard this Parliament as the constitutional trustee or bailee for all the States of any surplus of revenue that is available for distribution among the States after Federal requirements have been met, and this Parliament has no moral right to distribute that surplus in great sums to individual States without prior consultation of all the partners in the Commonwealth. That is the only proper and just procedure. No party should give an undertaking to pay a lump sum of £450*000 to one State because of certain disabilities under which it is said to labour. Many of Western Australia's disabilities are natural. On the other hand, the honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Forrest have declared that they are the result of federation and the unsound economic conditions prevailing to-day. This Parliament is now asked to subsidize those unsound conditions instead of remedying them. not to remove the fundamental causes of One of the youngest Western Australia's troubles, but to offer a palliative in the form of a subsidy. No State in the Union has experimented so much with socialism as has Western But' I Australia.

That is wroug. Western Australia was admitted t.o the union upon terms laid down by its own people, and those terms have been f a it h f u l l y honoured. In regard to Australian primary production generally, certain unsound economic conditions are retarding the progress of the country, but they cannot be cured by subsidies. We must go further. On one occasion only have I been a party to the granting of a subsidy. A t that time the meat industry of Australia was in a very bad way. London market for eight years, and all Australian meat works, excepting those in the metropolitan areas, were closed. In Queensland, eleven out of thirteen were closed. The Queensland meat producers asked for assistance and the matter was referred to me as the responsible Minister. recommend to the Governmentthe granting of a subsidy, because if . I did so, it would mean sudsidizing the impossible conditions that surrounded an industry at a time when the bottom had fallen out of the meat market and had previously a wonderful war contract. The Government suggested that if the shippers would reduce their freights, and the meat works their treatment charges, and if the. workers would accept a slightly lower wage, then the Commonwealth would subscribe £d. a lb. and thus build up the industry on a co-operative basis. A f t e r a good deal of negotiation the scheme was agreed to. It was the basis of the bounty to the meat industry. price-fixing ? tainlv' do not know ' to whom the honourable member is referring. Today we are suffering from economic conditions, brought about by the high values that. existed during the war and afterwards. Many industries have failed, and still the cost of production remains high. The problem arises: How are we to meet the position? This Parliament, even since I have been here, has passed half a dozen bills granting But a dismal bounties and gratuities, but that is not the way to meet the true economic posiand we are asked to tion of this country. We must go beyond that. While Australia is borrowing money of the State because of its heavily, and making money available, prices will not decrease; but when money becomes scarce the barriers to industry must immediately fall . Todayi t is easy to get money ""and, consequently, prices are high. I am not opposed to assisting Western Australia, but we are doing it on a wrong basis. A f t e r federal activities have been paid from the Commonwealth revenue, we are morally the trustees of the States for any surplus revenue, and our partners in federation should be bargaining with us, and be in accord with whatever advance Australian meat had been off the is made to a State out of the surplus revenue of the country. hardly fair to expect us to pass the bill this afternoon, especially as many honourable members expect a reply from the Treasurer on certain points. to the bill. sition to it , but there are matters that need explaining. I have no desire to prevent the bill from passing by 4 o'clock, if possible.

135,,"Mr MANN -There may be no oppohim that this grant is subsidizing an unsound position. That has been the burden of remarks of honourable members representing Western Australia ever since they have been in this Parliament. We have always tried to show that the proper method of dealing with Western Australia is to make her position sound; but if the Government refuses to do that and still continues along the road that it has always taken it will come to an intricate and uneconomical position from which it will be difficult to extricate itself. It is a road that may lead to disaster, and if it does, then we' who represent Western : Australia must be acquitted from any ulterior or wrong motive, because we have frequently pointed out that the subsidy system is unsound.. We have been obliged from force of circumstances to take advantage of the Government's offer, even although it ' m a y be objectionable to us. If we"" continue to grant subsidies and to increase duties on imported articles, the day must come when the whole false economic structure w ill topple about our ears. recognized that Western Australia is suffering"" some 'disability, and I believe that the House has no objection to the bill. I myself do.not object to it , except that the acceptance of the grant is very much against the grain. In the circumstances we-are forced to accept it . I have somewhat of a quarrel with the Treasurer regarding his method of presenting the measure. One could not help believing that he was not enamoured of it, and perhaps was unwilling to father a piece of the Cabinet's policy. Mr' MANN surer an easy,, method that I ha've been unjust to him. The commission's report recommended a grant of £450,000, to begin from July, 1924. In the first place, the Government said that it intended to adopt the commission's recommendation. election it was definitely stated in Perth By the Leader of the Government that the grant was to extend in its effect beyond this year. Under the billthe grant is for twelve months only. I tried by interjection when the Treasurer was speaking to get him to make some statement in accordance with the declaration of policy by the head of the Government, but he declined to do so. ments of the Prime Minister ancl myself .were very clear and definite, and are being given effect in the bill. was made By Senator Pearce, as the representative of the Government, at the opening of the campaign in Perth. He said in effect that the Government could not undertake i u indefinite terms to grant £450,000 for more than one year, out it did pledge itself that at the subsequent conference between the States and tbe Commonwealth it would undertake to accept this grant as a definite basis for additional payments to Western Australia. There has been no mention of that in the debate on this measure. necessarily mean that the Government will not carry out its pledge. is far too experienced not to know that unless mention is now made of the. matter it w ill very likely go into the limbo It has been generally of forget fulness. The result of the elections in Western Australia might have been very different if it had not been for Senator Pearce's statement.

142,Mr Mann,"W h a t any other Statedispute which has occurred as to the relative loss or gain as between the State and the Commonwealth, two sets of figures have been produced, one by the Treasurer, to the effect that Western Aus. tralia has gained by over £700,000, and the other by the State Treasurer, to the effect that the loss has amounted to £448,000. I quite agree with the statement made by fhe honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), that the commission ought tp be called ""the disagreement commission,"" because its members did not agree on very many points. Let me say in passing that the members of the commission were appointed from outside Western Australia, in the hope that no question would be raised as to their disinterestedness. It is an extraordinary fact that, although those figures were submitted, the members of the commission, one of whom was an ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth, in a. rather naive way said they were sorry they could not come to a conclusion as to which was right; and it is a strange coincidence that the figure adopted by the commission as the amount of compensation due to the State was approximately the amount stated by the State officer. Dr. said that the amount was £289.000, not £448,000. the Treasurer to read the evidence as well as the report. I say that the officer showed conclusively that the amount was £448,000. he simply stated it . I have read the evidence as closely as the honourable member has read it. able that the State officer put forward that figure, and that the same figure was adopted by the Commission as the amount of compensation due. The total grant provided in the bill is £450,000. that £448,000 was the amount of the loss, and in any case that is the nearest figure obtainable. His was the only complete and consecutive statement that came anywhere near the amount provided in the bill. The more we examine the figarcs as they have been examined here to-day, the more we see that the greater reliance must be placed upon the State officer's estimate. easily disproved. should have disproved it. this House. to do it. The commission has been sitting, and all the evidence should have been placed before it. Eor the Treasurer to make a statement which he knows honourable members will not have a sufficient opportunity to combat is not fair. I wish to make it. quite clear that there is a reasonable and reasoned basis for the amount of compensation proposed to be granted, and to lay particular stress upon the fact that this is only part of the fulfilment of the undertaking given by tlie Government to the State of Western Australia. While the Treasurer could not in his opening speech commit himself to the remainder of the undertaking, I urge upon him and the Governthe remainder of the undertaking should be carried out. We do not impugn the good faith of the Government in this matter. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) that .we should re-organize the basis of interstate and Commonwealth finance. That can only be done at a conference of representatives of the Commonwealth and the States. The present tendency of all our legislation is distinctly towards unification, and so long as the majority of the State Governments are Labour Governments, whose policy is in favour of unification, this Government, which professes not to support that policy, needs to be specially careful lest it unwittingly, and in pursuance of a desire for the centralization of power, places itself in the hands of those who in the States are not working in the bestinterests of the States.
