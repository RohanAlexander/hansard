18,Mr Spence (Darling) [10.36],"ISir time to read the Bill when we were first asked to discuss it. for capable men to grasp the meaning of the clauses of the measure, especially since these clauses deal with questions which they have heard discussed. A somewhat unusual expression applied by the honourable member for Parkes some time ago seems to me to fit the present case. He spoke about there being a large degree of inflammation in the discussion of certain subjects. That seems to me to fit the present discussion. The two great Melbourne dailies oppose the proposal for preference to unionists. The Argus does so on the ground that the union entrance fees may be prohibitive, overlooking the fact that a union whose entrance fees are prohibitive could not be registered, and could not apply to the Court. The leaders of trade unionism favour the open-door policy. which a union has had somewhat restrictive entrance fees is the noted New South Wales case of the coal lumpers' union. Whatever may be said from the point of view of the members of that union, it is well known that the policy of the Labour organizations has been to have an open door. Therefore the statements of the Argus are unfair even for an anti-Labour newspaper, and show what the honourable member for Parkes terms a large degree of inflammation. The Age, on tlie other hand, makes a wrong use of the statistics which are available. statistics bearing on a number of phases of the social problem. But this being a goa-head Government, questions are to be asked during the compilation of the census which will give us information regarding a variety of things about which we need it. figures will be more accurate than some that are supplied to us. rate as can be obtained. According to the Age, there are only 153,000 unionists in the Commonwealth, of whom 75 per cent, are in New South Wales. Every one knowing Australian conditions must be aware that there are proportionately as many unionists in Victoria as in New South Wales. The arbitration law of the latter State, however, requires unions which organize and register to send in returns. Many unions exist elsewhere which do not make returns. Their numbers, although known to us who are keenly interested in these matters, are JOHN FORREST -We had not had not known to the public. The Age is also wrong in assuming that those who are not members of unions at any given time are non-unionists. In connection with many of the unions, such as the Amalgamated Miners' Association, men contribute only while in work, and, when not contributing, are not counted as unionists. the same? rule of the union. Some unions limit the time for which a man's name may remain on the books after he has ceased to contribute. In other' cases, men contribute to unions, as to the Shearing Union for example, only when they happen to be engaged in a particular kind of work. Some men who follow more than one occupation contribute to more than one union. The majority of the rural workers, who are now being organized, are also shearers and The only instance in members of the Australian Workers Union. Many of these men are joining the Rural Workers Union, which is now being formed, and paying to the Australian Workers Union as well. Mr JosErH COOK -And being counted in both organizations.

28,Mr Spence,"That is not so. Theside of the House know nothing about the matter, and are quite impracticable in our ideas, especially with respect to country interests. It was peculiarly interesting to hear the honourable member delivering himself. But I have yet to learn that the honourable member for Flinders has had experience of being roused out of bed at 4 o'clock on a cold winter's morning to bring out the cows in a slushy yard for a "" refresher "" of ^ 1 a week. On the other hand, some honourable members on this side of the chamber have had a good deal ot practical experience. gaged both in the harvest field and in dairying. the honourable member for Flinders knows how to milk ! able member for Flinders know enough to become a secretary, and let others do the rouseabout work? practical experience which, I venture to say, has not fallen to the lot of the honourable member. There is a considerable degree of misunderstanding, which is, perhaps, natural and excusable, on this subject, and which may not be entirely due to what may be called prejudice. The whole aim of this legislation is to secure industrial peace. Trade unionists have been asked to give up a very great deal. The only weapon they have ever had for securing better conditionsa weapon which has been used with varying degrees of success, but with a very large measure of success as far as it has resulted in securing better wages, shorter hours, and a better status generally--is the barbarous one of striking. That is a weapon that becomes more evil in its effects as society becomes more complex, and as the union movement -the collective system-become s stronger ancl more widespread. Trade unionists, however, have agreed to give up this powerful weapon, and to submit their interests to the arbitrament of one mana man not of their class, no matter how able he may be, but who is appointed to decide finally between employees and employers. His decision must depend upon his capacity, and upon the'case presented by the parties to the plaint. That is the situation under the arbitration system. Under the member say that a small section in a trade Federal Arbitration Act with which Ave are can throw the whole industry into idleness? dealing just now, and in which a few amendments are proposed, we are so limited by certain vague expressions in the Constitution that at present the law is not of much value. WhatI am endeavouring to do this morning is not to indulge in word-spinning, such as we heard the other night. I am not drawing a fancy picture of what might happen. I wish to deal with what has happened, and what is going to happen. It is of no use to talk about what may possibly occur under . circumstances which can only with difficulty be imagined. We want to know what is likely I have been ento happen, and how the present law works and has worked in the past. To use a term employed by the honourable member for Echuca, we want to deal with the matter in the light of experience, and not trouble ourselves with difficulties that may suggest themselves to the minds of legal men based upon what supposed persons may do under supposed conditions. We are, I say, limited by the Federal Constitution. At present only a few organizations can come under the Federal Act at all. Those are the larger organizations which are federated in the various States and which are intimately connected with a number of sections pertaining to various industries. Having in view the present limitations, the Government have very wisely made provision for including smaller organizations. No one knows how far this may carry us, because, unfortunately, our Court has been in the habit of applying the dicta ofother Courts to Federal legislation. But whatever the effect may be in law, the aim is a right one, namely, to provide that groups of industries may come in under the Federal Act. ber mean related industries? industries. The point is this : If we aim at securing industrial peace, and require registered organizations to give up the weapon of the strike, it is manifestly a foolish thing to leave it open to a small section of workers who are unregistered under the Federal Act because of the smallness of their organization, to throw the whole of the big industry idle because they choose to go on strike. That, however, is what can take place now owing to the loopholes in our legislation. knows-n o one better than he-that there",16,Commonwealth Conciliation

I took him to be, referring to the whole industry of coal-getting in any one particular State. plies to most industries. dustry, however, is so important that a cessation of work in it has the effect of throwing a large number of manufacturing industries idle. These considerations emphasize the point with which I am dealing, that we ought to have sufficient power to stop strikes absolutely-that we ought to find a means of preventing such a thing as throwing a whole industry into idleness. If we have not that power at present, we are not carrying out the aim of securing industrial peace by law. member think that any machinery we could ever set up will stop strikes? this-that the subject with which we are dealing is so inherently complex and difficult that no scheme which can be evolved will work entirely satisfactorily. But out of several expedients we choose the best; and I say that the system of conciliation first and of arbitration as a supplement to it is the best that can be evolved. Certainly it is a great deal better than letting matters alone. I do not. say that we shall ever succeed completely. There may be some odd strikes, but that is no argument against trying to stop them. Experience has shown, however, that, with a conciliation and arbitration system in existence, the strikes sure prevent that ? that occur are trifling compared with the evils that prevailed before we had this prevent such a state of things. It would means of settlement. Even when strikes do occur there is invariably another side to the case. I do not, however, want to go into that matter now, because I admit frankly that you have to start by recognising that there are inherent difficulties. I only wish to have it remembered that it If the shed is of no use to bring forward little points, and to say that this thing and that can be done, as a reason for not passing this legislation. The trouble at present is that if a scheme of settlement is arrived at on behalf of an organization and its members, there are sometimes persons employed in subsidiary branches of the occupation affected who may not be separately organized, and who cause difficulty on their own account. Undoubtedly, therefore, power ought to be given to tlie Court to recognise the situation, and to include them in the settlement. It is therefore contended that power should be given to the Judge to deal wisely and fairly with cases brought before him, with the object of securing complete industrial peace. It would surely be a The coal infoolish thing to allow any one small section engaged in an industry to upset the whole. This is an argument against what was done by a previous Parliament in shutting out from the benefits of the Federal Act certain sections of employees. If the principle of conciliation and arbitration be a good one, why should any section of employees be able to commit a breach of the law or to upset what the law has decreed? There is no sense in leaving it open to one particular section of workers to go on strike whilst others are prevented from doing so. That is exactly what this Bill says. It is urged by honourable members opposite that the measure should not apply to farm labourers. Well, farm labourers are becoming organized. All sections of labour are becoming organized. Farm labourers at present often have it in their power to upset an industry. Consider what was done in New Zealand. We all know that when the grain is ripe and ready to fall to the ground, if it be not cut within a certain time loss to the farmer is entailed. The farm labourers, when the grain had reached that stage, went on strike in New Zealand and demanded 2s. 6d. an hour for their labour. They got it.

44,Mr Spence,"We are proposing toappear that a number of honourable members opposite prefer to give a chance to farm labourers to strike. I do not know why theyshould take up that attitude. I do not know why they should desire such things to occur in ""Australia as happened in New Zealand, when the farm labourers were able to insist on their demands simply because the farmers had to get their crops cut or the grain would have dropped out of the ear. Ours is a climate in which the grain ripens quickly, and has to be cut promptly. To leave the farm labourers outside the operation of such a law is wrong in principle. If it be wise to have certain conduct declared a crime for one section of the people it should be a crime for another section. Otherwise a very bad ethical effect is created. Other honourable members fear that domestic servants may get advantages under the Pederal law. If they become organized they should get an advantage from it. It might be difficult to apply such a law to them, but we merely -seek to declare that they shall not be differentiated from other sections of workers. If they become organized and registered we seek to provide that they shall not go on strike, but must, if they are discontented with their conditions, appeal to the law. There ought to be this equality, and for that reason the Government are acting properly in proposing to repeal the existing provisions. how can they be penalized ? has only to read the Act to see that a penalty may be enforced against their organization. forced against thousands of men? forced ' against their organization and its funds. The honourable member was not present when, in answer to an interjection, I stated that there are inherent difficulties in this form of legislation which have to be recognised. There is a limit to what we are able to do, and we are forced to make a choice of the best of alternatives. in which to deal with the matter. say that it is better than the old crude way of strikes. If the honourable member for Echuca is in favour of strikes, I can assure him that I am not, and never was. If he intends to oppose the repeal of the provision to which I have referred it must be because he is in favour of strikes and in favour of the farmer being placed at the mercy of his men at any time. I can assure the honourable member that if this provision is not repealed, the farmers will be placed in that position as sure as fate, because the rural workers are becoming organized, and the men who are taking the lead in that organization are veteran ancl experienced trade unionists, who have fought many an industrial battle, and know what strikes are. They will not consent to continue to labour under conditions which they do not approve, and the Government in this Bill, by repealing the provisions to which I have referred, are affording them an opportunity to secure the peaceful settlement of disputes by a judicial tribunal instead of by the old crude weapon of the. strike. Coming now to the question of preference to unionists, which is giving rise to a good deal of commotion, I should like to ask honourable members who took part in our previous legislation on this subject, what has been the effect of the limitations upon that principle imposed in the existing Act. I may remind them that this House, in dealing with the question, was almost unanimous on the subject of granting preference to unionists, but many believed that the application of the principle should be limited. The present Government, in the Bill before us, are proposing a limitation of the principle, which I do not consider fair. They propose that preference to unionists shall only be given where a minimum wage is fixed. I do not think that is a reasonable limitation of the application of the principle. Many cases may come before the"" Court in which the question at issue will not be a minimum wage, and will not depend on the remuneration of the employees at all. the guarantee of a minimum wage in an industry should be regarded as a reason against preference, and not for it. sonal view of the matter"", and I say that I do not see the necessity for limiting the application of the principle in the way proposed. I think that preference to unionists should apply to every award which the Arbitration Court makes. I ask what has been the effect of the limitations we imposed in the existing Act, upon the granting of preference to unionists. We provided that the Court might give preference to the members of a union if its rules did not provide for money contributions for political",18,Commonwealth Conciliation

In section 55 we embodied other limitations which, as pointed out by myself and others at the time, it was impossible for the unions to comply with. preference might be granted by the Court in cases where the majority of those affected by an award were members of a union. That was a thing impossible of proof. fused preference to 'unions, as that was professing to give it with one hand and taking it away with the other. It was an unfair provision, and was not creditable to this Parliament, because it was opposed to common-sense. We should have left it entirely to the Judge of the Arbitration Court, on the evidence, to say whether he will give preference or not. That was done in the original New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Until certain cases were taken to the higher Court, when Mr Justice Cohen was acting, and gave certain decisions, preference was regularly given, and I venture to say that no one ever heard a complaint of the working of the Act. No harm was done; there was no upheaval of society, and everything went on with greater harmony than before. 1 can give some of the effects of our legislation to emphasize my contention that the granting of preference to unionists exercises no coercive influence-that does not induce men to become members of unions. In 1891, before this kind of legislation was enacted, the Shearers' Union had a conference with employers, in which they gave up their previous claim to refuse to work with nonmembers. coerced into joining the union, and they conceded the point, and agreed to work with non-members. They made a collective bargain with the employers on those terms. What was the result? The opportunity was afforded for a test of the question whether, under ordinary conditions, men would voluntarily join or would leave the organization. that men joined the organization in thousands. When the agreement was broken, after three years' working, the organization was thousands stronger than it was before Mr Spence. That provision was modified, the agreement was made. Let me give an instance from the later experience qf the same organization, though it is now called the Australian Workers' Union. Over three years ago we had a settlement under The provision was a the present Act by Mr Justice O'Connor, sitting in the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The Australian Workers' Union is openly an organization that takes political action, and spends money on political work. In the circumstances, it The provision was that clearly could not look for a grant of preference. It had the choice of abandoning the rules under which it spent money upon political work, in order to secure preference to its members, because the organizaWe might just as well have retion fulfilled the other conditions upon which preference might be claimed. The Australian Workers' Union declined to do so. It sacrificed the chance to secure preference to its members in order to retain the power of political action. What was the result? Instead of losing members, it has increased its membership by 18,000. quite irrelevant. It does not touch the point. member does not see it, but if he waits a little I think he will see the point. The honourable member is aware that the principal argument against the proposal to give preference to unionists is that it interferes with the liberty of the individual, and is calculated to drive him against his will into a union. I am with the honourable member in objecting to coercive influence. I am endeavouring to show that, without is, the right of preference to its members, the Australian Workers' Union increased its membership from 30,000 to, roughly, 48,000 at the present time. The Union has been extended to States in which it did not previously exist, but it has increased its membership by at least 15,000 within the Some held that men had been area previously covered by its operations. Experience has shown that in all cases where, whether as the result of Court decisions or conferences, mutual arrangements between an employer and employee' have been arrived at, the unions affected have increased their membership, and it is only when there is industrial contention that their membership decreases. Men readily join an The result was organization when it has secured advantages for its members as the result of a conference. When the conditions of an industry have been improved, men voluntarily join the organization that has secured",19,Commonwealth Conciliation
53,Mr Joseph Cook,Surely that is,20,Commonwealth Conciliation
54,Mr Spence,"Possibly the honorablethe improvement. Some honourable members ask why, if that be so, we should seek for preference to unionists ; but I am pointhave studied unionists, individually and ing out that there is a good deal of exaggeration in the statements as to its possible advantages to the worker, and certainly a great deal of exaggeration as to its coercive influence in inducing men to join unions, which is the only objection raised to it. I am answering the objection of the honourable member for Flinders, who claimed that the provision was intended to exercise a coercive influence in order to build up trade unions. I have shown that without preference to unionists organizations have increased their membership. There is, of course, always an increasing amount of propaganda work going on, and men are becoming sensible enough to see that collective bargaining is best. Experience has shown that wherever workers are organized, their wages and conditions are better than where they are not organized. I might quote the case of the bakers in Sydney, which is known to many members of this House. Before the Arbitration Act was passed at all, unionists in the baking trade were working for 56s. for a week of forty-eight hours, whilst non-unionists in the same trade worked for 36s. for a weekof ninety hours. In spite of this, master bakers employing unionists competed successfully with those employing non-unionists, because of the greater efficiency of the union bakers. I say that experience has shown that preference to unionists does not exercise a coercive influence in forcing men to join unions. Under peaceful conditions unions grow, and we have to consider how they affect the employer in his choice of efficient workmen. The honourable member for Echuca has appealed to the light of experience as a guide, and, following his example, I think I can show that, even according to the admissions of employers, the best and most intelligent workmen are to be found in the unions; indeed, it would be remarkable if that were not so. And here I should like to emphasize the fact that brains are necesbecause, under such circumstances, there sary in all branches of work-that there is no such thing as unskilled labour. Some people describe .1 man as having a "" happy knack,"" as distinguished from skill; but what, I ask, is "" knack "" but skill? any one who is not at the zenith of his is very impatient, and.apparently suffering power. benefit to all classes, and I never knew a a case where the employer knows the man who was not made a better husband, father, and citizen by being a unionist. I collectively, for very many years; and it cannot be denied that a man, when he joins a union, is placed in an environment which tends to eliminate all selfishness, not only in his relations with -his fellow workers, but in his relations with his employer. It is admitted that the most intelligent men are naturally the first to take steps to improve their conditions; and the moral suasion exercised has a tendency to squeeze out those who are only casually employed and who cannot be brought to see the benefits of organization. Seeing that the best men are in the unions, no hardship or injustice is involved in asking the employer to give preference to unionists-h e is only asked to employ the most efficient men. not do that without being asked to do so ? point which the Attorney-General replied to by way of interjection; but, of course, a question of the kind cannot be properly dealt with in that way. The question is-Who will have to decide as to the relative efficiency of the workmen applying? and to this the Attorney-General answered that the decision must be left to the employer. So far as I understand the question, the Judge, in giving an award, would have to show in detail how the employer is to give preference. If two men appear, has the employer to ask which is the unionist, or what has he to do? All such contingencies, however, can be provided for in the award without any trouble; but I understand that, other things being equal, the employer must give preference to the unionist or be guilty of an offence. Suppose a unionist and a non-unionist apply for work, and the employer knows that the unionist is incompetent-and no one will deny that some unionists are-and the employer takes the better man in the person of the non-unionist, he must succeed in the event of the case being taken to Court, would not be equality of efficiency, and preference need not be given. informed us explicitly that the employer would have the right of determination. from that ""inflammation"" of which the",20,Commonwealth Conciliation

Sir ployer to fight the union in Court! stances an employer cannot get info trouble, because it is recognised by trie union that he must control his industry, and has the right to discharge a man who proves to be inefficient. exercise such a right, and I think the right honourable member is referring to another set of circumstances altogether. This principle has been in actual working in New South Wales without any complaint. In quite a number of industries in which the majority of men employed are unionists, it is common for the employer to send to the union office if he requires a man. True, I have heard some say, "" Yes, and nice sort of men are sent ! "" ; but no union secretary who showed any favouritism could hold his position for a week. The unions in this connection have a properly-organized system with a regular roll of unemployed, and the secretary must give every man his chance in proper order. ber sure that there is no social influence used? can assure 'honourable members that there is no more alert body of men than the union secretaries. ployers, and there always have lieen, who do not employ any but unionists if these can be obtained; and this they do simply because they have more faith in unionists, and for other advantages which such a policy undoubtedly confers. known to any one of practical experience that there is a strong feeling against any man who refuses to join a union; but I must say that the number of such men is very limited. It is a mistake made by many people to regard every man who does not join a union as a non-unionist. We take unionism as a principle meaning something-as meaning character-and there are men, who, distinguished from those I have just mentioned, may be termed antiunionists. ber once said that a man who refused to join a union was not entitled to Christian burial. I saw the report of the honourable member's words. those terms. ber was addressing shearers at the time. I have said stronger things. Anti-unionists are altogether of a different class from those who are simply not members of unions. . There are numbers of men who are not in unions, but who are unionists. to the honourable member having spoken of anti-unionists; he spoke of ""scabs"" and "" blacklegs "" as not entitled to Christian burial. of the criminal type-that they were absolute criminals-and I say so again here and now. Employers with any sense would not have such men about them, and those employers who have employed antiunionists at higher wages than are paid for unionists, have done so under fighting conditions, whereas now we have in view peaceful times. I do not wish to be drawn into extreme statements, but merely to be understood as distinguishing between men who are not members of unions and men who are anti-unionists, the latter being altogether of a different type, who do not deserve consideration. I was sixteen years secretary 'of a branch of a miners' union which averaged about 1,400 members, and in all that time. I knew of only three cases of men absolutely declining to join. The rule of the district was that every man had There are numbers of emto become a member, and that rule was recognised by the employers to their own benefit. The number of men who have to be coerced is so infinitesimal as not to be worth considering, and what coercion there is, is not against the employers. TheI t is well honourable member for Swan evidently has in his mind conditions quite apart from those of an award or conference settlementIt is true that men have refused to work with non-unionists, and that there has been trouble on this ground over and over again. To those members, however, who desire to have absolute freedom, I point out that the employment of unionists is altogether to the employers interests. If a man in",21,Commonwealth Conciliation

It is, therefore, a trade' union in the full sense of the word, and preference means preference of employment in that particular industry. If the members of the union are also politicians, I arc glad to know it. We hope that every member of the public is a politician. The fanners and selectors themselves are now all openly political, and the time has gone by when that sort of thing could be objected to. member for Flinders, and others, suggest that to bring farm labourers, viticulturists, dairymen, and others under the Act will be injurious to those connected with those occupations. I should have liked to hear the honourable member elaborate that argument a little more. If that is to be the effect, he ought to have shown how it is to be brought about. I should like to know what arguments he would use to induce a poor fellow who is working for 15s. or JQI a week to believe that it will be injurious to him to get 30s. or Â£ 2 a week. I think he would find it difficult, with all his ability, to conothers, let the employers pay them more vince that man that he was going to be injured. WhatI think the honourable member was driving at is the old stock argument that we have heard for ages,. that some men are worth more than others. The way that has always been applied is, that you should have the best workmen at a certain rate of wages, and the rest all below it, and that the employer is to fix what the wage shall be. It is just as well to recognise that that idea is knocked out altogether. Public opinion is against it, and it is just as well that we should realize where we stand on this question.' Public opinion is against sweating of all kinds. The Parliament of the Commonwealth has declared that every man should receive a fair and reasonable wage, and a Justice of the High Court has laid it down that a fair and reasonable wage is that which will enable the most unskilled workman to maintain his wife and children as they ought to be maintained in a civilized community. That dictum has been endorsed by Judges in Arbitration Courts, both in New South Wales and Western Australia, as well as elsewhere. In the circumstances, therefore, why should we hark back to the old idea of what is a fair remuneration to pay a man ? Where there are no rules laid down, who is to be the judge of what is a fair wage? I have met many employers who, according to their own statements, have been most unfortunate, and have never had working for them a man who could earn his tucker. The truth is that they are unreasonable men. There are unreasonable employers and unreasonable workmen. Human nature is not altered by its division into two classes; employer and employed. We say that human beings must be recognised as such. If a man happens to be less skilled than some of his fellows, whose fault is it ? It is not always his own. Have we not heard of the difficulties in the way of apprentices being The honourable properly trained so as to become skilled tradesmen? We are not going to allow a man to be penalized because he chances to be a little less skilful than some one else, I repudiate the idea that in some classes of employment no skill is required. Skill is necessary in connection with everything that a man has to do, and every worker is entitled to fair conditions. The minimum wage fixed in connection with any industry must be in accordance with the principle that the Commonwealth Parliament itself has laid down. A minimum wage must be fixed, and if some men are better than than the minimum wage. Fear has been expressed that farmers will not be able to pay a fair ancl reasonable wage, and, at the same time, make a living for themselves out of their land. I do not think there is any cause for alarm. We have had already a little experience in organizing farm labourers, and it may be news to the. Opposition to learn that quite a host of farmers are in full sympathy with this movement. They do not object to it ; they do not object to the wage for which it is proposed to ask. As a matter of fact, many farmers are already paying it. my electorate are paying even more. first steps taken in establishing a new organization is to ascertain what a fair employer pays, and that is taken as a guide in determining what the minimum wage ought to be. pay a fair wage get the best workmen. There is a highly exaggerated fear that farmers will be crushed if rural workers are brought under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. We say that we should apply to every industry the principle that we have applied chiefly to the manufacturing industries, and say that sweating of every kind",24,Commonwealth Conciliation

80,Mr Spence,That is so. One of the,25,Commonwealth Conciliation
81,Mr Frank Foster,And the men who,25,Commonwealth Conciliation
82,Mr Spence,"Certainly they do.must be abolished. Let me cite the experience of a friend of mine engaged in the dairying industry in connection with which it is supposed that certain conditions are absolutely necessary. I admit that it is impossible in the dairying industry to .get away from a working week of seven days, but my friend, whois a most experienced dairyman in New South Wales, never works any of his men more than eight hours a day. Further, he does not (hesitate to say that dairymen who work their men more than eight hours a day do mot know how to manage their business. He 'has been in the industry from his boyhood. As a lad he knew what it was to be roused at 4 o'clock in the morning in accordance with the old idea that a start should be made at that time,, and he declared that if ever he reached manhood's estate and had -.children of his own, he would take care -that they should not suffer the same experience. As a matter of fact he has carried out his resolve and has been most successful. He is frequently called upon to act as a judge of butter and other dairy products at agricultural shows, and is regarded as a thoroughly up-to-date man. It is very often due to a mistaken idea prompted by greed, that low wages are paid. Some men think that cheap labour and long hours alone are payable, but that is an altogether erroneous impression. Neither a man nor a machine can be continuously kept going with success for more than a certain number df hours. I would remind honourable members of the experience of the Austrian coal and lignite mines, in which, from 1884 until 1902, men used to work for twelve hours a day. In the last-named year a change was made to a working day of nine hours, in respect of about 75 per cent, of the workmen, and. since then, the output of coal per man for a nine hours' shift has been 6 per cent, in advance of the output for a twelve hours' shift, whilst in the case of lignite, the output has increased by 9 per cent, per man. Thus the employers who fought against the reduction of the working day from twelve to nine hours were fighting against their own interests. I can. support this experience from my own personal knowledge of what has occurred in Australia, where, under a ten hours a day system, the output per man was less than is obtained under the same conditions for an eight hours' shift.. It must be recognised that the employer who fights for long hours, believing that he will be ruined Mr Spence. if he is called upon to give better conditions, is fighting against his own interests. member seen the statistics taken in London in regard to the number of bricks laid by bricklayers there as compared, with the average in the United States. upon the thickness of the wall that is being built. shown by those statistics? My reading of them was that the eight hours per day American bricklayer beat the ten hours per day English bricklayer. adopt in Australia the American idea that only the man who can "" g o the pace"" should be employed. No doubt the honourable member for Parkes has read Foster Fraser's book, in which he describes a visit to certain works in the United States, and states that when he inquired, "" Where are the old men,"" his guide, filling his pipe, started to move away. "" Where are you going? "" asked Mr Foster Fraser. "" I am off to the cemetery,"" replied the guide, ""that's where the old men are."" We do not want Americanisms of that kind; we must remember that there is a limit to the best a man can give. We cannot run even a locomotive continuously. It must be laid up now ancl again, otherwise it will soon fall to pieces, and we cannot expect a human being to be always working. I cannot help recalling to mind an experience that I had when harvesting for a "" cockie "" who used to wish that a modern Joshua vjould come along and cause the sun to stand still so that he might have a twenty four hours' day for his men. That is not the principle upon which the successful man works. Some fear that the making of an award by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court in respect of men employed in rural industries will give rise to difficulties, but I do not think that it will. I recognise that there are on the land small men who are struggling hard to make a living, and who are naturally timid of such legislation as this; but, having regard to the conditions laid down for the guidance of the Court, there is no cause for anxiety on their part. If this Bill be carried it will apply, amongst others, to gardeners. Will any one say that gardening is not a skilled occupation?

Does the Attorney General desire to put into statutory form the judgment of the High Court in that case, or does he wish to go beyond that judgment? that ought to be done.

Ordinarily in indusfeel that it would be difficult for a Court to tries the men are not bound for any long period of service, the masters are not bound to employ the men for any particular period, nor are the men bound to continue to work for any particular period. Very often the men are paid wages by the day or by the week. But, although the men who are employed for the moment are not actually bound to come to work the next day, still, in the ordinary acceptation of the terms, the relation of employer and employee is understood to continue to exist. When there is a strike the relation has, in one sense, ceased. The employees have gone out of employment and have refused to work. which the terms may be understood, they were the very class of persons with whom the legislature was dealing when it made provision for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes words "" employer "" and "" employ^ "" in the sense in which, I think, that they were used by the Legislature, I think that the answer to the question is that the relation did not come to an end. The Courts are specially instituted to deal with the temporary cessations of work brought about by strikes. one from the decision in Brown's case.

Certain words are to be omitted from the principal Act with a view to bringing that about, though the honourable member said that he was not sure that that was necessary, because he thought that the intention was made fairly clear by many decisions of the Court. I should like to know what those decisions are. extract from a judgment of the Chief Justice in the Jumbunna caseThe term ""industry"" should be construed as including all forms of employment in which large numbers of persons are employed, the sudden cessation of whose work might prejudicially affect the orderly operations of civil life. The Chief Justice is there referring, not to the Arbitration Act, but to the Constitution, as his opening remarks show. posal to which I am referring was discussed very fully on a former occasion, when I , with others, voted against the inclusion of tlie classes named, and a large majority agreed to exclude them.

Bill, but if effective for the Commonwealth it will be equally effective for the States. I am arguing a question of policy, and say that there is no justification for the proposed step. The States are developing policies to meet their circumstances, and we had better leave local disputes to them. Coming to another matter, the honourable member proposes to define an industrial dispute as one extending beyond the limits of any State in relation to employment in an industry carried on by or under the control of the Commonwealth or a State, or any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State. The words relating to railway servants have been omitted, but it seems to me that the provision to which I refer must, on the gene'ral reasoning of the High Court, be of doubtful constitutionality. Court has not gone so far as that. ber think the provision constitutional? should not shrink from exercising powers which are not ultra vires. I refer invites contention, the issue of which is certainly doubtful. Let me read from the ruling laid down in D* Emden v. Pedder, cited in the railway employees case"" In considering the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the States it is essential to bear m mind that each is, within the ambit of its authority, a sovereign State, subject only to the restrictions imposed by the Imperial connection, and to the provisions of the Constitution either The honourable expressed or necessarily implied It follows that when a State attempts to give its legislative or executive authority an operation which, if valid, would fetter, control, or interfere with the free exercise of the legislative or executive power of the Commonwealth, the attempt, unless expressly authorized by the Constitution, is to lhat extent invalid and inoperative. And this appears to be the true test to be applied in determining the validity of State laws and their applicability to Federal transactions. In that case there is an attempted invasion by the State of the ambit of the Commonwealth authority. This case is the converse; but the doctrine is equally applicable."" The Commonwealth has no power to invade Ihe State field of activity. barrass a State instrumentality. the question arises: What is an instrumentality? The Court has held, as regards the railway servants, that theirs is an industry which a State can carry on without interference from the Commonwealth. There are other industries that can be carried on by a State-say , a State coal mine. throughout that case that a State could indefinitely increase its functions and call them State instrumentalities. case was as to the State railway servants, and a doctrine was clearly laid down, as regards them, that was to be applied in each case. was something quite different. finition was given of what is or is not a.

146,Mr Groom,"It is true that no dethat a State's railways were an instrumentality of the State. same time, it was laid down by the Court that no decision could be given as to what is or is not a State instrumentality. But we know that, as far as Australia is concerned, there is no rule as regards the appurpose of preventing disputes the better it plication of the functions of a State. A State in this country-ver y properlysimply acts on the principle that it will take whatever action is necessary in the interests of the public. The Attorney-. General is simply putting into this Bill words which invite litigation. opinion. The next important point to whicli I should like the Attorney-General to give full consideration is that he seeks to include in the definition of "" industrial the representatives of the parties together dispute"" ""any threatened or pending or probable industrial dispute."" The words are exceedingly wide. They are not limited in any way by any indication which would show that it is only intended that the measure should apply to those disputes which may probably extend beyond the limits of a State -Does the Attorney General intend, by the use of these words, to give the Court power to interfere in a dispute that is entirely a State disputeor threatens to become a State disputeand is not likely, by its very nature, to extend beyond the particular State in which it occurs ? sary for the purpose of amending the section .relating to the conciliation power. give the Court or tribunal power to interfere in the case of a threatened, or pending, or probable, industrial dispute, even if it is not likely to extend beyond the limits of a State? If so, I doubt whether this Parliament has power to deal with the matter in that way. Are these words intended only to apply to threatened, or pending, or probable, industrial disputes of an Inter-State nature? I call the Attortakes to the Court; and that is that the ney-General's attention to this point, and ask him to consider it carefully; because it seems to me that, unless the clause in question is limited in some way, we are simply assuming a power which it is exceedingly doubtful whether we possess. are a valid exercise of the powers that we have. point is that the Attorney-General is asking this Parliament to confer upon the Court power to deal with conciliation in a fuller measure than hitherto. As regards that point, I am entirely in sympathy with what the Government desire. Because the more we use our powers of conciliation for the will be for all parties concerned. I do not, however, commit myself to the exact wording of the clause. Our powers of conciliation are powers for the prevention of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any State. I am quite prepared to assist the Attorney-General in exercising all the powers that may enable tlie Court to fulfil its function of conciliation. It is my desire to see the Court exercise its functions and powers as far as relates to calling before any bitterness arises, to reason with them, and to endeavour to bring them to realize the injustice they may do to societv in general by causing a dispute. The more we can do that the better for all parties concerned. As regards clause 7, I certainly can see no objection whatever to the principle which the Attorney* General is asking us to adopt, as regards the power of amendment. If at the present time,"" owing' to some technical provision of the law, it is impossible for the Court to settle a real dispute between parties, because, owing to some mistake in the original plaint, they have not referred to something which should have been referred to, then I say that it is a wise and proper thing that the President of the Court should have the power of amendment, in order that he may deal with the whole matter which is the subject of the industrial dispute between the parties. That, I say, Is quite right. If , in the course of the proceedings, it appears that something has been omitted, or that it is desirable to amend some particulars, by all means let the Court do that. But a point arises on a further power which the Attorney-General Court mayinclude in the award or order any matter or thing which the Court thinks necessary or expedient for the purpose of preventing or settling the dispute. I think that if the Attorney-General looks closely into our powers he will find, as regards the amendment, that the power will",31,Commonwealth Conciliation

We said that he might or might not give preference. Honourable members will remember that in every tribunal of the kind, set up before the establishment of Federation this power was left as a discretionary power with the Judge. In New Zealand the Judge decided that the granting of preference was discretionary. His decision was referred to the Appeal Court, and the Appeal Court sustained his opinion. Then doubts arose, and the matter was about to be taken to the Privy Council, when the State Parliament stepped in and settled it by passing an Act givingthe Judge of the Arbitration Court the power.

It is the same as if we set aside the constitutional provision altogether, and said, "" It is the will of this Parliament that there shall be preference to unionists."" between conferring a discretion upon the Court and taking it away? So far as ""our powers are concerned is not the principle the same? we can lay down the conditions under which the Court shall exercise its jurisdiction. But the Government are proposing that something altogether different should be done, and that in respect of this class of cases the discretion previously given to the Court should be taken away.

219,Mr Groom,"The honourable mem-'can do it with respect to every other. The Attorney-General should look at the definition of "" Industrial matters"" in the existing Act. It reads"" Industrial matters"" includes all matters reliament dominated by one of the parties to lating to work, pay, wages, required hours, privithe dispute? Let us suppose, for instance, leges] rights, or duties of employers or employees, or the mode, terms, and conditions of employment or non-employment; and in particular, but without limiting the general scope of this definition, includes all matters pertaining to the relations of employers and employees, and the employment, preferential employment and so on. When the Act was framed we contemplated that this class of dispute was one in which the tribunal we created would have to decide. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.1j p.m. was pointing out that, amongst some of the industrial matters intended to be submitted to the Court is the very subject on which we are now legislating, as shown by fhe words of section 4 of the principal Act, namely, "" the relations of employers and employees, and the employment, preferential employment, dismissal or nonemployment of any particular persons."" I was contending that if the House claims the right to be able to decide arbitrarily that preference .shall be given in one way, there is no reason why we should not lay down terms just as arbitrarily in relation to every industrial matter and dispute. If we can say that preference shall be given to unionists, we can say that certain wages shall be paid, certain hours shall be fixed, and only certain privileges granted, arid also, on the application of any of the parties, limit the number of apprentices to be allowed to the number of journeymen. If we decide all these different matters, we substitute the will of Parliament for the determination of the arbitration tribunal, and really put ourselves in the position of being judges in our own cause. Clearly it was intended that we should have power to constitute a tribunal endowed with the judicial power to determine disputes; but we are going further and saying not only that we will determine disputes, but will legislate in such a way as not to allow a matter to even be the subject of a dispute. We take away the liberty of the subject by abolishing the right of even raising a dispute on a point 'at issue. Is Parliament a proper tribunal to settle disputes between employers and employed? Should we take the place of the judicial tribunal? It might happen that one side or the other was deeply tinged with political bias in favour of either one or other of the contestants. Are we to have a determination not by a judicial tribunal, but by a Parthe Parliament was absolutely under the control of the employers; would it be right and just, then, for Parliament to lay down conditions and decide the point at issue? will admit that Parliaments have so done in the past. point, which is the right or wrong of the position. I should be sorry to suggest such a thing, but it might happen that the majority consisted of secretaries, presidents, and prominent members of unions; and, under such circumstances, I ask whether it would be right, in a dispute as to the employment or non-employment of unionists, to leave the decision to such a tribunal? Would such a policy not be contrary to the first elements of British justice ? sentatives of capital have been doing for years-for centuries. honourable members opposite regarded that as so great a wrong that they determined, when they came to power, to remove the injustice. opposite only discover the wrong when they lose the power! members opposite to show the strength of their convictions. I am appealing on the ground of abstract justice for what is right as between man and man. What is proposed now is to declare that Parliament, which may have a majority representing employers or employees, shall, without hearing the merits of a dispute, lay down an arbitrary rule deciding matters which' hitherto have always been the subject of judicial inquiry. a dispute, but of principle. the exercise of power-whethe r this House should determine matters which have always been left to a judicial tribunal. tenderness is heart breaking when we think of his hard-heartedness in the past!",36,Commonwealth Conciliation

So far that maxim has been applied to industrial disputes; and they have been removed from the realm of party strife and warfare. The determination has hitherto been arrived at in a quiet, judicial atmosphere; and every question of whether or not preference shall be given should be decided on its merits. What is proposed now is to consider these questions from a political stand-point; and we have seen the effects already during the present discussion, in the aspersions which have been cast by some honourable members on others. From the very nature of these disputes it is essential that they should be submitted to a judicial tribunal. I raise two points, the first of which is that we are substituting the will of Parliament for the will of the Arbitration Court, and that it is open to serious question whether, under the Constitution we have power to do so. The second point is that, seeing this is a quesquestion that should be determined in tion that strikes fundamentally at the relacases of dispute away from the politions between employers and employed, and is essentially a subject for judicial inonly be attained by leaving it to a vestigation, even if we had the power, it is better to leave the determination of it to the Court. What is the power that the Court should have? I have always held in this House that the Court should have the power to give preference to unionists if it thinks it right to do so. I am still of that opinion, with one modification to which I shall presently refer. provide that the Court should not give preference to unionists, what then? were doing wrong. -it is open to question-but , at present, T case in which there should be preference to am speaking as to the merits of the case. ence in the Bill to preference to unionists, industry, but in addition to that they have procould the Court give preference? confer jurisdiction on the Court; but it is another thing to assume that we have legisno doubt they will largely avail themselves in lative power in a matter which, under the Constitution, should be left to the Court. jurisdiction cannot we limit it? condition that the jurisdiction shall be exercisable in a certain way. We could not call upon the High Court to give a decision just as we desired; and the Arbitration Court should be as supreme in industrial matters as the High Court is in its"" own jurisdiction. The constitutional power stands quite apart from the question of what power should be given to the Arbitration tribunal. I quite agree that the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration should have power to accord preference to unionists if it thinks proper. create a power greater than Parliament, but we cannot limit tliat power? exercise only the powers it has under the Constitution, namely, to make laws for conciliation and for arbitration. We cannot, under the guise of that power, act as if we possessed full jurisdiction to deal with every industrial question, and I have already said that, even if we did possess the power, we ought not to constitute ourselves judges in our own cause. Preference to unionists is essentially an economic tical atmosphere, and that end can judicial tribunal. As to what power should be given to the Court, I have always contended that it should have a discretion as to preference. Let us look at some of the decisions and see how a Court has acted. In the case of the Bakers Operatives' Association of New South Wales, reported in volume vii. of 28th April, 1908, we find the Deputy President of the Court in New South Wales giving his opinion on an application for preference to unionists, as follows:I do not think that there is any necessity to say anything further about the matter, except as regards the preference to unionists, and as to that, I should like to say this is eminently a unionists. It appears that, so far as skilled operatives are concerned, not only does the union practically and substantially represent the vided a registry as a means of keeping up at a moment's notice the supply of skilled labour, which the employers have very largely availed themselves of in the past, and of which I have the future.

This is clearly laid down to unionists. exists the Court endorses it. fact is that the unions are in such a strong position that they are helping the employers by providing a register, and are showing themselves to be a working social force, but it is left to the Court to decide the question of preference. unions are so strong that they can practically command preference .without the Court? member desires to legislate so that unions which are weak and useless shall all have preference. Is it not better to leave such a matter to the Judge to deal with according to the circumstances? unions give up the power to strike, 'they should have some concession. may get this preference. And that is not the only concession the unions get. The honourable member forgets that they have a concession in an award which can be given in their favour on the whole subject matter in dispute. order to get members, but because they believe there is a social wrong to be remedied by the Court. The question of preference is really an incidental one, though it must have the effect of strengthening the unions or they would not be so eager for it. But why should we pass a law saying that in all cases, justly or unjustly, preference shall be given simply because, in certain cases, preference is desirable. of the sort. Again, we find that in several cases, in the exercise of the judicial discretion, preference has been refused^ I could quote a case decided in New South Wales in 1905, where preference was refused, tlie union constituting but a minority in the trade. The conditions are laid down very well in the case recorded in Reeves' State Experiments in Australia, page 112, vol. IT. He is here quoting from New Zealand, to show the way the discretion is exercisedWhere it cannot be shown that the existence and aims of a union are a help to other workmen in 'its trade, as well as to its own members, and particularly where union men are but a fraction of those working in the trade, they are not by Mr Justice Edwards in the Christchurch Engineers Case in 1898. These were the words of the JudgeThe claim of the union to a preference,' in my opinion, necessarily fails when it is ascertained that the union is not really representative of the greater number of the workmen employed in the trade, and the claims of the union have not resulted in any practical benefit to the bulk of the workmen: These are matters that can eminently be left to judicial determination, because, in a case like that, after the unions had made their application, and the circumstances were such as the Judge indicated, who will argue that there should be absolute preference to unionists all over Australia? I admit that there are cases in which it should be granted, but there are equally cases in which it should be refused. It is wrong for us. to take away that judicial determination from the proper tribunal, and establish it by a legislative act. I have shown that in the case quoted, the Judge pointed out that there were facts of such a nature that the discretion ought not to be exercised in favour of the applicants for preference. That was not decided by a politician or a pubUnions do not fight in lic man, but by a judicial officer, accustomed to weigh evidence and to look at matters from the stand-point of equity and good conscience, in a Court guided solely by these principles. In the tribunals in both New Zealand and New South Wales the Judges have the discretion. cial tribunal? Wages Boards. is laying so much emphasis on the fitness of the judicial mind to settle these things. Mi. GROOM -Perhaps the honourable member disapproves of Wages Boards, and prefers a judicial 'tribunal. If he does, surely he will allow that tribunal to exercise its judgment, and not substitute the judgment of political partisans. I have now taken the three points-first , the constitutional power; second, that, even if we have the power, this Parliament is not, by reason of its bias, the proper tribunal to exercise it ; and, third, that such Acts have worked satisfactorily, the Judges have shown a wise discretion, and cases have been decided in which preference has been granted and refused.

253,Mr Fenton,"The honourable member has been justified. whether it is right to make preference compulsory as a legislative act, I differ from the honourable member tor Darling. I believe in every power and right being given to men to organize and form unions. Undoubtedly through organization, fighting for their rights, and making sacrifices, great good has been done in the inatter of social justice by tlie unions. But it must be remembered that there are persons outside the unions. It may be right or wrong for those individuals not to join a union, but should we take upon ourselves to dictate to them that they shall join, and threaten that if they do not join they will be excluded from certain benefits ? It is all very well to-day to say, "" They can get jobs of other descriptions,"" but we must consider times of distress when thousands of workmen are thrown out of employment. that in all cases and under all conditions only one class of persons shall have preference in employment, and that they shall be the members of unions? I am not condemning unionism, or saying anything against it, but, in these modern times, when we pose as Democrats, and claim liberty and freedom of action, and where it cannot be shown that that freedom has done any great social wrong, we ought, as far as we can, to leave men free. If we can so adjust our social arrangements as to enable unions to be freely formed to do the specific work which they are capable of doing usefully and beneficially for society, without at the same time political character. But under that section inflicting a wrong and arbitrarily putting compulsion on every individual, we ought to hesitate before we exercise that power of compulsion. The honourable member for Darling pointed this afternoon to the splendid way in which the unions are growing. He said that there had been an increase in membership of something like 15,000 during the last few years. This shows that under existing conditions, withput any statutory privilege or right, the unions are able to increase in power and numbers. But although there has been this voluntary increase in growth, and they are so wonderfully strong, they say, ""We are going to compel even the minority to come in."" It may be right that men should join unions; a man may be wise to join, and probably, if he knew the benefits of unionism he would, but that is not the point. The point is that it ought to be in. the exercise of his judgment, not yours, and Mr Groom. On the point as to his right, not yours, to join or refuse to join. plied to other things. People are made to pay their rates and taxes. on which the honourable member has been arguing to-day. I could go through the honourable member's arguments, but it would take up too much time. He put his case clearly. 1 will say this for the honourable member, that throughout his life he has been an.example of fighting for principle. He has always reasoned things out carefully, lucidly, and well, and, therefore, his arguments demand the attention of the House. His long experience in this House has led us to treat him with respect, and I hope we shall follow his praiseworthy example, and try to discuss the question in the light of pure reason and Are we to say justice. I have attempted to do so. Let me pass to another aspect which, so far, has not been discussed in this House in the debate on the question. Another section which is being repealed by this Bill is section 55. most impracticable section of the lot. dition that no organization should be granted any declaration of preference when and so long as its rules or other binding decisions permitted the application of its funds to political purposes, or required its members to do anything of a "" political purposes "" do not include those matters which are fairly and legitimately the object of a trade union organization, such as the preservation of life and limb, compensation for injuries or death, sanitation, sex and age of employees, hours and remuneration of labour, the protection of salaries and wages, and other conditions similarly affecting employment. jects are under the purview of the Commonwealth Parliament. the purview of State Parliaments, and a question of politics can be raised just as much in a State as in a Commonwealth Parliament. The High Court has also very properly held that a State organization is entitled to registration.

For my part, I have always taken the stand that if a trade union or organization wants to become political, it is a matter that concerns itself. I have never objected to their becoming political, but when they become not only an economic, but also a political organization, and approach a tribunal and ask for a preference, vvhich is an economic preference, to be given to them, and which has the effect of compelling men who may or may not agree with them politically to become members of their union and subscribe funds for political purposes to which they may object, the community is entitled to step in and say, "" That is not fair."" men who differ from them politically. the honourable"" member sees no difference between the political views of members on this side of the House and his own. site are not wage-earners, or workers for a "" cocky "" farmer. poses-onl y some. down that everything that it is really within the scope of the unions' rights to fight for in the relations of employer and employed, or in the conditions under which the employ^ carries on his calling, should not be included in any sense in the category of ""political purposes."" tial to the union that it may accomplish the purpose for which it exists the union should be left free to fight for. orable member's view, they could not fight for a Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

But it becomes anothermatter when the unions go into questions which are not within their legitimate scope. When we were discussing the question last time, I moved the amendment, which was supported by the Government of the day, and it was carried in this House against the views of the then Opposition. could in die circumstances. opposite now consider that they are entitled to alter their opinion, I do not blame them, but that does not alter the question as to Â« what is right and fair for the community as a whole.

I am afraid .1 have been led by interjections to say more than I intended, but we are deciding a very important question, and our general desire throughout should be to do what is right and fair for all parties in Australia. With industrial peace there will be progress, security will be given for the investment of capital, and the opening up of our enorEverything essenmous resources will follow. With industrial peace, and with a tribunal to lay down its decisions fairly and equitably, there is no reason why every individual in Australia should not be able to reach that standard of life that we all desire him to enjoy. If we continue the Act as framed at present, and allow the States to come in to deal with purely local matters, as they do, there is no reason why we should not see Australia prosper by leaps and bounds, with its industries progressing, good feeling growing up between employer and employed, and a condition of life prevailing in this continent worthy of the Commonwealth to which we belong. have listened with interest to the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Darling Downs, and must congratulate him upon his fair and reasonable, view of the legal aspects of the Bill.

275,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [2.45],"Iof the Bill; secondly, we have the question of the desirableness of bringing under its provisions industries that have hitherto been excluded from legislation of this kind; and, thirdly, we have what, judging by the arguments advanced, is the most important of all, the question of preference to unionists. As to the first point, those who have studied the Conciliation and Arbitration Act must admit that there are grave difficulties associated with it. A proposal to amend its machinery provisions ought to be above party politics, because it is as much in the interests of the employers as of the employees that we should have perfect machinery that will work cheaply and , easily, and so give greater satisfaction to all concerned. I have had some experience of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court in connection with the boot trade case. For over twelve months those concerned in the industry have been knocking at the door of the Federal Court. They have given evidence in each of the State capitals, and have incurred an expenditure of thousands of pounds, yet today no finality has been reached so far as the making of an award is concerned. There are so many pitfalls in the Act that no sooner is one point settled than the learned Justice says that there are otlier points that must be argued and determined. After endeavouring in vain to obtain a settlement under the Act the employers in the boot trade in Victoria have decided to meet their employees in conference, believing that in that way alone can a satisfactory settlement be arrived at. proceeding. able member to recollect that thousands of pounds Avere expended before that position Avas reached. The employees retained the ablest counsel to advocate their cause, but one phase of the question having been settled, the President of the Court had to refer other matters to the High Court, ""and consequently finality has not yet been reached. The position is regrettable from the point of A'iew of the employers, whose time and money haA'e been Avasted, as well as from the view point of the employees, and I think that all parties should combine to try to make the laAv clearer and more explicit. The President of the Court, Mr South Wales, and had the Court made an Justice Higgins, has asked for some of these amendments. Some of them are really necessary in the interests of good government, and I think we can rely upon the laAvyers of the Opposition to aid the Government in framing a Bill that will be workable and acceptable to the people. I come IIOAV to the proposal to bring within the purvieAV of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court rural Avorkers. I cannot understand Avhy they should be excluded. They are Avage earners; their feelings are similar to those of other men; they work long liours for a small pittance, and they desire to improve tiieir condition. When Parliament sets up a machine to adjust industrial conditions, Avhy should they be excluded? I cannot see the justice of excluding them, and I belieA'e that the employers in rural industries are just as anxious as their employees that justice shall be done. I well recollect an application mad.e by dairy employees under the old Arbitration Act of NeAv South Wales for an aAvard relating to their industry. Man after man Avent into the box, stated that he rose at 3 a.m. or at 3.30 a.m. and, after partaking of light refreshments, proreeded to milk his cows. He then harnessed up his horse, delivered his milk, and on returning at 9 a.m. had breakfast. He then had to wash his cart, feed his horse, cut chaff and start milking once more. . The evidence that these men Avorked continuously from early morn till late at night was uncontradicted. It struck me as peculiar that the men Avere not even cross-examined. Mi. FULLER I suppose"" they Avere metropolitan dairymen ? Heydon saying, one day, Avhen he left the Bench, while the inquiry was proceeding, common-sense "" This is a case in Avhich %ve should be able to assist a body of unfortunate men."" But Avhen the employers entered the box, what Avas the position ? They said, ' It ! is true that our men Avork long hours and receive from 15s. to 22s. 6d. per Aveek; but Ave are in the same position. We have to work long hours and cannot avoid doing so "" After the Court had inquired into the Avhole industry it found that it could not make an award that would be just to both parties. The reason was that in the country districts, from which Sydney's milk supply Avas drawn, there Avas no organization in the industry. Dairymen in country districts were not included in the schedule to the old Arbitration Act of NeAv aAvard applying only to city dairies, Avith the object of raising wages and reducing the hours of employment, it would have put the industry almost out of existence.",41,Commonwealth Conciliation

But tliey, and their employees, are practically slaves, because of the unfair competition of country dairymen. If we had in operation a law comprehensive enough to regulate the business in both the city and country districts, it would work to the advantage of all parties. The honourable member for Illawarra said that it would be better for the people if city dairies were wiped out of existence. I had the honour of acting as Chairman of an anti-sweating committee appointed by the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, before which evidence was given showing that if sweating is carried on anywhere it is in the dairying district which the honourable member represents.

A country in which wages are low and the hours of labour long never makes any progress; countries in which the highest rates of wages are paid, and the shortest hours of labour prevail, rule the commercial world. It is no advantage to a country that its people should be working long hours for small wages. Under this Bill it is proposed to place rural workers on the footing occupied by men in otlier industries, and I have heard no reason why that should not be done. These men have the franchise; they have reasoning powers, and the right to vote, and they demand better conditions of labour. They ask that they shall be treated as other workers are.

Unionists having contributed towards the cost of having an industrial dispute dealt with by the Court, having employed the best legal talent to plead their cause, and having in that way achieved something, not only for themselves, but for every man in the industry, ask for a preference, not for their own advantage, but to prevent an employer from giving a preference to the non-unionists.

The strong industrial unions already enjoy a preference. The coal lumpers, the trolley and draymen, and the miners have it. In the Cobar district in New South Wales unionists have been granted a preference, and it has not worked to the injury of that district in any way. On the other hand it has tended towards industrial peace. I believe that this Bill when it becomes law, will provide a greater guarantee of the maintenance of industrial peace in the future."" the outset honourable members upon both sides of the House may reasonably assume that they occupy common ground in that if we could frame a legislative enactment which would render it impossible for a strike to take place, every honourable member would be only too proud to assist in placing it upon our statute-book. dealing with this Bill we have to recollect that it contemplates a number of enlargements of the principal Act-enlargement s of far-reaching consequence. I listened with very great attention to the Attorney General whilst he was expounding its various provisions, and I must confess that I [32] was considerably disappointed at the small modicum of real information which he gave to us, and I was still more deeply dissatisfied because of the element of uncertainty which evidently exists in his mind as to its real intent. His speech fairly bristled with such statements as, "" I do not know,"" and "" l a m not at all certain."" These phrases, which occurred again and again, evidenced that he is not at all sure what will be the effect of the Bill. For that reason I think we have reason to congratulate ourselves upon having been favoured with exceedingly able speeches by the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Darling Downs, in regard to the legal aspect of this matter. I have been associated with Mr The honourable member for Darling Downs raised a most important point when he urged that it would be unconstitutional for this Parliament to make it mandatory upon I believe that he the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to discriminate as between two classes of workers. It would be well for the Attorney-General to take that point into very serious consideration. It appears to me that under sub-paragraph b of clause 2 a very grave situation is created. That provision reads"" Industrial dispute "" means an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State, and includesb. any dispute in relation to employment in an industry carried on by or under the control of the Commonwealth or a State, or any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State. I take it that the State Parliaments are, within the limits of their own Constitutions, supreme. But this Bill proposes to take from those Parliaments the exercise of a power which properly attaches to them under their Constitutions. Those Constitutions enable them to appoint certain individuals to positions and offices of trust, but this Bill seeks to bring those persons within its scope, thus taking away from them a power which is theirs by constitutional right. What the Government propose to take from the States they also propose to relinquish In on behalf of the Commonwealth. I ii other words, under this Bill the Commonwealth Parliament will cease to be its own arbitrator, so far as its own employees are concerned. These proposals, if adopted, will have far-reaching consequences. They may lead to grave legal complications, and involve the Commonwealth in considerable",44,Commonwealth Conciliation

Then paragraph d of clause 2 contemplates an enlargement of the scope of the principal Act by bringing various industries within its scope. is It was urged by the honourable member for Darling that we should bring these rural industries under the operation of the law. I give the honourable member credit for a great deal of knowledge regarding the shearing industry; but I do not think that anyone versed in the conditions of farm life, viticulture, horticulture, and dairying, than benefit them, because it will create would urge that persons engaged in those occupations should be brought under this law. In my opinion, the law might well be allowed to stand as it is until it has more fully proved its worth as applied to the better organized industries. When it has proved successful in its present scope, it may be wise to enlarge its operations. In the meantime, it is to court failure to apply it to the rural industries. It must be' remembered that employment in these industries is largely irregular. In times of harvest, sowing, fruit gathering, and the like, large numbers of casual labourers are employed. There is never a surplus of casual labourers; indeed, there are not enough of them for the effective performance of the work to be done. The production of Australia would be materially increased were more labour available for work of this kind. A natural result of this state of things is that the employee's have nothing to complain of. I am averse to unnecessary legislation. I am acquainted with a great many persons who are employers, and with many others who are employed in rural industries, and know that good feeling exists between the two classes. I have not had it brought under my notice that the conditions of rural employment are unduly hard. It is true that men employed in milking cows commence very early in the morning and resume work again in the afternoon; but, generally speaking, they are much at leisure in the middle part of the day. when they are not milking. Ploughing is done in the winter months, sorry to say that, doubtless without inwhen the days are short, and those who tent are engaged in milking would not have time to do the necessary ploughing even if tent. they were disposed to undertake the work. I am glad that the conditions of labour out intent-m y honourable friends opposite are improving. Nowadays a ploughman, are developing into coercionists of the very instead of having to walk for miles following his plough, sits on it and drives. It is right to take into consideration, not only the hours of labour, but the condiThis point tions under which labour is performed; one of paramount importance. and the fact cannot be ignored that on our farms, as well as in our factories, conditions are improving, and the amount of manual labour that has to be done is decreasing. I am pleased that this is so, and that the improvement will continue. But an effort to force the pace unnaturally will injure the employees rather conditions making it impossible to employ labour profitably. Of course, it is doubtful that the clause if passed will be operative; if it is operative it will, in my opinion, work only for evil. By the section which it is proposed by clause 8 to substitute for section 40 of the principal Act, it is provided that the Court may make provision for fixing a lower rate in the case of employees who are unable to earn the prescribed minimum wage. The honourable member for Darling urged that preference should be given to. unionists because the best men in every industry are unionists.. It is true that when a man joins a union he is generally, in his prime. But there comes a time in the life of every man when he is. not as good as he has been. When those who are now unionists have passed their best days, are they still to be preferred to others who are in their prime, though not unionists? not to old men, but to unionists. are to-day regretting the passing of legislation of this kind, because employers, being forced to pay certain rates of wages, and to work their men for prescribed hours, have been compelled, in their own interests, in order to make their businesses profitable, to dispense with all but the highest type of labour. That condition drives everybody but the very best workmen out of the market. When we come to subclause b of clause 8, we must ask ourselves ciliation and arbitration at all.

The Attorney General was most explicit that the persons who were to decide as to the "" things being equal,"" were the employers, but it has been made manifest from the speeches of legal gentlemen on this side of the Chamber, that it is not so. In reality the individual who will determine is the Judge of the Arbitration Court. The all important fact in connection with this provision appears to me to be that if this Bill becomes law, and if it is upheld by the High Court, the right to work for a living will depend on whether a man is willing to be coerced into becoming a member of a union. ticket; that is the part that is important. measure is being promoted for political purposes a still more disagreeable odour is given to it. The honourable member for Darling argued that there was no such thing as coercion in the Bill, and he was good enough to cite a case. He said that the shearers agreed to work with non-unionists. agreed to work with non-unionists, because they were not sure of their ground. If , however, we amend the law so as to make them sure of their ground, there is nothing more certain than that they will stand upon their rights and insist upon being paid to the utmost, and on being given all the preference that the law allows. hope that the Attorney-General will benefit materially from the legal opinions that have been advanced by my honourable friends on this side of the Chamber. That we are creating difficulties of a legal nature appears to me beyond question. We are also creating difficulties affecting the rural General upon the brevity and crispness industries, which will decrease the sum total of production, decrease the sum total of work to be given to labourers,, and decrease the sum total of our exports. These facts cannot be gainsaid, and the result will justify everything that has been said from this side of the House. think we shall all agree that no one outside a lunatic asylum would deny that the principles underlying conciliation and arbitration are just, right, and such as become civilized communities. It will further be admitted that what we all desire in Australia is to see our people living under conditions such as we believe they should en[3 ]2 2 The Bill provides that prejoy, and that in every industry throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, there should be such rates of payment and such conditions of labour as will enable workmen to live in accordance with these economic principles which are accepted as right and just. ""With the general policy of this measure, therefore, I do not disagree. I have always contended that, where it is possible for men to concentrate in such a way as to insure that industries shall be conducted on lines enabling them to live comfortably and at the same time insuring industrial peace, that should be done. But there are within the scope of this measure two proposals which go. beyond that requirement. In the first place I do not think that they are just, and in the second place, I do not believe them to be practicable. I should like first of all to deal with the subject of preference to unionists. I use that term because it is one which we all understand, though, as the honourable member for Flinders rightly pointed out, there is strictly speaking no such thing as preference to unionists. The point that he raised, in a perfectly convincing manner, was that a man might be a unionist and That is true. But they only still might not be a member of an association coming within the scope of this Bill; and that preference can only be given to those who are within its scope. As a consequence, it is not really a question of preference to unionists, but onLy of preference to those associations which are registered under this meaI sure, and in regard to which certain awards have been made. I emphatically believe that the principle underlying the granting of preference to unionists is fundamentally wrong, and for that reason I shall oppose the provision. I should like to congratulate, the Attorneyof the clause in which this principle is embodied. But I notice that he has introduced at the end of the clause a particularly short and crisp phrase which, to my mind, is the very acme of ambiguity. It might be possible to find a shorter phrase than "" other things being equal,"" but it would be very difficult to discover a more ambiguous one or one which might be morevariously interpreted. I admit that the Attorney-General has merely adopted thephrase from the Act which he is seeking to amend, but inasmuch as he has told us that it is the employer who is to be the judge as to whether other things are equal",46,Commonwealth Conciliation

I have every sympathy with the unionist who gives his money freely from day to day in order to forward his own particular views, but it is wrong, unjust, and iniquitous to force other men into the unions and compel thjera to contribute funds to further purposes which they do not hold to be right or just. I shall be very much surprised if honourable members opposite can point' me to any other piece of legislation of a like character throughout the length and breadth of the Empire. I am sure that no other piece of legislation can be found throughout the Empire which gives the same power of preference to unionists. Let me turn from that to the practical side of this great question. This Bill goes further than the party opposite have ever attempted to go before, by bringing within its scope a number of people who have never previously been brought within it. The definition of "" industry "" is to be amended by omitting all the words :excepting only persons engaged in domestic service, and persons engaged in agricultural, viticultural, horticultural, or dairying pursuits, and inserting in their stead the wordsAnd includes a branch of an industry and a group of industries. As one who has been for a long time engaged in these particular classes of industry, and who knows their technical details, I desire to place fully before the House their nature and peculiarities, and to give reasons why it will be almost impossible to bring them under the scope of I do this legislation without doing a serious injustice to a great many people engaged in them. mav have leave to continue his remarks. tinue my remarks on Tuesday next.
