35,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"would not be considered a small onewould, as I say, cause delay. If , however, any unfair advantage has, inadvertently, of course, been gained, the matter could be submitted to the State Parliaments, and then we should know exactly where we stand. I admit that, up to the present, the Western Australian Government have recognised that certain concessions are necessary, seeing that they have agreed to alter the gauge of their railway from Perth to Kalgoorlie at their own expense; and I see no reason why they should object to the Commonwealth endeavouring to, in. some way, reimburse itself for the loss which, in my opinion, must result from this railway for twenty years to come. The Western Australian Government, I have no doubt, would agree to the concession asked for by the honourable member for Riverina. Australian Government may not regard this as affecting them so much as did the negotiations over the Northern Territory; but, at the same time, I should say that as, in common with the other States, South Australia is nationalist in feeling morally bound because cf the agreement. cannot see what objection either Western Australia or South Australia can have to the Commonwealth making sure of this project being a payable one. There is no doubt that the Governments of the various States have adopted a policy of centralization; and the power of the majorities in the thickly-settled districts has predominated in deciding expenditure in the more sparsely-populated parts. beneficial to the more densely-populated centres, but it is clearly detrimental to the rest of a State and to the CommonweaUh as a whole. The construction of this railway will give South Australia a new province.' We have heard it said that Broken Hill made Port Pirie; and there is no doubt that the development of the interior is entirely favorable to coastal interests. I am assured that Port Augusta can be made a splendid harbour at an ordinary expenditure; and, as this is really the water terminus of the overland railway, it will tend to become a larger and more important place. The railway will also open up certain mining districts, and make them payable, whereas hitherto these have been worked under the greatest possible disadvantages; and similar results will follow in Western Australia. Unless the country is developed throughout the length of the line the project can never be a payable one; and no State not pecuniarily affected will be much concerned in seeing that it is made payable. Not only this Commonwealth Government, but every preceding Government, have had to fight the Premiers, no matter the party to which those Premiers belonged ; and that state of things will continue. We are told that there are Labour Governments in power here and there; but no matter what the brand of politics, if a State Premier be scratched we find the State rights feeling; and I suppose this is only natural. We, as the Commonwealth Parliament, ought to insure to the people of Australia some fair dealing. I do not desire this concession in order that the land reserved shall be under the control of the Commonwealth Parliament for all time, but only for so long as The South there is a loss on the railway. My idea is not to have a State within a State; and there is no doubt that if this land were taken over for ever there would have to be a governing body. My idea is that, if the loss extends over ten years, and then gradually begins to disappear, some form of trust ought to be created by whom the lands could be handed back to the States -pro rata. ment of the honourable member for Parramatta. not accept the amendment of the honourable member for Riverina?

I came into this House as a believer in the federalizing of the railways, but I have changed my mind considerably, not because I feel that such-a step is less desirable, but because I recognise the fact that the assertion of State claims here makes it undesirable for them to come into a union of that character. the railways as well as we do the Post Office? willing to federalize the railways, for the Post Office is a million times better managed now than it was under the States.

The Commonwealth Treasury alone can suffer j and South Australia and Western Australia ought to be prepared to do justice to the other States, which are ready to assist them to develop their country in this way, by entering into such an undertaking as will insure at least that there will be no loss to the Commonwealth on the working of the line. To those who fear that the making of such a condition as this would retard the building of the railway, I would point out that it is far better that we should the line by the Commonwealth would be impose some such stipulation than that we should have trouble later on with the States -concerned. We all recognise the necessity for this railway. only for defence, but for commercial purposes ; and I believe that it will ultimately prove to be of material assistance to our commerce. The enormous sum which we are at present paying in respect of the oversea mail subsidy would in itself be sufficient to pay interest on the cost of this line, I admit that the representatives of .South Australia and Western Australia are peculiarly situated. I assure them that there is no desire on our part to block the -construction of the railway, and I appeal to them to recognise that, in fairness to the rest of Australia, an arrangement should be entered into whereby the line will be made payable as soon as possible to the 'Commonwealth. Having regard to what is the evident feeling of the Committee, I 'hope that the Government will endeavour to make some such arrangement as is covered by the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Riverina, and that -outlined by the honourable member for Parramatta. Those honourable members ought to confer, with a view of embodying their two proposals in the one amendment. -confusion and uncertainty in the minds cf those who are opposing this measure are well exemplified in the speech to which we have just listened. member for Melbourne Ports rose to support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Riverina, but before he had proceeded far he showed that, in 'his opinion, it was radically defective, and member does not object to those States conhe concluded by commending a wholly diffiscating _£6,ooo,ooo of Commonwealth ferent proposal. If those who are bringing money. forward these amendments were animated solely by a desire to facilitate the construction of {He railway upon an equitable basis, many of the proposals outlined by them The two States concerned have everywould not have been made. They require but little consideration to show that they are impracticable. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports expressed surprise that the Government had refused to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member foi Riverina. They have a good and sufficient reason For the stand they have taken. If they accepted the amendment, they would al once convict themselves of hypocrisy and insincerity with regard to the construction of this railway, since its adoption would ruoan that the building of quite out of the question. The amendment is designed to secure, not only from Western Australia, but from South Australia, It must be built, not a large area of territory. The honourable member for Riverina having been in this House since the inception of Federation, and having taken a keen interest in this question, must know that the great obstacle to the construction of the railway has, from the first, been the attitude of South Australia. The concession to construct this line through its territory was only squeezed out of South Australia in connection with the agreement for taking over the Northern Territory. But for South Australia's difficulty in that regard, and the fact that we were in a position, to a certain extent, to impose terms, we should not have gained from her the concession that this line should be constructed through that State. the same people? but the fact remains that South Australia does not want this railway. with the reasons, but I know that they are of an entirely provincial and parochial character. The great bulk of the people of South Australia do not want this railway, and will be only too glad of. any excuse by which the proposal may be set aside. If we impose this condition, providing as The honourable it does for the confiscation of portion of the territory of South Australia in common with that of Western Australia, then we may say at once, "" Good-bye to the line.""",16,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill

If we begin administering land in this way in alternate blocks with the State Governments, a whole group of very serious troubles is likely to arise.

That we are entitled to be considered in this business arrangement is beyond all cavil or question, and I shall wait with some surprise and concern to see this Government turn down any proposal for recouping any loss on this railway out of the fund which the railway will create. The honourable member for Perth said a little too much for himself and his position. He told us frankly that we were going to make a present of 5s. per acre in respect of all this land to the two States concerned. If the land concerned in the amendment will increase in I cannot bring value to the extent of 5s. per acre, it is fair to assume that that increment will apply over a much wider area. ' There are 123,000,000 acres in the whole length of line 100 miles wide, and, applying the 5s. calculation, it means that we are presenting those two States with £30,000,000 sterling. I arrive at that result on the basis of the honourable member for Perth's own figures, and they bear out the figures presented by good judges of country, who have had a life-long practical experience. Even halving the amount, if we are making a present of £15,000,000to those two States, are we justified in incurring the further loss involved in carrying the line through their territory? There is no answer to that position. It is the fairest thing possible to ask that a little of the fund which this line cerates shall be set against the loss incurred in running the railway. rangement. _ Why not therefore incorporateMoreover, these blocks tween the Commonwealth and the States?",18,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill

I object on principle to any suggestion that the Commonwealth should take sovereign rights over or control of lands of the railway. of a State within the State and independent of the State authority. If the principle is wrong with regard to a stretch of 25 miles on eitlier side of the line it is no less wrong in regard to alternate sections. Indeed the difficulty seems to be aggravated by the proposal to have a sort of interrupted authority at every 10 miles. There is much more in the contention of the honourable member for Perth than he himself submitted, and perhaps than the Committee are inclined to accept. If we stipulate as a condition for the building of the line that we must have control over certain land within the two States concerned, we must accept responsibility for the development of that land, the control of the population, the education of the children, the policing of the district, and all the other work necessary.. that in the Federal Capital territory? though we are not doing it completely yet owing to a wise temporary arrangement with the New South Wales Government. We have made certain laws of the State of New South Wales apply to the Federal Territory, ancl stipulated that certain others arrangement for; the Commonwealth, and' shall not apply. That of itself shows that we accept the responsibility.

84,Mr Finlayson,"May I direct theo f the line in South Australia which runs through the sand hills, I recommend for consideration that a width of, say, ro miles, be acquired and reserved from occupation. .Apparently what will be needed will be a strip of varying width, and where the country is covered with loose sand the reservation must' be wider than at other places, in order to protect the line from the encroachment of the sand. that we should ask the States through whose territory the line will go to pay for its construction, because the line is being made, not for developmental purposes, but for defence and in furtherance of Federal iinterests generally. the Commonwealth should acquire the lands -of the States, the question should not be approached in a pettifogging, trivial spirit. Weshould say straight out that we want these lands, because we desire to run rail-ways through the States. The proposition now before the Committee is a nibbling and paltry one. I expect the amendment to be defeated, but 1 hope that the Government will accept another amendment providing that before the construction of the line is tDegun guarantees will be obtained from Western Australia and South Australia for the conversion of the existing. lines from Kalgoorlie to Perth ancl Port Augusta to Adelaide to whatever gauge may be adopted -for the Commonwealth line. If the Conmonwealth line had a gauge differing from those of the present State lines, there would ""be breaks at Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, and the difficulties now arising from breaks -of gauge would be increased, and the efficiency of the line for defence purposes -greatly diminished. The right honourable member for Swan interjected the other evening that the Western Australian Government -would make the gauge of its railway uniform with that of the Commonwealth railway, but I want to see that provided for in the Bill. to make any changes in gauge that may be necessary, it may be advisable to delay the further construction of the Commonwealth line. make the gauge of her railway uniform with that of the Commonwealth line. The honourable member's proposal is perfectly fair. prepared to do what I suggest, I shall oppose the amendment providing for the transfer to the Commonwealth of a strip of territory on each side of the proposed line. that line soon. am surprised at the intemperate speech of the honourable member for Brisbane. When his orgy of words had exhausted itself, he made a proposal which, I think, is hardly fair to the States concerned, namely, that they should foot the bill for altering the gauges of their railways to that chosen I do not think for the Commonwealth line. It must be remembered that the railway whose construction is in contemplation is not a developmental line, though possibly it may lead to some development. It is being constructed primarily for defence, and to proI f it is desired that vide quicker means ot transit between the States than sea-carriage provides. It would be very unfair to saddle any of the States with the cost of what is Commonwealth work, namely, the unification of the railway gauges on main lines. As for the suggestion that Western Australia and South Australia should contribute out of the unearned increment created in their territories by the construction of the proposed Commonwealth line towards the reduction of its cost, I hope that honourable members will agree that it is a fair one. I do not bind myself to support any particular proposal in that direction, because anything we may enact in this Bill may be used by South Australia as an excuse for postponing the construction of the line for a year or two. My view is that the Government should give an undertaking to endeavour to arrange with the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia -for the concession which we desire. Our difficulty lies with South Australia, which is mainly run for Adelaide, and Adelaide is very frightened that it may lose the advantage, microscopic as perhaps it is, of being the port at which the mails are landed. If we inserted in the Bill a provision declaring that, willy-nilly, the StatesI f the States are not prepared concerned must clo this or that, the South Australian Parliament might get its back up, and refuse point blank to let anything be done. Under the Northern Territory agreement, we have accepted certain responsibilities, and South Australia might reasonably say to us, "" Until you carry out your bargain in respect to the Northerr Territory we shall refuse to let you make the line from Port Augusta to the Western Australian border.""

131,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [11.54],"I proopposing the amendment, is prepared to impose the exceedingly onerous and unfair condition that the Western Australian Government shall convert their gauge from 3 f t . 6 in. to 4 f t . 8J in. or 5 f t . 3 in. at their own expense. That is a condition we do not propose to impose on any other State; and I am not prepared to support it. It is all very well to say that this railway is necessary fo*r defence; we know that it is so. It would be a great burden on the two States to ask them to find money for the construction at the present time; and we are prepared to undertake the responsibility. At the same time, it is only fair that we should ask the States to give us something that will enable us to recoup the Commonwealth for the expenditure incurred. I was very glad to hear the honourable member for Flinders interject, when the honourable member for Perth was speaking, that the handing over of this land does not necessarily mean our taking control and governing it in the same way as we should any other territory belonging to us. I , myself, could not see that such a result was necessary; and, as I say, I was glad to hear the interjection. I object also to the remark of the honourable member for Perth that, if it has taken Western Australia ten years to get this Parliament to carry out the agreement which was made at .the time of Federation, how long would it.be before the Commonwealth would be prepared to build this railway with some of the conditions inserted? should have to wait until the Commonwealth handed back the lands again. certainly no agreement, so far as the people of the eastern States were concerned. We recognise the desirability and necessity of this line, and I support it, not because of any agreement, but because it ought to be constructed in order to link up east and west. I am not prepared to support the honourable member for Wentworth when he says he would be satisfied with a Ministerial guarantee lo do their best to get as much land as possible. I do not care what Minister gives a guarantee to that effect; it practically means very little. forgets that I said that if we could not get some such guarantee, the Government should pledge themselves to introduce a Bill for the alteration of the Constitution. better, as I have said on another matter, to have in black and white what honourable members desire, instead of leaving it to the Minister of the day to understand what is wanted, and do his best to get it. I do not anticipate that the two States concerned will not do what is right. In any case, I do not see that in giving the Statesan opportunity to comply with the conditions we shall materially delay the construction of the railway. We could, I imagine, get their answer early next year,, or it might be this year. In the meantime,, the work in connection with plans and specifications, and so forth, could be proceeded' with, and it is improbable that we shall' be prepared to let any contract or start: building until fairly well on in next year. an answer from the States a fortnight after the Bill is passed. get an answer very soon. As for WesternAustralia, I anticipate no difficulty, because that State has already offered to construct the railway up to the border; and' the Commonwealth has acted so generously and fairly in taking over the great burdenof the Northern Territory, that, until theevent happens, I cannot believe that South. Australia would refuse to comply with theproposed condition. honourable member for Brisbane is indignant at the proposal that we should ask WesternAustralia and South Australia to transferto the Commonwealth certain lands alongthe line of railway in order to recoup usthe cost of construction. It has always been difficult for me to understand why, in the years gone by, the two States concerned did not undertake this work for themselves, seeing that the Eastern States-have spent millions in building their owntrunk lines. The construction of this railway will enhance the value of land in theimmediate vicinity, and must lead to a largely increased population in the twoStates. By way of emphasizing the latterpoint I would remind the Committee that in 1854, when the railway mileage of* America was only 16,756, that country had a population of 26.000,000. whereas to-day it has a railway mileage of "" 2 38 -3."">6 miles and a population of over91,000,000.

We have been told that Western Australia was promised that if she came into the Federation this railway would be built for her, while New South Wales was promised the Federal Capital. But even if those bribes were held but to induce the people of New South Wales and Western Australia to enter the union, would that fact justify us in asking the Eastern States, with their population of 3,500,000, to contribute most of the cost of building this railway for the other States, whose population amounts to little more than 600,000. We ought to recoup ourselves by controlling a certain area of land along the route. This is by no means a new proposal. The principle has been tried in Canada and has proved very successful. The honourable member for Parramatta declared that he could not agree with the proposition to ask for the transfer of land to the Conunonwealth since he believed that the taking over of the territory would give rise to a good deal of trouble. But in this matter he is in the same position as the honourable member for Brisbane, since he also voted for taking over a large area for the purposes of the Federal Capital. that in the case of the Federal Capital we ceeds from the said lands vested in the were under a constitutional obligation. between the two positions, but the fact remains that the honourable member voted for the taking over of a very large area in said lands cover the loss on the line.""

But those who raise that contention forget that the Commonwealth was brought into existence to deal with questions that were considered national and not parochial, and the right attitude to take in regard to a proposal like that under discussion is the national one. I do uot wish it to be thought that because we are opposing these amendments we do not desire to obtain a considerable area of land along the route of the proposed line. That is stated clearly and definitely in the Bill. Government to negotiate in regard to the But honourable members should look further. The construction of the line will, by increasing facilities for communication, tend to development and the increase of population, ancl as population increases the Commonwealth revenue grows, because twelvethirteenths of our income is from Customs and Excise duties. Moreover, the Commonwealth has equal power with the States in the taxation of land values. If the value of the land along the route is increased, the -Commonwealth can, if it thinks fit, raise -revenue by taxing it. We all hope that the -construction of the line will increase the value of the country through which it goes, -and add to the population and revenue of the Commonwealth. Following the construction of this line must come the unificalook at the clause, he will see that the tion of gauge of the trunk lines connecting the capitals of the States. I have promised that the Government will negotiate with the States on that subject. Would the honourable inember for Parramatta, and those supporting his amendment, demand that the States in whose territory gauges were 'altered at the expense of the Commonwealth should pay to us something by way of compensation; that our expenditure should be recouped from the increment of value created by it? will follow the unification of railway -gauges ? -go into that matter, but I could show clearly, and prove my contention by statistics, that no State would gain more from the unification of gauges than that in which this Parliament now sits. [12.44]I wish to meet the point taken by the ' honourable member for Hunter. frankly admit that there is a national as well as a local aspect in this matter, ancl agree with the Prime Minister that it is the business of this Parliament to deal with the questions coming before it from the national point of view. This, however, is one of those questions which is, at the same time, national ancl State. We are all partners in the concern, and cannot separate ourselves from it j there is no distinction and no dividing line, so far as the interests of the Commonwealth and the States are concerned. For that reason, I ask leave to modify my amendment by leaving out the words "" be necessary"" after the. word "" may,"" and inserting "" be agreed upon."" This will leave it to the sums. Amendment amended accordingly. -The Prime Minister drew attention to two points. One was that of the gauge, and it was a point which, I venture to say, has nothing to do with the question. When the right honourable gentleman found that he was leading himself into a sort of cul de sac, he abandoned it altogether; and, therefore, I shall leave it alone. The right honourable member then dealt with subclause 2, and, obviously without having studied it sufficiently, he attempted to satisfy the Committee that under, it all that was desired by honourable members would be done. Buti f the Prime Minister will whole of the power conferred is to deal with lands so far as they may be required for ""construction, maintenance, and working."" Does the Prime Minister contend for a moment that the Commonwealth will have the power to take lands and dispose of them in order to compensate us for any loss? According to the ""common or garden "" interpretation of words, there would not be the right to take a single acre, except so far as it was required for the ""construction, maintenance,"" in the practical sense, and the "" working "" of the railway; not one copper could be taken to compensate the Commonwealth for the loss, which might amount to £50,000 or £100,000 a year. There is a sort of political flatulency in some honourable members in regard to "" nationalism."" Of course, the question has a national aspect, since this has been recommended as a line for military purposes. For my own part, as a layman, I quite agree with the honourable member I fbr Echuca, who, last night, said that, in his opinion, the line was a weakness rather than a strength, from a national standpoint ; and laymen have a right to an opinion on what I may call the practical side of defence questions.

Lord Roberts has recommended, in the House of Lords, a system of defence of which the English people are taking no notice. able member is not going into the question of the defence of England. of analogy. Apart from the difference of opinion as to the'effect of this railway for defence purposes, it has a national aspect; but it also has incidentally an aspect which shows that it is going to give an enormous profit, in regard to which I accept half the estimate of the honourable member for Perth. As I say, this project has, incidentally, a local aspect, which shows that South Australia and Western Australia are to be given an increment of something like £15,000,000. If this line is going to involve the Commonwealth, in carrying out a national purpose, in a very heavy loss per annum, on what grounds of common honesty or morality can the two States refuse to compensate us for that loss, when it can be so easily recouped from the incidental benefits they derive from the national line? We need not be depressed on account of the people of England declining to accept the advice of Lord Roberts, for we have a distinct recollection that the people of Australia, on one or two occasions, have declined to accept the advice of the honourable member for Parkes. I suggest to the honourable member for Parramatta that the acceptance of the alteration in his amendment makes the amendment superfluous. It means that there shall be such money recouped as is agreed on; and for all practical purposes that idea is contained in maintenance. sub-clause 2. We have a Government in office which is likely to remain there a number of years, and which has indicated that it does not approve of the principle underlying the amendment, and has distinctly told us that it will attempt to secure such guarantees as are necessary under sub-clause 2. and construction of the line; and I wish to read the word ""maintenance"" in its largest possible sense. ""financial maintenance"" are used I shall be satisfied. men engaged cn the railway. gested is entirely permissive; it is simply a question of what may be agreed on in the future, and the Government in power have already indicated that they do not intend to accept it. Under the circumstances we should be merely inserting another sub-clause of a permissive character, with the underlying principle of which the Government have no sympathy. Is it likely that there can be any practical effect ? If not, why insert the amendment? not aware that the Government have no sympathy with the principle involved in the amendments proposed. I rather understood the objection to be that the amendments would prevent the railway being constructed, because South Australia would not consent. I can understand honourable members objecting because they do not agree with the amendments, for one reason or the other; but do not let any one run away with the idea that if he opposes them he will be able to obtain what is desired by reason of sub-clause 2. I do not think that the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Adelaide, or any other layman would be able to get a single lawyer in this Chamber, no matter on which side, who would be prepared to say that the words of the sub-clause are wide enough to embrace the land which is the object of the amendments. those lands can be taken which are necessary for construction, maintenance, and working. . at a l l ; and if these amendments are not carried we give up any claim to a contribution of the character desired.

Adelaide and Port Augusta into uniformity with that of the transcontinental line. A small section, .from Port Augusta to Terowie, covering a distance of about 100 miles, is built on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and 'it would pot cost much to extend that to the gauge adopted for the transcontinental line. ber aware that that line traverses a very circuitous route through the mountains, and that the work of extending the gauge would be very expensive? that the people of South Australia will gain so largely by the construction of this railway that it is not too much to ask them to bear the cost of bringing the line between Adelaide and Port Augusta into uniformity w i i i the transcontinental railway The section between Terowie and Adelaide, a distance of 150 miles, is on a 5-ft. 3-iri. gauge, and it would cost only a few thousand pounds to alter it. I am in favour of the Commonwealth bearing the burden of linking up all the capitals by ""means of a uniform gauge of railway. That is a national work, and should be undertaken by the National Parliament, but the people of the Commonwealth as a whole may fairly claim that in return for the construction of a railway that will cost something like £5,000,000 the two States concerned should agree to the proposal embodied in my amendment. The honourable member for Brisbane was careful to point out that he did not submit this amendment with the object of delaying the construction of the railway, but I think that it would have that effect, since it requires the two States directly concerned to agree to do certain things before the work is entered upon. We have it stated that Western Australia, in all probability, will bring its railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle into uniformity with the transcontinental line. We have no such assurance, however, in regard to the line between Adelaide and Port Augusta, and it is not likely that the people of South Australia will consent at the present time to such a proposition. The amendment has also an important bearing on the question of gauge. If it be carried it will be practically uselessto ask the States to meet the Commontion of gauge, for the reason that it will* have practically decided the question. New South Wales has already a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge, and by declaring that this line shalf not be constructed until the two States haveagreed to bring the gauge of certain linesinto uniformity with that of the transcontinental line, we shall liave practically settled the matter. In other words, there will be three States committed to a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, and Tasmania might see no objection to falling in with what had been determined so far as those three States wereconcerned. That being so, this amendment, if carried, would practically determine the question of the gauge to beadopted by all the States. I think that thisquestion should be an open one. I certainly hope that it will soon be settled, but we ought to be careful not to prejudicefuture action on the part of the States and the Commonwealth in regard to it. [2.'27) -Apart altogether from the fact that the honourable member for Brisbaneis seeking by a side-wind to determine, in the most unfair way, the uniform gauge for all Australia, his proposal is in itself unjust and the very essence of provincialism. Why should we require these two States to do anything which the others are not' compelled to do? Why should they be compelled to alter their gauges any more than the other three States are compelled to do?' If the honourable member is setting up the theory that the States to be traversed by any transcontinental line ought to be underan obligation to assimilate their gauges with that of the Commonwealth, and tolink up their own railway systems to it,, at their own cost, he is certainly taking on-a pretty big contract so far as Queensland""! itself is concerned. thing of the kind? member's proposal, as I understand it, is that this railway shall not be built until : these other lines are linked up with it.

Let the matter stand by itself and be considered on its merits. I decline to vote for a proposal which would require every State in the Union to do likewise. By accepting this amendment we should be committing ourselves to the assimilation of our individual State gauges to that of the railway now proposed to be laid down. That may or may not turn out to be the case. imagine that when the standard gauge is determined, it will be applied, in the first instance, as between the various capitals of Australia, and that there will be a gradual assimilation later on of the whole of the railway systems of the Commonwealth. That matter, however, does not arise at this stage. would be unfair to lay this impost on two of the States only, and leave the three large contributing States to this matter absolutely untouched.

My objection to the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes was that I did not believe in the Commonwealth obtaining a proprietary right in the land of a State. I advocate the vesting in trustees of sufficient land to produce an amount equal to the loss on working expenses, leaving it to the Commonwealth to bear theinterest on the capital cost, in. return for the national advantages to be derived. I . concede the claim that we are going to receive certain national benefits from the construction of the line, and that, therefore,, we should be prepared to bear a proportion of the annual loss. No doubt, that would be the major portion of the loss. If"" I the States could be induced to meet any deficiency in the working cost, I am satisfied that it would, to a great extent, allay any feeling of antipathy in the eastern States, be absolutely fair to the Commonwealth as a whole, and lead to a satisfactory settlement of the difficulty. It any idea of how much land would be involved? It might take in half WesternAustralia. of the sort. If the land is so valuelessas the honourable member indicates, it isuseless to attempt to develop it ; but I have a personal knowledge of this class of country, and know it is not valueless if it canbe brought into touch with other parts of the Commonwealth by railway. One of the virtues of the amendment is that it requires only sufficient land to produce the necessary annual revenue. It would be the duty of the trust, when formed, to determine how much land was necessary. the land would be taken. fair proposition, and submit it with confidence to the respectful consideration of the Committee. gested, "" by interjection, that this amendment is the same as others which the Committee has already negatived.

One is that it vests the land in trustees, the other is that it proposes to raise from the land only sufficient revenue to meet the loss on working expenses. I therefore rule that it is in order.

I assure the honourable member and the Committee that the Government will see that before the construction of the line is embarked upon a satisfactory settlement is arrived at between the Commonwealth and the Governments of the respective States in regard to this all important question. ently the whole position boiled down means that, as the Government have no desire to delay the passing of the Bill, they will have still less desire to delay the construction of the railway, and consequently will take whatever the Western Australian and South Australian Governments will be prepared to give them for the construction, maintenance, and working of the railway. They cannot get out of that position, no matter how many definitions or guarantees they may offer in this chamber. [2.44] -Al l these inquiries show the necessity for the Government coming to Parliament with some sort of rough plan and specification of the line before asking Parliament to authorize its construction. The Government all through are following an unprecedented course in connection with this railway. They ask the House to put the project through without telling the House what they propose to do in the way of land resumption, or anything else. Whenever a railway proposal is put before a State The Government will request the Parliament, plans and specifications are always laid upon the table, so that all the details may be thoroughly studied before a vote is taken.

239,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [2.45],"I s itMinister) [2.46] -The honourable member was arguing a little while ago that we were not taking sufficient power, but now he asks for a limitation. The Government will be sure of its power to do everything necessary for the construction of the line before it embarks on the project. An unlimited power of deviation is taken, because the sum expended on the preliminary survey was small, and the engineer advises that it may be necessary at some points to deviate considerably from the route now marked out. The provision to which exception is taken has been adopted to make the position of the Government absolutely secure, and to enable us to follow the most satisfactory route. I wish to emphasize what has been said by the honourable member for Gippsland. We should certainly have the assurance of Ministers, if a provision to that effect is not inserted in the Bill, that the railway will not go nearer the coast than 60 miles. I am in agreement, too, with the honourable member for Parramatta as to the need for the fullest information regarding route, methods of construction, and other particulars. We are committing ourselves to an expenditure of £5,000,000, or more, and leaving everything in the hands of the Government. No doubt it is safe to do that under present circumstances, but, were I in opposition, I should object to such a course. We should receive an assurance that the deviations will be limited in some way, and that the line will not approach nearer to the coast than the existing route. Clause agreed to. Clause 5The gauge of the railway shall be four feet in his opinion, the best gauge. eight and a half inches. That, after the word ""be,"" line 1, the following words be inserted, "" five feet three inches or."" The object of the amendment is to enable the Government to get the advice of the Engineers-in-Chief of the six States, or those acting for any who may be away or out of office, as to the best gauge for the railway in the light of recent expert knowledge. To follow this course will not delay the passing of the Bill. The report of the engineers consulted could be obtained in a month, when the Bill could be amended, or, if already passed into law, a resolution could be agreed to declaring what the standard gauge must be, and that resolution would have the force of law. I wish to put before the Committee concisely one or two points in favour of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge which have not received, even from engineers, the consideration due to them. There was a meeting of the Engineers-in-Chief of the States in 1904, but the question chiefly engaging their attention then was the survey of the proposed route, the question of gauge being incidental. If honourable members will refer to their report, they will see that their consideration was whether the then existing lines in Western Australia and South Australia should be prolonged on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge until they met, or whether the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge should be adopted for the extension. In paragraph 6 of the report they state thatWe are of opinion that this standard gauge should be adopted for the trans-continental line, as it would be a calamity to postpone the realization of the unification of the gauges, and increase the cost of doing so by constructing r,ioo miles on a narrower ancl inferior gauge. They were comparing the 3-ft. 6-in. with the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, and did not deal with the relative merits of the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge and the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. I have heard that Mr Moncrieff, who was then the South Australian Engineer-in-Chief, and is now Commissioner, has declared that he dissented orally from the assumption that 4 f t . 8J in. is the best gauge. That was said inferentially in a lecture by Mr Smith, and I have heard it stated in crieff himself. from Mr Moncrieff. ber of the Committee that 5 f t . 3 in. was, able member act on the report of the railway engineers? their decision, but it would not bind us, because Parliament must have the last "" say "" in these matters. When we ask for Commissions to be appointed, we, as a. rule, follow their recommendations, that is, if we act at all. In India, they appointed a Commission in 1884, and another -in 1870, to consider the gauge question. I referred to the latter Commission when, in 1889, I introduced a motion on the subject in the South Australian House of Assembly. When the first Commission met, the Indian railways had the 5-ft. 6-in. gauge and the metre gauge^ which is about",34,Joseph Cook S Amendment Put The My Amendment Cannot Conflict With The In

The question was referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons, which recommended that all leading trunk lines, with the principal feeders, should be on the broad gauge. gauge. half-hour consulted the authority on Indian railways from which I have derived my information, and I say that the comparison was between the 5 f t . 6 in. and the metre gauge. In 1889 the Director-General of Railways in India, Colonel Conway Gordon, recommended that an Act be passed to ' make the gauge 5 f t . 6 in. I believe that since the Commission of 1870, the conversions have been in the direction of adopting the wider gauge, and it was shown in an article in the Age a few days ago that . 1,100 miles of metre gauge, and, I think, a smaller gauge, have been converted to the 5-ft. 6-in. gauge. railway construction began in the Argentine, but I remember reading some years ago that in about 1877 or 1878 their expenditure on railways increased very rapidly, so that their construction is comparatively recent. Argentine there are now 10,176 miles on the 5-ft. 6-in. gauge. The_ Russian gauges, according to the pamphlet of Mr Schmidt, are 5 f t . 3 in. and 5 f t . there are 16,000 miles of 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. United States of America have adopted the 4-ft. 8^-in gauge on its absolute and comparative merits, but is that so? some years ago 10,000 miles of 5-ft. gauge were converted to 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. Was that done to obtain the advantage accruing from widening the track by 3^ inches? Would they have gone to that expense, and the expense of altering rolling-stock, as well as increasing the risks in rapid transit from the larger overhang, merely to secure a wider track? gauge was made to get rid of the break -of gauge. The Minister will admit that it would not have been considered economical by an American, or even by a Canadian, who, by a. small gauge, missed the chance of occupying the Presidential chair, to go to the expense which the undertaking to which I refer involved, merely to gain 3 inches in the width of track. 1 America the conversion of the gauges was -determined by the necessity, seeing that there were at least thirty-eight or forty States and many territories into which some railways ran, of having one standard gauge, which, at the time, seemed to be 4 f t . 8J in. Honourable members will see that 1 am not overdoing the inference I have drawn from the fact that this great conversion of only a few inches was merely to overcome the break of gauge. It is asked why the lines should not be altered now; but how could that be done? There are 237,000 miles of line crossing forty-seven or forty-eight States and territories, with different railway companies, all sorts of State and Inter-State laws, and the control of an Inter-State Commission. The financial prospects of such a proposition would stagger the enterprise and courage of even the Minister of Home Affairs. No doubt the reason why the lines are not converted now are found in the great financial outlay and the difficulties of reconciling the conflicting interests, if not the jealousies, of I do not know whenso many companies. In Canada, I think, they also converted to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge in order to link up with other railways. The most recent evidence I can get as to the inadequacy, under modern conditions of traffic and speed, of the 4-ft. 8J-in. It is significant that in the Central gauge is that given before an Irish Railway Commission which sat from 1907 to 1910. The subject of inquiry by the Commission was the nationalization of the railways, because of the alleged maladministration, not by Irishmen, because the reports showed that the railways are principally owned by English companies. One of the witnesses before that Commission was Mr Pinn, Chairman of the Dublin In Ohio and South-Eastern Railway, who, on the question of the gauge, was askedDo you think it is an advantage in Ireland to have a gauge different from the gauge in England?I think it is a rather curious thing that in Ireland, where we have less traffic, we should have a wider gauge j but I think tbe misfortune has been greater in England than in Ireland. The witness went on further to sayThe alteration of It is the public that suffers. I think the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge is too narrow, and it is a great, misfortune that it was adopted. They have the 5-ft. 6-in. gauge in many foreign countries. They have it in India, and, I think, in South America. He was askedI venture to think that the actual advantage of the narrower gauge is very small, and has its limitations, and that if you were to inquire you would find that your Irish railways are In able to keep their locomotives much longer out of the work-shops and get a greater mileage between shop repairs than we can in England, because your wider gauge enables all the wearing parts to have bigger bearing surfaces.",35,Joseph Cook S Amendment Put The My Amendment Cannot Conflict With The In

That is the experience, as against the assumption in 1846 that 4 f t . 8J in. was the proper gauge. Then a Royal Commission sat in England on the question of gauges; and I have here the history of the Great Western Railway, published in 1895, which contains extracts from the report of that Commission. It mentions that the assumption in 1848 was on imperfect information ; and an assumption that has been falsified by subsequent experience. This strengthens what was said by the witnesses before the Irish Commission in 1909. First there was a fear that speed on the wider gauge would be dangerous-that the gauge should not be broader than 4 f t . 8J in., because otherwise the speed would be too fast. I do not know what they considered fast in those days; but they evidently thought it would mean a multiplicity of accidents. The broader gauge gives more easy travelling, as shown in the report, and greater speed, with less risk. I have read that experts consider that the overhanging is always greater in proportion to the axleboxes in connection with the narrower gauge, and, of course, increases proportionately the liability to accidents. is said in the book to which I have referredHad the Commission taken place thirty or even twenty years later, one half of the report would not have been written, for the deductions and conclusions drawn by the Commissioners on the results that would accrue from the various South Wales railways were taken over by the suppositional premises would at this later period Government, who appointed Mr John Whitton, have been found to be entirely incorrect, or else the conditions under which the conclusions were arrived at would have been so completely changed that such speculations would have been unnecessary in the face of various improvements which had in the meantime been developed, and which were at this later period in daily use on railways. The writer goes on to mention that the summing up of the Commission on the comparative advantages of the tw.o gauges was wrong on two points-the danger, and the greater possibility of carriage on the narrower gauge. It must be remembered that the narrow gauge then considered was not only the 4 f t . 8J in., because others were suggestedFirst. That as regards the safety, accommodation, and convenience of the passengers, no decided preference is due to either gauge, but that on the.broad gauge the motion is generally more easy at high velocities. Secondly. That in respect of speed, we con-. sider the advantages are with the broad gauge; 7-ft. one it would have but we think the public safety would be enthe narrower gauge is a dangered in employing the greater capabilities of the broad gauge much beyond their present to the English railway use, except on roads more consolidated and more substantially and perfectly formed than those of the existing lines. The writer goes on to sayThirdly. That in the commercial case of the transport of goods, we believe the narrow gauge to possess the greater convenience and to be the more suited to the general traffic of the country. . . . We are desirous, however, of guarding ourselves from being supposed to express an opinion that the dimension of 4 f t . Si in. is in all respects the most suited for tbe general objects of the country. This bears out what I assumed a few days ago, that the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge was not adopted in 1846 on its merits, as compared with the 5-ft. and 5-ft. 6-in. gauges. And the recent Commission bears out the assumption that were the battle fought again now the victory would be with the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. Professor Kernot is, I think, regarded as an expert in railway matters. He delivered a lecture on the question of gauges in .1906, and dealt with the same question in Glasgow in 1901 in a paper read before the Institute of Engineers Congress. In the lecture the Professor said"" Great discussion took place at this time as Here is what to the gauge to be adopted. Victoria, Soutb Australia, Tasmania, and the colony of New Zealand, after careful inquiry, adopted the Irish gauge of 5 f t . 3 in . ; while New South Wales, after having at first adhered to that gauge, and at a time when the other colonies had already placed large orders for rolling stock, changed its decision and adopted the English gauge of 4 f t . 8^ in. In 1857, the New M.Inst.C.E., as Engineer-in-Chief. This gentleman assured the writer that he did his best to induce the Government to alter the gauge ta that of the adjoining colonies, but without avail, the result being that that State now bas 2,811 miles of railways on a gauge that exists nowhere else in Australia, and the evils of break of gauge exist wherever the lines cross the frontier. But even in Victoria and New Soutli Wales strong pressure was brought to bear, about the year 1870, to induce the Governments lo have all further extensions on the narrow gauge. This, however, was successfully resisted by the Engineers-in-Chief of the two colonies, T . Higinbotham, M.Inst.C.E., and John Whitton, M.Inst.C.E. In Victoria, so strong was the pressure that tenders were actually invited for the two lines, one in easy and the other in rather difficult country, both on 5-ft. 3-in. and 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, the result being that the narrower gauge showed a saving of only £150 per mile in the former and £181 in the latter case. After this,' all railway making in Victoria continued on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge until the last two years, during which two very short lines of 2 f t . 6 in. have been built under very gauges to a uniform standard. The adopspecial c inditions. Later the Professor said that in 1857 Mr thing towards immediately effecting that Whitton begged the New South Wales Government to go back to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and the reply was, "" The lines will never meet for centuries."" That, of course, was absurd in the face of recent experience. I omitted to mention that in 1846 there was rather a prejudice in favour of the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, arising from the fact that 1,900 odd miles had been constructed on that gauge as against, I think, a highest mileage, in other instances, of 274 miles. It strikes me that the engineering difficulties are not comparatively less in connection with the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge than in connection with a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge over the class of country to be traversed by the proposed line. It is not mountainous country. The only portion where the conversion would involve heavy expense would be south of Port Augusta, where for 40 or 50 miles we have a stretch of line the conversion of which would be very costly. If , however, this railway is built on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, South Australia will have a very great inducement to convert at once its line to Port Augusta. The State has been considering the conversion of that line, and even, I believe, the conversion of the line from Port Pirie to Hamley Bridge. The adoption of a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge would not matter much to Western Australia. matter very much to Western Australia. I know it is alleged that there are some difficulties there in regard to stations, but those difficulties are small in comparison with such a tremendous undertaking as this. Indeed, they should be only trifling' to Western Australia, which has done so much in the past, and will no doubt accomplish big things in the future. If this line were built on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge I assume that there would not be very great difficulty in converting the Western Australian lines to the same gauge. we should then have, within a reasonable time, a line of railway stretching from Fremantle to Albury on a uniform gauge, involving a diminution of the present complexities, and without any dislocating effect either upon New South VVales or Queensland. built the line on a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge we should immediately complicate the position as regards South Australia, and incidentally operate against the transformation of our tion of a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge would do sometransformation, whilst the adoption of a 4ft. 8j-in. gauge would mean only further complexities. If we built this line on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge I believe that South Australia would at once convert its 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line between Terowie and Port Augusta, and alter its 3-ft. 6-in. line to Port Pirie, whilst we should also get, I believe, a conversion to 5 f t . 3 in in Western Australia. I find from my reading that the question of flexibility is not affected by the difference between a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge and a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. On the broad gauge, according to an engineer cited by Professor Kernot, you must go slowly round the curves, and may run fast on the straights'; but on the narrow you must go slowly all the way. an hour the other day on a narrow-gauge line. the opinions of the engineers, and so far as my reading has gone, owing to the greater over-hang and the greater length of trains for the same freight, there is more danger in travelling at, say, 70 miles an hour on a 4-ft. gauge line than there is on a 5-ft. 3-in. line. I do not desire to cite an American experience in this matter, because immediately one does so some one who has not been there declares that it is due to causes other £han those stated. But it is rather significant that in the United States of America, where we have the greatest length of 4-ft. 8£-in. railway, we have in proportion to train mileage the greatest number of accidents. have a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, there are more accidents than in any other State. assertion, but can the honourable member prove it? for Wentworth says he "" thinks "" he can. ber deny that statement? ment of opinion on the part of any honourable member.

What are we to say of these questions when we see differences of from £2,000,000 to £3,000,000 between the estimates of experts regarding the cost of constructing the line, and equally striking differences in the opinions expressed by experts as to the cost of conversion. One expert takes into account the provision of new rolling-stock, another does not ; one expert takes into account the cost of new sleepers, while another says new sleepers will not be necessary ; and so on. If we look back at the records as to this point presented twenty years ago by Mr Eddy, we shall find that engineers and recent lecturers, like Mr adoption of a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge throughout Smith, are not so far out as are some of the amateurs of the House. In the light of what I have said, of what has been said by other honourable members, and of that which will be contributed, I am sure, in the course of this debate, I think that we may well ask the Government not to prejudice the matter by leaving in the Bill the provision as to a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, but to accept this amendment, which merely asks that the experts of the States, who have not met to consider this question seriously-the experts of the six Statesshould be called together to deal with it. The question affects the whole of the States, because Tasmania and Queensland will have to pay the piper in this matter, just as the other States will have to do. honourable member's proposal involve? mean a delay of more than a few weeks. from South Australia. to asperse the motives of the representatives of other States; but, for the last two days, I have listened to nothing more than bantering insinuations. A representative of South Australia or Victoria cannot open his mouth in this debate without an insinuation being made that he has some ulterior motive; whilst, if he remains silent, 4,800 coaches. In the construction of that it is said that he is afraid to stand up for bis honest convictions. When men have to motives, we may be sure that they are strengthening the other side. WhatI ask for is that an inquiry shall be made. I tried, before submitting this amendment, to ascertain how long it would take experts to consider this question; but I could not get any definite information on the subject. I assume, however, that the engineers of the several States could be brought together within two or three weeks, and that with the detailed information at their disposal they should be able, within a fortnight, to come to a decision. I appeal to the Committee to affirm the principle that inquiry is desirable. honourable member for Angas has dealt with this question from a purely theoretical and impracticable point of view. He has presented information to prove what might have been done, what some one suggested should be done, and to show that there are all sorts of possibilities in regard to the Australia. I propose to give the Committee, not mere theory, but actual facts, in regard to what has been, and is being, done at the present time. I would, first of all, tell the honourable member for Angas that the fastest trains ever known have been run on a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge; that the biggest engines ever built are running on lines of a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, and that the cheapest railways ever built have been constructed on that gauge. Whilst lines of 5-ft. 6-in. and 7-ft. gauges have been built in England, and pulled up again, I have searched the world's records in vain for an instance where a 4-ft. 8£-in line has been pulled up. I know, however, that lines of every other gauge have been. Let me give the Committee a few facts regarding the railways of England. In the first place, the London and North-Western Company has a length of 2,000 miles of railway; it carries yearly 77,000,000 passengers, and 55,000,000 tons of minerals and merchandise; and has an annual revenue of £16,000,000, or £43,000 a day. Then, again, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company has over 1,500 locomotives, 1,100 of them being under steam every day. It carries 60,000,000 passengers and 25,000,000 tons of freight over its lines every year; while it has a passenger mileage of 13,000,000 miles, and owns",38,Joseph Cook S Amendment Put The My Amendment Cannot Conflict With The In

A statement which I made being done in England and Scotland on in the House recently regarding the posithe lines of some of the medium-sized comtion held by the late Mr Harriman in repanies on the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge. I have so lation to the American railways was ques-far left out the Great Midland line, of tioned. He was quoted as a great which the figures would stagger the Commitauthority, and it was said that at one time tee, and no fault has ever been found with he made a statement to a meeting of his that gauge on the ground of incapacity to shareholders, that he wished the gauge of do all this big work. The Midland trains his lines was wider than it was. I said run 1,000,000 miles each week. The comthat I considered that that statement of Mr Hedges. And so the conversion extended until in 1892 of freight and 195,000,000 this was merely a market move. I find -after all that Mr Harriman's position, although he owned a big interest, was not :so great in regard to the American railways as some people thought. He commanded 28,000 miles of railway, but at that time the total miles of line in the United States was 210,000. Moore-Reid -commanded an equal mileage, while Van-derbilt commanded 24,000, thePennsylvania 19,000, and Gould 21,000 miles. If Mr Harriman did say he wanted his gauge widened it proves nothing. All those other people were not complaining at the same time, and Mr Harriman was simply trying to boom his own track by making it appear that he could not carry -on it all the freight that was offering. We must not give credence to all these -statements that come from America. I iheard of Vanderbilt and Gould, each of whom owned a railway running out west, -getting up a war of tariffs. This went on until Vanderbilt found that he could not get trains enough to carry the cattle that were waiting to be sent out east. He then found that Gould had cornered all the cattle in the west, and was running them .over Vanderbilt's line at a rate that did^ not pay Vanderbilt. I think it is a good thing that our Minister of Rome Affairs is a Canadian. The speed that can be -obtained on the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge should '-be sufficient for Australia or any other country. world. runs for short distances are the following: ferring to the New Zealand system, says-On the Philadelphia to Reading line, section from Egg Harbor to Brigantine Junction, for narrow .4.8 miles, at the rate of 115 miles an hour; -on the Great Western Railway in England, from Paddington to Bristol, 118 Dealing miles was run in. 1904 at 84 miles an hour; 1893-4, -on the Pennsylvania line from Washington Australian lines on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge had to Fort Wayne, a length of 81 miles, was reached £9,715 per mile, and that of the southrun at 75 miles an hour.

We can hardly expect 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. But, in a country which has that the Government will want to run been 'trains through to Western Australia at that standard, the strongest reasons will be required speed, but there is no doubt that it can be for discarding it in favour of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, done. It has been stated that heavier locomotives can be built for the 5-ft. 3-in. than for the 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge. That is incorrect, or if it is correct it has never been done up to date. It is stated that the heaviest locomotive ever built weighs, including the tender, 700,000 lbs., with a length over all, including the tender, of more than 100 feet. Those figures are given in the book published in 1911 to which I have referred. That locomotive runs' on the 4-ft. 8 -in. gauge. All this L is beyond theory as to what may or may not be done or ought to be done. It is what has been and is being done as a working proposition. Surely those facts are of more value as a guide to Australia than all the theory that can be laid before the House. These are statistics from the two biggest railway nations in the world, and should be convincing proof that what the Government propose to do is right. They must have decided upon this course with these facts in front of them. Some one has considered the matter, or the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge would not have been adopted. The engineers who Have been engaged on this problem met together and considered gauges, and 1 am certain that if the House fixes the 4-ft. Sit-in gauge it will, be doing what is right for Australia. The statement has been made here that the 4-ft. 8&-in. gauge is called a narrow gauge, but I find that it is the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge that is termed the narrow gauge; the being known as the broad gauges. The The same gauge, 3 f t . 6 in., ancl the same of rail, 40 lbs. per yard, were adopted gauge lines. with the question of cost, he saysAccording to the Commissioners' report for the cost of the southern group of South more.

270,Mr Hedges,"The fastest recorded authority from whom I am quoting, reand the ultimate economy will be secured by constructing a standard gauge line with light way and works, capable of carrying ordinary goods stock at low speeds, but not the mainline engines. Do not build your main lines too light! -He emphasizes the fact that New South Wales built light railways on the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge through its level pastoral country, and instances the Nyngan to Cobar railway. He saysSuch pioneer railways have been constructed at an average cost of £2,019 per mile, and have proved satisfactory both as regards working and traffic. . . . The adoption of the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge has again been urged on the Colonies of Victoria and South Australia. These statements are taken from the reports of the New South Wales Railways Commissioners. William Henry Cole is a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers, and was deputy manager of the NorthWestern Railway in India. He is a very high authority on railway construction. He saysThe variety of gauges in Australia is extraordinary. The 5-ft. 3-in. and 3-ft. 6-in. gauges are found in South Australia, the 5 f t . 3 in. in Victoria, the 3 f t . 6 in. in Queensland nnd Western Australia. is a 2-ft. 6-in. gauge in Victoria. tinue to construct on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. To resume the quotationadopted in New South Wales, is not the standard of all Australia, with a 2-ft. 6-in. gauge to fall back on whenever reduction of gauge is a sine qua non. I think it is unnecessary to say more to amendment. prove' that the 4-ft. 8^-in gauge is the standard. might now give us his own opinion. many railways, and know that the cost of railway construction is increasing in Australia. Sleepers are becoming dearer every year, and on the lines between Melbourne and Adelaide they are substituting steel for wood in some places. We must remember the desirability of ultimately giving through direct transit from Fremantle to Sydney. I cannot understand why South Australia urges that all the traffic should be brought through Adelaide, and carried over the Mount Lofty ranges. It would be much better to lessen the haulage by going over level ground. We should not deal with big questions in a tiddly-winking way. I have a friend who says that there are men in Australia who, if they were farmers, would want to plant their wheat with gimlets, and some honourable' members are inclined to deal with this subject much in that way. The 4-ft. 8j-in.. gauge has proved effective in other parts' of the world, and to be capable of any strain that we are likely to put on it. The 5-ft. 3-in. gauge increases the cost of railway construction, and both South Australia and Victoria have been forced to abandon it for some lines. The South Australians,, when they got to Terowie, had to give up the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and connect with' Broken Hill, and the country beyond the big lakes, by means of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Although they are now urging the adoption of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge for the' line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, they commenced the construction of the big transcontinental railway to Port Darwin on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and their engineerin-chief did his best to impress it upon Western Australia that that gauge was good enough for the line now under consideration. Victoria has not been able to build all her railways on the 5-ft. 3-in.: gauge, and has had to adopt the 2-ft. 6-in. gauge for some extensions. Progress reported.
