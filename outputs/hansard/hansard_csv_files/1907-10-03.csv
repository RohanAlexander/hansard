The spirit adulterated with kerosene which is sold by druggists is sometimes consumed by persons who are fond of strong drink. Kerosene is mixed with it to give it a disagreeable taste and smell to prevent its consumption, but I have known persons to drink white spirit so adulterated, and, on one occasion, I was told by a druggist, in reference to a woman who had come into his shqp to buy a bottle of this spirit for 3d. or 6d. that that was the sixth time that she had come in that day. She was a member of a travelling show company. the consumption of these beverages will be greatly increased if the duty is reduced.

This seems an extraordinary alterT h e departation, and I see no reason for it. Twentyfive per cent, of proof spirit must be a fairly strong drink, and the proposal that it should be admitted at a duty of 3s. 6d. per gallon is a very novel one.' There is no object to be gained by this alteration. Why should, we depart from the old rates, which have been confirmed by bothi sections of the Tariff Commission ?

47,Mr Watson,"Let us first of all disSir WILLIA M LYNE -As it seems to be the desire of the Committee that the -course suggested by the honourable member for . South Sydney be adopted, I shall follow it. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Whilst tlie -Government are in full sympathy with the -desire of the Tariff Commission to afford the fullest encouragement to the growth and use of Australian-grown leaf-and honorable members will find that the division, as it stands, follows the recommendations of one section of the Commissionan examination of the recommendations of the Commission will, I am confident, -clearly demonstrate that, if they are given -effect to, their intentions cannot possibly be realized. That is proved by the objections raised by those interested in the industry, as well as by experts, to the Tariff as introduced. It may be readily -shown by taking the recommendations in -order, and examining the protective incidence which would result in each case. A slight modification, however, ' may be made which will amplv provide for what is so much desired. Take item 17, the first in this division. The proposal of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission is that the duty on that item, ""Tobacco, manufactured,"" shall be 3s. -6d. iier lb. If we turn to the Excise, to fully understand the position, we must -compare this with the rates proposed on unmanufactured leaf to be manufactured into tobacco and the Excise duty to be paid on such manufacture. We find on turning to item 21 that the recommendation is unstemmed leaf, is. 9d. per lb. ; stemmed or in strips', 2s. per lb.; and the Excise on manufactured is. 3d. per lb., as it was anticipated that the cost of stemming would be 3d. per lb. That is a point of which I had previously no knowledge; but it is estimated very generally that stemming would cost what I have mentioned The duty on the leaf would therefore be equivalent in either case to 2s. per lb. on that assumption. This affords a protection to the manufacture of tobacco from imported leaf of 3d. only, as compared with 9d. under the 1902 Tariff. 3d. per lb. when the cheaper labour conditions of. the United States are taken into consideration ditions ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Yes. I think that allowance must be made for the negrp labour which is employed in the Southern States. done by negroes? clear that a margin of 3d. per lb. when the cheaper labour conditions of the United States are taken into consideration is altogether insufficient to compete with the imported tobacco, and the inevitable result will be-if this proposal be adhered to that the importation of manufactured tobacco will very largely increase, and the manufactories here will be seriously affected. I wish to draw special attention to the fact that whilst we are prepared to spare no effort to encourage the use of the local leaf, we recognise that important aid to its encouragement and existence will be found in well-equipped factories in Australia, and we must be careful in seeing that whilst they are not permitted in the slightest degree to discriminate unfavorably against ' any local interest, their existence is not imperilled. I have been in close consultation with Mr Nevill, the tobacco expert of Queensland, whose recommendations I think the Tariff Commission intended to follow. I have his assurance that he intended the Commission to draw from his evidence the conclusions which I am putting before the Committee at the present moment, but that his statements were misinterpreted-no t intentionally, of tourseand therein the trouble appears to have arisen. He has suggested to the Government that whilst the duty on imported manufactured tobacco might properly be fixed at 3s. 6d. per lb., the duty on imported leaf for local manufacture should be rated at (a) unstemmed, is. 6d. per l b , (b) stemmed, 2s. per lb., with an excise of is. per lb. port is the Treasurer reading?

82,Mr Glynn,"I cannot assume that theI prefer to think that the expert has changed, his opinion, and that, possibly, the Ministry have helped him to do so. I suggest-and I intend to test the question-that we should revert to the rates established in 1901-2, which have worked very well. Of course, while willing to consider the interests of importers and of local manufacturers, in view of the quantity of tobacco consumed in Australia, we must, in the interests of the general public, pay some attention' to revenue, price, and quality. There is a very large public interested in the question of quality and price. Surely then we are not going to give too much encouragement to the local manufacturers who, according to the report of the Royal Commission of 1906, are almost all in combination, so that they have at least a partial monopoly. We are surely not going to give too much encouragement to local growers at the expense of the consuming public, with whom the first consideration is quality. I suggest that, for various reasons, we should go back to the position of 1901 and 1902. When the Tariff was introduced in 1901, an import duty of 3s. 6d. was proposed, but after a long debate it was determined that a rale of 3s. 3d. would be sufficient. been made by Sir George Turner. orable member has reminded me of that. He took a great interest in this and other questions affected by the Tariff. Sir George Turner said publicly at one stage of the debate that, although his proposition allowed ai difference of is. in favour of the local manufacturers, he was prepared, after full consideration of all the circumstances, to rejrard a preference of 9CI. as adequate, and to that Parliament agreed. the unaltered resolutions are an import duty of 3s. 6d. on manufactured tobacco, and of 2s. on stemmed leaf, with an Excise duty of is. 3d. on locally manufactured tobacco, giving a protection to the local manufacturer of only 3d. instead of the former protection of 9d. On tobacco made from imported unstemmed leaf the protection will be 6d., the import duty on unstemmed leaf being only is. 9d. The adoption of these rates suggests that it was considered that the cost of stemming is equal to 3d., but now the Government is departing from what was a symmetrical arrangement, making the difference between the import duty oil stemmed leaf and that 'on unstemmed leaf 6d. Colonel FOXTON -One-thir d of the weight is lost in stemming. with the statements of the Minister. This change seems to have been made' after a conference with Mr Nevill, the Queensland expertI do not say that he is the mouth-piece of the Queensland Government -wh o has had the advantage of presenting a special report, another report on the subject being practically his. The upsetting of the former symmetrical arrangement will givegreater and disproportionate protection to the local leaf, which is produced chiefly in Queensland; but Mr Nevill seems to have gone back on the evidence which he gave before the Tariff Commission in reply to question 28,419. I have only glanced at much of the evidence taken by the Commission, liecause it would be impossible for any man who had other matters to attend to to do more, but I again testify to the splendid public service of its members, and especially of the free-trade section, who may have had less help from official sources than was given to the protectionist section. According to Mr Nevill, in Virginia-the stemmed leaf is put on the market.After that the re-handler gets hold of it, and he allows it to hang in his drying-room fo'r two or three months. That tobacco is not taken out until the following spring, say in May or June. Then it is put into hogsheads, holding from 1,200 to 1,400 lbs. This continuous handling, with freezing and thawing, and the coming and going of soft and dry weather, eliminates the objectionable qualities of the tobacco, and develops its flavours. Probably, since a long course of treatment must be undergone by .stemmed leaf in America, stemmed leaf here must undergo similar treatment.

That protection seems to have berlain, it being mentioned, I think, in the report, and again by Mr Nevill, in reference to a speech of Mr Chamberlain, that in Great Britain they were about to give a protection of 3d. in favour' of local stemming, by increasing the duty on stemmed leaf from 3s. to 3s. 3d. I believe that that was done, but according to the memorandum to which I have referred, the preference has been reduced from 3d. to i d . , because, I suppose, although it provided a certain amount of employment, it had an injurious effect on the revenue, or on the price or quality of the tobacco produced. state when the reduction to £d. was made?

On the whole that has been a success. vernment was to grant a preference of is. per pound to the local manufacturer. that proposal with the approval, of Sir George Turner, who was then Treasurer, and who, after submitting it, made a further investigation of the facts. How has the revenue been affected? In 1902 the It is a memorandum Excise from tobacco was .£453,171, and in 1907 it rose to £ 6 8 8 , 0 0 0 so that the revenue, tested by the Excise, has benefited. Honourable memI do not know what has been the increased revenue derived from the Customs duties on tobacco, but I have some figures relating to narcotics, which I shall put before the Committee. They show that the Customs duties collections in respect of narcotics in 1902 were £ 9 1 7 , 0 9 0 ; and in 1907, £ 9 9 1 , 0 0 0 , so that the preference of od., if we take as the test its effect upon the With reference to the revenue, has been fairly successful. The increase in the Customs collections has been more than in proportion to the increase in population. This is an important matter, because the week before last the Treasurer, when concluding one of the three general discussions on the Tariff, two of which he had induced, stated that if the annual revenue of £10,500,00 0 which he estimated to derive from the Tariff were reduced within two years, as suggested by the honourable member for Flinders, to about £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, he would not be able to pay to the States the f u l l three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled under the Constitution, and at .the same time meet the expenditure provided for this year. In such a contingency, he said that he wzuld have a shortage of something like £272,000. In these circumstances, we must be careful what we do in regard to any sacrifice of revenue. We ought not to tamper with the difference of 9d. which,, up to' the present, from the point of view of protectionists and revenue Tariffists, I think that the word appears to have worked fairly well. There Under the New is another aspect of this question to which I shall refer. Even under the old Tariff the local leaf has not fared badly, and it does not require any further protection. If we make a difference of 6d. per lb. between the duty on stemmed and unstemmed But in 1901 leaf, we shall affect the quality, since the demanufacturers, who ought to know someand a f u l l consideration of thing about the question, have indicated agreed as a their preference for stemmed as against unstemmed leaf, and may diminish importation.

Thus, the consumer must be affected. Under the Tariff which was passed in 1901-2, a great increase has taken place in the consumption of imported leaf. I refer ""to this fact, merely as indicating the preference exhibited by the manufacturers, who ought to know what is the best leaf to use. In-1899', the consumption of the local leaf in New South Wales was 1,243,580 lbs., whilst in 1906 it was only 692,282 lbs. The consumption of imported leaf, on the other hand, increased from 1,167,417 lbs. in 1899 to 2,527,358 lbs. in 1.906. In Victoria 1,271,556 lbs. of imported leaf were used in 1899, whereas in 1906, no less than 4,172,065 lbs. were used. 237,172 lbs. of imported leaf were used in 1902, whilst in 1906 241,897 lbs. were used. The consumption of the local leaf in South Australia and Victoria also increased during -the same period, but not in anything like the same proportion. If these figures point to anything, it-is to the fact that the manufacturers prefer the imported leaf for their purposes. At the same time, the protection granted to the local manufacturer under the old Tariff must have been sufficient, since there has been a shrinkage in the importation of manufactured tobacco. In these circumstances, I propose that we should revert to the old preference of 9d. per lb. tation of the workers, as well as of the manufacturers, which waited upon me, that it is almost impossible to force on the marSo unsatisfactory were the answers received ket manufactures of local leaf. ence of Queensland. mitted to me, showing that tobacco containing 75 per cent, of imported leaf was Opposition side of the Chamber. -selling at 4s. 6d. per lb., whilst tobacco made solely of local leaf Wa.s"" realizing by those interested in the industry show only 2s. rod. per lb.

I reThen, again, in South Australia, member a speech then made by the deputy leader of the Opposition, who dilated upon the profits of the manufacturers, and produced a balance-sheet -showing that Messrs.

When we met again, four days later, Sir George Turner made a statement to the effect that, notwithstanding that he had appealed to the manufacturers to assist him to deal with the statement.

I am not sure at the present moment that I have fully grasped the precise import of the changes in the rates of duty members if the Government had submitted their new proposals .in a tabulated form alongside of the proposals embodied in theprinted Tariff schedule. Then we should have been able to get a better grip of the subject than we can hope to do by discussing a mass of figures which have been orally presented to us. I do not intend to discuss the new proposals in detail, but' I desire to inform the Committee of themethods by which the Tariff Commission arrived at their conclusions. We had four aspects of this question to consider. In the first place, we had to consider the question of developing the cultivation of tobacco in Australia; in the second, we had to think of the position of the manufacturer; in thethird, we had to have regard to the interestso f the workers; and, finally, we had l.oguard against the consumer being called upon to pay an unduly high price for his smoke.

Indeed, no subject which came under the consideration of the Commission was dealt with at greater length ordiscussed with more anxiety than 'the incidence of the duties upon tobacco. .We heard the evidence of the Queensland expert, Mr Nevill, in connection with the growth of tobacco, particularly in that State, and all' the members of the Commission were very much impressed with his testimony. He gave us proof positive that Queensland was turning out an excellent quality of tobaccoa tobacco which was sampled by the most uncompromising free-trader on ""the Commission, who readily admitted that from the stand-point of quality it was equal toanything that he had ever smoked.

I believe that Australia has suqh. a variety of soil and climate suited to the growth of particular varieties of tobacco as would enable us, within a few years, to become independent of the outside world in regard to our -consumption of that article. That being the opinion which was arrived at by a majority^of the Commission, we had to give -considerable weight to the value of such evidence in framing our recommendations. It seems to me that the new proposals of the Government, to a large extent, ignore the interests of the growers of tobacco, and .also, the possibilities of developing the cultivation of that commodity, in favour of the interests of the manufacturer. rect. honourable member has scarcely got the figures correctly. rectly. some modification of the Commission's proposals, it is impossible for me to go so far as the Government have indicated a -desire to take the Committee. aware that men in the tobacco industry have been thrown out of work, but I hold the opinion that that is not the direct result of the Tariff. -which controls the manufacture of tobacco in Australia has thrown those men out of work for no other reason, I believe, than to emphasize the requests that have been made for better consideration than has been .given to the monopoly in the recommendations of the Tariff Commission as adopted by the Government. cruel proceeding? we know that such things are done in the commercial world in order to work a point. -selves do not seem to be of that opinion. are, unfortunately, in the hands of their employers, and when they are thrown out of work it is very natural for them to come to the conclusion that the Tariff is -responsible. The Tariff Commission took up the position-and I believe I am now quoting the opinion of all the members-that in this connection revenue is an important consideration, and that under the old Tariff nearly £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , which dught to have gone into the Treasury, went into the pockets of the manufacturers. The Commission modified the old duties with a view to overtake that loss of revenue, and further provided that if the manufacturers developed the growth of Australian tobacco, and used it, they would, instead of losing by the increased Excise, gain something. However, I am of opinion that the manufacturers do not wish to use the locallyproduced article, and thus encourage production, for the reason that while the bulk' is imported they can control the importation, whereas if the bulk be locally grown their monopoly will cease to exist, because then small manufacturers, who now have to buy their supplies from the combination, will be able to compete. would be all right?

173,Mr Batchelor,"The Governmentgiven to the local manufacturer should certainly go hand in hand with that given to the local producer of the leaf; but the first desideratum to be aimed at in this connection is to give the largest degree of support to the locally-grown leaf. After a number of consultations with Mr Nevill, the Queensland tobacco expert than whom in the Commonwealth I have arrived at the conclusion that the proposals .now put forward by the Government in substitution of the items in the schedule as originally submitted are eminently calculate""? to achieve that object. I representedfor many years in the State Parliament of Queensland a district the staple product of which is tobacco, and there is no reason why other districts should not be able to produce large quantities. The chief considerations are suitability of soil and climate, and I feel confident that, there are many other parts of the Commonwealth where the climate and soil are equal to those of the Texas district, to which I have referred. ing in my electorate are as good. Colonel FOXTON member's electorate is separated only by a river from that which I formerly represented in the State Parliament. The misgivings which any one may have as to the capability of Australia to produce ultimately a sufficient quantity of tobacco of high quality to meet local requirements are entirely without foundation. I forget for the moment what was the Excise duty in Queensland. the import duty was 4s. per lb. Colonel FOXTON honourable member. import duty on manufactured tobacco was 4s. per lb., whilst the import duty on the unmanufactured leaf was 2s. per lb. There was an Excise duty of is. per lb., so that there was thus a differentiation of is. per lb. In New South Wales there was a differentiation of only 9d. per lb., but that difference had this effect: that whilst the whole of the alluvial flats along tbe northern or Queensland bank of the river dividing my electorate from the Federal electorate of Gwydir were covered with tobacco farms, the cultivation of tobacco on the southern-side was neglected. A most successful tobacco-growing area was established there, with a local factory for the manufacturing of the locally-grown kaf> whereas upon the New South Wales side of the river no tobacco was produced. formation of the tobacco combine? Colonel FOXTON I am speaking of a. period prior to the advent of Federation, when the old State Tariffs were in operation. I am merely stating the facts as there is no better authority they are known to me, and I make no comment whatever upon them. Everybody who visited that district used to inquire,. "" How is it that tobacco is not grown on the opposite bank of the river? Surely there must be the same class of soil there?""' The difference of 3d. per lb. between the incidence of the two State Tariffs was responsible for this marked contrast. So that a margin of 3d. per lb. in a Tariff can exercise a very vital effect upon production. Whether it will make any considerable difference to the consumer is asimple question of arithmetic which we can work out for ourselves. It seems tome that it means that the man who smokes, a couple of ounces of tobacco per week will be called upon to contribute an extra threepence to the revenue every twomonths. I have already mentioned the fact that Mr Nevill, the Queensland toT h e honourable bacco expert, is now in Melbourne. A short time ago, at the request of some of the Queensland representatives, I despatchpd an urgent telegram to the Premier of that State requesting that Mr Nevill1 might be instructed to proceed to Melbourne for the purpose of affording honourable members every possible information'' in reference to the tobacco industry, and also that he might be of assistance to the Government if they desired to avail themselves of his services. I understand that It was is. per lb., whilst soon after his arrival in this city Mr Nevill got into communication with theI am obliged to the Treasurer and his officers, and as a result In Queensland the the Government-ver y properly, I thinkhave acted upon his advice in regard to these duties.

He was brought from the United Statesto Queensland as a tobacco expert, and he has done splendid work there. He hasthoroughly mastered all the details of theindustry, and in acting upon his advicethe Government are accepting the counsel of one who is anxious to see the growthand manufacture of tobacco in Australia encouraged as much as possible.

Under the circumstances, I think the. experiment is worth making; and I believe that the proper time . for stemming is when the leaf is dry. I have taken the trouble to consult -the Customs statistics; and I find that the importation of manufactured tobacco in 1904 amounted to 2,175,000 lbs., of which only 1,880,000 lbs. was taken out of bond. In 1905 the.quantity imported was 2,045,000 lbs., of which only 1,661,000 lbs. was taken out of bond; and in 1906 the quantity imported was 1,926,000 lbs., of which only 1,516,000 lbs. was taken out of bond. three years the total quantity imported was €,147,000 lbs., of which 5,058,000 lbs. was taken out of bond, leaving about 1,100,000 lbs. in the custody of the Customs.

The duty payable on a brand of Manilla cigars, which cost in bond £ 1 18s. per 1,000, is £ 4 13s., or 230 per cent."" that kind of cigar here. see more cigars made here. The duty chargeable on German cigars costing jQi ios. per 1,000 in bond is £ 4 12s., or about 300 per cent. But in respect to expensive cigars, the rate of duty is relatively lower. For instance, the duty on a superfine Havana cigar, costing £ 1 6 per Over the 1,000 in bond, is less than 40 per cent. Then, taking the prices on the list of a Trichinopoli firm, which is one of the leading manufacturers of cigars in India, I find that one brand costs 26s. 8d. per 1,000, another 24s. per 1,000, another 21s. 4d. per 1,000, and another as little as 12s. per 1,000, and a gentleman to whom the local agency was offered, was promised 20 per cent, discount off the 12s. per 1,000 cigar. stick to the highest rate possible, so far as the import duty is concerned.

The local manufacture of cigarettes, like the local production of cigars, increased during the period under review; 623,000 lbs. having been produced in 1900 and 1,148,033 lbs. in 1906. There was thus an increase of over 500,000 lbs. figures, the proposal of the Government to increase the rates ot duty appears a most extraordinary one. They show most conclusively that there was no necessity to interfere with the old rates. to give preference to Australian producers, they are willing to go to any length,, and without rhyme or reason. Thewhole of their sympathies are with the local growers primarily, and, secondly,with the manufacturers of local leaf products. pay no regard whatever to the great masses of the people-the consumers. They do not pause to consider that an increase in the price of' tobacco is a very serious matter to the. working man, who is called upon to pay the cost of this increased measure of protection. Under the circumstances, can we wonder that the workers are beginning to complain? Surely we should recognise that they have rights which ought to be conserved, although the Labour Party do not seem to think so. By compelling the consumers to pay high prices for their to. bacco, the Government will force them to use inferior brands. f riends are so anxious to exclude Virginian tobacco from the Australian market, why do they not set a good example by refusing to smoke other than Australian leaf ? ' In stead of. smoking the best brands of cigars, I suggest that they should smoke only Australian cigars,"" and that any failure to do so should involve them in a heavy penalty. Although they might not enjoy their smoke so well under such circumstances, they would at least have the consolation of knowing that, by their action, they were assisting an 'Australian industry. With regard to the cultivation of tobacco in Australia, I am credibly informed that there is no hope whatever of the manufacturers obtaining a sufficient supply of the local leaf to meet the requirements of our home market. posed they will be able to get a sufficient supply of Australian leaf within a few years. of tobacco is seriously affected by climatic conditions, such as droughts, blue mould, and frosts.

Frosts, droughts, and blue mould are constantly interfering with it to such an extent that only one good crop out of three can be expected."" Hence the average quantity produced per year is comparatively small in spite of the late protection of about 250 per cent. the production of cigar leaf show that its cultivation will be a success in the northern part of Queensland. I trust that we shall be able to improve the quality of the leaf, and to become large exporters. It must always be remembered that it does not follow that, because free traders oppose the imposition of high duties, they are opposed to the establishment of Australian industries. No more erroneous impression could possibly get abroad. But we do say that there is a limit to the price which ought to be paid for the encouragement of local manufacture After all, the question of successful local manufacture depends upon the market that is available, and that in its turn depends upon population. Until we are able to attract a much greater population to our shores it is idle for us to expect _ to become a very large exporting community, seeing that we should then have to compete in the world's markets at prices If these duties are imgovernedby the world's competition.

I do not think that that is so. When we come to examine the question we find that it is to the interests of the local manufacturers to use Australian leaf in preference to imported leaf, because upon every pound of Australian leaf they effect a saving of is. 6d. in the rate of duty charged. Surely their commercial instinct is not entirely dead. Upon the face of it, the statement of the honourable member for Perth appears to be absolutely untenable. Upon the question of stemmed and unstemmed leaf, I do not pose as an authority, but I am informed that it is better to stem the leaf before it is imported, because the process of stemming before packing improves the quality of the leaf. That is to say, it is better to do the stemming while the tobacco leaf is fresh and green. general rule. always imported in an unstemmed state. who claim that the tobacco is very much improved in quality and flavour' if the stemming be undertaken when the leaf is freshly gathered. ber will make inquiries he will find that the most expensive tobaccoes are imported in an unstemmed condition. have already made, that does not appear to be the case. I wish now to quote from a letter which I have received upon the subject from the Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, in which it is statedManufacturers lay vital stress upon the necessity there is for them to have access to American leaf, for without it the Colonial leaf would die a natural death, and all the advance made in its cultivation be thrown away. By the access to American leaf manufacturers are able 1 to blend in with the Colonial leaf and supply tobaccoes of middle price, varying from a net price of 2s. 6d. to'4S. fid. This, while allowing us to work in the Colonial leaf, permits us to supplv a good medium smoke at low prices. Returning to the question of stemming, I am informed that if tobacco is packed unstemmed, it has to undergo several operations and processes, including re-handling, re-moistening and re-packing, which means a reduction in weight and a material addition to the cost. Then, if the leaf be sent unstemmed^ there has to be added tbe cost of stemming, extra freight on the weight of the stems, and greater expense of handling;. so that I do not see any great advantage in the differential rate. We have been told, of course, that the stemming of the tobacco will give employment to something, like 600 additional hands; but that is pureoonjecture, no substantial basis on which any such calculation could be made, having been placed before us. As to the control, of cigar-making machines, it may be that theCombine have possession of certain classes of machines, I do not know. Buti f that be so, why are the provisions of the Commerce Act or the Australian Industries Preservation Act not put into operation, on the ground that such control is in restraint of trade? Under such circumstances as those suggested, the law may be invoked; and I should like to know; if the .Ministry have any, knowledge on the point, why it has not been set in motion. If the law is inoperative, the fact only shows how much time we have wasted in enacting the measures I have not so, as a mentioned. will have an opportunity soon to help us in. that matter, by assisting us to get the eviBence we require. for the statements which have been made as to the Combine controlling machines? given by one man who was"" refused a machine.

It would have been far better to leave the old Tariff as it was. The effect of the proposed increases has been to dislocate, and, in some respects, almost paralyze the tobacco trade. have not only greatly increased the cost of tobacco to the consumer, but have seriously prejudiced a number of operatives engaged in the industry. I do not know what the effect on the revenue has been, but it is quite possible' that it is very serious. . In any case, the proposals have brought about quite an unnecessary and indefensible disturbance of trade. I gave notice of an amendment on the same lines as that proposed by the honourable member for Angas, but, as he has forestalled me, I can only There may be a kind of arrangecome to his support. I do not intend to detain the Committee at any length, because I think that short speeches, which' have been my aim during the session, will greatly assist us in speedily disposing of the Tariff. The honourable member for Angas has made a. mistake similar to that made by the honourable member for Langi n reference to the question of stripping. So far as I understand, importers of tobacco desire to import it in as dry a state as possible, so that they may introduce the largest quantity on payment of a certain amount of duty. Tobacco, I believe, keeps better when it is unstemmed, and when it is desired to stem it , it is moistened with water. At any rate, the very finest kinds of leaf used for cigars are always imported unstemmed. The honourable member for W ill the honourable Lang complains that we on this side do not pay attention to the criticism of the Opposition, and ' I may say that, while I have a certain amount of diluted respect for the Opposition corner, I have much more respect for the I sympathize with straight-out.

Spencer Brothers, of Madras, from whom I obtained my information, supplv cigars of good quality, and after hearing thefigureswhich I have given, honourable members will not be surprised to learn that cigars are so cheap in India that in an hotel, when a man asks for a -cigar instead of a drink, he is not charged for it. No doubt the encouragement of the hand-made cigar industry will give employment to a large number of men. I am told that there are legal' gentlemen in this House whose services are in demand by the StandardOil Company, which I believe is connected with the Harvester Trust, and perhaps, indirectly, with the Tobacco Combine, and we may have to face oppo-sition. Buti f more of the cigars smoked in Australia were made by hand here, there would be a larger circulation of money in the country. Most of the profits of the Tobacco Combine are spent out of Australia, but a man earning £ 2 a week here would have spent 39s. of it by the Tuesday following the Saturday on which he was paid. Thus it is that when people are earning money in a country it is being constantly circulated-there, which is a healthy state of affairs. Although there are nof now in Melbourne as many tobacco twisters as were here at one time, if a preference were given to hand-made tobacco, those who remain would teach their trade to others, though it is by no means an easy one to learn. With regard to cigarettes, I find that three-fourths of those consumed in Australia are made by the Tobacco Combine with machinery, and that upwards of eighty hands are employed in the operation, while Messrs. Sniders and Abrahams employ between 600 and 700 persons in making the remaining one-fourth by hand. If the Tobacco Combine made nothing but hand-made cigarettes, it would have to employ from 1,800 to 2,000 operatives. arguing in favour of the abolition of machinery ? industry were nationalized, I would say, by all means employ machinery, just as we employ machinery at our railway workshops at Newport. cannot be made by machinery. made by hand. An American will pay a [148] dollar for a good cigar, and if he likes a green cigar will see it rolled in the shop. When I went through the splendid factories in Manila, I found that the finest cigars were being made by hand by the best makers. I prefer hand-made to machine-made cigarettes; but to compete against the Combine nine hand-made cigarettes have to be sold for the price of ten machine-made cigarettes, although the cost of production is very much greater. I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to make a differentiation in favour of hand-made cigarettes. The feeling that we should nationalize the tobacco industryhas been intensified by the recent action of the Combine. France derives from her national monopoly in .tobacco -a larger revenue than the whole of Australia yields. In one year she has obtained from it as much as £14,900,000. operatives ? paid when the industry was a private enterprise. The wages received by the operatives there are not all that they could wish, but when the people of France desire them to be better paid they have only to indicate that desire to Parliament. made in, France? ber for Corangamite, as a medical man, knows very well that the choice of tobacco is largely a question of flavour, to which the palate becomes accustomed. Twenty-five years ago I learned to like the flavour of French tobacco, and recently, on the occasion of a visit to the South Sea Islands, I found that my taste for it had not been lost. In Holborn, London, there is a shop devoted to the sale of French 'tobacco to meet the demand of English art students, who. while in France, have learned to prefer it. How many brands of inferior tobacco have been placed on the Melbourne market within the last twenty-five years? ShouldI not be right in saying that during the last quarter nf a century something like fifty brands have been placed on the market, only to quickly, disappear? . That being so, why should the honourable member for Corangamite hurl at me the taunt that French tobacco is inferior ?

If it is possible to produce over 2,000,000 lbs., we could, no doubt, produce 20,000,000 lbs. if neces-' sary. Chinamen. not be here very long to grow it . The tobacco I have seen produced by Chinamen in New South Wales and Victoria is very inferior, and almost unsaleable, owing to the fact that they do not know how to cure it. Much experiment is required in regard to the production of tobacco. We know that in the United States seeds obtained from Cuba, Havana, and Virginia, ! and planted in various districts, produce a leaf quite different from that which results in the centres of origin. I hope the time will soon arrive when there will be established in Australia an Agricultural Bureau, with well-paid, first-class chemists attached; and when that time does arrive, we shall find that what can be done in America can be done here.. The honourable member for Lang stated that last year there were manufactured in Australia 7,800,000 lbs., of tobacco, while 1,500,000 lbs. were imported. What is there to prevent our manufacturing the whole? The less we import under present conditions, the more chance will be given to a number of small manufacturers throughout the Commonwealth to make a livelihood. I do not think it necessary to discuss this item at any length. There seems very little desire on the part of honourable members opposite to discuss the question; and I take it for. granted that they are convinced of the reasonableness of the proposals of the Government, or, at any rate, that they do not propose to offer any factious op-position. in the future, we have been shown Aery clearly the advisability of extending a small preference in favour of hand-made tobacco, and a larger preference in favcur of hand-made cigars. Only the best leaf is used by the hand worker; and such a preference is in the interests of the Undoubtedly. smoking public. If it be true that a quarter of the cigarettes consumed are hand made at present, I feel sure honourable members will not exclude those engaged in this In 1901-2, there were branch of the industry from the benefits of the proposal before us, whatever the profits of the industry may be; because it is a great gain to the Commonwealth to afford this employment. While I feel sure that the honourable member for Angas is sincere in the proposal he has made, the Government proposal is, in my opinion, better. It is grown mostly by hope that in our future transactions in connection with the Tariff the Government will be a little more considerate of the Committee than they have been to-day in the consideration of these important items. The least the Government can do when they propose to depart from the proposals which have been before us so long is to give us the earliest possible notice of what they really intend to submit, especially in connection with items which have so many ramifications as those under the head of tobacco. printed copies of the proposals ought to have been distributed. copies of the proposals to have been in the hands of honourable members, but earlier notice should have been given of the intention, to submit them.' I do not desire to indulge in any captious criticism, but honourable members look to the Government to help them as f a i as possible by giving the earliest information of any intended changes. With respect to these particular items, I cannot profess to have any personal knowledge. I look on the tobacco duties as a very important source of revenue; and, therefore, I regard with a lenient eye the smoking habits of the Australian community.

The new Tariff proposals do not contain any startling change of policy.

But it is most disappointing that, during the past twentv years, tobacco growing has had such a chequeredexperience.

Thesefigures -seem to support the conclusion of the hon'-orable member for Lang that the crop is -of the most precarious kind. prices which were being paid. the States, the duties have favoured the use -of colonial leaf, being equivalent to more than 100 per cent, on its market value.

Honourable members are prepared to die on the floor of this chamber voting for duties for the protection of the growers of tobacco leaf, but they are not prepared to smoke a pipe of colonial tobacco. It is a source of regret to me that my protectionist friends, who are prepared to make such enormous sacrifices in the imposition of duties on behalf of Australian industries, will not make the personal sacrifice involved in smoking colonial tobacco and drinking colonial beer. The self-denyinfs protectionists of Australia have only i o make a solemn league and covenant, for the sake of our national industries, to drink nothingbut colonial beer-the y can get a large quantity at a very reasonable rate -and smoke nothing but colonial tobacco",45,Chapman Th E Growers From Imported Leaf And Observe The Differ

I suppose that they shrink from doing so because of their horror of the curse of cheapness, colonial beer and colonial tobacco being too cheap for them. The present Tariff law fixed the duty on imported tobacco at 3s. 3d., and the original Tariff proposal of the Government-becaus e what we are discussing is not a Tariff Sir WILLIAM LYNE ing collected. honourable gentleman would lay his hands on anything he could get. It is a mercy that he is not collecting twice as much as he proposes to levy. The first Government Tariff proposal was to increase the import duty by 3d. per lb. In my opinion, a duty of 3s. 3d. per lb. is heavy enough, because it is equal to much more than 50 per cent, on the value of the imported tobacco upon which it is levied. I see no reason for increasing it. Then, under the present Tariff law, the duty on imported leaf, whether stemmed or unstemmed, is is. 6d., but in its Tariff proposals the Government first made a difference of 3d. per lb. in favour of the unstemmed leaf, and now put forward a difference of 6d. per l b . ; which, it seems to me, is going too far, being altogether out of proportion to the difference between the costs of manufacturing stemmed and unstemmed tobacco leaf. As for the Excise, the present Tariff law imposed a duty of is., which the Government Tariff proposals increased first to is. 3d., but now bring back to is. Ministers now propose an increase of 3d. in the duty, and a decrease of 3d. in the Excise. In my opinion, that is not sound finance. The difference between is. Excise and 3s. 3d. import duty is quite sufficient for the encouragement of local manufacture; there is no need to increase the difference to 2s. 6d. There is no warrant for the difference. It is not in the interest of the revenue, and it is not in the legitimate interest of the colonial leaf. We must remember that the colonial leaf is sold at about 6d. per lb.

I suppose that colonial leaf is sold unstemmed, so that the basis I am taking isa fair one. The colonial leaf, as I have said, commands, not always, but someT h e duties are betimes, a price of 6d. per lb., whilst under these proposals the imported unstemmed' leaf will be subject to a duty of is. 6d. Of course they are. The per lb. There will thus be a protection c f 300 per cent, on the total value of the colonial leaf as sold in the Australian markets to-day. Surely that is all that can be honestly wanted in the interests of the tobacco-grower. The fact is, however, that under cover of these duties a lot of other people are running after the publicmoney. No producer of Australian leaf wants a duty in excess of 300 per cent. If we put a duty of 5s. per lb. upon imported leaf we should not long increase the value of the colonial leaf, since there would be in no time an enormous increasein production. Surely the difference existing under the present law, which I understand the honourable member for Angas wishes to retain, is a legitimate one. There has been no strong appeal that I know of to alter that aspect of the Tariff. The Government proposals have created a: number of demands for consideration;. they haw given rise to a feeling of unrest. There are in connection with the trade grievances of which we have heard a great deal, and which I hope some day will be thoroughly investigated by someimpartial authority; but there was nofeeling of unrest or dissatisfaction until the present Tariff was submitted. I feeF .that under these circumstances it would be well to leave the duties as they were, so far as' the manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco and the Excise upon them are concerned comparison, did the right honourable member consider the Excise on the colonial 1 tobacco ?

I look upon a combine of capital as being prima facie just as honest and as. respectable as is a combine of labour. The man who can see all sorts of wickedness in the act of ten business men uniting is not the man who looks upon unionism as one of the remedies for industrial evils. combine is embodied in every trade union, and it is absurd for those who believe in trade unionism to think it an object of wickedness when other people adopt it . But I say as to all combines, labour or capital, that the State should secure strength enough to deal with them whenever they abuse their powers. Any man who is not prepared to throw the searchlight of the Government on any industrial body, whether of workers or of capitalists, who are abusing their power or exercising it in any way prejudicial to the community, is oblivious of what the future has in store for us. Notwithstanding the view of some who represent me, .since I am a free trader, as believing, without regard to consequences, in the dry principles of political economy, I . think out expedient of Socialism, the law of human progress will inevitably bring the power of government more and more in touch with all evils, abuses, and wrongs, from whatever quarter they come. Combines that do wrong will have to be dealt with just as the individual wrong-doer is dealt with in our courts of law. which every one ought to cheerfully recognise. But, just as-in our courts of law we do not prejudge a man who is brought up for trial-w e do not find him guilty before a jurv has tried him-so we must extend similar treatment to combines.

They ought to be applied to every investigation and every exercise of 'the If the devil himseif supExecutive power.

What interest has a main in crushing one who can provide him with an article three times as cheap as that which he"" has to import ?

I called their attention to this fact, and that I thought they had discriminated against a certain community. They came up again, and bought about twenty tons more; but they stated that they did not know what they would do with the tobacco, as they had more on hand than they could use. Manifestly the leaf, which the manufacturers had in hand, was not the Australian article. there has been a considerable increase in the importation of imported unmanufactured leaf, and a decrease in the use of Australian leaf. at the importations of unmanufactured leaf to realize that a great proportion goes into consumption, combined with Australian leaf, as the honourable member for East Sydney has indicated. the fact of the unpopularity of the Australian leaf. ber accentuates a point that was obvious to the Tariff Commission, though I think it is not obvious to honourable members. appeared to the Commission that the whole difficulty in regard to the production of Australian leaf and the development of that important industry is due to the differentiation that has nearly always existed between the imported unmanufactured leaf and manufactured tobacco. turer imports unmanufactured leaf, and there is what appears to amount to a disability as against the local article. the manufacturer introduces into every 10 lbs. of that unmanufactured leaf somewhere about 2 lbs. of other materials, in the shape of glycerine, liquorice, and so forth, and then he adds, we will say, 15 per cent, of Australian leaf. circumstances, we know that the manufacturer makes profits sufficiently substantial to satisfy any reasonable person.

As protectionists we felt that in many cases duties in excess of those recommended by the Commission were desirable, .and we had no hesitation in asking Parliament to adopt our proposals. Where there was grave reason for doubt as to some of the recommendations of the Commission we simply placed them before the Parliament) and in the case of the tobacco duties we have submitted to-night an amended proposal. I admit that there is a great deal of force'in the observation of the leader of the Opposition, that the Committee would have been in a better position to deal with the question had we been able this afternoon to circulate printed copies of the new proposals. I would point out, however, that great difficulty was experienced in arriving"" at a conclusion as to the best course to adopt with regard to these items. Many days were devoted to the work of preparing a scheme which would operate fairly to the grower, the manufacturer, the employer, the employee, and the revenue. I think it is desirable to compare the amendment moved' by the honourable member for Angas with, the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission.

Sydney) [10.15] -It was an amendment of my own, which resulted' in the margin which existed under the old Tariff between the duty levied upon the imported as against the Iccally-manufactured article. I had some reason, therefore, to speak in support of the proposal of the Honourable member for Angas upon that ground. But, rather than occupy the time of the Committee, I had decided to remain silent. Trade and Customs observes indications of that kind amongst members of the Committee, he should be careful to avoid arousing fresh debate. Apparently, the honourable gentleman has not understood his own proposal. In the first place, he impressed upon the Committee the necessity for standing by the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. which its members had devoted to the matter, and asked whether it was not better to stand by their recommendation than risk an experiment by departing from it. He seems to forget that the Government brought forward a proposal which embodied Tariff Commission majority, and that they are now proposing to depart from it. It seems to'me that this Committee desires to encourage the formation of a combine. Some honourable members admit that amargin of 6d. per lb. would be ample to enable the large houses operating in tobacco to make substantial profits. But they affirm that if that margin were adopted, we should close up the small manufacturers. In other words, the small factories are to be kept open by a combination of prices between the small men 1>49] and the large men. That is what exists to-day. In order to keep the small men If the going, honourable members ask for a difference of gd. per lb. in favour of the local producer, and for nothing less. Thus the action of this Committee is in the direction of the margin would strengthen the Combine. bination is necessary to maintain the small men. overlooks the fact that the large Combine has.also a monopoly of importations. admit that. ber know that in free-trade England the margin is is. per lb? satisfied that it is.

I favour the proposal of the honourable When the Minister of member for Angas, because I consider that the present import duty is a sufficient tax upon the consumer of tobacco. I am not in favour of piling up taxes to the extraordinary degree that is proposed in this Tariff. I further favour the amendment because it will not disturb the trade. lessly disturbed at present. turbed by these Tariff proposals. Buti t will have to be'further disturbed when we depart from the old rates. Tobacconists are in the habit of selling plug tobacco for an even coin, and any alteration in the old rates of duty will necessitate the introthe recommendation of the duction of new machinery and the adoption of a different sized plug by importers or manufacturers. ThenI am opposed to differentiating between stemmed and unstemmed tobacco. According to the statement of the Minister, in order to make the distinction proposed, the people of Australia will be called upon to pay taxation to ' the extent of £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 annually. Eveni f that differentiation did result in the employment of 700 additional hands, which I very much doubt, the amount indicated would be more than sufficient to pay their wages.",55,Honourable Member Then The Under The Excise Conditions Laid Down By

Upon the assumption that it costs only 3d. per lb., the differentiation between stemmed and unstemmed tobacco would mean a loss to the consumers of £90,000 annually. The Minister has stated that the proposal of the honourable member for Angas would show a smaller difference in favour of Australian leaf than that of the Minister's own proposal. I say that it would be exactly the same difference, because the duty would be is. 6d. per lb. on the imported unstemmed leaf in each'case. That is a very high measure of protection. It is ridiculous to assert that any sensible maker would not use as much local leaf as he could, when by so doing he would not be called upon to pay is. 6d. per lb."" by way of duty. An immense proportion of the profits of the Combine must be made out of the difference between the cost of the Australian leaf which they use and the cost with duty of imported leaf. It is idle to say that the Combine does not use Australian leaf for fear of losing its monopoly.

Comorable member himself has' given the reason. He stated that some of the applicants who desired the Combine to purchase their tobacco were informed that the Combine had so many more tons in stock than it could use. loaded up with Australian or with imported leaf? Australian leaf I should say. I have some personal knowledge of this matter. Years ago, a firm with which I was connected in New South Wales, was applied to by some tobacco growers to dispose of a quantity of their leaf. The highest price offered was about 4d. per lb., and' this the growers declined to accept; and then, though my firm was not in the tobacco trade, we offered, as the growers were friends, to advance money on the leaf, and allow them to test its value in the British market. When a sample was sent Home, however, the highest price obtainable was 2^d. per lb., and the experts there said that the leaf was of inferior quality and badly cured. A similar experiment was tried by the New South Wales Government a few years ago, and on that occasion it was foiinu that the price of the leaf in the English market was lower than in New South Wales. have referred was of good quality. know anything of that tobacco; I am speaking only of the folly it would be on the part of any business men to refuse a good article produced locally, when they could obtain it without the necessity of paying a duty of is.'6d. per lb. I hope, I believe, that good tobacco will eventually be grown in Australia. As yet, however, we do not know sufficient of the capabilities of our soils and climate in this respect, and there must be experiments. : very^ good tobacco is grown at a place called Texas, in Queensland. heard that that is so, but I do not know of my. own knowledge. made profitable only by manufacturing the leaf here, and not sending it to America. mon-sense tells us that the reason that tobacco leaf grown in Australia has not secured greater use, is that the manufacturers cannot, with satisfaction to their customers, use more than a certain proportion. It would have been infinitely wiser on the part of the Government to adopt the old Tariff. But the Government, after accepting the Tariff Commission's report, introduce a new system, which gives practically the same margin as the old duties, Which are those proposed by the honourable member for Angas, and yet they make a departure from the old duties, and give rise to much consequent disturbance of trade and manufacture. posedThat the Chairman report progress and ask leave to sit again.",56,Thomson Whe N The Tion Of Creating A Combine
