37,Mr Reid,"It will not affect the basisDebate resumed from 12th March (vide That this B ill be now read a second time. There are two very important proposals in this B ill to which I desire to invite the .attention of the House. I do not propose to revert to the multitude of vexed and -heated controversies which the discussion -of the principal Act provoked when it was -under consideration in this Chamber. merely desire to say that I have always"" .agreed with the main principle underlying .any legislation which would, in the early history of the Commonwealth, provide machinery for preventing the growth of any -combination of persons engaged in trade to injure the public interests. is a view which I think is common to all parties in this House. In the Act which we passed last year there are some provisions contained in the sections relating to dumping, about which I am not quite so clear, but I think that honourable members on all sides of the House are in> sympathy with the main principle underlying that portion of the Statute which -deals with trusts and combinations. It is infinitely better that in the early stages of the Commonwealth we should place some measure of the kind upon the statute-book than that we should wait until abuses have -become more obvious. Having said that, I now desire to draw the attention of the House to a matter of grave importance. I hope that I may engage the attention of honourable members for a few minutes whilst I address myself to a question of some consequence. I presume that there are occasions upon which we may subdue the mania for holding private conversations, and this I conceive to be one of them. serious questions relating to the way in which justice is to be administered is involved in this B ill . I desire to explain to the House what I mean by that statement, if honourable members will give me their attention. The principal Act, somehow or other, is now considered to be very seriously defective. passed it was generally thought it would prove an efficient Act. Of course, everybody admits the difficulty of dealing with such matters as are involved in that mea-sure. No matter how wise any Government or parliamentary draftsman may be, it would be unreasonable to expect that an Act of that kind would not be in some degree imperfect. But it would haye been interesting to the Housei f the Attorney General, in moving the second reading of this B ill , had more clearly indicated what, in his view, was the necessity for certain of its provisions. Some of its provisions are absolutely necessary, and I am rather surprised that the legislation of Canada upon this subject years ago was not in the view of the Government when the principal Act was before Parliament. Of course, there I is a great difference between the powers of the Federal Government in Canada ancl our powers, because the Canadian Government is vested with general powers under its Constitution. It has all the powers which the States have not expressly reserved to' them, whereas our position is That exactly the opposite. This Parliament possesses only the powers which the States bave conferred upon it. Consequently, the sphere for the exercise of legislative power in Canada is much larger than it is here. In section 18 of chapter 6 of an Act which was passed by the Canadian Parliament in 1897, the Legislature sought to put down the evils of combinations in a certain direction-that of unfairly enhancing the price of goods to the consurner. I admit that the most obvious power which should have been conferred' by the Act which we passed last year, was one to compel the production of books. In section 18 of the Canadian Act, that power is conferred. Under that Act the charge laid against any combination is at once referred to a Judge. It is rather surprising, therefore, that in view of Canadian legislation, our. principal Act did not compel the production of books. culty in inducing the House to pass the principal Act in its present form. the production of books was never made. I have not recently referred to the original provisions of the B ill , but my recollection is that it contained no power to compel the production of books. was most difficult to get the measure passed At the time it was even in its modified form. member will see that that fact has nothing to do with what I am saying. I merely say that the power to which I have referred was not contained in the B ill as originally, introduced.",15,Surplus Revenuebill

43,Mr Reid,"But I hope the honorableby the Government to grant that power, we must not be reproached because we did not grant it. So far as the power to compel the production of books is concerned, I do not oppose it . No legislation can be effective unless it contains such a power. If this legislation is to -be effective, we must grant powers to the Government, many of which are rather out of the beaten track. AlthoughI am as slow as are most people to unduly enlarge any power affecting the liberty of the subject, there are occasions when to some extent we must depart fron'i the beaten track. But in Canada, the effect of the inquiry which was instituted upon the production of books by any combination, was not to punish anybody. Where a combination is found to exist-whethe r it is an internal or an external combination is quite immaterial, because the provision applies to both-whos e operations tend to enhance the price of goods to the public, the Governor in Council has power to reduce the duties upon, the articles in question. This afforded the consumer some protection against the rings which were operated under cover of the Tariff. Honourable members will readily recognise that in any country a ring can work more easily behind a fence than it can if there be no fence at all. It is a. convenience to a ring inside a country to have a fence to shut out competition. would also hit a. man who was not a member of the combination. of this particular provision was that it did not hit the public. Perhaps it .did not provide a very effectual cure for the evil, but that was the method of bringing it about. closed by the books would be regarded as confidential ? Bill under consideration. I merely say that the necessity for the power to compel the production of books is inherent in legislation of this kind, and it is a pity that the fact was not recognised when the principal Act was under review. That statement means that I do not oppose the inclusion of this power in this B ill . Seeing that it is not contained in the principal Act, we ought certainly to allow of its insertion in this measure. Attorney-General is not present because I wanted to ask a question which, with I admit that. the exception of the Prime Minister, he alone can answer. It is a question of law. In this Bill a provision is incorporated from the Customs Act of 1901 ancl the Excise Act of the same year, and this is a very important matter, to whicb I desire to direct, attention. It is spe-ciallv important, in the light of a. decision which has been given by the Full Court of New South Wales. Section 255 of the Customs Act readsIn every Customs prosecution the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary, but so that(a) When an intent to defraud the revenue is charged, the averment shall not be deemed sufficient to prove the intent, and (*) In all proceedings for an indictable offence, or for an offence directly punishable by imprisonment, the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence. I am labouring under a great inconvenience owing to the absence of the Attorney General, because I desire to ask him a very important question of law. Sir William LYNE He is engaged in the High Court. is quite a. sufficient reason for his absence. Sir John FORREST -The Minister of Trade and Customs will answer the right honourable member's question. scarcely competent to give me the desired information. one can be quite sure that a lawyer is right is when he is the final court of appeal.

That clause T h a t is provided for in the incorporates the sections in question in exactly the' same words. Sir John FORREST -Not in the same words as the right honourable member read just now. section erroneously.

53,Mr Reid,Yes. The only time when,17,Australian Industries Preservati On Bill
54,Mr Reid,"Then I must have read thetheir meaningHonorable members will probably consider that the wordsThe averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary mean that if a person accused is unable to produce evidence which disproves the accusation against him, he shall be deemed to be guilty. This is the way in which a layman would read them. Of course, everything depends upon the meaning that is attached to those words. I cannot illustrate my point better than by inviting the attention of honourable members to a decision of the Full Court of New South Wales upon the meaning of these, very words in the case of ex parte Healy, reported in the New South Wales Law Reports of 1903. Under the Excise Act an information was laid charging a. person with keeping an illicit stiTT; and the magistrate had to construe the provision, which, speaking roughly, is that the words of the information shall be deemed to prove the offence in the absence of evidence disproving it. Evidence was given on behalf of the Commonwealth in support of the charge, and the person charged gave evidence in reply. The magistrate, having heard both sides, was in doubt whether the man was really guilty; but he held that the words of the .statute compelled him to find the man guilty. The words areIn every . . . . the avermentsThat is the allegation. . . . contained in the information . . . . shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. That is, on the words alleging that the man kept an illicit still, he must be deemed to have kept it unless he could produce proof to the contrary. very fine in his feelings. He said he was doubtful, but that in view of the positive language of the section, he must convict the defendant. ber propose in this, or any other Bill that we ever pass, to provide that a man should be found guilty and punished, when the person who is trying him has a doubt as to his guilt? I am sure that is not the intention of the honourable member. doubt he should have given a verdict in favour of the accused. I desire to make. Laymen, I think, will be glad to know that, in spite of the view of the magistrate, the Full Court took exactly the view of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and others. The Court held that it would be monstrous and contrary to the principle of. the administration of justice, at any rate, in British communities, that a magistrate should convict a man if it was not proved to his satisfaction that the man was guilty. But the Full Court had some difficulty in arriving at its conclusion, because these are words which another Court might construe in a different way. I desire those words to be so placed in the Bill that the intention of Parliament shall be perfectly plain-that is my only object in addressing honourable members-that the real object of such a provision is to make the information primd facie evidence. Those who have any experience of legal matters know that sometimes charges collapse on some technical points, without any evidence being given. Very often, when a charge is made, the lawyer appearing for the person charged, asks the magistrate whether there is really anything to answer; and the case is disposed of without the merits being gone into. The real object, I submit, of the words is that the statements in the information should put the inatter before a magistrate, so that evidence must be gone into before the case can be disposed of, and that.when the eviprosecution for an offence dence is gone into, the charge must be disposed of on its merits. I may not be here when this Bill is considered in Committee, and, therefore, I am taking advantage of the present opportunity to lay these views before the House. keeping an illicit still, do those words mean that he would be held to be guilty unless he could bring evidence to disprove the charge ? sion is repealed, the better. absolutely right. The information is read out in Court, and the allegation that the man has kept an illicit still is deemed to be proof-no t evidence, but proof-that he has committed the offence, in the ab-' sence of the accused producing evidence to disprove the charge. ceed without offering any evidence?",17,Australian Industries Preservati On Bill

The question of intent is dealt with in this particular clause, though it was not in the Customs or Excise Acts. Admitting all that, just let us look at what is held to be proved. If honourable members will turn to section 4 of the Principal Act, they will find it as follows :Any person who, either as principal or asagent, makes or enters into any contract, or isor continues lo be a member of or engages in any combination, in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the States{a) with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public; or, (Â£) with intent to destroy or injure, by means of unfair competition, any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers. I am endeavouring to show now what is taken to be proved outside intent. First, it is taken to be proved that the person charged has entered into such a combination, and if he cannot disprove that he isconvicted as to that part. could the object be attained? am only anxious to show what the section really means. Then, according to subsection b it must be held, in the absence of. proof'to the contrary, that the person acdone in the cused has been guilty of unfair competition, that there is an Australian industry the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and conBut the words I sumers-al l this has to be taken as proved",18,Australian Industries Preservati On Bill

All these matters, I think, should be proved just in the same way as intent is proved. The intent and the act itself are so mixed up that it is -very difficult to separate them, and I am very glad the honourable member for Macquarie interjected as he did, because it is very important that the point he raised should be considered. the Customs and Excise Acts there is not even the protection afforded as to intent; because, in the case of an illicit still, the keeping of it includes the intent. Of course, the mere possession of an illicit still is, in itself, evidence of intent. But everything else in the information is to be taken as proved by the mere statement of the Comptroller-General, and the onus of rebuttal is put on the person accused. Eveni f that provision is adopted, it should be made clear that, when the accused has gone into evidence, and the Justice of the High Court who is to try the case is in doubt of his guilt, he is not to be convicted. saying. the case to which I have referred, the Full Court looked upon the contrary as such a monstrous provision that they construed the words, ""shall be deemed to be proved"" to mean ""shall be evidence."" pretty good stretch of construction, and I do not know that any other Court would take the same view.

118,Mr Reid,"The Constitution emproved necessary to do so in the public interest. I suggest that this novel method of criminal justice should be reserved until it is proved to be necessary. Let the accused be compelled, under very heavy penalties, to tell the Court everything. In all countries there are special Acts which go very f a r ; but I do not think'that in any British country an accused is compelled to go before his prosecutor, and put everything before him before being tried. We have not got to that yet. I have never heard of a man being compelled to enter the Attorney General's office to be raked fore and a f t , in order that the Attorney-General may bring a charge against him and produce, at the hearing of the charge, the evidence so obtained. viously had combinations so intangible as some of those which now exist. necessity. As a rule, we ought not to compel a man to incriminate himself before a Judge. compel a man to prove his own guilt by means of his own confession before a Judge; but it may be absolutely necessary to do so. Do not honourable members think that it is quite good enough for a start, in this instance, to provide for such a procedure? Are we to say that a man shall be taken to the Crown Prosecutor's office, and there compelled to produce the whole of his books, and to submit to be cross examined on oath in order that everything he says may be used against him. Sir John FORREST -It cannot be used. fence against this Act. That is the very purpose for which it is to be used. criminal proceeding. ask the House to consider whether it is not, for a start, a great stretch to compel a man to incriminate himself before a Judge, and that it is going too far to compel him in addition to enter the Crown Prosecutor's room before he is tried in order to supply the material on which he shall be tried. There are a number of other points in the Bill which, I think, will give rise to a great deal of trouble, but I am thoroughly in favour of its main object. I hope honourable members, in carrying out what may be great reforms, will be slow, in the absence of some absolutely proved necessity, to push too far changes in respect of the rules of natural justice between the accused and the .Court. If it came about by-and-by that this law would absolutely break down if power were not given to put a man into the Crown Prosecutor'sroom before the case against him began, the House could reconsider the matter, and,, if it thought fit, go to the f u l l exrre.ne. But I hope that the Labour Party will never associate itself with a proposal to sav toa man, "" You are to go to the prosecutor before you are tried, and disclose your offence, so that we may use against voir every word that you utter."" I hope that, the Labour Party will not associate its name with that system of administering justice until it has been proved absolutely necessary.

'WeI am yielding to that must not be too strongly influenced by our desire to carry out a certain policy; let us try to carry out our views on questions of It is an extraordinary thing to policy without disregarding any natural rights of justice.

They, like the members of the Labour Party and the Government, say that they do not believe in trusts, and desire to take all proper steps to prevent them from injuring the people; but when proposals are made which would have the effect of regulating them, they make all sorts of excuses for voting against them. I am not sure that, even from their own stand-point, that attitude is wise. Mr Secretary Taft,. who, we are told, is likely to be the next President of the United States of America, has stated that if the Republican Partyfails to successfully regulate trusts, the government of that country will, in hisopinion, be handed over to the Socialists. member subscribe to all that Mr TaftI have always been favorable says ? honourable' member says, although occasionally I hear pearls of wisdom from his lips. I referred to the matter merely to show that an opponent of Socialism recognises that must sweep away the evils of which the Socialists complain. I do. not think that' legislation such as we are considering will be completely successful. It may be possible to destroy, or, at any rate, to cripple, trusts which are unwise enough to allow their agreements to become public; but in the United States of America many of the trade combinations most opposed to the Trust-have , sinceadverse decisions were given by tbe Courts, continued their nefarious practices without a written agreement, under an arrangement termed euphemistically a ""gentlemen's agreement."" That shows that, even with the most rigorous laws that can be drafted, it will be exlation of combinations opposed to the public interest. We have other concerns but are not trusts or combines. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is neither a combine nor a trust, but it is a monopoly. a collective institution ! features of Socialism which conduce to economy of production and distribution, but it keeps all the profits, instead of dividing them with the community. same exhibition of human nature under the honourable member's scheme. in the ability of civilization to find a remedy for these abuses, but I have not a cut-anddried scheme. A very important step forward will be made when the State takes over monopolies of all descriptions, and manages them in the interests of the public.",26,Australian Industries Preservati On Bill

191,Mr Watson,"I have a sincere belietas it already manages a number of concerns. In my opinion, the leader of the Opposition was, during the greater part of his speech, merely beating the air, and devoted a considerable part of his argument to the discovery of a mare's nest. His first contention was that it would be improper to provide that the. averments of the prosecutor shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. But he had to admit that, even from his stand-point, paragraphs a and b of clause 4 modify the position very considerably. He said that paragraph a removed his objection in regard to intent, although he declared that matters of fact could be deemed proved. I , as a layman, reluctantly place my views against his legal knowledge, but, having carefully looked through the principal Act, I am of opinion that every offence of importance provided for there rests upon the basis of intent. Section4 readsAny person who, either as principal or as agent, makes or enters into any contract, or is or continues to be a member of or engages in any combination, in relation to trade or commerce' with other countries or among the States(a) with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public; or (*) with intent to destroy or injure by_ means of unfair competition any Australian industry. There the intent is the basis of the indictment, and the provision in paragraph a of clause 4 covering intent really removes the objection raised by the right honourable member for East Sydney. Section4 declares that intent must be proved in each instance, and so do sections 5, 7, and 8. Therefore, the criticism of the right honourable member, should go by the board. He was quite willing that the prosecutor's averment should be taken to make out a primd facie case. tion 9? Whoever aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or by act or omission is in any way, directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or privy tola) the commission of any offence against this Part of this Act; or (b) the doing of any act outside Australia which .would, if done within Australia, be an offence against this Part of this Act, shall be deemed to have committed the offence. Penalty : Five hundred pounds. Therefore, whoever assists a person proved guilty shall be deemed to have committed the offence for which he was tried. That, however, does not affect my argument that all the indictment sections of the principal Act rest on the basis of intent. I believe, indeed, that the right honourable member for East Sydney was himself responsible for the insertion of the word. I did not object to it, because I think that some proof of intent should be possible under every circumstance, whether by inference or direct evidence. But the qualification to the general proposition that guilt shall be deemed to be proved by the averment of the prosecutor, contained in paragraph a of clause 4, meets his contention in this connection, and I think that he did not sufficiently appreciate the scope of the principal Act. He also objected to the proposal that the Comptroller General should have the right of interrogation and production of books. He said that he did not object to give to the Court power to demand the production of books, but that he objected to the French system of allowing the prosecutor to summon and interrogate an accused before trial. So far as the Labour Party is concerned, I do not. think that we have any particular responsibility in this matter. With our views in regard to monopolies, trusts, and combines it is not our business to insist that steps towards regulation should be taken. We think that a much shorter cut is the only road to success. I cannot understand the attitude of honourable members of the Opposition who would permit these abuses to continue rather than adopt methods that have been found' necessary elsewhere to cope, or to attempt to cope, with similar abuses. member says that in spite of the adoption of those methods people elsewhere have not been able to cope' with the abuses. has gone, in some cases they have not been successful. member believes that we should make this radical departure from British justice for a futile purpose. view -My idea is that while politicians of the stamp of the honourable member assure the people that regulation is all that is required, it is very probable that they will not believe that something of a far more radical character is necessary.

It does not appear to me that an honest trader has anything to fear in respect of such a provision. The worse he could fear would be a disclosure of some of his business methods. We may well trust the Comptroller-General of the day, whoever he may be, not to make any improper disclosures. He has now the control of the Customs revenue, amounting to ^11,000,000 or ^12,000,000 per annum, and necessarily must be intrusted with business secrets of immense importance. An honest trader has nothing tb fear from an investigation such as that for which the Bill provides. An honourable member asked a little while ago, "" How would a union like to be subjected to this procedure?"" If any union with which I was connected were afraid to have its affairs investigated-, I should say it was about time it disbanded. My own opinion -has always been that trade unions are a little too candid in disclosing all their affairs to the general public. serve the same degree of candour on the. part of our friends of the Employers' Fede-. ration, and do not know that they are to be blamed on that account. My argument is that even although the principle adopted in regard to the production of books and interrogation of persons is a new one, no honest trader has anything to fear, and that the justification for its adoption is that unless drastic stepsare taken, there is no possibility of-securing the result which the majority of honourable members are very anxious to bring about. agree with the last speaker as to tbe provisions of paragraph b of the proposed If it were received as new section 15. It provides a proper way of dealing with the matter, and by a slight extension of its .provisions the Government would be able to obtain all the information they Tequired COOK -But, having rein respect to any prosecution under the principal Act. If they take power to interrogate the person who is to be made a' defendant in certain proceedings, and the to obtain all the information they require to prove intent on any averment under the original Act. But every one must feel that there is a great danger of an innocent person being punished under paragraph a of proposed new section 15. Under that provision, as well as under subclause 4, in any prosecution the defendant is to be assumed to be guilty until he proves his innocence. Many cases may arise in which the defendant may find great difficulty in proving his innocence. The leader of the Labour Party said that under the Mines Act of Victoria, the occurrence of an accident in a mine was prima facie evidence that the fault was that of the mine-owners. That may be a proper provision in respect of a civil proceeding for damages, but under, this Bill a defendant, although innocent, might be unable to prove his innocence, and be sent to gaol. The clause as it stands will open the door to the blackmailer. A man will be able to go to some one in business and say, "" Unless you give me a certain sum, I shall tell the Minister that you have committed an offence under the Act. You may then be prosecuted, and, unless you can prove vour innocence, you are assumed to be guilty."" I believe that some people would be weak enough to allow themselves to be blackmailed in such circumstances vided by paragraph b ? first part of sub-clause 4 the moment the Attorney-General, the Crown Prosecutor, or the person wbo has charge of the case files a. charge the defendant is assumed to be guilty. What would happen to a postmaster if he were proceeded against under such a law as this because there was a shortage in his stamps ? He could gointo the witness box and ray, "" The stamps were in the office drawer, and I did not touch them,"" but that would not'be sufficient for tlie jury.

Sitting suspended from i to 2.15 p-m. Labour Party admitted that there was a possibility of injustice arising under some of the provisions of the Bill, but urged that we had a sympathetic Parliament, which would amend the measure at any future time if hardship were inflicted on even one person in the-community. . The. honourable member expressed a great desire to see justice done, but I presume that he does not claim a monopoly of that desire; and the time to do justice, or to prevent injustice, is now. ' We have the opportunity to amend the law by eliminating all those provisions which involve injustice, and substitute others more in keeping, with our ideas of equity. I hope honourable members on all sides will put aAvay any idea of introducing a party element into this debate. The leader of the Opposition has done a distinct service in his criticism of the measure ; and, in considering the defects which the right honourable member pointed out, I hope honourable members will have only the one object of making this as near as possible a perfect Bill. The honourable member for Dalley, in referring to the clause.which compels suspected persons to produce all documents, nnd answer all questions, asserted that the information thus obtained was not to be used for the purpose of formulating any charge against that person. on which the honourable member defended the clause is entirely erroneous. He drew attention to sub-section 4, which, he held, showed that none of the documents or statements could be used as evidence by the prosecution; and, .while I do not impute any desire to the honourable member to mislead the House, it is evident that he has not read the provision carefully. He relied on that portion of the clause which read as followsNo person shall be excused from answering any questions or producing any documents when required to do so under this section on the ground that the answer to the question or the production of the document might tend to criminate him; but his answer shall not be admissible in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceeding. There he stopped, I do not say intentionally, and I desire to point out that the words which follow-anc l which apparently escaped his notice-sho w that the intention is to collect evidence against suspected persons. The words which follow areother than a proceeding for an offence against this Part o""f this Act. It is clear, therefore, that the object is to make fhe suspected person the means of supplying information to his prosecutor. Sub-clause 3 of the proposed new section distinctly statesThe Comptroller-General or any person to whom any documents are produced in pursuance of this section may take copies of or extracts from those documents. What can be the purpose of taking extracts or copies if it is not that of collecting evidence against the suspected person? Unless the documents can be so used the proceeding is practically useless. may be just the opposite-to enable the man to stop any further proceedings. duction of the books and the documents and the answers to questions might lead the Comptroller-General to form fhe opinion that there was no case. On the other . hand, 'however, the obvious object is to get evidence against the suspected person, and make him. supply it himself. nary system of interrogation that takes place in all legal procedure of this kind before the parties get to close quarters. tion is not by the prosecutor or under penalty of a heavy fine for refusing information. When a man is arrested by an The ground ordinary policeman or detective he is always cautioned that whatever he may say will-be used in evidence against him ancl he can refuse to answer, whereas under the Bill a suspected person has no option, being subject to a fine of ^50 for refusing to answer. It will be seen, therefore, that there is a radical difference between the two systems.' sonably suppose that those who join combinations and trusts do not require much cautioning against committing themselves. . say that; but if the principle of this measure were applied to ordinary cases, the most innocent person in the world would be held to be guilty until he had proved his innocence.

The leader of the Opposition Supreme Court, or from a Justice of the has pointed out the danger of the words of High Court, before the Comptroller-Genethe proposed new provision 15A, which are ral should summon persons before him. as followsIn any prosecution for an offence against consideration. sections four, five, seven, eight, or nine of this Act the averments of the prosecutor contained in the information declaration or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. The words "" shall be deemed to be proved"" are in such a case wholly contrary to the spirit of fair play. The leader of the Opposition, moreover, gave a specific instance in which a magistrate, because of similar words in another Act, felt it his duty to convict a person, although he had a doubt as to that person's guilt. I am sure we have no desire to see instances of that kind if they can be avoided. I hope the Government and the members of the Labour Party will .not regard as unfriendly any proposed amendments simply because they happen to come from the leader of the Opposition or other honourable members on this side. afraid that more than once in the past measures which might have been made much more effective have suffered simply because any suggestion from this side has been treated as hostile. I am in perfect accord with the desire to deal drastically and effectively with, combines and trusts formed for the purpose of injuriously affecting trade and the community generally, and I am prepared to support any fair and just proposal with that object in view. At the same time, we must remember that if we set out to cure an admitted evil by means of unjust law, the only result must be the creation of a greater evil. The evil is intensified by the fact that injustice and injury are done with the sanction of the law. I shall support the second reading, but I propose in Committee to ask honourable members to consider amendments for getting rid of the difficulties which have been complained of. I thought at first that, instead of allowing the Comptroller-General, who will be the prosecutor in these cases, to have power on his own initiative to call an accused before him and require the production of books and papers, the assistance of a magistrate might be invoked. But, on talking the matter over with one or two, it was pointed out I think with some reason-that that might not be the most advisable course to follow. should be obtained from a Judge of a The liberty of the subject is of paramount the subject interfered with by trusts ? to do injustice to any member of the community. The leader of the Labour Party has expressed the desire to do justice to all, and we have now an opportunity to prevent the perpetration of injustice. Therefore I appeal to honourable members not to treat the measure in a party spirit, but to deal with proposed amendments on their merits. If we can eliminate the unjust provisions of the Bill without impairing its. effectiveness, I think every one will be satisfied. Personally I shall give careful consideration to amendments, wherever they may come from. [ -3Sl-I certainly think that there is need 2 I am for very stringent legislation to cope with the injurious operations of trusts and combines. A recent book, entitled Frenzied Finance, exposed the doings of American Trusts, mentioning the names of well known persons. The revelations contained in that work show it to be necessary to take extreme measures for ascertaining facts in regard to the operations of corporations and the objects which they have in view. In many cases their promoters start out with the intention of committing fraud. They know that they will impoverish persons who can least afford to lose their money, from whom they take in the aggregate millions of pounds. It is necessary therefore, to pass legislation to give effect to the wish of the people that they shall be protected from the injurious operation of trusts and combines. But we shall be as bad as the trusts which try to govern and oppress the community, if we adopt the measures practised in certain parts of America. In the dark ages, the thumb screw was resorted to to obtain information ; but no one would think of using that method at the present day, notwithstanding its directness. Then, in China, when they want to get to the bottom of things, they persecute men by preventing them from going to sleep. The course proposed by the Government, of calling upon accused persons to give evidence against themselves, I think, however, that leave is a near approach to such persecution.

270,Sir John Forrest (Swan) [2.52],"so that there will be no likelihood of such a case arising under it as is said to have been heard recently in Sydney, where an innocent man was declared guilty because the presiding magistrate considered that he had not absolutely proved his innocence. I heard"" the speech delivered by the honourable member for South Sydney, and I do not think that proposed new section 15A contains any provisions that, are not already in the principal Act. I have no objection to the sub-clause which provides for the production of documents, believing that such a provision is necessary in order that justice may be done. At the same time, I certainly do not favour a proposal to compel a man to give evidence to incriminate himself. Such a proposition is altogether foreign to our ideas of British justice. We have always been told, and have thought, that no man should be compelled to give evidence that would incriminate himself, and I do not think that sub-clause 4 of 15A is necessary. That a man should be compelled to give evidence on oath in order to make out a case against himself at a preliminary hear the interests of the general public. But I ing is opposed to my idea of justice. It is altogether un-British. Another point that most of us have heard?"" Surely it is not is worthy of consideration is that by declining to give evidence on the ground that he might incriminate himself, an accused person would very much prejudice his case. Such an attitude would not, in the opinion of the justice or the presiding officer, improve his. position. If a person were to say to any one of us in the ordinary course of business, "" I cannot tell you. anything about such-and-such a matter, because, if I did. I might appear in a disadvantageous light,"" I think we should record a mark against' him. The leader of the Labour Party appeared to pose as taking very high ground. He said, very properly, that we were all desirous of doing justice, and went on to declare that if only one man were injuriously affected by any legislation that we passed, there was not one honourable member who would refuse to assist him to secure redress. Those are very fine sentiments, but have we nbt had before us for the last six months a case of great injustice done to a large number of members of the community, and in respect of which no protest has been made in the House? What have honourable members to say about manufacturers in this State-to go no further-wh o have complied with the State law in regard to the payment. of rates of wages Sir John Forrest. fixed, not by themselves, but by Wages Boards, but who have nevertheless been called upon to pay fines for their failure to observe a scale of wages and regulations of which they had no knowledge and of which'they were absolutely ignorant. Having complied with the State law, they are now being called upon to pay bigher wages from a time anterior to the date upon which the recent decision of the Arbitration Court was given. I ask "" Is that just?"" Boards in connection with lhat industrv. the accuracy of that statement. Recent events conclusively show that there is not always that paramount desire to do justice to every man of which the leader of the Labour Parity boasted so much. I . am under no obligation to trusts or .combines, and I have no sympathy with them when their operations are prejudicial to the best interests of the general community. I admit that they ought to be controlled, because their operations may be adverse to ask "" What about the Combine of which to the interests of the community that the Newcastle mines should refuse to supply coal to any but a limited number of shipping companies. thing that we desire to remedy. ber ask the Labour Partyi f its members desire to break up that combine. to the welfare of the community that those mines should refuse to supply any coal to any but a few shipping companies?

There is just as much likelihood of a combine operating in Western Australia to the detriment of the community as elsewhere. bines need . to be controlled, and I am willing to grant that control to the governing body. I think that clause 15A of this Bill ought to be modified so that a person accused shall not be deemed to be guilty of an offence under it before his guilt has been proved. I also object to an accused person being called upon to give evidence to incriminate himself before he is tried. Of course the power to compel the production of documents is a necessary one, in order that the Customs Department may be able to discover whether operations in restraint of trade are being carried on. I am in favour of some such provision being inserted in this measure. At the same time. I am not in favour of turning our ordinary legal procedure upside down by calling upon an accused person to incriminate himself. I shall vote for the second reading of the B ill , and perhaps in Committee the Government will reconsider one or two of the points to which so much criticism has been directed. to me remarkable that honourable members opposite should be so concerned about preventing accused persons under this Bill from incriminating themselves. conceded that those who are unwilling to produce evidence are guilty of illegal practices, and have something to hide, because if they have nothing to hide tliey have nothing to fear. Why, then, should honourable members opposite argue that trusts and combines must not be asked any questions? When a man is accused of an offence his silence is -prima facie evidence of his guilt. But I would point out that this Bill does not provide that any person shall be condemned without first being accorded a hearing. It merely insures that publicity shall not be given to cases until they are brought before the Court, so that the country may be saved the expense of unnecessary and speculative actions. If those concerned are honourable men, they will not shrink from giving evidence. If they are afraid of the light of day it is our duty to make them disclose their position. This afternoon the It is as bad as the honourable member for Maranoa suggested that under this Bill the Comptroller-GeneralI am told that in Wesof Customs might be called upon to take action upon the ipse dixit of anybody. I do not see That, however, is not the case. TheB ill provides that the Comptroller-General shall take action only after he has satisfied himself that a complaint is well founded. PerA l l comsonally I do not know anything of the coal combine to which the right honourable member for Swan has referred. The matter has not been brought before this House, and if it were I venture to say that a number of honourable members opposite would be the first to exclaim, "" This is a State matter. It does not concern the Commonwealth."" ber would not seek to touch it. every day in the week if it were injurious to the general 'welfare of the community. I am always to be found on the side of justice. any interest in the coal vend? tp the issue. If the question should ever come before the HouseI shall then be found taking up the same attitude that I do now. I trust, that the second reading of this measure will be carried. [3.10] -It appears to me that 1 must be included in the category of those who do not believe in justice because I intend to support this Bill. How does the old idea It is generally that a man should be presumed to be innocent of any offence until he has been convicted, pan out in practice? If a person is accused of theft is not his possession of the stolen goods accepted as evidence of his guilt in the absence of a satisfactory explanation? Then, again, circumstantial evidence is admissible even in cases where a man is being tried for his life. As bearing on the proposal that trusts shall be compelled to disclose information which may .have the effect of incriminating them, I may be permitted to mention a case which occurred in my own electorate, and which some time ago I brought under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs.

Had it thought otherwise, it . would have had to-uphold the ""decision of the Police Magistrate, which was clearly unjust. As to the proposed new section 15c, why should not the Government be satisfied to give to a Judge the power to summon before him all necessary witnesses, with documents and papers, when called upon to try a case? any one could say to the Comptroller of Customs that, in his opinion, a combination existed, and the Comptroller would be able to cause the person against whom the charge was laid to appear before him, ancl to produce all his books and documents, so that a case might be worked up against him. be called upon to produce his books until he is actually before the Court. not think we should go back to the French system of taking evidence. If the officers of the Department are' vigilant, they will be able to obtain sufficient evidence to bring cases, supposing that there are in existence all the injurious trusts which have been spoken of. have discovered good grounds for making a charge aganst any corporation, let them hale it before the Court. I shall not oppose the second reading, but I hope that, in Committee, alterations will be made to meet the objections which have been raised. If , later on, it is found that the Government does not possess sufficient powers for the suppression of injurious combinations, it will be our duty to amplify its powers. Although many were opposed to the passing of the Australian industries Preservation Act, now that it is law we are bound to make it effective. I listened with great interest to the address of the right honourable member for East Sydney, who tried to make it appear that a new principle is being introduced into our legislation. As a matter of fact, the principle is not new. the Imperial Parliament some years ago, and already finds a place on our statute book, it being proposed now merely to extend it to proceedings against trusts and combines. In my opinion, it will be [320] The Full.Court necessary to do a. great deal more than is contemplated to effectively repress these corporations. The right honourable member for Instead of reading East. Sydney, when the CommerceB ill was before the House, seemed to think it an unnecessary interference with trade; but I am glad that he has since found it to be necessary. The late Right Honourable Mr Richard Seddon,dealing with trusts, made this remarkable statementThe trust evil is rearing its head very high in New ZealandNo higher than in Australia There are.the tobacco and the harvester trusts, and various combines of all kinds. We think Underthe provision in the B ill , that wherever a trust obtains, in, regard lo foodstuffs especially, the State must step in as the only power to combat it. Legislation is a very slow process, especially when fines only are the penalties. My opinion is that the remedy is to have no fines, but imprisonment pure and simple, and nothing but imprisonment. great economic authority? he successfully undertook experiments which I do have not been tried in the Commonwealth. The Bill does not go nearly as far as he was prepared to go. He continuedI fail to see the difference between a highwayman who forces from another what belongs to him and the combines or trusts that practically do the same thing. Once they If a poor man, compelled by hunger or the needs of his children, steals a loaf of bread, he is placed in gaol. Mr Seddon' would deal in exactly the same way with those who form combinations with respect to foodstuffs. I think that 'the Bill does not go far enough, and, that, later on, further amending legislation will be required. When we take this action I trust that honourable members of the Opposition will follow their leader and say that since something more than the principal Act is necessary to enable us to combat the evil, we should give the Government the additional power they require. The leader of the Opposition said it was monstrous to assume that a man was guiltv of an offence and to punish him if he could not prove his innocence. A magistrate who would go so far as did the justice ih the -illicit distillation case mentioned by the right honourable member for East Sydney-wh o would say, "" The defendant It was adopted by has not proved his innocence; I am not satisfied that he is guilty, and I am not satisfied that he is not.
