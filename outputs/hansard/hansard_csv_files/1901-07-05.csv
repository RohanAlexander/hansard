Referred to the Elections and Qualifications Committee. Sir JOHN QUICK I wish to ask the Prime Ministor1. Whether he will, in the interest of external trade and commerce, draw the attention of the P. and O. and Orient Companies to the following extract, dated London, 24th May, 1901, written by the London oorrepondent of a leading Viotorian newspaper, and published here on 1st July :Two shipments of apples have been sold during the week ex the Australia in London and the Runic in Liverpool. The condition of the apples in the former varied considerably, some being overripe, others Bpotted, and a portion heated. Cleopatras, Scarlet Fearmains, and Sturmers appear to have carried best. Complaints are numerous concerning the carriage of the fruit by the mall steamers, and it certainly seems necessary for steps to be taken on your side to force the P. and 0. and Orient Companies to guarantee a regular and proper temperature throughout Uie voyage. In one shipment lately arrived some apples were quite warm; others placed near the oold-blast pipes frozen hard. 2. Whether he will invite the steam-ship companies mentioned to take steps to prevent Uie further loss of fruit in the manner described in the foregoing extract? SinceI tabled thc notice of the question, I see from yesterday's issue of another leading Victorian paper that similar complaints have been made -with reference to a large shipment of apples by the Omrah, which apples have been landed in a very unsatisfactory condition. The newspaper goes on to say:Consignees are loud in their complaints about the unsatisfactory way in which the mail com1901. panies' steamers have carried Uie fruit Uiis year. I would ask the Prime Minister whether he will draw the attention of tbo steam-ship companies to these complaints with a view to preventing the further and unnecessary loss of Australian fruit. tained, it seems that the carriage of f r u it is entirely a matter of arrangement between the shippers and .the steam-ship owners.

6,Sir George Turner,"The matter mount importance to the whole of Australia.the recollection of most honourable members that in the year 1861 or thereabouts, the continent was first successfully traversed by John McDouall Stuart. ately following that date, an appeal was made by tbe then Government of South Australia to tlie Imperial Government to transfer to the South Australian Government control of the tract lying north of the 26th parallel of south latitude, with a view to its colonization and to its being opened up. m At that time the South Australian Government represented to the Home authorities that it was the intention of the colony, if this extension of boundaiy about which there had been some communications before in the years 1859-60-were being the natural extension of South Australia, be termed Central Australia, the object of that State would be not only to colonize that tract of country, but also to extend telegraphic across tlie continent to join with expected cable communication from the older countries of the world. ment agreed in 1863 to this extension of boundaries, after some little trouble, and the-passing of an Imperial Bill to alter the boundaries of the other colonies, Letters Patent in that year put the control of the whole of this tract of country'under, or to use tbeir own words, "" annexed it"" to South Australia. If honourable members will glance at tlie map I have taken the liberty of placing in tbeir hands-not doubt of their geographical but with the desire to place under their eye, in considering such an important question, the whole position of the Australian continent, and of this particular tract of country-they tory inquestion comprises an immense area of something over 335,000,000 acres of land. Its value and productiveness I shall deal with later on. This great tract of country was handed over to South Australia, and very shortly afterwards the transcontinental telegraph line was constructed, being completed in the year 1873. That telegraph line was constructed to meet the cable from Banjoewangie, connecting us with Europe. The great work was undertaken, not as it should have been, at the cost of the whole of Australia, but by the courageous enterprise of that little State of South Australia, which then had a population of only a little more than 200,000, at its own expense, and Mr V. L. Solomon. at its own risk. I am sure it needs few words -of mine to tell honourable members the importance of that action on the part of Almost immediSouth Australia. It needs little to recommend the proposition that I am going to put, namely, that South Australia's enterprise in constructing that line of telegraph is deserving of recognition, which it has not hitherto obtained, at the hands of the combined States of the continent. rival cable to the Cape has it not ? MrV . L . SOLOMON I trust that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo will not draw a line like that across my present argument, with which it has granted-it nothing to do. which more properly might value. MrV . L . SOLOMON -It is not a question of the value of the telegraph line which has passed over with the rest of the Postal and communication right Telegraph department to the control of the Commonwealth. That is not the point to which I am leading up. The point to which The British GovernI am leading up is that South Australian enterprise in the construction of that line preliminary which connected all Australia with Europe, is deserving of consideration and recognition, irrespective of any other consideration at the hands of this Parliament. Of course at the time the line was constructed and the extension of the boundary was agreed to by the Imperial Parliament, the State of South Australia naturally enough expected to be with any able to settle and colonize tliat tract of knowledge, country successfully. Unfortunately, owing immediately to the various questions wbich have arisen since 1873-question s of considerable importance to-day, such as black labour in Australia,-South Australia for many years will see tliat the terripast, in spite of having the country therethe climate and soil of which have been demonstrated to be capable of producing tropical and semi-tropical products of value -has , owing to the policy of wiiich I am sure most of Australia will be proud-the policy of refusing to allow Asiatic labour to be employed in the northern portion of ber possession-bee n the loser by many thousands of pounds each year. Wliile on this particular point, perhaps, it would be as well for me to deal with the amount that South Australia has lost. Last year, I think I am nearly right in saying that the deficiency in tlie administration of the Northern Territory by South Australia was something like £90,000. In previous",15,Australia

8,Sir John Quick,"It directly damaged itsyears it has aggregated from £50,000 to £60,000 and £70,000. And although I see some honourable members smile at the idea that one should desire to pass over an asset of such a questionable character, it is my desire to place before the House nothing but an absolutely candid and true position of the whole case. The difficulty that South Australia has had to contend with, owing to the adoption of the policy which I have mentioned, has been that, although she has admittedly a large tract of land in the northern portion of her territory, capable of growing sugar, rice, indigo, cotton, tobacco, and a host of other tropical productswhich has been amply proven by the experiments at the Government Garden, and by other experiments by private individualsthe lack of suitable cheap labour,whetherit be black or white-and I am certain honourable members will recognise that white labour in that degree of south latitude can hardly be successful-sh e has been unable to utilize that country. It is not necessary, in dis; cussing a motion such as this, to touch upon the suitability of the labour in other branches of industry AlthoughI am absolutely of the opinion, after a residence of more than fifteen years in that country-that without black labour, suitable to the climate, it is impossible to cultivate any form of tropical products, I still admit that in regard to mining and pastoral pursuits, there is no difficulty whatever. will be no cultivation. MrV . L . SOLOMON"" -That is a point which I am sure the honourable member will admit is now entirely beyond the control of South Australia. That is a question of policy for Federated Australia, and I think I am safe in saying that the settled policy of the United States of Australia is that the northern portion of the continent had better be left unutilized than that the future happiness and prosperity of our European races should be jeopardized. When I put my case in tliis way, it will be understood by honourable members that I do not desire in any way to cloud the issue or to influence their opinions by any threats as to what might be done if this portion of the continent were handed back to the Imperial Government. On that particular point, although the letters patent by which this territory was provisionally annexed to South AustraliaI use the term "" provisionally annexed "" exactly as it stands-migh t raise some form of doubt, there can be little doubt in the minds of most of us that there would be no attempt on the part of the Imperial authorities to go back on the bargain which they made, or to belittle in any way the title of Soutli Australia to this tract of country which they granted many years ago, and upon which that State has expended hundreds of thousands of pounds. Now, as to the financial position. In order not to delay honourable members too much upon private member's day, and to give as much information as I possibly can, I have had a small map prepared showing, not only the geographical position of this tract of country, but also some details of its exports and imports extending over a long period of years. Honourable members will notice, for instance, that the export of gold for 1881 to 1899, to which I have previously alluded, amounted to 458,475 ozs., of a value of a trifle over £1,572,214. The exports of cattle, wool, sheep, horses, tin, copper ore, trepang, and pearl-shell brought tlie total up to a value of £2,414,832. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Between 1881 and 1899, a period of nineteen years. The population during most of the time-al though it has varied, perhaps, by a thousand or two-ha s not been over 6,000 or 7,000. The population to-day, according to the Government Resident's report last year, is 1,620 Europeans, 2,180 Chinese, and 520 Malays, Japanese, and so forth. in mining principally t MrY . L . SOLOMON -They are principally employed in niining. The Malays and Japanese are principally employed in pearlshelling. There is thus a total of 4,320 souls in a tract of country comprising. 335,000,000 acres, and extending for nearly 1,100 miles. Coming down to last year's record, which was certainly not as good as the previous year's in regard to mineral export and so forth, I find that the imports were valued at £129,488, or approximately £3 0 per head of the population, whilst the export of staple products was valued at £156,062, which is equivalent to 36 per head. For the whole population, including Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans the Europeans being very much in a minoritythe contribution to the Customs revenue is higher than any other portion of Australia, viz., £ 7 15s. per head.",16,Australia

SOLOMON I do not doubt that it is rich in mineral and other products. was lying idle some £5,000, and in customs HoweverI do not wish to extend my speech on this subject by dealing too largely with figures. I have for that reason placed tlie figures on the map I have handed to honourable members with a view to their thoroughly studying the whole position. I would like now to come to the question of the other possibilities in regard to this tract of country. It will be seen by the map that the line to be completed is some 1,063 miles in length, from Oodnadatta, at the south end, to Pine Creek, at the north. This railway will pass through the very heart of ' Australia, and will be found to be within fairly easy reach of the railways, stretching out from various important centres in Queensland, all of which should within a reasonable time be connected with this line. Irrespective of that question of the railway, which I do not desire to touch upon at any length at the present moment, I would like to point to the valuable pastoral country both on the eastern and western borders of tliis northern territory. border, we have undoubtedly a very fine tract of pastoral country-wha t they call the Herbert River country. On the western, the Victoria River country, which I am sure is well known to the Minister for Defence, we have equally fine pastoral country ; and this country absolutely cannot be opened up and developed without reasonable communication. The question will naturally be asked -why , with all the natural advantages of this portion of the State; with the splendid rainfall, which in the northern portion, JOHN FORREST -Opium has someaverages from 50 to 60 inches each year; with fine herbage, and witli great mineral resources, South Australia has .not in the past been able to make a financial success of it ? Well, there are a good many reasons for the failure. First of all, without touching on State politics at all, I may point out that the veiy earliest attempt at colonization by the State of South Australia was a huge financial blunder. What did they do 1 Immediately after they obtained possession of this great tract of valuable countiy they offered, to the people of tlie colony and of the older countiy, land orders covering a. right to 160 acres each, at the rate of 7s. 6d. per acre. By this fmancial transaction they received altogether for 1,524 of these land orders, which entitled each purchaser to 160 acres of land, the sum of £91,000. They received in interest upon tlie money while it duties a little over £8,000. Bufc between the years 1864 and 1873, after the issue of these land orders, the cost of maintenance and of fche sunrey, which tliey had agreed with the land-order holders to make, and of various other things connected with the new settlement amounted to £225,000. So that the results of the first ten years of experience of this costly, and one might almost say impudent, experiment on the part of a colony with, I think, only 200,000 people at the time-the absolute result from a financial stand-point of ten years' experience was a loss of £120,000 in cash, and the alienation of 400,000 acres of land, including the whole of the town lands of the settlement. Can any honourable member imagine success from colonization commenced in that way, or that a burden like that put upon them so many years ago could possibly be fought with by a mere handful of people? That was the start. Difiiculties afterwards arose from the very fact that this land had On the eastern, the Queensland been alienated, as no man who landed at Port Darwin could find a block of land upon which he could settle, because the landlords or owners in England, Adelaide, Melbourne, and scattered in the various parts of the",17,Australia

13,Mr Piesse,"50s . a head is the averageAustralian colonies, demanded for the halfacre blocks, for which they had paid 3s. rentals of from £ 7 0 to £ 1 0 0 a year on short leases with all improvements to be left. ""With such blundering as that at the start of colonization, it cannot be a matter of much surprise that the results have been a financial failure to the State. and within a few years, we had the introduction of Asiatic labour-the introduction of Chinese after the mines were discovered. They were not introduced by private individuals. It is necessary to make a perfectly clean breast in dealing with a matter of this kind, and to explain that the first 200 Chinese were introduced by the South Australian Government for the purpose of assisting mining enterprise, the principle owners of the mining enterprises being people who were settled near the centres of jiopulation at Adelaide ancl elsewhere. did that? MrV . L . SOLOMON I do not know what Government did it . I do not wish to enter into State politics at all. Buti t is necessary, in putting the whole case before honourable members, to show how it is that with a country possessing such magnificent resources these failureshave occurred. that occur? MrV . L. SOLOMON -In 1873 or 1874. But that is not tbe only thing. We had the construction of a line of railway authorized some years later, from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, traversing roughly about 150 miles, and supposed to serve the mining district. It was supposed also to be the northern section of a transcontinental line, and that it would eventually be connected with the line wbich honourable members will see stretches from the south to Oodnadatta. Unfortunately for the settlement of the northern end of the colony, the Government of the day consented to this line being constructed by what they termed "" optional labour."" I may say that by this regulation the South Australian Government saved some £80,000 in the contract price; but the firm of C. ancl E'. Miller, I think it was, who constructed the line, introduced thousands of Chinese to complete it, and when it was completed the Chinese left. Consequently the efforts at settlement in the countiy liave been so far utter mistakes. And they sbould not be [137] counted against the country in the consideration of the question I am now submitting to the House. land left ? , "" 1 MrY . L . SOLOMON -The area of land alienated is comparatively small, aiid veiy little of it has been alienated in fee simple. Following closely upon that, Only a small portion comparatively is even under pastoral lease except around the settled districts. There is no doubt about thequantity of good land for settlement, and there canbe no doubt, from our experience of the McDonnell Ranges, and from tlie reports of skilled geologists like Mr Brown, the Government Geologist, that there-are large tracts of country that offer eveiy inducement for farther prospecting. So that'w.hen it becomes a question whether the Commonwealth will be making a good ov bad bargain in purchasing from South Australia this tract of countiy, embracing 335,000,000 acres of land, for what ?-pro bably in consideration of taking over the liability, amounting roughly to £3,000,000, or about 2d. per acre-whe n it becomes a question of' the Commonwealth taking over this tract of country at such a price, I do not think it needs much consideration on the part of honourable members to enable them to decide that the bargain will be a good one. I say that, in spite of the futile efforts of this little State of South Australia, with its present population of only 350,000 people, to deal witli a tract of countiy thousands of miles away from the centre of government, involving the question of the development of tropical country. Looking at the map one sees that the northern part of this countiy is within the eleventh parallel of south latitude, and is absolutely more tropical than some portions of India. To attempt to develop, the agricultural resources of a .countiy like that by European labour is a mistake, there is no chance of doing it successfully. Then again the question arose in the South Australian Parliament whether it was wise or fair to the other States of the group to allow this Port Darwin country-Port Darwin being the very back-door to the East-to be populated and developed by an inflow, which could easily have been obtained, of Asiatic aliens or even of Indians. Offers have been made to the Government of South Australia to take over this countiy, and to relieve South Australia of the debt over and over again, but liave been refused,",18,Australia

15,Mr Mauger,Ho w many years ago did,19,Australia
16,Sir Johx Quick,"I s there much goodand I give the Government of that State full credit for it. The offer has included the construction of the whole line of railway, but has always had the condition attached that those who constructed the railway should be allowed to introduce into that northern end of the continent what labour they chose. At one time in the yeai"" 1882 the Government in power passed an Indian Immigration Bill to permit of tlie introduction of Indian immigrants for the development of the agricultural hinds of the tsmtory. tunately for the present position, this Immigration Bill was never availed of. There were difficulties thrown in the way by the Indian Government, and I do not think tliere have been any labourers imported uuder it. chosen to throw open that part of the concontinent, to throw open their lands, to capitalists who were prepared to invest large sums of money there, especially when tlie agitation against Kanaka labour in Queensland was rampant, the position of the Northern Territory from a financial standpoint would have been very different from what it is to-day. Now, passing from what nwy be described as a series of explanations of why the Nortliern Territory has not been a profitable asset to South Australia, I come to the broader position, and I think I may put it to honourable members that in dealing with this question they have to consider the geographical position of South Australia and of the Northern Territory. A glance at the map, which honourable members have in their hands, will show that within a very few days' sail or steam from Port Darwin-some 6 or 7 days by fast steamers--we Singapore; that within S days we have Hong Kong; and within 9 days Japan. Then, going a little bit further north, we have Russia, or rather Russia's possessionManchuria. Russia tliere has been constructed what the reporters of the leading papers published in England, describe as tlie future east and west of Europe the Manchurian-Siberian structed for a distance of some 3,300 odd miles. This railway is likely, to be completed within another two years at the very latest, and it will undoubtedly in the veiy near future form the highway for most of the passenger and mail communication from one end of the continent to the other. With that line completed, and with a swift steamer to connect with Port Darwin, it ' ilr. V. L. Solomon. is quite possible, as is stated by the correspondents of some of the leading London dailies, that Australia may be brought at least S to 10 days nearer to London. The time at my disposal will hardly permit me to quote all tlie material with which I could supply honourable members; but I will satisfy myself by saying that the correspondent of the London Daily Glwonide, who, some 6 months ago journeyed across this 3,300 odd miles of railway to ForIrkoutsko, the present terminus of the line, describes the travelling as being about the most comfortable of any to be found in the world, except in America. He says that not only is the travelling luxurious, but that the cost for that 3,370 miles for first-class Had tbe Government, however, passengers is a trifle over £ 1 6 ; for secondclass passengers, £ 9 16s. ; and for thirdr class passengers, £ 2 12s. 6d. Now, I think figures like tliese should show honourable members that in the very near future the existence of this line will be a veiy important point to bear in mind in considering the construction of our future transcontinental lines of railway. It certainly is a very important point to consider in connection with the value of the Nortliern Territory to the Federal Government. It has been provided under our Commonwealth Act that the Federal Parliament may take Over a tract of countiy such as this, and may administer it either by giving representation such as may be deemed fita certain amount of representation in the two Houses of the Federal Parliament-o r by treating it as aji appendage State for the time being, until a reasonable populahave tion becomes resident in the countiy. What1 wish this House to decide is as to the desirability of taking over this tract of countiy. I do not wish the House to decide it to-day, or that there sliould be any Across the southern portion of haste in the matter ; but I do desire that, as far as the Government are concerned, we should have from them some distinct pledge highway as to their line of policy in reference to this question. Hitherto we have . had railway already cona few diplomatic replies to questions, all of which have meant nothing. From the very first announcement of tlie Prime Minister's policy I found fault with the omission of a question of such great importance to Australia. Still, I am happy to believe, notwithstanding the guarded replies given by the members of the Ministry, that tliey are in sympathy with the proposal to take over this tract of countiy from South Australia. It may be asked why the Northern Territory ought to be taken over, and in reply I might ask why South Australia should continue to run this countiy, to keep that back door at Port Darwin closed against what the settled policy of the Commonwealth has declared to be undesirable immigration, at its own cost. It has been stated that unless the Federal Parliament agrees to take over this countiy, the natural result will be that South Australia, whether tlie Federal Parliament likes it or not, will be forced into the position of giving the country back to the Imperial Government. Now, is it desirable in the opinion of any honourable members of this House, that after having given local Government to every State throughout Australia, one large and important portion of our continent should be handed back to the Imperial Governmeut to be dealt with as that Government may desire-perhap s in . such a way as would not great many members of this Federation, and in such a way as certainly would not meet with the approval of a large proportion of our constituents. It would be quite witlun the power and quite within tlie right of the Imperial Parliament to settle this tract of country, if it were banded back to it, by permitting the employment there of its own subjects from India; and, undoubtedly, if a scheme with that object were adopted, the possibilities of successful development in tliat north end of Australia can hardly be estimated by us. There can be no doubt that with the labour which could be introduced from the northern portion of India to develop the agricultural lands near Port Darwin, great success could be obtained. Still, I am just as anxious, as I think every other member of this House is, that such a scheme should not be adopted, and I am equally anxious that South Australia, having loyally defended the rest of the continent from an influx of undesirable labour, and havingby herenterprise brought Australia into close communication with the older countries of the world by the construction of the transcontinental telegraph line, should be relieved as speedily as possible of the liability .which she has every year to meet. It seems to me that there can be little doubt of the justice of a request on behalf of any representative of that State that this course should be adopted. If it is not adopted, the possibility is that the Northern Territory may fall back into the hands of the Imperial Government; but I do trust that honourable members will see, first of all, that what has been offered by South Australia to the Federation is not a bad bargain, b u t that the tract of countiy to be handed overis valuable, and that with the powers and the immense purse of the Commonwealtli it s resources-mineral , pastoral, and agricultural -coul d be better developed than would bepossible.under the control of a small Statelike South Australia, with its population, of only 350,000. I have no desire that this debate should be hurriedly coucluded.. (House counted.) I have no desire fco take the opinion of the House to-dav, or even next week, on this question, f am simply carrying out a pledge made to the electors of South Australia when I was the first, I think, in the whole of Australia to point out the omission of this important question from the Prime Minister's speech. That pledge was that, so far as I was conmeet with the approval of a cerned, this measure should be put beforethe Federal Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity, and that I would givei t the fullest information in my poweras to the advantage of taking over this, 'tract of countiy. That pledge, I think, I have redeemed. I leave it to fche good sense of the House to discuss this question -whic h is not a party question, bufc one of : national policy-temperatel y and quietly,, and to look into it as closely and critically as possible; and I am sure the result must be that honourable members of both Houses will agree that it would' be a good thing for Australia if this tract of country were taken over by the Commonwealth. Question proposed. very brief in my remarks. We ought to be to some extent grateful to the honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L _ Solomon, for bringing so important a matterbefore us; but I feel that, although we agreewifch him with respect to one or two facts,, most of his facts are singularly at variance with our views of what the Northern Territory is. Of course we know that the Northern Territory originallv formed a,portion of New South Wales, and the honorable member is correct in saying that the Government of New South AValesi n 1863 were very glad to get rid of a bad bargain by letters patent.

Very soon after we pass Goyder's Hue, and long before we get to Oodnadatta, we pass into the howling Australian desert. Although in the McDonnell Ranges there is .a considerable amount of mica and. a. considerable amount of gold, I think that if a camel were tuwied out there he would not get food between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek. There is simply nothing to keep body and soul together-n o food for cattle or . sheep. The whole country today is a howling wilderness, and will remain so for a ll time. Mr O'MALLEY -There are jack-rabbits there. even jack-rabbits are able to live there. Although tlie honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, is right on general principles in regard to tlie national two ago, when, singularly for Australia, a aspect of the case, the whole of his local information appears to me to be incorrect I do not desire to say misleading. As we pass north along the railway to Pine Creek, and farther north to Palmerston, we get a 63-inch rainfall, but that, unfortunately, is accompanied by such a considerable amount of malaria that a white man finds it very hard to live there. MrV . L . SOLOMON. -D o I look like it , after fifteen, years ? climate did not affect the honourable member. The population consists of a few whites, a considerable number of Japanese, a good number of Chinese, a considerable number of aborigines, and a considerable number of criminals. When the Queensland Government want to get rid of any criminal who causes a great deal of trouble, tliey let him slip over to the Northern Territory, because he is there in company which just about suits him. Honourable members should understand that in places at the back of Pine Creek there is, perhaps, one of the most appalling populations in Australia. If any honourable member has an opportunity of going to Pine Creek and seeing the people there, he will ahnost wish he were back in Parliament. a proposal as the honourable member has Port Darwin is the sort of plaGe where the town is periodically blown into the sea, and left for the teredo to eat. There is a railway Although no local reasons may be advanced from Palmerston to Pine Creek, and, while the honourable member knows a little bit about the length of that line, he does not know anything about profits. The line was completed nine or ten years ago. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Long before that. About 1886. way was in Pine Creek in that year, but I am speaking casually. ago. 1888; but I speak subject to correction. However that may be, never at any time have the gross returns from that railway paid expenses. MrV . L . SOLOMON-The returns have always paid working expenses, though not interest on the capital. I do not suppose .that the kind I am subject to correction, but at tlie same time. I think I am perfectly right in saying that the railway has never paid working expenses. Last year, or a year or new jetty or something of the kind was built out of the railway earnings, the revenue from the railway was £10,000 behind. ThatI remember as a factI saw it stated at the time. That is about the position, so far as I can see, of the Northern Territory. Could any place be more useless to Australia from the local stand-point, with regard to which the honourable member had not a leg to stand on ? The more we inquire into-this matter from the stand-point of local I am very glad the value, the more sure we become that the Pederal Parliament had better leave it alone. That will be the unanimous opinion of every man who looks into the question. But the main point, in regard to whicli the honourable meniber is light, is that the Northern Territory is close to Asia-is the back door toAsia-and , therefore, whatever the cost may be, it must be taken over,preserved, and controlled by the Commonwealth Parliament. But in taking over a territory of this kind-and I would take it over for national reasons and not for local reasons-ther e must be an agreement reasonable to the Commonwealth made with the State Parliament of South Australia. It is not possible for any person to vote for such made, and the honourable member must have known that when he tabled the motion. for taking over the Northern Territory, it being worth nothing, with millions of acres not worth a halfpenny per acre,",21,Australia

23,Mr Ewing,"In making a statement ofstill we have a national obligation which must be discharged. I find in tbe Governor's speecli a reference of this kind-. No doubt the project of railway connection between the Northern Territory and the Southern States will before long assume great pnblic importance. A proposal mode by the Oovernment of South Australia for the surrender by that State and the acceptance by the Commonwealth of the Northern Territory is under careful consideration. That is about as far as this Parliament can go in regard to tlie matter. It is under consideration, and there it must remain until we know more about it . I therefore move That all the words after "" is,"" line 1, be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words desirable that t,he Oovernment should as speedily as possible inquire into the advisability of taking over the Northern Territory of South Australia."" I am sure that the House will accept tbe amendment and nothing more. AlthoughI bave said a number of unpalatable things, the honourable member knows that they are absolutely true. He knows what the Australian desert is, and what PortDarwin ia. I presume that so long as he has the wish of his heart fulfilled, and the territory ia taken over, he docs not care whether it is taken over on local or on national grounds.
