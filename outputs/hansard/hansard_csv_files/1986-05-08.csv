But the question is whether that wide opinion that there is before it evidence of misstatement is cut down by what appears later. In behaviour-I emphasise the words 'evidence of clause 5 (1) it says: misbehaviour'-within the meaning of section 72 of the Constitution, sufficient to require an anIn carrying out its inquiry the Commission shall conswer and the Commission has given Mr Justice sider only specific allegations made in precise terms.

So far as we are talking about a prima facie case, we have no that evidence must be evidence admissible in quarrel with that. There should be a prima facie proceedings in court'. He will say, or one can case set up which Mr Justice Murphy has to imagine it being submitted: 'Since it is impossible meet before he is compelled to give an answer. to identify who made the tapes, since it is imThat seems fair enough.

But he says-and again I the rules of evidence that apply to criminal repeat: proceedings as opposed to civil proceedings. The judge goes on to say: The police witnesses' inability for the most part to identify with any precision elements of the tapes and The Commission has certainly not succeeded in drawtranscripts, or to give first hand evidence about them, ing up an accurate picture of the identity of each person renders it highly unlikely that any such material would responsible for each part of the process leading to the be admitted as evidence in criminal proceedings. creation of the material in its possession and has concluded that this would be an impossible taskDoes this mean: Exit the Age tapes, exit the note the words 'impossible task'Age transcripts? Were these matters in the mind of the Government? Did it not understand that In the vast majority of cases the Commission cannot be satisfied as to who typed any particular page-that was one consequence of applying at all stages the strict rules of evidence? Once again note the words 'vast majority of cases'. He continues: We have sought to overcome this in an However the Commission has received sufficient eviamendment which has been circulated and which dence to lead it to the inescapable conclusion that the we have, along with other amendments, no more material is the product of illegal telephone interceptions than five minutes to explain.
