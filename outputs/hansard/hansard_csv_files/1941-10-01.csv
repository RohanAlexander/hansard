I have since been in personal touch with the Premiers of all of the States, and have asked them to have a survey made urgently through the State Departments of Agriculture and other appropriate State instrumentalities, in order that the Commonwealth may be advised of their likely man-power needs in connection with the forthcoming harvest. It has been represented to me that in some of the States, more particularly in Victoria and South Australia, the problem will not be met simply by retaining the existing labour in rural areas, but that such labour will need to be augmented in some degree if the harvest is to be garnered. I have informed the Premiers that, so soon as they are in a position to communicate their needs and to suggest ideas as to how the problem may be met, a conference of appropriate Federal and State officers will be arranged in order that necessary steps may be taken to overcome any labour shortage.

18,Mr Curtin (Fremantle,"Leade r of that whatever may take place in. this Parliament this week will not in any way affect the complete unity of the Australian people, or the determination of this Parliament as a united body to prosecute the war to a successful conclusion. We are here concerned with how we can best and most fairly organize the nation so as to secure the greatest possible degree of efficiency in the prosethat of the Government, and different cution of the war, and in that way the more early attain victory. Ways and means of war involve a consideration of the relationship of people to one another, and of how we shall get those things which are requisite for the conduct of the war. The war is a physical thing. It is fought by fighting men, supported by the economic strength of the civil populaThey are the men who are doing the real tion. The fighting men have the first claim upon anything the country can do. The families of the fighting men have the first right to any special privileges that the country is capable of conferring in time of war. It is important that we should ever keep in mind the fact that no amount of legerdemain in the form of either fantastic theories of credit inflation, or of taking money from the poor, can add anything to the physical capacity of the country to wage the war. We cannot fight this war by inventing money; we can fight it only with guns and material.', with the physical things that soldiers and fighting men use, and we cannot add to the sum of those things by merely taking away from the lowest paid and most poorly circumstanced sections of the community that which is essential to their physical strength, and therefore to their morale. The Labour party regards this problem as one of social organization. When a government begins to tax incomes of £150 for the purpose of financing the war, it is beyond all doubt taking everything that the people in receipt of those incomes possess. Such persons are being called upon to give everything except their lives. Everything they have must go. Their standards of living go at once. They are the first victims of the sacrifices imposed by war. Our view is that, apart from the soldiers and their families, the persons on low incomes should be the last victims of financial policy. It is no new thing for the Labour party to be in opposition to the financial policy of the Government. We were opposed to it a year ago. We have been opposed to it in principle for more than 25 years, and more particularly since 1924. Our conception of how to organize Australia socially and economically is different, apparently, from from the plan upon which this budget is founded, and upon which the last budget was founded. Let us consider the problem of the fighting forces. Without divulging actual numbers, I can say that there are about 400,000 men in the fighting forces of Australia to-day, and they have a great number of dependants. work of war. Behind them the workers are performing the task of providing the fighting forces with the equipment of war. The Government, since the war commenced, has made six proposals indicating its opinion of what is a fair thing to do for the fighting forces of Australia. As a matter of fact, in iN'ovember, 1939, in this very chamber, the present Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) contended that the Government's first proposal was to pay to the soldiers 5s. a day, and a meagre 6d. for each child. I merely cite that example without regarding it as a proposal, because it was put forward by the present Minister for Commerce at a time when he was not a member of the Government. Thus, I shall disregard it, and discuss the proposal which the Government actually brought down on the 5th November, .1939. That proposal was to pay to the soldiers 5s. a clay, with Is. deferred pay, 2s. 6d. for a wife, and 9d. for each child. It was not acceptable to this Parliament, and therefore the Government brought down its second proposal, which still prescribed 5s. a day and Is. deferred pay for the soldier, but raised the rates for his dependants to 3s. a day for the wife and Is. a day for each child. Improved conditions had been extracted from the Government. In December, 1939, as the result of constant pressure from this side of the chamber, the Government brought own its third proposal, which was to ii'rease the deferred pay of the soldier (< .> ' j. a day after embarkation. That was one more concession wrung from a government which, apparently, was not disposed to regard the soldiers as having i lie first claim on the financial resources of this country. A year passed; in November, 1940, the Government introduced its fourth proposal which provided for an increase of the child allowance to Is. 6d. a day. The Government's fifth proposal was introduced in December, 1940. It provided that the soldier was still to get 5s. a day, and 2s. a day deferred pay, the wife 3s. a day, and Is. 6d. a day for each child, and, in addition, a wife with a child, or children, was to be given an extra 7s. a week. The 4xth and latest proposal of the Government provides that the soldier shall be paid 5s. a day, with 3s. a day deferred pay after embarkation; the wife is to get 3s. a day and Is. 6d. a day for each child; whilst a wife with a child, or children, is to receive 7s. extra a week, or if withshould be met out of the present resources out children, she will get an extra 3s. 6d. a week. 'n addition to those rates. respect of the the rest of the community. It will be seen, therefore, that since men were first invited to volunteer for service in the fighting forces of a country which, if the fighting men are worsted, will be lost and its liberties destroyed, six successive steps have been taken by the Government, each of which has been taken, not as the result of its own conception of what is the fair thing -n do, but as a grudging concession to either political opposition in this chamber or to public opinion in the country. In the present proposals of the Governsum of between £300,000 and £350,000 is ment, as set out in the budget speech of the Treasurer, the soldier is still to get nnly 5s. a day in addition to his deferred nay. I shall take a wife with two children as the basis of my remarks in respect ->E allowances for dependants of soldiers because, having regard to the fact that child endowment operates in respect of the families of soldiers as for the rest of the community, that appears to be a seasonable basis. The wife of a soldier is to get. £1 Is. a week for herself and 7s. a week extra on account of having a family, and also 21s. for her two children. That makes 49s. a week. She will receive also 3s. a day allotment from her husband, making a total of 70s. a week. I emphasize that this woman's husband is away with the fighting forces and thai she is under the constant strain of great mxiety; yet she is to be paid £1 a week less than the basic wage! I put it as fairly and as temperately as I can that that is not the way in which this country should evaluate the services which the fighting forces render to Australia in this war. That is one of the cardinal objections to the budget which we on this side have. We say to the Treasurer that the £6,000,000 which he proposes to incur as an annual liability-to be redeemed in the future by some other government-is an obligation which of the country and be paid now to the fain Hies of the soldiers. £6,000,000? already committed to pay about £350,000 of that amount to the wives of soldiers us a charge on this budget. mate. The Treasurer now says that £300,000 of that £6,000,000 is to' be met out of present revenues and paid this year. The budget contemplates that thai amount, which represents the extra allowance to be paid to the childless wife of a soldier, is to be paid to her at once. I do not wish to be misunderstood. A to be paid out of revenue this year to the wives and families of soldiers. We submit that the whole of the £6,000,000, including the £300,000, should be paid to the soldiers and their families in the present year. We say that it is reasonable and proper to regard that payment as the primary obligation of this country, in addition to the other obligations that are recognized in the budget. The Treasurer properly makes no demur about many",13,Budget 1941 42

24,Mr Curtin,"1 made a liberal estiother items of expenditure which he says this country should meet this year. No other item of expenditure in this budget which all agree should be met in this year can be considered by reasonable beings to constitute a greater obligation than that of treating our soldiers and their families fairly. I decline to say, or to accept the argument if it be put forward, that this country cannot afford to pay £6,000,000 more to the families of the fighting services in this present year out of this budget. Honourable gentlemen opposite may ask where the money is to be obtained. I am not in control of the Administration, but I am certain that economies could be effected, taxes revised and adjustments made, which would enable at least £6,000,000 to be found. [ put it to the Government, and to the Opposition and the country, that we are really evading our obligations to the soldiers by saying to them that when they return from the war they shall be paid the £6,000,000 which is now promised in this budget. It is the constant practice of the Government when confronted with the argument that soldiers and their families should be treated more fairly than they are being treated to answer that argument by increasing their deferred pay. The Government knows that that practice does not increase the present resources of the soldiers and their at least 22s. 6d. a week, and if I had families, or enable them to meet their present problems. It merely passes a liability on to posterity, and means that in the post-war period the soldiers will be included in the same category as bondholders or ordinary lenders of money. A soldier has a stronger claim on the finances of this country than has any money lender. I pass that aspect of the subject by saying that a budget which contemplates leaving the wife of a soldier who is fighting overseas with less resources than the basic wage on which to maintain herself and two children is fundamentally a budget which ought not to be acceptable to this Parliament. I do not propose to indicate other items experts of the Treasury, have been of new or additional expenditure that might reasonably be budgeted for. I merely say that the Labour party, if it held office, would feel an obligation to increase invalid and old-age pensions. might feel the obligation to increase those pensions, but would it do so? Labour party obtain the necessary money ? granting of an additional Is. a week to invalid and old-age pensioners would impose-upon the budget an extra burden of £1,000,000 a year.

So far as equity of sacrifice is concerned, there is a vast difference between the burden placed on the man with an income of £150 and the man on a much higher income because, after meeting the whole of what is called the national contribution, the latter has suffered no deprivation in respect of food, housing and the ordinary amenities of life. The only restriction he has suffered is in respect of his investible margin. does it not mean unemployment? only with what is called equality of sacrifice for the purposes of war. I have described war as a physical thing, and I also describe sacrifice as a physical thing.. That kind of budget which obliges one family to go without boots and does not oblige another family to go without boots does not impose equality of sacrifice, and. demonstrably, to impose a national contribution on those in receipt of income*below £300 a year is to cause absolute deprivation of some of the essentials of life. But it does not mean the same thing to those in the higher ranges of income. What happens to the man with an income of £300 per annum who desires to send his son to a university or to pay for some other form of training? Possibly the son has enlisted in the armed forces and the father hopes to set aside something continue paying the insurance premimri on his own life iu order to provide capital for the son when he returns; but the man who has an income of £2,000 or £3,000 a year could do so. the deferred pay would be useful, but 1 am insisting that £6,000,000 could be",17,Budget 1941 42

58,Mr Curtin,"I am not denying thatwith money. It is all very well to say that the contribution of £33 from an income of £250 can be paid. Of course it cau be paid; but the man who pays it cannot retain the same outlook on life as that of a man who, with an income of £3,000 a year, has to pay £1,543. The latter would still have nearly £1,500 left. We are told that there is to be equality of sacrifice, but will there be equality of purchasing power in these two men? If both have to look for a house and one has £1,500 after he has paid everything and the other has only about £220 after he has paid everything, who will get the house? on £1,000 a year? bution of a taxpayer in receipt of £1,000 a year is £282. That still leaves him with over £700. No physical hardship is imposed on the man with an income of £700 or even £500 clear of national contribution. We may deprive such a man of an opportunity to invest for his old age; we may deprive his wife of the opportunity to give all sorts of entertainments in her home; we may rob this country of a great deal of fashionable glamour; but we are not imposing any physical hardship on a man or woman when he or she is left with a net purchasing power of over £500. The childrenof such people will not be 3tinted of bread or the other requirements of existence. But when we step down into those categories of income receivers below £300, having regard to their obligations and the fact that so many of them are soldiers, we are not really diverting civil consumption to military purposes, but are greatly endangering the physical capacity of the country to withstand the demands of the war, for the majority of the workers in the factories and the majority of the men in the fighting forces are in receipt of less than £400 per annum. I Dominion of New' Zealand had a system of compulsory loans, but that in the last budget presented to the New Zealand Parliament there is no continuation of that policy. Leader of the Opposition, who holds viewsopposed to those of the Labour party, congratulated the Government on having abandoned it . abandoned taxation. necessity for taxation for the purposes of the war. however high it must be. But this is not a system of taxation; it is a system under which certain persons will pay £44 per annum as a national contribution. When the war is over, the Government will repay £25 to some persons in some States and £8 4s. to some persons in other States. I do not believe in this system of compulsory loans which will bring in a total in the present year of only £25,000,000. Receipts from the sale of war saving certificates have reached a considerable sum each year. I warn the Government that the policy of compulsory loans, if adopted, will probably dry up that source. Thousands of people in Australia regularly contribute from their incomes for war saving certificates. The Government cannot expect not to lose money from that source if it imposes a national levy of the sort contemplated. In two years the sale of war saving certificates has brought £23,00,000 into the Treasury. for two years. indeed ! The Prime Minister knows that war saving certificates purchased voluntarily have yielded £11,500,000 per annum. A t the very best, he proposes by compulsion to obtain £20,000,000 per annum from the people. Opposition think that the purchase of war saving certificates has affected the standard of the living of the people? remind the committee that the that voluntary contributions in any way affect the standard of life of the community, because those who find that they have tbe money to spare give it, believing that to be their duty.

76,Mr Curtin,"Let us say thehave that income as his personal right. If we are to fight this war collectively, we must have some application immediately of what people are describing as the ""new order"". But there is nothing of a new order in allowing people at the top of the income scale to meet all of their financial contributions to the war without having to go without anything requisite to their subsistence. The honourable gentleman sometimes talks about non-essential industries. If we are dealing with essentials, and we are obliged to restrict civil consumption, we must not allow the restricted supply of civilian goods to be the subject of competition between a man who has £1,500 to spend and another who has only £150 to spend. The correct way in which to trtjat that problem is by rationing. the Government is doing. of what the Government is doing. Obviously, if one man with a wife and three children has £1,500 to spend after he has met all of his obligations under these schedules, and another man with a wife and three children has a margin of only £220, there is no equality of competition in . the market for services or goods as between those two persons. put forward a budget of taxes as though that could establish some equality of sacrifice of purchasing power for an everfalling supply of commodities.

That is the right way to tackle our economic problems-o n the basis of reasonable justice and equal opportunity for all. We are opposed to the budget because of the principles upon which it is founded and the plan that has been formulated in order to carry it out. For this reason I move That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the that the expenditure requisite for a maximum prosecution of the war should be provided by Parliament, the Committee is opposed to the unjust methods prescribed by the budget, declares that they are contrary to true equality of sacrifice, and directs that the plan of the budget should be recast to eusure a more equitable distribution of the national burden."" cannot accept the amendment in its present form.

It is further laid down by May that the committee can attach no conditions or expression of opinion to a grant.

On inquiry, I have ascertained that the Acting Prices 'Commissioner recently approved an increase of the fare by 5s. for the journey by sea between the mainland and Tasmania to offset higher costs that have been borne by the company as a result of the war. Many methods of securing the increased revenue were examined, but the increase of second-class fares was, in all the circumstances, considered the most satisfactory. the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) asked the following question, forbidding without notice:Is the Prime Minister aware that the commanding officers of various sections of the defence forces have issued instructions to all members of those forces that they must not take grievances to members of Parliament; is the Prime Minister aware that those instructions mean that service men have no appeal to other than those who inflict punishment upon them and that the men have been denied their civil rights; if the men have no appeal to their local members, to whom can they appeal ? I have now been advised that the position in the three services is as follows:Navy -Unde r regulation 123 of the Naval Forces Regulations, naval personnel are forbidden to take their grievances to members [24] of Parliament. The King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, Article 10, which are applicable to the Royal Australian Navy, provide a means for naval personnel who have grievances to represent their complaints to superior authority. Briefly stated, a naval rating may make a complaint to his captain. If he is not satisfied with the decision of his captain, he may request that his complaint be forwarded to the rear-admiral commanding, and if still not satisfied, he may rcquest that it be forwarded to the Naval Board, of which the Minister for the Navy is president.

This procedure, as laid down in Military Regulations, provides that if a soldier considers himself wronged, he may complain in succession . to (a) -h'is company, &c, commander; (&) his commanding officer; (c) his brigade commander; (d) his formation, & c . commander; (c) if out of the Commonwealth or on war service in the Commonwealth, the officer in chief command of the force to which he belongs; and (/) the Military Board. Commands were instructed that regulations in regard to the redress of grievances were to be explained (not merely read) to all members of units at frequent intervals and that members of the Military Forces were to be informed not only of their opportunities, but also of the delay which must arise if they attempted to secure redress in unauthorized ways ant: that they were committing a breach of military custom and regulations if they did so. It wst? further instructed that each commanding officer, when bringing under notice the provisions of the regulations, should make it clear that members of the forces will not be penalized in any way as a result of lodging a genuine coinplaint or grievance in the proper manner. Air Force -Instruction s are in existence members of the Royal Australian Air Force to take grievances to members of Parliament. The importance of an adequate system for the ventilation of individual or collective grievances, and the need for the existence of satisfactory machinery to give effect thereto, are, however, fully appreciated. An elaborate process has therefore been provided in A ir Force Regulation 153, which provides that if an airman considers himself wronged, lie may complain in succession to («) his flight commander; (ft) his squadron commander; (c) his commanding officer; (</) the air or other officer commanding the command in which the airman is serving: (e) if outside Australia or on war service in Australia, the officer in chief lominnnd of the force to which he belongs; and (/) the A ir Board. In addition, a member of the A ' r Force may make a complaint to an inspecting officer. Regulation 153 further provides tn»t any authority to whom a complaint is made or",25,Petrol Rationing

94,Mr Menzies,"On the 28tb August,referred shall not attempt to prevent or dissuade any airman from carrying his complaint to a superior authority in accordance with the regulation and that each authority mentioned shall cause the complaint to be investigated and if it appears that the airman has suffered a wrong, shall cause the wrong to be fully redressed, if full redress is within the power of the authority, or, if investigation or full redress is not within the power of the authority, shall refer the complaint to the next superior authority in order that it may be investigated and redressed as far as possible. It will be seen that, whilst members of the forces arc forbidden to take their grievances to members of Parliament, adequate provision has been made whereby they may have their grievances fully ventilated.

Is it the intention of the Minister to refer tions provide that a claim by a deserted the town planning scheme and proposed government buildings to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for report? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The decision of the Commonwealth Government is that the Administrative Headquarters should be transferred from Rabaul to Lae. The committee which investigated the question of the transfer estimated in 1038 that an expenditure of £370,000 would be involved. Reliable estimates of the cost under existing conditions arc not yet available. 2. The transfer is to be made to Lae, not Wau. It is proposed ultimately to provide at Lae buildings sufficient for the office and residential accommodation of the complete personnel of the Administrative Head-quarters. For the present it is proposed to restrict expenditure to a minimum and to utilize existing buildings at Lac and Snlamaua and to erect at Lae such temporary buildings as may be. necessary. 3. The Administrator of the Territory has been asked to submit detailed proposals in connection with the proposed transfer including plans for the layout of the settlement at Lae. The engineering member of the committee which investigated the question of the selection of a site for the Administrative Head-quarters submitted his views and a plan for a town on modem lines at Lae. 4. The matter will be considered when the plans for the complete Administrative Headquarters at Lae are prepared.

The regulawife and dependants for allotment from the pay of a member of the Military Forces shall be subject to investigation as to the merits of the case. If claim is upheld an allotment is enforced by the prescribed authority. Payment cannot be made retrospective until the position of the soldier's pay-book is ascertained as he may have received pay himself at his full drawing rate, and in other cases an allotment may have already been paid on his behalf. Dependants' allowance is payable only from the date from which an allotment operates.

I assure the honourable member that the matter raised by him is constantly under attention to ensure observance of the principle of equal opportunity, but as it is not apparent that any useful purpose would be served by submitting to the House the list he suggests and as a considerable amount of research would be involved in its preparation, I am unable to accede to the honourable member's request. the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) asked the following questions. upon notice:1.
