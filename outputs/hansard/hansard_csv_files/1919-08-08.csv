"" the Acting Prime Minister has, doubtless, been directed to the fact that certain Australians are engaged in Northern Russia in connection with the military operations which are being carried on there. Raving regard to the fact that these soldiers were not recruited, and are not controlled, by the Australian Government, will the honourable gentleman take the steps necessary to see that the good name of the Australian soldier, and of Australia itself, is not tarnished by association with what so many good Australians conceive to he an iniquitous invasion upon the Russian proletariat ? it is a fact that Australian soldiers are taking part in the occupation of Russia, nor do ' I know the circumstances under which any Australian soldiers who may be in Russia were enlisted. When the war was over, and demobilization was in sight, the Government made it perfectly plain that it was the desire of the people of Australia that the whole of the Australian troops should be returned as early as possible, and should not be used anywhere except on those Fronts where they had been employed prior to the Armistice. However, I will make the necessary inquiries, and inform the honourable member at a later stage.

The desire of the Government has been to so arrange the""personnelof that Commission that it will be equally representative, in the fullest sense of the word, of all the interests affected, and educative upon the question.

The prices fixed by the Government were, approximately, 50 per cent, higher than that, but to-day evejn they have increased by 100 per cent.

That remedy, of course, is impossible, even for children, in the colder parts of 'Australia, and, with 12 degrees of frost, such as we experienced last week, it is a remedy we should not like to see applied in a civilized community like this. The Government ought to take the whole matter into serious consideration. the Government ought to take? ought to be a complete Pool to deal with hides, leather, and boots, for one cannot be dealt with without the other. If we protect the tanner, we must also protect the boot manufacturer, and those who purchase the boots from the retailer. This is an Australian question, which no authority but. the Australian Parliament can deal with -that is not permitted in Australia; and, We are told that Australia at the present time is being flooded with buyers from other parts of the world, and as one who had something to do with the embargo on the exportation of skins and hides, I ask honourable members to look up the statistics of the years just before the war, when they will find that hides and leather from Australia were going to Continental countries. It is quite possible that boots worn by our enemies were made from Australian hides, and that was my fear at the time the embargo was imposed. The result of the embargo was that the tanning trade in Australia received a great impetus, and I believe that Australian leather made a great name for itself. If our tanners can obtain the raw material, they ought to be able to turn out leather equal to that produced in any part of the world. do that, but they do not always try. dency sometimes is to take the hides out of the pits before they are properly tanned in order to get it quickiy on the market. Johnson) -The honourable member's of the House. I must have the Assistant Ministei' for Defence( Mr Wise) present. [Quorum formed.] -This is a most complex question, and it is only by inquiry that the problem to be solved can be realized. Owing to the kindness of men in the business, who are only too glad to afford information, I have recently been able to pay considerable attention to the subject of leather production, right from the bullock's back to the tannery, and into the boot manufactory. No doubt there is a great shortage of hides in Australia, and tanners are unable to procure sufficient for their requirements, owing, I am informed, to the operations of American dealers. It has beeni explained to me that while in other countries tanners are able to "" load"" leather witli glucose and other materials, consequently, it pays foreign buyers to get hides here and .treat them abroad. It will be seen how easy it would be for an American company to operate in Australia, iand almost compel tanners to pay any price the Americans chose to place on the hides. The question requires the most earnest consideration, and if the Government are not careful one section of the industry will be most harshly dealt with. It is absolutely necessary to encourage primary production as far as possible, in order to realize that wealth so essential to our paying our way. There is such a shortage of labour in the tanning trade that many tanners are willingly paying over the award rates, and are welcoming the services of returned soldiers. A t one factory I recently visited I had pointed out to me a number of returned men who were being trained, so as to eventually become experts in a particular branch of the trade: and I hope that other employers will follow this excellent example.",31,Smith An D The Tanners Queensland Is Differentfrom The Hide

130,Mr Laird Smith (Denison) [12.8].,"I should like to see a better understanding between all those who are concerned in the various branches of the leather trade. I read an article the other day which was vary severe on the manufacturer of leather, pointing out that that product is altogether too expensive, and implying that the tanners are responsible. That, however, is not the case. A t one tannery 1 visited I was told of hides purchased in Queensland which had arrived in Melbourne quite unclassified, and quite useless for the purposes of till is manufacturer, owing to the enormous brands on them; indeed, it ia almost impossible to see any portion of a hide without a brand. In my opinion, Australia must be losing considerably every year owing to this unsystematic system of branding. brand than lose the cattle altogether. met with that argument; but, in my innocence, I wonder whether a bullock dies if it is not branded. lock, and somebody else gets it. not go out of existence. change of ownership, that is all. A legislator in the ""Western Australian Parliament, who has given considerable attention to this serious question in a practical way, assured me, in the course of conversation, that the loss owing to unsystematic branding must be about £1,000,000 annually. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr tanners to obtain the hides they require Tudor) spoke of the treatment of glaco kid, patent leather, and other leathers oi the higher class, but he will bear me out that there is considerable risk in the preparation of these leathers. The preparation of patent leather, for instance, is really a science. patent leather is being produced in Australia, but the trouble is the great price of the ingredients used. For instance, there must be the best linseed oil, which has to be treated at a temperature which causes considerable risk of fire in a factory. The profits of the tanner are not as large as many honourable members imagine. very well. member knows more about the raising of cattle than the tanning of leather, and I assure him that the tanners are not making such huge profits as some appear to o believe. The tanning industry should be encouraged. It takes a long time to build up, and now that it is established in Australia the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), must be careful not to do anything that might be disastrous to it. The Iboot manufacturers and the tanners must be prepared to give and take. Boot manufacturers should assist the Australian tanning industry by using oinly Australian' leather. Our leather is quite as good as that made in America, and an important point is that .we do not produce here the boot composition which is prepared in the United States of America, and in which there is practically no leather. I do not think we need be much concerned about the export of leather to the United States of America. I was recently informed by a large firm who had exported leather to America, that the agents and brokers' fees, as well as other costs involved, in placing Australian! leather on the American market, were so heavy that they were no't likely to continue the trade. I would urge the Minister to make it possible for local at a price that will allow the growers a fair and reasonable profit. If that were done, it would go a long way to solve this problem. The situation at present is 'not likely to last. It can be only temporary, since its continuance would be disastrous to those who are sujjposed to be cornering hides. If the price of boots continues to increase, there will be aln upheaval, and the people will insist upon something being done to bring them down to a reasonable level.

In giving to this question the consideration that I know he . will devote to it, the Minister should be careful not to interfere unduly with the tanning industry. We want to develop our industries as much as possible. In every calling, whether it be that of the manufacturer of leather, boots, or any other commodity, I would pay the very highest wages in return for the best work. . When I was working at the bench, it was always my belief that I should do the best possible work, so that I could, conscientiously ask for the very best wages.

They said to the Industrial Workers of the World, "" This sort of thing must stop. If the system which you have introduced is allowed to go on the United States of America will not be able to compete with other parts of the world, and therefore out you must go."" leaders of industry and the industrialists themselves who put these men out. They said to them, "" Y o u are no good to the bosses, to the workers, or to the United States of America, and the sooner you get out, the better for our country."" Johnson) -Order! The honoraible member's time has expired. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) is to be commended for his action in bringing before the House this most t important question, which, having regard to the fact that the price of boot leather is steadily soaring, demands the most careful consideration. The honourable Prices member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith) has made what I should describe as an apologetic speech. He has endeavoured to show that these high prices are due to the scarcity of labour, and the difficulty of securing certain tanning requisites. Does it not appear strange that now that we have more labour available than we have had for four or five years, scarcity of labour should be urged as a reason for tlie increase in prices ? When our men were at the war there might have been a scarcity, but now that we have an abundance of labour, and men looking for employment all over the country, it cannot be said that a shortage of labour is responsible for the steady increase in the price of boots. That argument goes by the board. The honourable member's argument in regard to the increases in wages may be dismissed in the same way. been no increase of wages in the boot making trade for twelve months. going up all the time. Are we to admit that as a Parliament we are impotentthat we cannot protect the people from the profiteering that is taking place, espe-' cially in relation to commodities over which we have complete control? Whatever may be said as to our power to fix prices, it cannot be denied that this Parliament controls the export of hides.

Pastoralists could run their industry successfully and make a profit at the prices prevailing before the war, and there is no justification for such an increase that the sale of. hides alone produces almost sufficient to pay the current expenses of a station, while at the same time the pastoralists are getting more for every pound of beef that is grown. Surely they can afford to let the people of Australia have the hides at the price prevailing before the war. The Minister has power to deal with this matter. He is given no authority under the Constitution to regulate the price of hides,, but he has the power to prohibit their exportation. matter which lies entirely in the hands of the Commonwealth. It is hoodwinking the people to say that the Commonwealth Government cannot control the price of hides. They can do it , if they make use of the provisions of the Customs Act. If they decline to do it , it is useless for this Parliament to ask the people to amend the Constitution so as to give further powers to the Commonwealth, seeing that we do not make use of those we already possess. If the exportation of hides ila prohibited, the Australian tanners will get their raw material ab a ' cheaper price. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has pointed out, provision must also be made to prevent the tanners imposing exorbitant rates. But the position today is that people outside controlling certain commodities practically laugh at Parliament. like. They have no consideration for the general public, so long as they get their pound of flesh. And we permit this sort of thing to continue year after year without making any attempt to cope with it . I am one of those who agree that it is necessary for the Constitution to be amended so that we may regulate many things, but we can do much to cause the fixation of prices by prohibiting exportation. It cannot be argued that the pastoralists will not kill their beasts if the exportation of hides is prohibited. will not pay them to keep their stock on their holdings beyond a certain time. Mr Charlton. The beasts must be killed. Therefore, if we prevent the exportation of hides until they can be purchased in Australia at a reasonable price, it will not affect the price of meat. The matter is easily regulated. A little backbone on the part of Ministers is required. In stead of the Government pandering to the wealthy, it is time they pandered a little to the poorer section of the community, or had some regard to their interests. We have too much pandering to certain people, with the result that they are gathering in immense wealth at the expense of the balance of the community. We have the power to deal with this matter.

What the honourable member said was that he had no objection to the Australian price rising to the export parity. I have no doubt that under normal conditions he would hold that view, and the only question we have to consider is whether, under the abnormal conditions which exist throughout the world to-day, we should .adopt measures which would result in tlie deliberate depression of prices in this country. We have to consider the wisdom or otherwise of taking that step. It is perfectly clear from what the honourable member said, when I asked him to make a suggestion, that he realizes the fundamental (iiflioulities in the way of dealing with this question except in a very complete fashion. ber sees that the mere prohibition of the export of hides, which was urged by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Act, honoraible members on both sides of Charlton), would simply have the result of putting money into the pockets of some other party instead of into the pockets of the producer. If the Government control the export and the prices of hides and leather, and not the export and the prices of boots, the money, instead of going into the pockets of the producers and tanners, will reach the pockets of the boot manufacturers. The honourable member for Hunter has not done himself the credit of considering whither his proposal to simply prohibit the export of hides would lead him. the Government would require to take measures to protect the consumers against the tanners also. ber talked about an embargo on the export of hides, but I heard him say very little about leather. The question has been raised as to whether there has been to date an undue say that. I export of hides. So far from that being the case since the removal of the embargo on the 14th May of this year, the number of hides exported has been nothing like as great as the number exported in the years before the war. hides has been exported during the last three months? three months we exported only 33,128 hides.

Sometimes, to meet the convenience of the commercial community, and permit of lockers' attendance and so on, it is desirable to be able to collect other fees. This alteration w ill meet that case.

The reason for the alteration is that we have experienced great difficulty w it h some countries in ascertaining what the home consumption value of goods is. There are some countries manufacturing and exporting goods which those countries do not themselves use, so that there is no home-consumption value. Japan, China, and, to some extent, India, manufacture and export goods which are not consumed in those countries, and there is nothing by which the value can be checked. we are asking the House to agree that while we lay down what shall be the value for duty purposes, that value in no case shall be less than the genuine in voice value. goods at a very low value compared w it h the value of similar goods in other countries ?

If , in the country from which the goods are exported, there is no basis of comparison between the genuine invoice value and the price at which those goods could be purchased by some one desiring to use them in that country, then, we say that the genuine invoice value at least should be taken. We do not say that something may not be added to the invoice value.

TheB ill merely lays down the means of determining th© value for duty. The provision's of clauses 11, 12, and 13 are designed to reduce, as f a r as possible, the number of investigations in the country of export, to prevent the consequent delay in the adjustment of any duty that might have been short-paid, and to show in clear, unmistakable language what the practice of the Department at the present time is. These clauses should overcome a lot of difficulty on the part of both i m porters and the Department in arriving at the value on which duty is payable. While limiting the number of claims against importers for short payment' of duty, it will also prevent a large loss of revenue and assist in the protection of Australian industries. Clause 14 merely repeals the provision in section 169 of the principal Act as to the continuance of inter-State duties by the State of Western Australia.

If the officers on a Customs launch are given this power to search a suspected boat, the probability is that there will be less smuggling than now goes on.

Needless to say, no one has anything to fear from these provisions except the man who wants to defraud the revenue. A Collector of Customs will not be able to act under these clauses unless he has information on oath leading him to suspect that some one is endeavouring to defraud the revenue. In such circumstances, we propose to give him powers which, although fairly drastic, are necessary, we believe, to prevent fraud. Under the existing law, if a Collector, having reason to suspect that a man is defrauding the revenue, calls on him and asks for the production of documents, the person suspected may decline to hand them over until he has consulted his solicitor. When the Collector, or his officer, calls again, he is allowed to search the place, because the desired documents have been disposed of ih the meantime. Under this Bill, however, when a warrant has been issued as the result of sworn information coming into the possession of a Collector of Cmstoins, the premises of the man searched. tleman say that the Department has not that power at the present time? honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best), I am sure, will recall many cases where such searches have been made. involving £4,000. power has been exercised; but, as I have already said, a Collector of Customs was sued for trespass and I think we lost the case.

Clause 20 of the Bill has been drafted by the Crown Law authorities to meet a difficulty which has arisen owing to a judgment of the High Court. In that case a limited liability company was charged with intent to defraud the revenue, but the Court held that, under section 241 of the present Act, the defendant company could not be convicted of an attempt to defraud. It is very undesirable that this position should continue, and clause 20 has been drafted accordingly to remedy the defect. In order to prevent the risk of similar decisions being given by other Courts, it is made retrospective. back? sary to make the B ill retrospective to that extent, but at the same time there are other Statutes which will probably limit its operation. involved. ber will know better than I do, but it is suspected may be immediately certainly an anomaly that, at the present time, while a person who is importing can be found guilty of fraud, a company doing exactly the same thing cannot.

254,Mr Greene,"I cannot see thatClause 21 provides one of W most i m portant amendments. In a Customs case the H i g h Court ruled, on appeal from a decision of the magistrate, that, in any case in which section 255 was used, reliance must be placed entirely on the averment, consequently precluding the calling of evidence on matters in regard to which proof was possible. pointed out other defects in the section, and the amendment seeks to remedy these. I do not profess to know as much ahout this matter as a lawyer would, but as I understand the position, it is this: The Customs Department is called upon to make an averment of fact in certain cases. Apparently the H i g h Court has ruled that the Department must rely upon that averment for the proof of a case, and is not permitted to call evidence in support of it . The provision in the Bill has been drafted by the Crown Law authorities to get over the difficulty, and enable the Department to call evidence in support of ah averment.

He said that it was only a little measure, but after hearing the explanation of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), I find that there are one or two clauses which are really vital to the whole Customs system of Australia. The clause dealing with the fair market value of goods is really the backbone of the collection of duties. The honourable members for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) and Eden Monaro( Mr Chapman) have had sufficient experience in the Customs Department to know that it is the one thing It also upon which most of the criticism from outside persons has been based. partment get at the value of goods now ? lined in the clause. plain English what has been the practice of the Department. if more duty can be obtained by accepting the local value than by accepting the foreign value, the practice of the Department is to take the higher, whatever it is ? is alwayfa accepted as the invoice value at the time of shipment. That is to say, the fair market value of the goods at the time of shipment is arrived at by adding all the f.o.b. charges, not including in surance, freight, and exchange -The Minister explains that clauses 11, 12, and This 13 will obviate a great deal of investigation which is now carried out in countries of export. The Customs Department was being systematically robbed by persons who were importing goods. I was in Court when the notorious motor car case was being tried, and after the defendant had pleaded guilty to every other charge, I the prosecuting barrister said, "" Now we come to case X . "" He explained that, in this case, there were three invoices-the one produced for Customs purposes, the genuine invoice, and the one produced to sell the goods. I understand the values varied in each case. In one case the value was £ 6 0 0 , in the second case it was £ 8 0 0 , and in the t h i r d case it was £1,000. The article in question being a I undermotor car, the whole of it was not duti able. The importer loaded the value of the chassis, which was not dutiable, and unloaded the value of the tyres and body, which were dutiable. The total value of the car was not disturbed, but the value of the dutiable portion of it was fixed at a low figure corresponding w i th the in creased value put upon the portion which",46,Robert Best Th E Power For Point

Another system very familiar to the omcers of the Department is the house-to-house transaction. A f i r m making goods for Australia, which has also a house in Australia, instead of putting its profit on the value of the goods before exporting them, added it after the goods had been landed in Australia. But, to use an Americanism, the Department "" is wise"" to that procedure. Section 154, dealing with f a i r market value, is apparently being rephrased in the B ill . There have been a great many law cases regarding the determination of the f a i r market value of i m ported goods, and recently Mathew Goode and Company, of Adelaide, objected, as a matter of principle, to the departmental decision npon that question. The amount of duty involved was small, but no doubt the decision of the Court meant hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Department. I know that when in connection with the .1907-8 T a r if f a question was raised regarding the payment of duty on packages or containers, a tremendous amount of revenue in the aggregate was involved. In the Adelaide case, the H i g h upon the question of f a i r market value, but apparently this B ill is designed to I believe that the system give specific legal effect to the practice that has been in' operation, and to give protection to the Department in other It will need to be conrespects. That is perfectly right. Clause 19 confers power on the Department to enter houses and premises, and to seize documents. The Department has been doing that a l l along. Of course, no person lilies to fight the Government, who are sure to w in in the end, because they have the power of the whole people behind them. Raids and searches have taken place in every city in Australia, and would take place even, without the power which clause 19 w ill confer. If this provision is necessary to further safeguard the Department, I shall support it . I remember that on one occasion, while I was Ministerf o r Trade and Customs, acting on certain information that reached the Department, we raided three different places simultaneously. A t one of those places the manager said to the officers, "" Excuse me a moment""; and he left the room. When he returned, he",47,Robert Best Th E Power For Point

The Department should have, if it has not, power to raid and search. It also should have power to search boats, as Well as ships. If this Bill is merely giving effect to an existing practice, it is a step in the right direction. We should not, however, make clause 20 retrospective to 1901. I do not stand up as the advocate of any firm that has committed fraud; but we might proceed to-day against a corporate party for an offence iu 1901 or 1902, and the whole of the persons who then constituted that body might have disappeared.

If it is held that we can make this measure retrospective to 1901, it may be held that we can do the same with every other Act, and that might inflict hardship upon innocent persons, who might not have the opportunity after such a lapse of time to produce evidence in answer to the charge made against them. To the Bill as a whole I have no objection. --The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) is to be congratulated upon having introduced this Bill. A caref u l examination of the Act will show that, although the Bill may propose a technical ProbaWy the three firms were alteration, no substantial change in the existing law is being attempted. What the Minister is very properly trying to do is to give merchants and the public generally full and complete knowledge, by a perspicuous statement, of what the law and the practice of the Department are. I do not think any clause of the Bill confers powers which have not been substantially exercised by every Minister for Trade and Customs. If any Minister is convinced that a fraud on the Department is being attempted, he is justified, in the discharge of his duty, in resorting to despotic powers, even though he be technically exceeding his statutory authority, in order that justice may be done to the community. In proposing to repeal the section dealing with fair market value, and to substitute a more elaborate provision, the Minister is doing justice to the Department and the public. The question of fair market value is of the very essence of Customs law. No Of course, I question is more consistently before officers, and they have the greatest responsibility to exercise in connection with it. The difficulties associated with the discharge of their duty are very great. Of course, there is not the same trouble in getting the fair market value from some of the chief ports of export as there is in respect of others,, because a number of merchants are exporting from those ports, and the fair market value may be established by a study of the various invoices and catalogues. By this process, and a consistent effort to collate all available information, the Department has a remarkably good idea of what the real market value of such imports is. But the dislocation caused by the war has gravely accentuated the difficulties, because some of the most^ important troubles which have arisen, involving serious hardship, have been in respect of contrabts over a term of years entered into by Australian merchants importing goods from America, the United Kingdom, or elsewhere. They contracted to buy at particular prices. Subsequent to the outbreak of war the goods increased",48,Robert Best Th E Power For Point

No doubt the Minister will in due time come down with a Customs Tariff Act providing for preferential duties, and no doubt the honourable member for Parkesj finding that Pree Trade is an exploded superstition in the minds of the majority pf the people of Australia, will abandon his Pree Trade advocacy, and declare himself a thorough believer in preferential Tariffs. Why? Preferential trade offers a haven of refuge for the Pree Trader. cated in this House, the late Sir George Reid, Sir Joseph Cook, and other Pree Traders confessed their belief in it. Trader. member still believes in Pree Trade, and will die a Pree Trader, and in the odour of sanctity. I suggest that the Minister should introduce into the Bill a prescribed form on which may be stated the rate of wages being paid in connection with the goods which certain people will want to introduce into this country under a preferential Tariff. If we are going to give preferential trade to anybody, even to the United Kingdom, there ought to be provision made that, where preferential duties obtain, an exporter or importer, in order to get the benefit of them, must certify that the goods are made by labour ]>aid at trade-union rates of wages for a trade-union number of hours. We have no right to give preference to people who have not the milk of human kindness in their breasts, and who have no consideration for their employees. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) is now present, because I wish to remind him of his words the other day, when he said honourable members were mistaken in thinking he knew anything about the Shipping Combine, because he had no interest in shipping, excepting so far as the dividends which he draws are concerned. Honourable members should show a broad and tolerant religious spirit. Johnson) I do not see thatthis has to do with the Customs Bill. allowed time, I might be able to connect my remarks. Thorold Rogers, the economist is. ber know that Thorold Rogers says that the workers of the world have gained more by trade unionism than by any other institution? No one to-day would deny the benefits and justice of trade unionism, which ought to be recognised in the certificates at the Customs Department. I should like the Minister, When the idea was first advoin the interval between now and when he introduces the Tariff Bill, to consider these few observations. I was born a Eree cedure relating to the admission of goods under a preferential Tariff would more properly come under a machinery Bill than under a Tariff Bill. member is quite right. The Bill will not pass this afternoon, and I hope the Minister for Trade and Customs will prepare a form of certificate such as I have suggested. I am not prepared to vote for' preference to men who decline to recognise trade unionism, or who take no more interest in their employees than the honourable member for Parkes takes in shipping, but have regard only to the dividends which they produce. Every patriot, alleged and bond fide, can substantiate what I have said iu regard to trade unionism. However strong a man may be in his belief bhat the British Empire has nothing to learn from any other Empire, he will admit that the sweater in the United Kingdom should not be able to introduce his goods here under a preferential Tariff with the same facility as may an upright, honest, fair-minded employer, whose interest goes beyond his dividends. I shall venture to test the feeling of the House when the Bill is in Committee; and I presume we may hope to get the support of all National Labour mem-",51,Robert Best Th E Power For Point

I cannot, on the present occasion, point out the effect of such a policy on other nations, and the good that might ensue if we insisted on certificates of the kind. What objection could there be, for example, to giving preferential treatment to an exporter on the other side of the world, say in the United States of America, if he could prove that he paid a higher rate of wages, and worked his employees a fewer number of hours than any other?

I desire tb deal very briefly w i th two matters I promised to inquire into during the course of the week. able member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) asked me a question regarding the answer to a request by certain mining companies for permission to dispose of their output of copper without reference to the Copper Producers Association. I have since conferred with the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom), who has had the matter under his control for the last few weeks, and am now able to inform the honourable member for Darling that a conference was held on the 14th to 16th July, at which representatives of the Commonwealth and the State Governments were present, and at which the whole copper situation was discussed. the conference, an agreement was drawn like the honourable member up and posted to the Premiers of the various States. Replies from all the States have not yet been received, so I am unable at present to make an announcement; but as soon as the matter is finalized, a statement on the subject w ill be made in the House. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Tudor) on two occasions during the week inquired as to the proposed appointment of ten fourth class clerks in the Taxation Office. I have looked into the matter, which, from a rapid perusal of the file, I find is somewhat complicated and technical. The papers consist mainly of letters between the Public ServiceI n spector and the Public Service Commissioner, and it has already been ruled by past Governments that these are privi leged documents, and should not be made available. Moreover, certain appeals are now being heard against the cerned; and as, in a Public Service sense, the matter is sub judice, I do not think ON TRANSPORTS: ""PORT Table as suggested. TAX first asked a question about these clerks, I have learned a little more about the Taxation Department, and the desire of those concerned was to have the file made available for the purposes of an inquiry which is proceeding. I further understand that some, if not the whole, of these men were recommended by the Public Service Inspector, but were turned The honordown by the Government, who, in effect, refused to accept efficiency as the ground for appointment. The case was taken to the High Court, which held that efficiency should be the ruling factor, and that there was the righ t of appeal. I do not know any of these men, and I am not discussing the merits of their case; but I am told that the Inspector holds that the most efficient men should be selected. If tliere is anything that the Public Service Act stands for, it is the recognition of efficiency, to the exclusion of favouritism; but if the Government can ignore the recommendations of the In spector, based as they are on efficiency, the whole basis of the Act is broken down. As a result of I know that Senator Millen said, in an-",52,Robert Best Th E Power For Point

I have since been officially informed that returned soldiers' badges would not be issued to personnel of the Australian Imperial Force who embarked after the date of the armistice. [4.1] I gather from this afternoon's Melbourne Herald that the Government have refused the request of the executive of the Seamen's Union. In common with many other honourable members. I have not interfered in this matter, because I think it best that the head of the Governsay that in France with their own regiment and the Seamen's Union should deal with it. But seeing that everybody desires a settlement of the existing dispute, I am of opinion that the Government might have conceded that request. Of course, they may have their reasons for declining to do so, but, nevertheless, I am perly fed on the voyage out here. I would sorry that some arrangement has not been arrived at. I wish now to say a few words regarding the food supplied to our returned soldiers on the voyage from the other side of the world. It seems to me that there has to be a mutiny on a vessel before facts in connection with the collection any exposure can be made of what takes place there. Quite recently we witnessed the sorry spectacle of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yate3) being gaoled ' for having done his duty. He was gaoled innocently. I followed his case pretty closely, and I have not the slightest doubt secretary of the movementa man who that he was gaoled because he exhibited a little human feeling. ship Port Li/ttle ton arrived here on Tuesnoon that this entertainment was to take day and is still in port. Seven of the men place he was very busy, and accordingly who returned by her have assured me that the stew supplied to the soldiers on board, especially after leaving South Africa, was quite inedible. Now, any man can make a stew which is palatable. Yet these young men positively affirm that the stew supplied the troops on that vessel was so bad that it could not be pudding was to all intents and purposes, bullets. As they could not reach their Officer Commanding, they placed some very hard puddings outside his cabin door for New England (Lt and he ordered them to be thrown overboard. Commanding ? name is Weld. The boys have assured me that had it not been for the bread and jam which was served to them they could not have subsisted. I desire to know whether the Government will agree to two returned soldiers on the other side of the Chamber, and two from this side, being appointed a Committee to confer with the troops who returned by the vessel in question, in order that they may learn the facts as to how they were treated on the way out. The men admit that the food could have been worse. But they mental cooks they obtained much better fare. The captain of the Port Lyttleton endeared himself to the men, who made him a presentation before their departure from the vessel, but the Officer Commanding did not see that the troops were prolike to know whether the Government can see their way to agree to my suggestion. [4.7] -Before the illness of the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) I intimated that I would bring before the House some of the entertainments tax in New South Wales.

306,Mr Hector Lamond (Illawarra),"asked a young man to go to the post office and procure the amusements' tax tickets. This young man was delayed by a game of football, and as a result, when he arrived at the post-office he found that it was closed. The Committee then had either to postpone tlie entertainment at an hour's notice or to proceed, and afterwards settle matters with the Department. They naturally decided to proceed, and the entertainmient was duly held. The following day an inspector from the Taxation Department interviewed the secretary of the movement, and on the 24th March the f u l l amount of the tax, together with a complete explanation of all the circumstances was forwarded to the Department. Notwithstanding this fact, proceedings were instituted against the secretary, and upon the summons being received a gentleman, who had interested himself in the matter, wrote to the solicitor who had been engaged by the other side, intimating that the secretary would plead guilty, that the circumstances had already been explained to the Department, and asking that no witnesses be called, and that as light a penalty as possible be inflicted. this, the Department sent its inspector down to tlie Court, claimed his expenses for appearing there, and also professional costs in the case. outrageous that the magistrate, who heard the case, commented upon the .excessive costs, and intimated that if any application for a remission of them were made to the Department he would support it . This is not merely a case affecting a miner at B u l l i . We entrust the officers of the Taxation Department with the exercise of the most autocratic powers, and we are told that they administer their Department in the spirit in which Parliament intended it to be administered-in other words, that they exercise sweet reasonableness on all occasions. But I can point to another case in the Department, showing that this is not so, and that taxpayers are proceeded against for the most trivial offences. Regard is not always paid to the fact that a great number of taxpayers are ordinary working men who think that a difficulty can be adjusted if right be on their side, merely by interviewing the head of the Department. W it h reference to the case of the [430] B u l l i band, I wrote to the Deputy Commissioner in New South Wales and received a letter to the effect that he had no jurisdiction to reduce the penalty imposed by the Court. He does not indicate that any one in the Department has power to remit the fiine, or to meet the case in any way. If that power does not rest w it h some official in the Department, it should do so. It is not right that any one officer in a Department should .be able, in the circumstances I have outlined, to inflict upon an ordinary working man a penalty that may represent two or three weeks of his labour and that there should be no red:ress. I hope that it w ill 'be found that some one has power to. interfere w it h this nutocratic administration of the Department, and that a more reasonable attitude wall be adopted towards people who have no desire to infringe the law, but seek Tather to benefit their fellows by their association w it h patriotic or charitable enterprises. Notwithstanding I desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) the following letter from two returned soldiers :These claims were so Modella, 4th August, 1919. Dr. Maloney, Dear Sir -Pleas e excuse tlie liberty I am taking in addressing you, ibut, knowing you so long, and that you are always ready to expose a wrong action, I am sending you one of a .pair of boots which my mate bought Friday, the 1st August, and only had them on his feet on Saturday, 2nd August.

307,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4.11],"at 10s. 6d. per pair. It is supposed to be a watertight boot, tongue-fastened in the ordinary way. I have submitted it to an expert, who tells me that the leather is of the most inferior quality. Surely it is time to take action against the exploiters and others who are battening upon, not only the general public, but OUT returned soldiers. I would urge upon the Acting Prime Minister that some inquiry should be instituted without delay into the complaints made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews). My knowledge of tlie conditions obtaining on the other side of the world convinces me that there should not be any difficulty ajn obtaining good food on a transport. AH the transports before leaving the Old Country are specially examined, not only by responsible officers of the Defence Department, but by an honoraible member of this House( Mr Heitmann). Before a transport leaves port, the accommodatioin, set apart for the men, 'the general living conditions, the cooking facilities on board, the matter to be cleared up, because it is and the food supply are specially investigated. It is because of this knowledge that I urge the 'Government to have a special investigation .made of the complaints regarding tlie conditions prevailing on the Port Lyttleton. We cannot allow our soldiers, whether their period of war service has been long or short, to come back here with complaints regarding She food supply oin. board transports. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports stated that when the complaint was voiced the men could not meet the Officer Commanding the troops on board. That, to me, is absolutely unthinkable. same sort of thing to happen here in Melbourne. I have known officers to be unable to reach the Commandant. member will admit that the circumstances are not the same. When men are on board ship for six or seven weeks, the opportunities for approaching the Officer Commanding Troops are innumerable. These men should have pressed their case more strongly than 'they did. I am not advocating insurrection The men have to mutiny to have their complaint attended to. ready means by which these grievances can be redressed. I am entirely with the honourable member in asking for an investigation, which .would 'be iiru the interests of, not only the men .themselves, but the ship and officers in charge. terested in the supply of bad food ?

The various Governments, and particularly the Commonwealth Government, are paying a per capita rate for the transport of the men'. feeling against the skipper of the ship, because they have made him a presentation. manifestly wrong that such a condition of affairs should be permitted on any ship. I could have understood such trouble occurring immediately after the signing of the Armistice, because at that time the food position in the Old Country was' entirely different from what it must have ibeen When these men left about June last. Plenty of time had elapsed after the signing of the Armistice to allow food conditions to improve. to any extent in the matter of prices. more particularly of the quantity and quality of the food. There is no question that supplies from Canada and the United 'States of America reached the Old Country within a few months of the signing of 'the Armistice. I urge the Acting Prime Minister to agree to the request made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports; and I believe that, as suggested by him, there should be a special, rather than an ordinary, departmental inquiry. --' I desire to bring under the notice of",55,Staff Deportations Pub Matter I Understand That I T Was Proposed Service Pbefeeence To Re To Appoint Ten Fourth Class Clerks To The

Some twelve or eighteen months after the outbreak of the war I made representations in this House to the effect that a number of men who were anxious to enlist could not do so because they were below the standard height of 5 f t . 5 in. The result was that the standard was reduced to 5 f t . 3 in,, and hundreds of men able . to conform to the reduced standard enlisted, and went to the Front. Many of them had served as sergeant-majors before the war, and some of them were told, by means of circular, that if they applied .to go to the Front their action would be regarded as a breach of discipline, because their services were required in Australia to train members of the Australian Imperial Force. iSome of these men have returned only to find that, because they do not come up to the old standard of 5 f t . 5 in., and have a chest measurement of less than 37 inches, they are debarred from appointment to the permanent Instructional Staff, notwithstanding that they have qualified by examination and otherwise for such appointments.
