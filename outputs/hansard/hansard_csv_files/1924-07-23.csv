The Building Of Capital Ships Has Been Stopped By The ""Washington Treaty. Cipal Trade Route Would Be, Not Through The Indian Ocean, But Round The Cape Of Good Hope. Would Operate On Our Principal Trade Routes, Wherever They Might Be. Argument Advanced By Supporters Of The. Bill Is That The Cruisers Must Be Built To Protect Our Trade Routes. We Are Endeavouring In Australia, And People In Other Countries Are Endeavouring, To Cultivate What May Be Termed The Sentiment Of Peace. I N That Connexion, I Was Very Much Im","pressed by a leading article that appeared in the Age of the 26th January last. I do not often quote that newspaper in support of my views. The article dealt with the training of youth. We believe in so educating the young people of this country as to qualify them for citizenship, but a large number of people would have .our boys drilled until they become emcient in the use of arms. In the teaching of history we adopt wrong methods, and inculcate wrong principles-if , indeed, we can call them principles. A new reading of history is now being suggested. The Age, in the article to which I have realienated from one another. It adds that ferred, said that history in the past had been largely ""names of battles and lists of dates."" Those of us who have perused history books know that they deal largely with bloodshed and battles, as if those were the principal events in the past. The Age quoted from a book entitled History and its Place in Education, by Professor J. J. Findlay, of Manchester, who pointed out that the kind of history taught in our schools, not only in this, but also in other parts pf the world, is keeping civilization in constant peril. Reformers, therefore, are seeking to cultivate a new sentiment, based on a new interpretation of history, ""which will keep patriotism within bounds, checked by a devotion to internationalism, an all-embracing social sense, such as will unite the nations in one brotherhood."" I know that some people will take exception to that view, and I confess that I was quite surprised to find that the Age was willing to* support the sentiments in Professor Findlay's book, and to urge that it was time we reformed our method of teaching history by inculcating ideas that would promote peace and brotherhood. The Australian Labour party is accused of belonging to the International Peace Society,, but even a paper like the Age, owned and controlled by capitalists, is prepared, atany rate once in a while, to publish an article pn this subject that meets with my The hearty .approval. If we can teach theyoung people of Australia in the way recommended by Professor Findlay, we shall be doing much to abolish war. The article went on to say that "" History ini the past has been a mere travesty on history."" Watt) .7-The honourable member's remarks are but distantly related to the -motion or the amendment. He is discussing an educational problem. the relationship of nations, and allegesthat the educational system of the past has been used to foster hatred and antagonism, instead of a spirit of brotherhood. If we could foster and maintain an international spirit of brotherhood, war would certainly never troxible the nations. That article says that history has beenused to foster the basest elements in human nature, and keep the nations Australia should be increasingly devoted to the cause of international peace, and that our children should be increasingly instrucjted upon those lines. I join in that advocacy because I believe that such instruction will lead to international peace.

I urge the honourable membeito read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest its contents. I have previously quoted from the speeches delivered by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) when, as a private member, he was our delegate to the meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, in 1921. All of them show that he was a.t that time a man of peace. I make one more quotation from his speechesWith regard to the primary objective of rendering war more difficult, it seems to me that little has been done cism is that it would be better to concentrate more upon our primary objective and wait for a time when we can, with advantage, take up with enthusiasm the subsidiary matters that we have to deal with. The greatest question with regard to our primary objective is, of course, become strong in manufacture, and if the question of disarmament. Over and over again, at Geneva, the right honourable gentleman stressed the necessity for disarmament. was sitting, the message from the then President of the United States of America, the late Mr Warren G. Harding, convening a disarmament conference at Washington, was received, and the assembly expressed its approval of the efforts of the American President, and wished them God-speed. I suggest that the sentiments expressed by the Australian delegates on that occasion correctly represent Australian people, and I wish that the Prime Minister were uttering the same sentiments to-day. He apparently spoke then w it h conviction in favour of peace, and I cannot understand why he now submits to Parliament a measure which, instead of forwarding the cause of disarmament, proposes the construction of the biggest war vessels which the Washington Treaty permits Australia to build. I hope this Parliament w ill seriously consider the proposal by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, that the construction of these vessels shall be postponed. is a very modest request. Travellers bring to us contradictory tales of war preparations by other nations. We are told that Eussia is preparing for war*-whic h I do not believe-and that Germany is again arming to the teeth. In my modest way, I claim to voice the sentiments of AusI t publishes tralian democracy, and I know that those who speak for the democracies of other countries speak a language different from that used by the war-mongers. This is pre-eminently. the time when we should be preaching the gospel of peace, and setting a splendid example to other nations by refraining, for the present, from the building of further armaments. By such restraint Australia would be giving an object-lesson to the world, and making a notable gesture in favour of peace. I hope honourable members w ill realize that, instead of constructing cruisers which w ill be useless, it would be better to adopt the policy, suggested by the Acting Leader of the Opposition Hy criti( Mr Anstey), of paying more attention to the building up of our factories, and establishing an organization which would be useful in peace as well as in war.

It seems to be customary for a proposal that emanates from the Opposition to meet with the hostility of members on the ministerial side, but I ask Government supporters to deal with the amendment on its merits, and analyse its meanThat ing. Another conference is proposed, at which the cause of disarmament may be advanced a further stage. The Labour party is consistent in its advocacy of international peace, and our leader ( Mr. Charlton) has just departed f b r Europe to attend the next meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva.",22,Setup

The opponents of Labour live very largely as political "" of the intentions of the Labour party, and in this debate they still further misrepresent us. I say definitely that honourable members on this side of the House, and the Labour party generally, are prepared to provide for Australian defence. Every opportunity has been taken by the Leader and other members of the Labour party, when the question of defence has been debated in this House, to place their opinions before the people of Australia. There is every prospect of a further disarmament conference being held in the near future, and, as a result of its deliberations, just as we sunk the Australia because of the decision of the Washington Conference, so it may be necessary for us to sink any new cruisers constructed by this Government. Members opposite have stated that Japan is the potential enemy of Australia. I noticed the other day, in one of the Melbourne newspapers, an article by Mr Gullett, respecting Japan and our fear of her. Japan carried out her obligations under tbe Washington Treaty, and will certainly conform with any decision that may be arrived at by the conference of the League of Nations, shortly to be held at Geneva. We have nothing to fear from that country This is the paragraph that recently appeared in the Melbourne press:Mr H. S. Gullett, who has spent four montlis defence: seems to coincide -with that which in Japan, as special commissioner from the existed just prior to the Labour party Melbourne Herald, returned to Australia. He has had unique opportunities for studying assuming office in 1910. In that regard Japanese problems and conditions from the I wish to reply to the statement made by [94] Australian point of view. His conclusions must prove of the greatest interest and importance to the people of this country. . Pending the Mr Gullett set out twelve definite conclusions, the first three reading1. Australia has little to fear from Japan for 25 or 30 years. But I am 2. Japan had, even before the earthquake, deliberately resolved upon a radical change in her foreign policy, and had decided, temporarily at least, to modify her disposition towards aggression and colonizing expansion. 3. Japan is definitely committed to a fundamental change in her system of government. She is proceeding to set up a democracy in the place of the present rigid, if benevolent, despotism by a small military clique acting in the name of the Emperor. The conference of the League of Nations will certainly deal with defence, and for that reason we should stay our hands and bodies because of their misrepresentation not construct these cruisers until Australia knows the decision of the conference. The defence proposals ;of the Labour party are of a practical nature, designed mainly to protect Australia from invasion, and they will be placed before the people at a suitable time. We have no right to expend £2,000,000 of the people's money for the building of cruisers whilst a conference is being held to bring about the peace of the world. This money should rather be spent on the development of Australia. There is urgent need for the construction of roads and railways, and, as a representative of South Australia, I contend that £2,000,000 could be better spent on the construction of the North-South line, thus honouring the Commonwealth Government's pact with the South Australian Government. The Acting Leader of the Opposition, in moving his amendment, does not aim at inadequate provision for the general defence of Australia. He merely proposes to defer the -construction of the two cruisers until such time as a conference of the League of Nations is held to bring about further disarmament among the nations concerned.

Teh years ago, the Conservative Government of the day did not get down to tin tacks for the defence of Australia. The proposal at that time was to borrow a certain sum of money for defence purposes. The honourable member for Eichmond also said that on this question there were two outstanding features-financ e and defence. The Conservative Government of a decade ago mixed up these features well. £3,000,000 to buy a dreadnought, to be put in tihe North Sea. The Labour -party disapproved of that decision, in the same way as it disapproves of the proposals of the present Government. When the time came for the Laboui' party to act, it laid down for Australia a system of defence second to none in the world. Nothing was left unprovided for. Today, Government supporters"" criticize the Labour party for its attitude on defence, yet I well recollect, although I was not a member of this House at the time, the pseudo-admiral of the day, a member of the Conservative Government, saying "" What is the use of riverdestroyers ? We have no rivers for them to go up."" That statement is on record. The same man when he became Minister for the Navy later on, used to speak of the navy we established as a ""tin-pot fleet."" The same thing is being said to-day, in different words. established fleet,"" which included the capital ship Australia. It has been left to the Conservative party, not only to sink the Australia, but to sink valuable material with her, without any regard for the financial side of ithe defence problem. Although the Australia is now at the bottom of the ocean, her memory will remain a monument to the sagacity of the Labour party in preparing for the defence of their native land. member mean to say that we should have repudiated the Washington Treaty1 ber advised me, I am getting down to tintacks. If the points prick him, the fault is not mine. I did not ask him to sit on them. We also made provision for proper equipment for the defence of Aus-^ tralia. We realized that clothing equipment was necessary, and we established the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. We did not desire that the cormorants of private enterprise should be in a position to secure a ."" rake-off"" on military contracts. We established one of the finest: and most up-to-date woollen mills. We established also a harness factory, because, as every one knows, harness is a big factor in the equipment of a land force. That factory supplied harness of the highest quality. I have been inI t decided to borrow formed that the farmers of Victoria would have been only too pleased to buy the harness they required from the Commonwealth Harness Factory. What ha* <become of those factories. Like the Australia, the woollen mills and the harnessfactory have been sunk by the partyopposite. The Labour party alsoestablished a Small Arms Factory to meet the necessities of the nation for defence. In accordance with the psychology of the time, w e ' established a system for the training of the manhood of Australia in discipline and the use of arms. For that purpose we adopted a policy of practical conscription. While the party on this side has gone back upon that, because we believe that in the opinion of the electorsof Australia the system is no longer necessary, I am prepared to continue that system along somewhat different linesWe neglect now some essentials in the The Labour party education of youth, and I think that we the so-called "" tin-pot should adopt some such system for the physical development of our people. Noone can estimate the advantages which, would follow from such a policy. Wecould carry it out without making the trainees part of the military machine. If we spent the amount proposed for defence in giving effect to such a policy,, we could provide a gymnasium and a. bath in every school. I have been called a dreamer for expressing such' views, but I think the day will comewhen action will be taken .along thoselines.

It might be necessary that we should have cruisers to protect our trade routes, and that is the only reason given for the Government proposal.

I point out that Mr Gullett, as mentioned by the honourable member for Grey( Mr. Lacey) has been in Japan recently. As a journalist, he was in touch w i th people who would not be interviewed by ordinary individuals, aud he said that we are immune from any menace from Japanf o r the next 25 years. Sof a r as naval and military equipment is concerned, Japan is a first class nation; but if we are immune for the next 25 years from any attack by J apan, where is the anticipated attack coming from ?

26,Mr Yates,"The democracies of tofrom which we may expect attack. There is no doubt about that. Japan we might be more likely to secure peace than by discussing this proposal for the building of cruisers. We are told that they are necessary, and honourable members opposite half say, or dare not say, that the expected attack is from Japan. We know the holocaust that occurred some few months ago in Japan through a devastating earthquake. If such a thing had occurred in Australia we should have been down and out for the next 50 years. I believe, with MrN Gullett, t nat that r catastrophe has prevented Japan even from thinking of making war against any nation for thc next 25 years. The honourable member for Richmond shakes his head, but I do not know whether he has visited Japan, and he writes with some authority and knowledge of world's affairs, -because he followed the Great War. Though he did not fight in it, perhaps he had an opportunity of seeing more of the game than fhose who actually took part in it . He says that there is no menace from Japan, ""and I am not prepared to say that there is. think that the earthquake is our insurance in the matter. think so either. From what I have read, I believe that Japan is becoming more democratized, and once the democracy is in charge, there will be no killing merely for the sake of killing. Unless the Government is in a position to prove that our menace is from Japan, it has no right to set up that menace as a justification for its proposal. member reasons for believing that the menace is from Japan. told us that Japan is negotiating for a pact with Germany, and is carrying out the biggest naval programme in her history. I can hardly conceive that to be right in view of Mr Gullett's statement that Japan is observing every detail of the Washington Treaty. Those who are in favour of the construction of two cruisers should tell us by whom we are menaced. I remember that in the eighties there was some difficulty with Russia, and at that time a lamp was fixed on top of the Adelaide Post Office, and the people were told that when it was l it war would have been declared with Russia. It was never l it , and I am inclined to think that the present Japanese scare is likely to end in the same way. When we prepare for defence, it is to defend ourselves against somebody. Do we anticipate war with America, or tJhat the Russian Soyiet Government will become so powerful as to make a bid for world's supremacy? Do honourable members expect war with the new Poland or with Czecho-Slovakia? If honourable members cannot get down to tin tacks and tell us by whom we are menaced, they cannot justify this proposal. The House is therefore justified in asking the Ministry to stay its hand, as is suggested in the amendment. I suggest to the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) that, if he is still satisfied that the situation justifies his intention to leave his own party to support the Government, he should give this House his reasons for so doing. He knows well that the Labour party is not averse to protecting Australia, and I believe that he would rather place the protection of his house and its inmates in the hands of the party to which he belongs than with any other party in this House. He seems to see in this question something outside the platform of his party. I hope that he will reconsider his position, and look at this matter from the point of view which I am endeavouring to outline. If he cannot then agree with me, I shall not blame him for doing what he thinks to be right. So far as I am personally concerned, I am prepared at all times to do what is necessary for the defence of this country, but, when defence measures are necessary, I hope that there will be a party in power which will deal with them in a complete manner. Let me now refer to the statement that expenditure for defence is in the nature of an insurance premium. When a man insures his house or his life, he must be satisfied that there is a reasonable chance .of his losing something. So far no honourable member has shown the necessity for the payment of this insurance premium at the present time. Many a young man, 25 years of age, when approached by a life insurance agent to insure his life, does not do so, because he",26,Maxwell Doe S The Honourable Benefit Of The War Mongers I N Europe

But, if he is approached when he is 40 years of age, he will probably take out a policy, and he will be quite prepared to pay tihe necessary premium. The honourable member for Bichmond( Mr B.. Green) used the simile of the old man who said to his three sons, "" Surely you do not want to ' loaf on dad.' "" "" pommy,"" having arrived in Australia from Great Britain in 1878, and I say that, ever since that time, "" dad has been loafing on Australia.""

We are not "" loafing on dad."" Austraha ia Great Britain's second-best customer. In 1922 we obtained from Great Britain goods tb the value of £60,000,000, and each year we pay in interest to that country the sum of £20,000,000. Would Great Britain, in the event of war, not take steps to protect her own interests? than £20,000,000, if we consider municipal and other loans obtained from Great Britain. borrowed by the Commonwealth as a whole. If a private individual were in Australia's present position, ho would refuse to pay an insurance premium of this nature. He would require the other party to pay it . While I am not unprepared to do my share, I will not be stampeded into agreeing to protect other people's interests by adopting a naval and struck, they have done so to obtain for military scheme which will burden our own people. Do honourable members think that Great Britain would let India go without a struggle? No. Should a hostile nation attack India, the British Navy would be despatched to her protection without delay. Similarly, if any of the British possessions in South Africa were in danger, the British navy would be immediately on the spot. Honourable members know that that is so. In order to protect Britain's financial interests, her navy would be despatched to any point where danger threatened. As the Age said, the trade struggle must end in a war of blood. So long as Australia shows herself sane, and while not prepared, through war hysteria, to go in for the building of ships, only to sink them later, prepares against the possibility of attack, she need not fear that she will become involved in another war such as that through which she recently passed. The honourable member for Bichmond said that the honourable member for Ballarat make a definite statement in this House. I am a The speech of the honourable member for Ballarat was at least a common-sense one. It is true that he is a pacifist, and has stated that he is not prepared to incur any expenditure whatever for defence purposes; but he is only one member of the Labour party. A time may yet come when his views will be subscribed to by a majority of the people of Australia. The honourable member spoke of the beneficial results which would accrue if the money proposed to be spent in the building of two cruisers were expended 1 in the development of Australia. I ask any honourable member on the other side to work out what could be done with the money. surplus would provide in the way of roads. honourable member apply equally to the money lost hy strikes. member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) for his interjection. Men have never gone on strike to leave other men maimed as the late war maimed them. If men have themselves a little more of that which they have produced, a little more opportunity to enjoy God's sunshine and the life he has given them, and to make possible a better standard of living. The Australian soldiers were the finest body of men that ever went to war. Every man was classed A l , and not C3, both as regards courage and physique. The spirit shown by them was the same spirit as that exhibited by those who preceded them when they went on strike to obtain for themselves and their families a higher standard of living. No strike yet has proved a loss. We should look beyond the immediate loss to the results. If the effect has been to confer benefits on the people generally, we should look at that rather than at the initial loss. It",27,Maxwell Doe S The Honourable Benefit Of The War Mongers I N Europe

On occasions when ""Fritz"" came over the line, I have tried to count, until I could count no longer, the bursts of the shells fired without success by the anti-aircraft guns. The shells burst like big balls of white cotton, and I have seen "" Fritz"" floating about quite unconcernedly amidst them. One would imagine that with the anti-aircraft guns on a firm base, where the gunners could adjust their range and their fuses as they pleased, they would occasionally score a hit, but it was my experience in France that not one enemy machine was brought down by the anti-aircraft gunners. If , from a very suitable location, where the proper elevation can be secured, an aeroplane cannot be hit by an aircraft gun, how will it be possible to hit them with anti-aircraft guns on vessels, where the least movement of the base would serve to throw out the elevation? that every vessel built for the Australian Navy should have accommodation on it for carrying aircraft. understood the honourable member. have seen aeroplanes flying very low without, being hit. I saw one blow up four observation balloons in a quarter of an hour without being hit. If these machines cannot be hit from the ground they will not be brought down by guns fired from the deck of a vessel. In my opinion they will be able to fly so low as to enable them to bomb Vessels with success. The bombs nre released at the point of banking just when tliere is no great velocity on the plane, so that they can thus be dropped with a fair amount of surety upon a warship, and the latter will not be in a position to retaliate. ( Mr Bowden) has informed the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) that an aeroplane will be in a position tofly200 miles to sea and return, I feel that aeroplanes will be our safest arm of defence, and I cannot see what reason the Government has for proposing An' adequate fleet of aeroto build cruisers. Possibly some arrangement has been made with the British As the Government to buy cruisers already on the stocks in Great Britain, and so assist to relieve the unemployed in that country. If that is the case, the object is a laudable one, provided we can afford the money; but it is time Great Britain adjusted her own economic conditions without allowing Australia to buy cruisers to enable her to do so. ""We should build our own cruisers even if it costs us more to do so. By building them locally we shall be developing an industry in which we hope to excel. Australia has not entered the lists in other enterprises without sooner or later excelling. If any one had said prior to the war that vessels could be built in South Australia, he would have been ridiculed, but the war brought about the development of the .initiative and resources ' of the people pf Australia, and two steamers have been built at Port Adelaide for the Commonwealth Government. The least we can do is to develop the facilities in the ports and harbors of Australia, so that in time to come we may be able to build the biggest of ships required for the defence of Australia. Buti f w^ was do not make a start we shall never know how to build such vessels. If we never tackle the job, it will always remain too big for us. The Ministry should reconsider their proposal I to build two cruisers at the present time, and allow the matter to stand over until our peace plenipotentiaries have an opportunity to bring their wisdom to, bear upon the altered pyschology of Europe. Ministers know very well that the British Government of to-day represents a different train of thought from that which existed in Great Britain a few years ago. There has also been a change of thought in France and in South Africa. We aro two years older since the Waehington Conference was held, and there is no reason whatever for opposing a proposal to delay the building of cruisers until our As the Minister further endeavours in the direction of securing peace are given a trial.

49,Tellers: Mr Mahony,"That is so. Havingit runs right through the Navy administration. It is a policy that says we must go to Great Britain for everything we need, because it is not possible to make anything in Australia. Whenever the people of Australia have attempted to do anything in the direction of naval construction or shipbuilding, every conceivable obstacle has been placed in the way of their making a success of the undertaking, but they have generally been able to rise above all difficulties. Australia, like all other countries, must make a start some time. Germany, within my recollection, had to send to Great Britain, not only for merchant ships, but also for vessels of war, but the people of Germany realized that if they were to become a nation they, must cease to be dependent upon others. They adopted the sensible policy of first sending some of their young men to be trained in the big shipbuilding yards of Great Britain, after which the German Government started the shipbuilding industry in Germany. who had received technical training in British yards were placed in charge, and were supplemented by a number of workmen imported from Great Britain. As a result of that policy, Germany in twenty years progressed in the shipbuilding industry from a nation that had to depend upon Great Britain for everything she needed to one that, before the war, was a most formidable maritime nation. Can we not remember the huge palatial liners, built, manned and equipped in Germany, that came out to Australia before the war? that Germany, like Australia, obtained all her ships from Great Britain, but the Germans were more f arsighted. than the present Government. The Germans said, ""Here is our chance to get tuition; we will take advantage of it to build up the shipbuilding industry in our own country. "" We should take an example from Germany, and adopt the German policy of establishing our own ship-building industry. I believe that the Australian people would support that policy, notwithstanding the actions of our Government. There is the further example of Japan. that only within recent years has Japan become a naval power or a ship-constructing nation. That result was brought about in exactly the same way there as in Germany. Young Japanese students were sent to Great Britain, were taken in hand by the Britisli Admiralty, and given facilities for gaining technical knowledge in the great ship-constructing yards of Great Britain. Japan, to-day, can construct all her naval vessels. A similar policy has been adopted in the United States of America. It is only a very few years since America was unable to build a boat of any size, but the American people stood steadfast to the principle of "" America first."" They adopted much the same policy as that of Germany and Japan, but went farther, by stipulating that no ship should engage in the American interstate trade unless it had been built in America and was owned and controlled by American citizens. tion of the United States when that policy was inaugurated? The young men the United States of America, when she declared, her independence, was less than the population of Australia to-day. The Prime Minister, in his second-reading speech, said we could not hope to build the cruisers in Australia, because it would cost more than they could be constructed for in Great Britain, aiid would take very much longer. He stated that to construct a cruiser in Great Britain would cost from £1,900,000 to £2,000,000, but to build it in Australia would cost more than £3,000,000; and that the time required to build it would be two years in Great Britain, and over three years in Twenty years before Australia. I take leave to challenge those figures, and I ask the Prime Minister to make available to honourable members any information he may have in support of them. If the figures came from Great Britain, they must have been supplied by some one there? Who is that some one? I question his figures, because I have gone to the trouble of cabling to Great Britain, aiid have obtained first-hand information that is quite different from that given by the Priine Minister. action shows that he is deeply interested All honourable members know in the mattei*. that all people who desire .to do something to make this country great, are deeply interested in it.",31,Pairs

I challenge the Prime Minister to lay upon tbe table of the House the information he has received from tbe British Admiralty. I take it that he must have received information from that source; he surely did not dream the figures he quoted to the House! ' He surely did not make his statement in a rash and careless fashion! I challenge him, therefore, to produce the information upon which he bases his estimate. The intelligence I have from Great Britain is that delivery of a 10,000-ton cruiser cannot be guaranteed inside three and a half years, and the price will be not less than £2,250,000. I further invite the Prime Minister to lay on the table the information he has received regarding the cost of construction in Australia. posed to Australian construction on the Judging from our past experience of what Australian workmen are capable of doing, I am satisfied that a 10,000-ton cruiser could be constructed at Oockatoo Islandi n two and a half years, provided -and this is essential-that the Navy Office will see that prompt deliveries of. material to the Shipbuilding Branch are maintained. If that is done, the workmen will guarantee to turn out the cruiser in two and a half years for, approximately, £2,750,000, and the workmanship will be such as could not be equalled in any yard outside Australia. Corroboration, of my statement is supplied by the rate of construction of the Ferndale. Her keel was laid on the 21st June, 1923, and the vessel was launched on the 21st June, 1924. Deducting holidays, the actual working time was about ten and a half months. The vessel will be completed about the end of October, nr about one year and four months from the date of laying down the keel. The vessel will be of about 12,800 tons dead weight. The average British shipbuilding yard could not improve upon that rate of construction. The 10,000-ton cruiser will not, at the time of launching, have nearly the same weight as the Ferndale. I admit, however, that the work upon a cruiser is more intricate, and allowing, on that account, about eighteen months to advance the vessel to the launching stage, the body could be completed within two and a half years. Defence [EEPEESENTATIVES.] Equipment BUl. hurry, in any case? said that time was of the essence of the contract. It wili certainly cost a little more to build a cruiser in Australia,, but that extra cost will be counterbalanced by the fact that the whole of the money will be spent in Australia, and work will be provided for our people. That will mean prosperity, not only for the men directly engaged in construction, but also for all business people, with whom the money will circulate. If there is one class in the community which should be more interested than another in the carrying out of this work locally, it is the primary producers, for whose products an improved local market will be provided. If cheapness is the principal consideration actuating the Government, if honourable members of the Country party are opground that it will cost more, may I suggest that they might have the ships built still more cheaply by letting a contract for their construction in Japan or China by sweated coloured labour? I readily admit that we cannot construct cruisers in Australia at exactly the same cost as in Great Britain, and the reason is that we have won in this country certain wages ancl standards of living which we are not prepared to surrender.

62,Mr Mahony,"The Government isweeks ago by tbe Honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks), whether there was a shipping yard in Australia adapted for submarine construction, the Minister said that there was no such yard in Australia. That reply is on record in H a n sard. Does the Minister know what has been done, and what can-be done, at the Cockatoo Island yard? Is the Minister not aware that a previous government sent to GreatB r it a in a number of bright young Australian mechanics to receive tuition in ship construction, more especially submarine construction, and that they visited every shipbuilding yard of note, including Vickers' yard, in which the whole of the up-to-date submarines were constructed ? through the shipbuilding industry from start to finish, and received highly technical training. Their services are available in Australia to-day; but the Minister, to fo3ter the Government's policy of anti-Australianism, glibly tells us that submarine construction cannot be undertaken in Australia. I ask honourable members to note the different policy adopted by other countries. Germany, and Japan all sent their young and intelligent mechanics to Great Britain for tuition in the shipbuilding industry, and, on their return, placed them in control in their own coiintry to build up that industry. Here there is no time for Australians; our bright youths have no chance to exercise their capabilities while an anti-Australian Government remains in power.

They were repaired at a shipyard which, according to ber any proof that in connection w i th the the Minister, is hot suitable for submarine building of the Adelaide orders were construction. sound all right, but I did not make use proof here. cf it . look up the report. These vessels had to be almost rebuilt. The men who worked on them are quite capable of constructing submarines. The most effective way to defend Australia from attack is to use submarines, and the establishment of a submarine-building industry would be one of the finest' things ever undertaken in Australia. The cost of a submarine is a mere bagatelle compared with that of a cruiser or battleship. The latest type of submarine:K type-carrie s 6-inch guns, and has a speed on the surface of 30 knots per hour, and, when submerged, of 18 knots per hour. This vessel is a first class fighting machine, and has a These men went steaming range of 12,000 miles. its base? This type of submarine can be constructed in Australia, and at least six of them built for the cost of one cruiser. A fleet of six such submarines would provide a much better defence America, for Australia than two cruisers. Providing that the orders are given simultaneously and that the vessels can be laid down in such a way that work upon them w ill follow rapidly on, we can build in Australian yards two cruisers and two submarines and deliver them complete in five years. That compares favourably w it h anything that can be done in any other part of the world. The Ministerf or Buti t is essential-and I stress thisthat there should be prompt deliveries of material.

The probable result of these delays was foreseen by the general manager as early as October, 1916, when he communicated with the Navy Board in Melbourne and told it of them.

The dockyard should be put in the same position exactly as private shipbuilding yards in Great Britain. contract to build a vessel to definite plans and specifications, and if they are departed from he should be paid for the extras as a private builder would be. If that course is adopted, and the Cockatoo Island Dockyard is given a chance, it will show what can be done in Australia. In the few moments left of my time. I want to quote briefly from the report of the royal commission appointed to investigate affairs at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. and ordered to be printed on the ,12th July, 1921. The Commission was composed of a majority of Government supporters-anti-Australians , not Labour men. means anti-Socialists. ' Mr' MAHONY -No; I mean antiAustralians. I make this quotation from the report of the commissionCockatoo as ai National Undertaking -It is . ing and discharging in both countries, thought desirable that the importance of Cockatoo Dockyard as a national undertaking should be pointed out to the people of the Commonwealth. It is unfortunate that an idea seeir-s to be prevalent in the publie mind that the dockyard at Cockatoo is ah unnecessary establishment; and consequently we think it proper to draw attention to the fact that the dockyard is an important undertaking and a necessary factor to the naval defence of Australia. What more is needed to dispel sucl* a,n idea than the utility of the dockyard demonstrated during the years of the war? If there had not been in existence such establishments as those at Cockatoo Island, Garden. Island, and Williamstown, it would not have been possible for Australiato have placed her troops with such remarkable expedition at the various theatres of the war; and, -whatever The credit has ibeen given to Australia in this respect should, in part, be attributed to the hearty response of the management and employees at theseestablishments. That royal commission pointed out the importance of maintaining the Cockatoo Island Dockyard as a necessary part of the defence policy of Australia; the importance and high class of its work, and the efficiency .of the workmen. To show the kind of work which can be done in. Australia when our workmen are given a fair chance, I shall make a short That, of course, quotation from the Journal of Commerce of the 10th May of this year. The reference is to the Fordsdale. There ia a heading, ""Australian-built Liner The manager should sign a Fordsdale Arrives in London,"" and a subheading, "" Shock for Scotch Shipbuilders.""

86,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [5.51],"Ifor postponing this work until certain events have taken place on the other side of the world. A meeting of the League of Nations is about to be held, the Prime Minister of the British Government has already made an announcement of a further conference to discuss disarmament, and the President of the United States of America contemplates acting in unison with the British Government in bringing it about. A few months only, have sine© an anti-Australian Government sunk the Australia. Many of us regretted the sinking of that vessel. With the Australia were sunk a number of new guns which were not pub aboard until she was about to be sunk. If another disarmament conference should decide on additional sinkings, Australia will again be asked to sink some of her war vessels. When the time came to give effect to the decisions of the Washington Conference, the British Navy had not a vessel sufficiently obsolete to warrant its being sunk, and, therefore, Australia was asked to sacrifice one of her warships. ment had thc vessels, but they asked us to sink ours. not, in their opinion, sufficiently obsolete to be sunk. But a pliable government in Australia was willing to carry out the wishes of the British Government, and so the Australia was sunk. From the speeches of the Minister in relation to the sinking of the Australia, one might have thought that the Commonwealth would save much money by the sinking of that vessel. should save at least a quarter of a million pounds per annum, and that, generally speaking, we would be well rid of her. The same thing may, in the future, be said of some of the vessels which we now have, or even of those which it is now proposed to build. Government, or one as willing to save the people huge sums of money, and as desirous of pleasing the British Government, be in power, and a similar proposal be placed before it, the two cruisers, the construction of which is to-day so enthusiastically advocated by honourable members on the other side, would also be sunk in deep water. In view of the period of change through which we are now passing, and of the world-wide trend towards disarmament and peace, the building of these cruisers is not only ridiculous, but wasteful. In view of the statement of one of the most "" jingoisticmembers on the other side, that even if we spent £50,000,000per annum, we could not defend Australia, the proposal for the construction of these vessels is even elapsed more absurd. When men with long war experience make statements of that character in .this House, one feel3 inclined to go to other than to the military experts for information in matters of this nature. The different views expressed by men occupying high positions in the naval and military forces of this country cause one to wonder whether those high officials are merely keeping together a system to provide themselves and their friends with good positions. When peace was declared, and our men returned in thousands from the fields of war, every possible effort was made to get the private soldiers off the pay-roll as quickly as possible, but, when it came to the officers, there were many delays before they were paid off. Many of those now occupying high positions in the Commonwealth defence forces are merely "" seat-warming."" This Government, and that which preceded it , have truckled to these people, and, whenever the position of a high military omciai has been in jeopardy, the present Minister for Defence, as well as his predecessor, has been ready to protect him. Speakers on the other side have said that the building of these cruisers is absolutely necessary for the defence of Australia, but the announcement that the vessels are to be built outside Australia is a serious blow to Australia's industrial welfare. We were informed ' that we The defence of Australia cannot depend . solely upon boats that will float above the water, or boats that will work under water or upon flying machines or fortifications. It depends not exclusively but inherently, upon the capacity of Australia to look after itself, to make its own guns and Should the present munitions, to repair its vessels and war material, to make its own uniforms, to provide rolling-stock for use on its railways, and to maintain its roads and bridges in good order.

Unless we are prepared for the people of Australia such as can be done by having these cruisers built in Australia, we cannot make that provision which is necessary to develop our man power. For a number of years, a semi-protectionist policy has been in force. In regard to onions, potatoes, and other such produce of the soil, the Government's protection, but so far as our iron and steel industries and other important secondary industries are concerned, we are a protectionist country. Eveni n the matter of building merchant ships we are protectionists, as witness the Ferndale and Fordsdale recently built by Australian workmen. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) has already given evidence of the excellent reception those vessels have received from people who understand ship-building. The building of two large cruisers in Australia would afford a great deal of employment, and, what is probably equally important, would continue the very fine training that our mechanics have already been able to get in building cruisers and merchant vessels. It is a training that should be continued, because what would our position be if we had not trained mechanics who could be called upon to build ships when the occasion required it? I voted for the postponement of the building of these cruisers, but if they are to be built I am absolutely opposed to the work being done outside the Commonwealth. Various estimates have been given as to what these vessels will cost. figure has gone up to nearly £4,000,000. The more anti-Australian the pert, the higher becomes his estimate of the probable cost of the cruisers. It is sad to think that the knowledge of these so-called experts always runs i h a certain groove. It is always their declaration that nothing good can come out of Australia, and the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, and others on the ministerial side slavishly adopt that creed as if there were no room for independent thought, and most certainly none of an Australian outlook. Honourable members opposite simply follow like so many sheep the lead of anti-Australian experts, who are probably more than superficially in terested in the question of where these But above all is the need cruisers shall be built. The mere statement that the cruiser Adelaide cost a lot to do something practical -more than it should have cost, without any Word of explanation as to how the added cost was brought about, does not justify any Commonwealth Government in having cruisers built outside Australia; The work of building cruisers or any other vessels required by the Commonwealth Government should .be done in Australia if for no other reason than to policy is, of course, keep together a trained staff of shipbuilders. I am sufficiently Australian in my outlook to subscribe to the doctrine that it is better to spend £4,000,000 in Australia than to spend £2,500,000 out of Australia; but one looks in vain among the anti-Labour parties of Australia for subscription to such a doctrine. The ministry in power to-day is not the only anti-Australian anti-Labour GovernmentAustralia has had during the last few years. Prior to the great sweeping movement which has recently put Labour Governments into power in the different states, one anti-Australian ministry after another would call for tenders for, say, 40 engines, or a quantity of steel rails, or of structural steel, and with hardly an exception, in pursuance of their anti-Australian policy, the order was sent out of Australia. tralian tender happened to be lower than the outside tender. twelve months of their period of office, the South Australian anti-Australian anti-Labour Government placed out of Australia £1,500,000 worth of work. The The present anti-Australian Commonwealth Government is not guiltless in this reexgard. It was only Because of the strenuous efforts of the Labour party, and the propaganda we spread throughout Australia on behalf of the workers and industries of the Commonwealth, that we were able to prevent this Government from sending out of Australia for locomotives. But evidently there is a difference between a contract for the building of locomotives and one for building cruisers. If private individuals had in Australia yards and facilities for the building of cruisers, the Government would not have dared to bring down a bill to have cruisers built outside Australia. In the case of the locometives, it was with the Government",39,Tonkaox Ak3> Cost

If it be Tight and in the best interests of the Commonwealth to have these cruisers built outside of Australia, why stop at that point ?

I quite agree with the honourable member for Newcastle, who mentions that it might be cheaper in the long run to pay more for an article made in Australia. I have vivid recollections of inspecting a fleet of boats which was bought by the Commonwealth Government during the war, and of seeing what shoddy, ill-built boats they were. With the exception, perhaps, of the work of Kidman and Mayoh, who really could not be called a reputable shipbuilding firm, seeing that it sprang up in the night, and had no intention of building boats, but were merely indulging in a boodling scheme, the work of Australian ship-builders is of the highest quality and standard. After inspecting the quality of the material used in such boats as the Adelaide, But as the Ferndale, the Fordsdale, the Eudvmda, and many others, one feels that we could safely leave the building of the proposed cruisers to Australian workmen. A large sum of money is to As a matter of fact, be spent outside Australia upon replacements for the Australian Navy, because the present Government are incapable of imbibing Australian spirit, sentiment, or ideals. Further incapacity on their part is evidenced by their failure to bring down an economic and sound system of defence. It is some months since the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) declared that he would shortly propound the Government's defence policy, and that the people would, as it were, be riven asunder into two camp3 by the momentous declaration he was to make. On other occasions direct hints and mysterious warnings have been given by the Prime Minister ancl other members of the Government. When he made his speech, the people of Australia were waiting expectantly for him to put forward a statesmanlike policy of defence, but, after six months pondering, deliberation, and consultation in Cabinet and party meetings, all he did was to propose to replace thc Aus-' certain units of the Navy created by the Labour party. The Minister should cause an investigation to be made of the defence system of Australia, and should come From down to this House with a comprehensive policy for cleaning up the augean stable, which has been in a very questionable state since peace was declared. Large sums of money are being squandered and wasted; equipment and munitions are rotting; the military districts have been allowed tq go their own way, with practically, no supervision; and, generally speaking, the defence of Australia has become a farce. Before setting put to build new cruisers, the Government should cause a strict inquiry to be made into the naval and military arms of defence, with a view to introducing some co-ordination, or at least some small measure of efficiency..

I desire to place on record the cost to Australia of the training of students at Duntroon and Jervis Bay. If my figures are not correct, it is because it is impossible to exless notice of military experts on tract correct information from the Minister or the department. It is quite likely that the Minister'will find in his department an officer who will give him figures to suit the case, and to show that mine are wrong. We have come to a pretty pass when officers holding high positions in this country lend themselves to faking and deception. As far as I have been able to ascertain, during the year 1921-22 there were 81 students at Duntroon, and the cost was £743 per student. In 1922-23 the number of students was reduced to 44, and the cost increased to £933 per student.. In 1923-24 there Were 41 . students,, and the estimated cost per student t was £993.

I have been told that several students, upon each of whom the Government had spent many hundreds of pounds, left the college and went into private employment. compensated at the rate of £150 each. had the benefit of employing these highly skilled men, who had been trained at the expense of the people of Australia. Jervis Bay College is even a worse scandal. In 1921-22, there were in that college, 84 students, who cost £814 each; in 1922-23 there were 58 students, and the cost was £1,064 each; and in 1923-24 there were 41 students^ while the cost increased to £1,463 per student. That institution has also been responsible for squandering about £500,000 in six years, and the two colleges between them have spent £1,000,000 of the taxpayers' money. An investigation should be held into the working of both those institutions. If the Minister for Defence consults the experts at Duntroon or Jervis Bay, as he no doubt has done, he will be informed quite solemnly that it is impossible to decrease the cost per student or to make a saving in any way. I have no doubt that that view is supported by highly placed naval and military omcers. I am not prepared to accept the opinion of those people, because they are biased.

Wien we hear such anti-Australian sentiments as have been uttered by members on the Government side, we cannot forget that it is not long since the Government brought down two bills that were anti-Australian in sentiment and viewpoint. Not satisfied with Australian legislation for the Defence Force, the Government looked overseas, and sought to apply fche British Army Act in fche Defence Bill, and the British Air Force Act in the Air Force Bill. The Defence Bill is still on the notice-paper. Members of the Labour party have been taunted on their attitude to the question of defence. The Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey) has effectively answered those taunts, but may I add that, if anything important has been done for the defence of Australia-if any valuable system has been inaugurated, if any desirable departure has been made tending towards efficiency-it has' been done exclusively by the Labour party. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m. made in behalf of fche Federal Labour party by our leader ( Mr Charlton) on fche 27th July, 1923, when dealing with the Imperial and Economic conferences, wasThe Labour party's policy is to promote world peace, and, consistently with Australia's produces more food than five times as good-will to her kindred overseas, declares its readiness to take full responsibility for Ausgreafc a population could consume, thafc tralia's defence, but is opposed to the raising yields, also, abundance of material for of forces for service outside the Commonwealth, clothing and housing, and everything or promise of participation in any future overseas wars, except by a decision of the people. That declaration was primarily brought about by the jingoism of two prominent Prime Ministers in the British Empire, Lloyd George and W. M . Hughes. The war drum was beaten by Mr Lloyd George when Prime Minister of Great Britain, who, without consulting the I m perial Parliament, or even his Cabinet, sent cablegrams to the Dominions asking whether, in the event of the Imperial Government determining to send an expedition to the Near East, they would participate. Just as that irresponsible gentleman, without consulting his colleagues or his Parliament, asked Australia to participate in a buccaneering expedition, so did an equally irresponsible Prime Minister of Australia ( Mr a tendency to make the existing condiHughes)-probabl y an even greater jingo than Mr Lloyd George-imme diately cable a reply in which he promised participation, without having consulted fche Australian people, this Parliament, or even his own Cabinet. Five irresponsible men in Great Britain and four irresponsible men in Australia, holding high position but nevertheless unfitted to discharge the trust reposed in fchem by the people, were committing their countries to war. Minister is responsible to Parliament. ter, and no ten men, or even twenty men, should have the right of declaring war, and Mr Lloyd George's action, supported by Mr Hughes, was a practically a declaration of war. It was fortunate for the British Empire thafc the statesmen of both South Africa and Canada had sufficient sense of responsibility to refuse to give the same enthusiastic affirmative as was cabled by the then Prime Minister of Australia. Should fche proposed cruisers be built, whether in or outside Australia, their use will be controlled by the irresponsible men who from time to time may occupy the treasury bench in this House. To-day there is much unemployment throughout Australia, caused principally by anti-Australian and anti-Labour Governments. In this land, which has been blessed by nature and necessary for the comfort and happiness of a community, many thousands of people are without sufficient food and proper clothing, and are unable to getwork. In New South Wales about 7,000 men are vainly seeking work in order that they may live as human beings are entitled fco live. A large number of men in Sydney rely entirely upon the charitable instincts of the people for a sufficiency of food and clothing fco keep them alive. In the Domain hundreds of homeless men are to be seen nightly.

I remind honourable members that the Government has never said thafc both of the cruisers will be built outside Australia. The Prime Minisfcer said that one cruiser will be built abroad, and that the Government will make very careful inquiries before deciding where the contract for the second vessel shall be placed. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley thatfcheAdelaide does not provide a fair comparison with ships that were built in England. It was constructed during the war, and war-time prices were paid for all materials used in it, of which delivery could be obtained only with great difficulty. Many alterations in design took place during the progress of construction, and at the conclusion of the war the completion of the vessel was more or less a stand-by job. The cost of the In these circumcosts of the Sydney and Brisbane provide a better comparison. The construction of the Sydney in England occupied two and a third years, and fche cost Was £385,000. Four years were occupied in building the Brisbane at Cockatoo Island, at a cost of £746,624. I am fully conscious of the necessity for maintaining in Australia a first-class engineering yard, capable of effecting major repairs to ships in time of war, and the Government is anxious to ensure the maintenance of such an establishment. One of the strongest arguments for the building of the second cruiser in Australia is that it will maintain afc Cockatoo Island an efficient ship-building and repairing yard. I have made no suggestion that the work could not be well done at Cockatoo. The workmanship in the Adelaide compares most favourably with that in any ship of the same class in the British Navy. We have nothing to fear respecting the quality of the materials or the accuracy of the Australian workmanship. ' We must remember, however, that the proposed cruisers, if they are to replace the Sydney and the Melbourne, will be required in very much less time than it would take Cockatoo Island to build* them. It is also a matter for very grave"" consideration whether the Government could at this juncture maintain two dockyards to build cruisers or to carry out other naval work. If the construction of these two vessels were commenced at two establishments, or if one establishment was duplicated to build them simultaneously, it would be only postponing the evil day.

The position at Walsh Island is that the shops are deficient in certain plant for the building of 10,000ton cruisers; for example, there is no crane there capable of lifting more than 30 tons into the vessel. There are three large cranes there ready to stand right over the vessels. there are no cranes at Walsh Island that v/ill l if t more than 30 tons. Many more machines' would also be required there. It is estimated that something like-£100,000 would need to be expended before Walsh Island could commence to build a cruiser. I repeat that it is a matter for very grave consideration whether in any event two shipbuilding yards should be established. The honourable member for Dalley asked who supplied the estimate of £1,900,000. That figure was given by the British Admiralty to the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), when at the Imperial Conference, as the cost for which the Admiralty would, if required, deliver one of these vessels to Auscentage includes the cost of armaments, electralia. Of course, any alteration of the plans of the vessel would increase the cost. The offer was made at that figure. an estimate only. price for which the British Admiralty could then supply a vessel. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley that if the plans were altered the estimate would have to be reconsidered. There would be extras. plans of this vessel? estimate be made? naval authorities were based on the British cost. If the British cost were increased, of course, the estimate of Australian costs would also increase, even to a greater extent. I asked the Shipping Board whether it could supply the approximate cost of a vessel built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, what proportion of the cost would be labour, and what proportion material; also what proportion of the material would have to be imported and assembled here, and how much actual Australian material would be used in the construction of the vessel. The Shipping Board, in its reply, dated the 9th J u l y , gave a n estimate of the cost of b u i l d in g a 10,000-ton cruiser a t CockatooI s l a n d dockyard . A letter w r it t e n on behalf of the b o a r d reads(1) With reference to your communication of the 3rd July, addressed to the general manager, I am directed by my board to furnish you with the following information based on the data contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of your letter : (2) Cost: It is impossible to accurately state the cost of the construction of this vessel at Cockatoo Island dockyard owing to lack of plans and specifications', but taking the British cost . of £1,900.000 as a basis, and assuming that it is correct, it is estimated that the approximate cost of constructing a similar vessel here will be, £2,898,000. (3) Time for construction: Provided that complete plans and lists of material are available when the order is placed, and that no undue delay occurs in the delivery of material from Great Britain, a vessel can be completed in two and a half years from the date of the laying of the keel.

132,Mr Bowden,"He has had theand time to build two years. Cockatoo Dockyard's estimate of cost is over £1,000,000 higher than the estimated English cost. The Naval Board assumes responsibility for the estimate it has given. It was asked to reconsider the matter in the light of the Cockatoo estimate, and it has been unable to reduce its estimate. It stands by the estimate it has given. right that honourable members should have the estimates which have been asked for, and so I have given them to the House. We have heard a very interesting statement from the Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden), and I propose to deal with it first. He has said that the possibility of building the second cruiser in Australia depends on whether it could be built here for anything like what it would cost to build in England. Honourable members on this side have stated their position in regard to the whole question of defence, and I need not go over the ground again. But I think I have a right to ask why the Government, which was returned at the last elections a3 a protectionist government, should decide that even the first of the cruisers shall be built outside this country. The Minister has given estimaies of the cost of building a cruiser in Australia and in England. He admits that there are no plans of these cruisers here or in England. We know that since the Washington Conference was held England has been restricted as to capital ships; but we know, also, that in the Old Country they are endeavouring to put into the cruisei-3 that are being built as much of the equipment 'of a modern battleship as they possibly can. How can any one tell what these ships w ill cost, whether in England or here? If the Minister w ill look, I think it is in the Naval Gazette, Brassey's publication, he w ill find, that the estimate he has given of the cost of building a cruiser in England does not refer to the class of cruiser proposed by the Government at a l l . If he will look where I have told him to look he will find that in England to-day they are building a cruiser to be named Effingham, which was put on the slips in 1918. cruiser. old Raleigh class, and she has not yet The done her trial trips. wiped out. Government is going on with the construction of the Effingham. The money spent on her to date is over £3,000,000, and she is not yet completed. So much for the honourable gentleman's estimate I thought it only of £1,900,000 to build a 10,000-ton cruiser in England. The time has come when we must tell the people of this country very plainly whether or not we intend to carry out the policy which they sent us here to give effect to, and that is the local manufacture of our own requirements. war time, and why should we not do it now ? to do these things. We built ships, and turned them out in record time, and the work put into them was superior to that put into any vessels we had built overseas. I do not say that it was only as good, because engineers who have worked on Australian-built boats have said that they are the best boats they have ever been in . We are told that these cruisers cannot be built in Australian dockyards because we have not the necessary machinery, and, amongst other things, that we have not suitable cranes. A t Walsh Island there are three or four cranes which could be used on each side of a ship. It is time that we decided that money spent in the way proposed by the Government shall be spent in this country. Cockatoo Island and Walsh Island are not very far apart, and the establishment at one place could assist that at the other, as was done in connection with a previous shipbuilding nrogramme. When the Government initiated its shipbuilding scheme it collected artisans from all over the world, and told them that it intended to pursue a policy of shipbuilding in this country. Some of the men were induced to give up their previous employment, and learn the business of shipbuilding. When they reached the centres at which the industry was being carried on, they made arrangements for the purchase of homes which have been partially paid for. Now they are to be l e f t stranded because the present Government will not pursue a policy that w i ll keep them in employ-",46,Tonkaox Ak3> Cost

In the face of the figures which I have given, the Minister coolly tells us that they are taking £1,900,000 as the cost of constructing the vessel in Great Britain. I make bold to say that the price will be upwards of £3,000,000. The Government should withhold action, and not place an order overseas for even one vessel until the exact position is ascertained. I have referred to a boat of the Raleigh type, which has been on the stocks in England since 1918, but has not yet run her trial trip. The cost of that vessel will probably be nearer £4,000,000 than £1,900,000.. ing on her all that time? do I know the actual time taken in the construction of the Adelaide.

In these days of heavy taxation, and of distress among the engineering trades, When the for a Cominonwea'lth Government to lead the way in ordering from outside Australia two vessels, to cost at least £5,000,000, is, to say the least, anti-Australian.

He has expressed the sentiments of the great majority of true Australians who believe in the development of the secondary industries of this country. The weak, vague, I do not know, nor and indefinite reply of the Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden) convinced me more than ever that the cruisers,, if built at all, should be built in Australia. The Minister clearly showed that the Government was not in possession of sufficient information to justify it in placing this order abroad. Eveni f the figures are as stated by the Minister, on his own showing more than one-half of the cost of constructing the vessels in Australia, according to the estimates supplied by the authorities at Cockatoo Island, represents wages to Australian made materials. Those considerations alone should convince the Government of the wisdom of constructing the cruisers in Australia. Even the fact that a proportion of the material would have to be imported may be due to the lack of continuity in the Government's ship-building programme.

156,Mr Coleman (Reid) [8.58],"I detralia would be materially reduced, and our steel and engineering industry, wbich is languishing through lack of adequate orders, would progress to a very much greaterextent than has The relative costs, after all, are governed mainly by the wages paid in Austraha and those paid in Great Britain. . We should not lose sight of the fact that the figures quoted by the Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden) with regard to construction in England were not based on the latest information; therefore, the cost of having a cruiser built in GreatB r it a in w ill probably exceed £1,900,000. Despite the fact that it may cost more to build the cruisers in Australia than to purchase tliem in Great Britain, I say, as an Australian-born citizen and an uncompromising protectionist, that there is no justification for strangling young industries such as the steel industry and shipbuilding, which are both essential to the defence of this great continent, and depend largely on Government support. In time of war -whic h we trust will never come upon us again-w e should need, for the construction and repairing of vessels, shipbuilding yards and an efficient staff such as can only be secured by placing orders for the construction of vessels in Australia. The cost of construction in Great Britain may be lower, not only because the wages paid there are lower than those paid in Australia, but also because B r it a in has a con35,000,000. tinuous shipbuilding programme, and has passed a Trade Eacilities Act, under the provisions of which £65,000,000 has been set aside to provide loans, free of interest in some cases and at low rates in others, to languishing industries, to enable them to compete for overseas orders, and also to provide for home requirements. That 55 per cent, of the amount proposed to be spent on building a cruiser represents the expenditure upon wages is a most important fact, and means the skilled artisans, engineers, boilermakers, fitters, and others whose services are invaluable to Australia, and who are now out of work. The arguments -cruisers abroad should apply to almost every article required in Australia. We have a protectionist tariff, w i th duties ranging as high as 33^ per cent., 40 per eent., and even 50 per cent. If a duty of 40 per cent, were placed upon cruiser construction, as a f a i r appraisement of the relative economic conditions of Australia and Great Britain, Australia could build these vessels in competition w it h Great Britain on fair terms. As a probeen the case in the past. tectionist, I recognise that our high tariff has been largely responsible for the high standard of livin g in Australia, and for the high wages paid here, which naturally increase the cost of building cruisers in Australia; but honourable members who claim that these vessels should be built ; abroad should, if they are logical, also declare tliat, for the sake of cheapness, our secondary industries should be sacrificed by completely abolishing the tariff protection afforded to them. I am afraid that any honourable member who advocated a policy of that sort would find it utterly opposed to the sentiments of the people of Australia> The people want their secondary industries developed to the fullest possible extent. The secret of the success of America has been the fostering of her secondary industries. According to statistics given in the special report of Mr. Davis^ the Secretary for Labouri n the United States Government, the population of the United States has increased by immigration from 1901 u n t i l the present time by 17,000,000 . persons, the total increase of population by immigration since 1820 being That increase is the direct result of the protective policy of America, and of that country's attempts to promote her secondary industries, into which the great majority of the immi-t grants have been absorbed. Every year Australia pays large sums of money in bounties. What would be wrong in our paying a few hundred thousand pounds extra, in connection w it h the enormous economic waste involved in building cruisers? The money spent in building much to vessels of war is absolutely unproductive, except that, if the order for building them were placed in Australia, it would assist the steel industry, and would afford employment to thousands of operatives, w i th advanced for building these a consequent better economic balance throughout the community, and general prosperity. The speech of the Minister for Defence was in itself an indictment of the Government. It was a confession of absolute neglect on .the part of Ministers. 1 am surprised that on an important matter such as this, which is a fundamental of government-because is a function for which the Commonwealth Parliament was establishedthe Minister should admit that he' is not in possession of complete information which would enable Parliament to come to a definite conclusion. If the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Dalley Mahony), they should certainly agree to a postponement of the construction of the cruisers. My vote on the amendment submitted by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey), to have the construction of the cruisers postponed, was amply justified in view of the fact that the Government are not equipped with definite information as to costs which would enable us to form a proper opinion. on the Government side have charged Ministers with neglect. able member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse) has shown that the Government have given no attention to health matters. He has quoted appalling statistics as to the low standard of physical efficiency in Australia. Other honourable members opposite have pointed to the neglect of the Government in the equipping of factories for the manufacture of implements of war. On our part we have submitted an amendment which was quite justified, and have made our position clear. If Ministers will not agree to postpone the construction of the cruisers until they are supplied with proper information to enable, not only themselves, but also honorablo members generally to come to a conclusion in an intelligent and business-like way, that is another reason for the course we are taking. As a party, we on this side have faith in the League of Nations, and we look to the delegation which left Melbourne yesterday to further world peace. As there will be, for the first time in the history of the league, Labour Prime Ministers from England and France in attendance, we feel that there is and their expressions of fear of Japan, every possibility of an arrangement being .arrived at for further disarmament; and, rather than see a proposal like that which is now before us bludgeoned through the House to provide for the expenditure of millions of our money ifr. Coleman. among British workmen, while our own defence workmen are unemployed, we again urge postponement. There is no need to rush this bill through the House on the meagre information supplied. There has already been twelve months' delay in the construction of these cruisers; because the sum mentioned in this bill was voted on last year's Estimates. What, therefore, is the urgency for this bill? The( Mr Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) admits that there is no possibility of an invasion, and that, in any case, an invasion would be impracticable. He says that war is not imminent, so far as Australia is concerned, that there is a revulsion against war, and that the peoples of the world are now seeking for a better means than the arbitrament of war for settling their international differences. I admit that the right honourable gentleman afterwards Honourable members contradicted himself, but I am prepared to accept his view that there is no immeThe honordiate danger to Australia, in which case there is no need to place this order for the construction of cruisers abroad. However, as the Government have intimated their determination to proceed with their policy of having cruisers built, we have put forward an amendment to provide that, if any money is spent upou building cruisers, it shall provide work for Australians. I protest against the pessimistic utterances of honourable members on the Government benches. If Japan wanted a casus belli, it would find it in the utterances of those honourable members who have pointed to her as a potential enemy and a menace to Australia. Utterances such as these are not only likely to arouse racial antagonism and involve Australia in international complications; they are also disloyal. Some honourable members speak about the doctrines of communists in Australia. But I noticed recently in one communistic journal that the communists are prepared to adopt a defence policy for Australia, and at the same time propagate the ideals of peace. Honourable members on the Government side, with their warlike utterances are a worse enemy of Australia than the most allegedly disloyal elements in this community, because statements such as theirs are likely not only to cause international trouble, but also to damage our credit abroad, and unnecessarily alarm the people of Australia. I therefore, as one who believes in Australia, who believes in the British Empire, and who hopes that it may long exist and work for the peace of the world, desire to take this opportunity of protesting against the short-sighted utterances made in this debate by supporters of the Government. I have read every speech made in the debate, but I have not seen a tangible argument to support the theory that Japan is about to attack us. The statements are mostly assumptions, expressions of vague fears, and nebulous ideas that have been put forward as a result, it seems to me, of a diseased imagination N'o facts have been submitted, and after reading the reports of the speeches I felt that it was my bounden duty to give some attention to the matter. vestigated it , and have gathered together a number of statistics. that Japan was about to attack us? member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) said that Japan was a potential enemy, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) made insulting remarks about that nation, and other honourable members have inferred that there is a possibility of attack by Japan. I refer those honourable members who dispute my statement to the reports in Hansard. The honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse) suggested that we should have to hoist the white flag in the event of invasion. What a terrible and tragic "" confession to make ! It was a confession that should make every decent Australian blush with shame. I have a great deal of respect for the eminent and gallant gentleman who represents Calare, but I am ashamed to hear him, after his brilliant record of active service, make such a regrettable confession. that character are a reflection upon our Australian manhood; the men who say such things seem to forget the aw fu l sacrifices made by Australia during the war, the unparalleled record of valour established by our soldiers, and the world fame achieved by them. I submit that there is no possibility of the successful invasion of Australia by any country while we possess the prowess, the gallantry, .and the patriotism for which Australians are renowned. debate well-worn phrases, beloved by conservatives, have been used. The Prime Minister said that "" human nature has not yet changed,,"" and that sentiment undoubtedly appealed to the honourable member for. Warringah, for he repeated and apparently stupid it. 1 suggest that to say that human nature has not yet changed is antisocial, it is cruel, it is godless, it is the assertion of a veritable anti-Christ, for any man with Christian principles and beliefs must recognize that human nature has improved during the centuries, and that to-day we have reached a higher stage of humanity, civilization, and in telligence than ever we occupied before. member go to Belgium for a certificate?

166,Had The Advantage In The Mr Coleman,"Even allowing f o rhead in Japan and 56s. lOd. in Great Britain. from the debate is that GreatB r it a in is unable to carry the heavy burden of defending her trade routes, and has had to appeal to the Dominions for help. The Prime Minister placed that on record as the excuse for constructing two cruisers; but honourable members on the other side, while they have made all kinds of statements, do not seem to have given much attention to it . WhilstI admit that we must maintain a naval defence unit, I differ from honourable members opposite, in that I favour postponement of construction. I think that the question of what is a suitable naval unit for Australia should be carefully investigated by competent naval authorities, who would study the matter from the Australian view-point. I feel sure that, having regard to the weight of opinion that has been generally expressed, and which is borne out by statistics, experts would favour the policy propounded by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, namely, the building of arsenals and munition factories, the construction of forts to guard our important seaports, and the creation of submarine and aerial fleets. The following figures indicate the importance attached by other countries to submarines and destroyers:-Of destroyers B ritain has 201, the United States of America 316, and Japan 173; and 69, America 128. Japan is keeping her submarine construction secret, but it is generally believed that she has at least 70 or 80 of those vessels. The utterances of honourable members on the Ministerial side would suggest that Australia is comparatively defenceless on the seas, and that we can hope for very little help from Great Britaini n the future. Indeed, the Prime Minister said that possibly the day would come when Great Britain would not come to Australia's assistance. I draw the attention of honourable members to the view expressed by Vice Admira l Ballard, for some time director of operations on the British Admiralty Staff, that for success against Japan, Britain would require a Beet three times as strong as the Japanese fleet. According to that expert, we cannot hope for effective naval aid from Great Britain, and that brings me to the point that the f u t u r e of Australia The only fact that emerges depends upon an entente with our cousin and friendly ally, the United States o i America. I regret that a section of fche press is frequently sneering at America. Having spent a little time in that uountry, I resent that attitude veiy strongly. The Americans have a tremendous interest in the welfare of Australia, and a great admiration for the valour of our soldiers and the prowess of our athletes and sportsmen, and it behoves us to cultivate friendship with the American people, because, in fche unlikely event of trouble with Japan, American sympathy and Moreover, support would be our first line of defence. might be "" too proud "" to show it . cheap sneer that does more than anything else to anger the American people-. Every nation is entitled to determine its own international obligations, and the Americans were quite within their rights in deciding when and how .they should enter the wax. The fact should not be forgotten that Americanintervention materially shortened the war, and determined the issue in favour of the allies. American feeling was never more friendly towards Australia and the British Empire than it is to-day, and I regret that the honourable member for Swan should have made such a short-sighted interjection. Some honourable members on the Government side of submarines, Britain has would lead us to believe that Australia is and the United States of not doing her fair share in defence, and they quote the enormous burden of debt that Great Britain is carrying. I freely admit' thafc Great Britain is bearing a tremendous burden. Her annual expenditure on account of the last war is £300,000,000; upon incidentals, such as war * pensions and other charges, £86,000,000; upon the maintenance of armed, forces, £123,000,000; and upon the maintenance of the Middle East force, that is, the armies in Persia and I r a q , £9,000,000, making a total of £518,000,000 spent on warlike purposes, as compared with only £169,000,000 spent upon the ordinary services of civil government.

Honourable members will see that Australia's burden of debt per head of population is, if anything, heavier than that of Great Britain.. be between the war debtsj and not between the general war debts. order to determine the ability to maintain defence forces and discharge the obligations of government, a comparison between the total deadweight debts of the two countries is fair. large proportion of Britain's war expenditure is represented by loans to her allies, which are recoverable. with 9,000,000 people, is, according to Mr Hurd, a member of the House of Commons and an eminent financial authority, complaining because she is carrying a "" grievous burden"" of war debt Her provincial debt is only £70,000,000. She considers that her debts are a serious problem, although they are, in proportion to population, much smaller than the debts of Australia. Do those honourable members opposite who say that Australia is neglecting to carry its fair share of the burden of defence forget that interest on our war debt and current expenditure upon defence are costing Australia £44,000,000 per annum -equa l to two-thirds of our revenue from taxation? Do they forget that we are continuing the mad policy of borrow, borrow, borrow, and that unless there is a limitation of loans, and economy in some forms of expenditure, the country will ultimately be bankrupt? The facts support our advocacy of economy and postponement, and it is clear thafc we should think twice before we embark upon an extravagant policy of armaments which will involve us in still further debt. The Government, whilst ready to gag us on other measures, is giving us ample opportunity to discuss this bill, in the ""hope that we may commit ourselves, and by our utterances provide them with political capital for use on the public platRelatively, Australia is already form. In order that my attitude may a bigger burden than not be misinterpreted, I place on record my belief thafc Australia should maintain of Australia totals almost defence forces. The party with which I am associated believes in the defence of Australia. Ifc maintains that Australia can depend upon itself. We have profound faith in our own country. We advocate internal defence by the construction of arsenals and munition factories. able member advocate internal defence? Whom does he fear ? peace, but we must maintain a nucleus defence force. No good purpose is served by trying to make the people of Australia panicstricken by telling them that there is imminent danger from Japan or some other neighbouring country that is In any case a at present friendly towards us. There is no justification for precipitating expenditure, which experts may later declare to Canada, have been upon wrong lines. I invite the attention of honourable members to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which indicts the Government on account of its past neglectThe committee is of opinion that the producamounting to £340,000,000. tion of munitions to be manufactured in Australia should be based on raw materials, and it urges the fullest utilization of the resources of the Commonwealth in this direction. The committee points out that the progress made in the manufacture of munitions has been very slow, and that the Small Arms Factory could be utilized for the manufacture of telephone parts and other requirements of the Postmaster-General's Department which are at present imported. There is nothing to prevent the Government from ascertaining Australia's economic resources for war, finding out what factories could be readily converted from peace production to the manufacture of munitions, and organizing the engineering industries in such a way that they would serve the purposes of both peace and war. We have before us the splendid example of the United States of America. Owing to the tremendous development of her manufactures and the magnitude of the steel industry, she was able to supply the Allies with enormous quantities of munitions, and after the termination of the war, the factories speedily reverted to the building of motor cars and other engineering products.

172,Mr Coleman,"We should work forBritain's imperial burden of defence by helping to protect not only our trade routes, but also Britain's trade routes. Our task would be made much lighter if Great Britain would help the Commonwealth in certain directions. As an Australian, I am proud of our comparative political independence and industrial properial Government. I have entered my gress, and I remind honourable members that the Commonwealth is helping Great Britain by trade preferences which amount to £8,500,000 per annum. We are helping the Mother Countiyi n various other ways. We are providing fields for the profitable investment of her capiselves, and are unable to produce defence tal, and let me not forget this point-for I anranxious to enter my protest against the attitude of helplessness and futility adopted by honourable members opposite -that the Commonwealth is paying 6 per cent, interest upon the £92,500,000 that Great Britain loaned to us during the war, more than half of which was for the maintenance of our troops while they were in Europe. amount totals £5,550,000 per annum, and as the British debt to the United States of America has been funded at 3 per cent., it would not be too much to ask Great Britain to allow us to fund our debt to her at a similar interest, and expend the annual saving upon the manufacture of munitions and the maintenance of defence forces. Honourable members must admit that it is monstrously unfair that we should pay 6 per cent, interest on that debt when we have already paid an enormous interest in the lives, blood, and valour of the 60,000 young Australian heroes who sleep beneath various battlefields abroad. titled to as much consideration as is America. If our debt to Great Britain were funded at 3 per cent., the Commonwealth would have nearly £3,000,000 per annum, which it is at present paying to the Mother Country, to expend upon defence and developmental purposes. That point bas been missed by previous speakers, but it has a most important bearing upon the problem of Imperial relationships and obligations. done very well out of Australian wool and wheat. to honourable members opposite sneering at that statement. Their's is the attitude of [95] political hypocrites. Surely it is only right and proper that we should maintain our self-respect, and hold our heads high in the conviction of having done our task.

But when we contrast the prices, we find that the comparison is impossible. £1,900,000 paid for a cruiser built in Great Britain, after satisfactory trials, nothing being paid until delivery, and over £3,000,000 paid for one built in. Australia, to which must be added interest during the four years' period of construction, £1,500,000. on the Australian construction woulcl amount to something like £360,000, taking 6 per cent, on half the amount over four years, assuming the cruiser to be built at an even rate of speed. There is, roughly £1,500,000 between the cost of a cruiser obtained in Great Britain and that of a cruiser built in Australia. What could be done with that amount? How many miles of road would it provide? Honourable members opposite, or at least some of them, only last week were pressing the Government for greater expenditure on roads. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) recently appealed totho Government to construct the Northern Territory railway. If my memory serves me aright, he told us that it was estimated that that railway woulcl cost about. £1,600,000. cruiser would practically provide the North-South railway on the estimate submitted by th& honourable member for Bass. Then, again, £1,500,000 would go a long way towards providing Australia with a dock capable of accommodating one of the largest capital ships afloat. The necessity for such a dock must be obvious to all We were told this afternoon by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr adequate for that purpose. In any Yates), much to my surprise, that while our trade routes needed protection, Great Britain should alone bear this responsibility. figures of the relative war burdens borne by different countries of the world, must have come to the conclusion that more than her fair share of expense. While it was quite reasonable Mr Paterson. that Great Britain should provide for the? Personally, I sbould be very defence of Australia when it was a young, and comparatively unimportant colony,, surely, now that we have reached man'sestate, it is only fair that we should at least do our share to protect our traderoutes. . The houorable member for Reid this evening spoke about theThe difference between enormous war debt under which we are staggering, and yet, in the same breath he suggested that we should spend on one item of defence double the amount that was really neededHe wants Australia to buy cruisersin the most expensive market, deis something like spite our enormous war burden. That The interest bill alone honourable member and one or two others who preceded him stated that they regarded the proposal to build cruisers as an unproductive expense, and nothing else than sheer waste of money.' If that be so, would it not be worse to waste speaking, a difference of £3,500,000 than to waste £2,000,000? Surely, if this money is to be wasted we should waste as little as possibleThe wit of man has never yet devised', any satisfactory method of paying for exports except with imports of either goods or gold. If , as an exporting country, we must import, is it not better to> import something which we cannot ourselves make to advantage, and concentrate on those things which we canmake to advantage? We have beentold that if a cruiser is built in Great Britain, a great many men here will be thrown out of employThe saving in cost on one ment, but I would point out that whilecertain men may lose employment, othermen who provide those commodities, from the export of which we shall be able to pay for a cruiser, will obtain additional employment. Then we have been told that it is quite useless to provide fewer than, ten cruisers to safeguard our trade routes. Even ten cruisers, we were told byone honourable member, would be in case half a loaf is better tban ne bread. It is better that a man should insurehis house at one-quarter or even oneAny one who has studied the tenth of its value rather than-not insure -it at all. Two fast modern cruisers would at least be a very grave menace toraiders, and we know what effect raidGreat Britain has to bear ing vessels had on Australian shipping, in the early days of the war. We have been told tliat Australia should bo eniirely self-contained in the matter of -defence. I am glad that in many respects we are endeavouring to become .self-contained, especially in those particular services which will be urgently needed, regardless of cost, in the event of war. Accounts Committee I have had the ^privilege of inspecting various Commonwealth factories connected with our defence. I inspected the Acetate of Lime .Factory at Brisbane, whence that product is sent to Maribyrnong for conversion into .acetone for the making of gun cotton. .Acetate of lime is made from molasses, -and the factory at Brisbane is now obtaining from the same source power .alcohol which is used"" for motor vehicles in the Postmaster-General's Department. I have also inspected the Small Arms Eactory at Lithgow, in which rifles and machine guns are made. The work there is done so accurately that the staff think nothing of working to a quarter of a thousandth part of an inch. I have further seen the Maribyrnong and Footscray Cordite and Small Arms Munition Factories. It cannot be said that in this country the Government is doing nothing to make Australia self-contained by the provision of those things that we must nave, regardless of cost, in time of war, It has also been my privilege, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, to visit the Flying Station at Point Cook, the Flinders Naval Base, the Jervis Bay Naval -College, and the Duntroon Military College. by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) of the high cost of training cadets at the Jervis Bay and Duntroon Colleges. Honourable members opposite seem to be willing to spend unnecessarily great sums on the inanimate factors of our defence represented by -cruisers, but they would appear to grudge -spending what is necessary to turn young Australians into capable navalomcers and staff omcers for our army of defence. I went to the Jervis Bay Naval College with an absolutely open mind regarding that institution, and I must say that I was more than favourably impressed by what I saw. atmosphere of the place are all that could be desired. The institution is conducted on a truly democratic basis, and that .should be pleasing to honourable members opposite. Every young Australian who is physically and mentally fit has an equal opportunity to enter that establishment. There are no social barriers to entrance.. Indeed, I was informed that those who are qualified physically and have passed the educational examiAs a member of the Public nations for entrance to the college, are subjected to a final verbal examination, and at this examination the sons of one oil two highly-placed gentlemen in this country have been turned down. The cadets appear at this final examination with a number and without a name. They are unknown to the examiners, so that I am right in saying that every man's son has an equal chance of being accepted for the Jervis Bay or Duntroon Colleges. With regard to the cost of training youths at these colleges, I may point out that there are only about 40 cadets in each of the institutions. If we had four times as many attending each institution the overhead expense per cadet would, of course, be greatly cut down, and the cost of training would then appear very much less than it does now. Even with the figures as they are, these institutions compare quite favourably with West Point, in the United States of America, upon which I believe Duntroon has been modelled. A t West Point, although there are something like 1,400 cadets in training, the cost of training an officer has been calculated to be from $12,000 to §15,000, or, in round figures, from £2,790 to To-night we had some criticism £3,488. I believe'that the training there extends over four years, and assuming that it does, the cost amounts to something between £700 and £900 per cadet per aiinum. When we remember that the cost of training in Australia is about £1,200 per cadet per annum with only 40 cadets in each institution, we realize that the comparison with West Point is not unfavorable to our colleges. If the number of cadets in training at Jervis Bay College were increased ' to 160, a number which the college is capable of providing for, the cost of training would be cut down to £730 par cadet per annum. If there were 160 cadets in trainThe physical and moral ing at Duntroon the annual cost per cadet would be cut down to £600 per annum, which would be below the cost at West Point.. I should like to say a word with regard to the calibre of the young men turned out at these establishments. Tlie honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr ""Watkins) this evening waxed eloquent upon the quality of the ships that can be built in Australia. It would be very easy for any honourable member to become eloquent on t'he calibre of the young men who leave Duntroon and Jervis Bay colleges. When lads leave the Jervis Bay College at the age of seventeen, after completing a. four years' course, they go to the Old Country to complete their training, and have to undergo certain examinations there. In one year, of seven cadets who went in this way from Australia to the Old Country, five took tbe highest places in the examination against cadets from all England. That is a wonderful achievement, and says much for the efficiency of the instruction which they were given at the Jervis Bay Naval College. W it h regard to Duntroon College, I sbould like to quote what has been said by Lieutenant General SirH . G. Chauvel, in his report as Inspector-General of tlie Australian M i l it a r y Eorces. I may say that a Duntroon officer who leaves that establishment at the age of about 21 years would be very quickly snapped up by the B r i j tish military authorities if he cared to ; accept a commission in Great Britain. An Australian officer leaving Duntroon receives one year's seniority if he joins the BritishA r m y. high opinion the British military authorities have of the men turned out at Duntroon. Chauvel saysThat the Duntroon establishment has already justified its existence there can be no shadow bf doubt. To say that the 158 graduates who served in the late war had any bearing upon the 300,000 men who comprised the Australian Imperial Force would seem ridiculous, yet most, if not all, divisional, brigade, or regimental commanders will bear out my statement that this was so. The high ideals established at the college by the late General Bridges were a : potent influence, which made itself felt throughout. gradually spread throughout the Citizen Forces to-day. In giving the opinion of Sir John Monash, I remind honourable members that he is not a professional soldier, but au eminent civilian, who made a great reputation for himself as a soldier at the Eront. He saysAs a soldier I regard tlie naval and military colleges as tlie sheet-anchor of the whole of our .organization. In the 4th BrigadeI had a Mr Paterson. considerable number of Duntroon graduates under my command; I took the whole of the second-class from Duntroon with me, and they comprised a great portion of my officer class and acquitted themselves gloriously. Many of them reached senior rank. I know the supreme importance of maintaining educational establishments such as that of Duntroon in order to provide the nucleus of trained leaders without wliicli no defence organization is possible. He further saidIt is the most essential thing; it is more essential than onr military head-quarters. If one of these two had to be sacrificed, I would sooner sacrifice military head-quarters. I say, emphatically, that if the college is destroyed ive destroy also what hope Australia now has of defending herself. Major-General Sir. Brudenell White says of the Duntroon. graduatesThe opinion I formed of them, and one that was confirmed by many of the senior officers, was tliat tliey were invaluable, and in most cases tlie backbone of their units. I look upon Duntroon so much as a foundation that I should place its expenditure almost before anything olse. Lesti t should be said by honourable members that these are the opinions of soldiers, I should Hke to give a short extract from some remarks made by Professor Sir Edgeworth David, who is famous not only as an educationalist, but also for the part he took in an antarctic expedition and in the war. He said^From the point of view of national defence That shows what a and insurance, the sum expended on these two institutions is money well spent. It costs us something like £110,000 a year-£50,00 0 for Duntroon, and about £60,000 for Jervis Bay. Lieutenant-General SirH . G. In my judgment, it is by no means an excessive amount for the training of men for the defence of this country supposing we were seriously menaced at any time. I should like to say, in conclusion, that the amount spent on these two colleges, the expenditure of which is said by these eminent authorities to be so very necessary, represents less than 3 per cent, of our total defence expenditure. I shall vote for the second reading of the bill.

In. submitting the motion, I wish to state that we were rather alarmed this evening upon receiving a wireless message from the Commodore commanding the Australian Fleet at Port Moresby.

Some two or three weeks ago I made a request to thc Treasurer for a grant to the Potato By-products Company of Ballarat. As honourable members know, the price of potatoes is now very low, and, as a consequence, many -potato-growers are threatened with ruin. This is a matter of serious importance to the potato-growers of. Australia. This company has been formed at Ballarat to treat potatoes, so that both in years of plenty and when disease attacks the potatoes, there shall The honourable bo no waste. A mistake, however, was made by the company in erecting its plant on railway land. Had freehold, land been selected, it could have obtained financial assistance from the State Government. Its members, chiefly potato growers, have themselves put £10,000 or £.12,000 into the company. They have ordered the plant, but are now snort to the extent of about £10,000. If they can get from this Government immediately a loan of from £8,000 to £10,000, they will be in a position soon to treat 500 tons of potatoes a week, and obtain therefrom starch, glucose, and other by-products. _ In Germany, 500 factories are engaged in dealing with potatoes in . a similar manner. Starch is now being made in tbe Ballarat district, but, because of the tightness of the money market, there is a chance of this company not being able to carry on. A request has been made to tbe Treasurer for assistance, and I understand it haB since been submitted to the Minister for Customs. Those engaged in the flotation of the company are anxious to' know the Minister's intention. This matter does not concern only the growers in the Ballarat and Bungaree districts, but is of importance to. the whole of the potato growers of Australia. I ask the Minister to give it bis urgent and sympathetic consideration. Trade and Customs) [10.17] -This matter came before me.a day or two ago, and is now being inquired into. I promise the honourable member that I shall give it fair and close consideration, and leb him know tbe result in due course. suro that the word "" sympathetic "" does not convey a little more thn is intended in this case. I promise the honourable member the closest, fairest, and most business-like consideration of tbe application for a loan. Question resolved in the affirmative.
