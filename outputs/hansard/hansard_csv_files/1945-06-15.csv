I can assure the people of Australia that neither Queensland nor Miiy other State is being neglected in the plans being prepared for the standardization of railway gauges.

I move That the House do now adjourn. ported ? Five honourable members having risen in. support of the motion, action because I consider the subject with which I shall deal is the most serious domestic problem facing the Commonwealth to-day. I believe that honourable members generally will appreciate that the position is sufficiently alarming to demand an immediate meeting of State Ministers of Agriculture with the Commonwealth authorities if a calamitous dislocation of our distribution system is to be averted in the most critical months of the year. The position in Victoria is not only serious but is also in the process old military axiom that attack is the of becoming dangerous, due to what is commonly known as the "" chaff grab"". That term has been applied to the action of the Commonwealth in acquiring 2,000 tons of fodder which had been allocated to Victoria with the approval of the Director-General of Agriculture, Mr guilty party, and to place the innocent Bulcock. That chaff was bought and paid for, and, naturally, the system of distribution was based on the anticipation that tlie contract would be honoured. However, the Commonwealth, to use a colloquialism, "" threw a spanner into the works "". I have been intrigued lately by questions which honourable members opposite have been asking with the intention, in my opinion, of trying to prove bungling on the part of the Government of Victoria. The latest question on the subject was perfectly ludicrous, and is, I believe, being used as a kind of bed-time story for children. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr McLeod), in the course of the question, intimated that of a parcel of fodder lately handled by the Victorian authorities only 10 per cent, went to the most vitally affected areas of the State. The actual fact, as the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully)! probably knows, is that in the over-all distribution of fodder in Victoria 70 .per cent, has gone to the most vital areas. To try to the National Parliament that the Government of Victoria has been remiss in its duty in this regard and that it is deliberately neglecting to supply fodder in areas where it is most needed is both unfair and ludicrous. Instead of facing this serious issue in a responsible way, some honourable gentlemen opposite have been indulging in ""little Australianism"". It is deplorable that they should seek to make some small political capital out of what I believe to be a great national emergency. The honourable member for Wannon may have asked his question innocently, and independently of other questions, but he revealed a complete ignorance of the general position. The questions that have been asked bear all the marks of concerted action. The attack, if it may be so termed, is to attach guilt to the innocent victims instead of to those responsible. The best form of defence is being applied. Blaming the other fellow for that of which we are guilty is a dishonourable practice which usage has clothed with a certain degree of respectability. The purpose is to give the initiative to the",18,Allied Works Council Impressment Of Machinery

28,Mr Bowden,"I have taken thisvictim on the defensive. I believe the object of certain recent actions to be the covering up of "" the chaff grab "". I appreciate the reasons which cause honourable members representing border electorates in Victoria, to have an inferiority governmental but I cannot understand members making more difficult the solution of a problem of this nature, by trying to discredit their own State. Tliat ing; a false impression is being given in this Parliament, and the solution of the problem is being made more difficult. The concerted action to which I have referred is represented hy these facts: When the ""grab"" was correctly anticipated that a good deal of criticism would be aroused and. much hostility engendered; consequently, preparations were begun for the defence which Obviously would have to be made. At the outset, the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Victoria, Mr drastic rationing it has imposed in order Cain, moved the adjournment House to discuss what he termed "" the bungling of the Government on the fodder problem "". Honourable members will note the similarity of expression in that Parliament exactly euphonious, but easily understoodi. Simultaneously, member for Wannon began asking questions in this House for the same purpose, namely, to impute bungling to the Government of Victoria. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) party "". Not on one occasion did he deny the charge of bungling in an undertaking with which his own officers were intimately associated,. He gave to me the impression ofi benevolent acquiescence in the impeachment. Whilst promising to make further investigations in regard to the position in Victoria, he did not once say that he would also ascertain the reason why the State of New South Wales had not made provision for the rationing of fodder as the Government of Victoria had; because that would not have been "" playing ball "". The purpose of these attacks, obviously, wag to divert public -attention from a State that has lamentably failed to discharge its obligations to Mr Bowden. the country by rationing fodder as other States have had to do. Of course, the Government of New South Wales is not a Country party administration. I am happy in being able to provide a complete and devastating reply to the complex when discussing charge of bungling from, no less an matters in that State, authority than, tlie Director-nGeneral of Victorian Agriculture, Mr Bulcock. That gentleman, addressing in Melbourne the nine merchants importing chaff from Western Australia, said that Victoria had done is exactly what is happenan excellent job in the rationing of fodder; in. fact, it had done the best job of any of the Australian States. on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. to huav whether the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture will repudiate the statement off his chief executive officer. There is an answer to the petty attempts to impute bungling to a government which, to-day, is suffering because of the of the to bolster up fodder supplies for the benefit of those who have done nothing in the matter. The present "" grab "" is reminiscent of another "" grab "", by reason of which Victoria was mulct in an and this-""bungling""; not amount of £4,000,000, only to bolster up the revenues of the same State the honorabb of New South Wales. If this "" grab "" be Department ofi Agriculture in Victoria believes that it may result in the death of many hundreds, probably thousands, of horses, a consequence of which would be "" attended the the complete or partial dislocation of the provisions designed' to maintain essential services, including the sowing of crops and the clearing of dvains^-whick means the clearing of hundreds of miles of reticulating channels in the north-west of Victoria. channels have become filled with sand during the dry weather. I believe that, at the moment, more than 2,000 horses are being used in the attempt to complete the clearing of the drains, in order that water may be supplied to farms that are badly in need of it. In addition, 6,000 horses are engaged in the delivery of essential commodities in the city. If this",19,Fodder

33,Mr Bowden,"Perhaps so. Thosedanger be not averted, tbe difficulties of the Commonwealth will become immeasurably greater next year. 'Should we have the misfortune to experience a further drought on top of that through which we are now passing, and at the same time, by reason of neglect, be unable to have crops sown in areas in which they can he grown, our position at this time next year will be unenviable. That is one of the reasons for my having brought to the notice of the country to-day the serious position in which we are placed. Wheni t became apparent, early last year, that Victoria and several other States would not have sufficient fodder to maintain essential services, the Director General of Agriculture and several State Ministers of Agriculture conferred, and the order was issued' for stock to be taken of supplies throughout the Commonwealth. The discovery was made, that 24,000 tons of fodder was available for sale in Western Australia. The agreement wasreached that 10,000 tons of it should be diverted to South Australia. Apparently, that allocation satisfied that State. Mr Bulcock agreed, that the remainder of it-14,00 0 tons-should , go to Victoria. That State immediately seut officers to Western Australia, and they succeeded in purchasing 13,260 tons of chaff. Because of shipping difficulties, they could transport to Victoria during the year only 3,600 tons. Of the remainder, 4,000 tons was taken to the seaboard at Fremantle, and stored so that it would be convenient for shipment. Honourable members will note how convenient it was for the staging of the great "" grab "". HadI been Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, probably I would have realized the handy position in which I was placed when I wanted chaff for another State. The ostensible reason for the "" grab "" is that the chaff was needed to feed pit ponies in New South Wales. That gives to it a Commonwealth flavour, and also diverts attention from the delinquencies of New South Wales. It is ironical that Victoria should supply, out of its savings, fodder for pit ponies in New South Wales, and at the same time have to institute gas rationing because of inability to obtain sufficient supplies of coal, which could have been provided had the pit ponies worked full time. The [109] Minister knows what is being done in Victoria. He knows that the authorities have threatened to forbid the keeping of race-horses for training, but in New South Wales nothing of the sort has been done. If he had taken steps to ensure that race-horses in New South Wales were turned out before fodder was commandeered from another State for the benefit of New South Wales, sufficient fodder would have been saved to feed the pit ponies, and there would have been no need to take fodder from Victoria. Nothing has been done in New South Wales comparable with what Victoria has done in the rationing of fodder. In Victoria, on the other hand, a drastic rationing system has been introduced. Horse transport has been replaced by motor transport wherever possible. Racing has been "" cut to the bone"". Two-thirds of the number of race-horses formerly in training have been turned out;-betwee n 500 and 600 altogether-and last night it was stated that the remainder might also be turned out'. A coupon system has been introduced under which no one may buy a bag of chaff without producing a coupon. Coupons are issued on the basis of the number of horses which each person owns, and the kind of work he is doing. That procedure should have been followed in all States. It is entirely wrong that, from the fodder saved by rationing in Victoria, supplies should be commandeered by the Commonwealth for use in a State where no attempt has been made to save fodder. In addition to the 2,000 tons taken last week, the statement was made only yesterday that it was proposed to take another 500 tons. That would be indefensible while more than 600 racehorses remain in training in New South Wales. It has been said that the fodder taken from Victoria is only borrowedthat it will be replaced. The newspaper Westralia, a usually well-informed journal, states in an article headed "" The Chaff Grab ""As it is, there is a grave doubt whether the Commonwealth plan to replace from Western Australian sources the 2,000 tons of chaff diverted from Victoria to New South Wales, and the 2,000 additional tons that it is proposed to divert, is capable of fulfilment. If it is proposed to replace the chaff, the Government should investigate the possibility of doing so froiti what would be sated if race-horses were turned out in New South Wales. 1 am convinced that there is no need to take from Victoria the additional 500 tons mentioned while raCe-horses are still in training in New South Wales. The authorities in Victoria are perplexed as to how to maintain essential transport services. They have introduced an effective system for ration^ ing fodder, but the fodder thus saved has been grabbed by the Commonwealth because the State next door has appealed for supplies. The fodder available for purchase by Victoria, including pressed hay, rice hay, and 1,930 tons of straw, including rice straw, totals only 14,370 tons. In March of this year, there was in Victoria a total of 460,000 tons of fodder, whereas the normal reserve of fodder at that time of year is 1,250,000 tons. The Department of Agriculture in Victoria estimated that at the end of May, there was only 210,000 tons of fodder left in Victoria. There are 70,000 farina, so that there is an average of only 3 tons of fodder to each farm, leaving 14,370 tons for sale for outside workand this includes the quantity which is being diverted to New South Wales. [Extension of time granted.] According to the Victorian are 129,000 horses in the three Victorian districts most affected by drought, namely, the Wimmera, the Mallee and the northern areas. How are these horses to be fed during the next four or five months if the fodder which has been saved through our long-sightedness in Victoria is to be taken by the Commonwealth for the benefit of another State which is obviously in a better position as regards feed than is Victoria? recognize that other States have their problems, too, and that the position in New South Wales has been aggravated by the calamitous floods on the north coast; but I maintain that the Commonwealth has been remiss in not having imposed a general fodder rationing plan on the whole of the Commonwealth. It could be provided that, unless a State cooperated in the carrying out of this plan, supplies would not be made available to it. If the Commonwealth can commandeer chaff, it could' also refuse to commandeer for the benefit of any State llr. Bowden. which failed to comply with the rationing arrangements. It is not too late now to countermand the order for the diversion of this last 500 tons of fodder from Victoria, if it is proposed that it should go to the same destination as the earlier consignments. The Government should investigate the /possibility, of saving fodder by requiring race-horses in New South Wales to be turned out to grass. I ask the Minister not to acquiesce airily in the present situation, in which one State has bungled its fodder arrangements, and is now profiting at the expense of a State which, was mortprudent. Commerce and Agriculture) [11.15] The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), to whom I listened with great interest, is not aware of the facts. He presented his case moderately and, I am sure, to the best of his' knowledge; but I think it was inspired by the Govern* ment of Victoria. We all know that there is no more astute politician in Australia than the Premier of Victoria, who, when* ever he desires to cover his tracks, attacks the Commonwealth Government and charges it with bungling. I know as much about Australia's fodder position Year-Booh, there as, at least, any one in Victoria. The Commonwealth Government arranged with the Government of Western Australia for 24,000 tons of hay above the usual quantity to be cut for the eastern : States. I made the arrangement on behalf of the Commonwealth Government with the Minister for' Agriculture in Western Australia on the definite understanding that all the drought affected eastern States would receive their I quotas. Subsequently Cabinet approved, on my submission, of the payment by the Commonwealth of a subsidy of £6 a ton on all that hay. A singular fact, of which I was not aware, I admit, until quite recently, is that Victorian fodder merchants went to Western Australia and secured 14,000 tons of thai fodder. The Government of South Australia obtained 10,000 tons. That accounted for the lot. Would it be equitable for the Commonwealth Government, after having arranged for the 24,000 tons to be cut in Western Australia, and having agreed to pay a subsidy of",20,Fodder

The Director-General of Agriculture, Mr that Victoria had done the best job of Bulcock, wrote to the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, Mr Martin, on the 14th September, 1944, suggesting that the State Government should have the power to acquire stocks of hay and chaff so as to be in a position to enforce the release of existing stocks and to arrange the distribution to the best advantage. Mr Martin was asked to give urgent consideration to the suggestion and to adjvise whether he was prepared to accept the responsibility of acquiring and distributing the various stocks of fodder. Had Mr Martin accepted that suggestion at the time, he would have had a clear knowledge of the fodder supplies existing in his State. Asi t is, on his own admission, he has no knowledge of fodder crops in Victoria, and in order to ascertain these he started early in May a census which was to have been completed by the 15th May, but was not. Time will not permit me to go into details of the debate on fodder on the adjournment of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. The Melbourne Sun on last Wednesday published the following:Hay and chaff will not be able to be bought animals. The view was expressed that without coupons alter Friday, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr Martin) announced last night. This order-mad e under the National Security Kegulations-n-will apply to Melbourne readily forthcoming and the quality of metropolitan area, and in the cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. . Mr production of coal would be serious. Mr Martin said it was expected that the new system would eliminate 2,500 horses in the areas affected. [ emphasize Mr Martin's words "" would eliminate"". We have had a fodder crisis for a long time, but not until now has the Government of Victoria taken a serious view of it and taken steps to eliminate 2,500 horses from the fodder pool. Here is an indication that many horses were getting fodder to which they were not justly entitled. If the plan instituted by the Victorian Government had been instituted when the Government of South Australia took over the acquisi^ tion of fodder in South Australia, the position would have been a great deal better. The Director-General of Agriculture, in September of last year, appealed to the Minister for Agriculture in Victoria to take actionMr BowDEN.^-Was he right in saying all. "" Did you make that statement ?"", and he said, "" In no circumstances, can I remember making it "" . I said, ""Are you sure you did not make it ?"", and he said, "" I cannot, for the life of me, remember having said that"". made it. recollection of it. Only a few days ago, 800 tons of fodder was delivered from Western Australia to Victoria, Prior to that, the shipments to that State exceeded 5,000 tons. Consequently, with 1 the quantity from Western Australia Victoria received more than 6,000 tons. The position regarding colliery horses in New South Wales was becoming acute, and Mr Bulcock conferred with me on the subject. I had received urgent letters from various agencies controlling sup^ plies of fodder for colliery horses, and, incidentally, I received some private letters from the men in charge of those the ieed position was becoming deplorable, and that, unless supplies were more the feed were improved, the effect on the Bulcock mentioned that a shipment of fodder would be leaving Western Australia, and suggested that 2,000 tons of chaff should 'be diverted to New South Wales. ThenI received from the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson,"" the first intimation that the irrigation channels in the Wimmera were in a serious condition, and that the diversion of the chaff to New South Wales would seriously interfere with the work of clearing them and inflict great hardship upon settlers in the MalleeI immediately rang Mr J.

That instruction will .be observed. Following a further rethe Commonwealth in an expenditure of quest from the secretary of the Victorian ""Wheat and Wool Growers Association, fodder, which would be unloaded, must be sent to the country districts of Victoria. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) accused the Government ofi having shown preference to New South Wales at the expense of Victoria. Discrimination against any State in favour of another State is to be deplored at any time, and, since becoming a Minister, I have not held any special brief for New South Wales any more than for any other State. In my administration, I have not, shown partiality to any State, and while I remain a Minister, I shall always endeavour to adopt a strictly impartial attitude. Indeed, a Minister would be recreant to bis trust if he were to act otherwise. Recently, the Director-General of Agriculture and the Food Controller visited the rice-growing areas in New South Wales, and imfiormed me that, if the Government were prepared to subsidize the cutting, a quantity of, rice-hay could be obtained for fodder. I immediately secured the approval of the Treasury for the expenditure, and 6,000 tons of ricehay will be made available in New South Walqs. The Minister for Agriculture in that State has agreed to the immediate diversion of 2,000 tons ofi rice-hay to the districts in Victoria mentioned by the honourable member for Gippsland. Since the shortage of fodder became acute, New South Wales has constantly adopted » reasonable and generous attitude to Victoria. Of course, the position of Victoria is acute; but, so also is the position in eertain other States. The disastrous floods in the northern coastal districts of New South Wales are accentuating the fodder difficulty. The Commonwealth Government has done all that is humanly Mr Scully. have subsidized heavily. About 6,000,000 form of oats in it, has been purchased from the United States of America at a cost to the Commonwealth Government of between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000 sterling. Incidentally, the transport of wheat from Western Australia to the eastern States will involve £2,500,000. From these figures it will be seen that the Commonwealth Government has not been recreant to its trust. Recently, two officers of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture proceeded to New Zealand for the purpose of purchasing fodder. One of them returned yesterday; the other will remain to supervise the loading of the feed. They have secured 7,500 tons of hay, which will be shipped to the eastern States. The first shipment of 2,500 tons will be made next week. Al l that has heen done on behalf of the States, and Victoria will receive, perhaps, a little more than its quota. Because of the adverse seasonal conditions, that State has a more urgent need of fodder than any other State, with the possible exception of South Australia, where drought conditions are still serious. The honourable member for Gippsland may rest assured, that no State will be shown preferential treatment. The diversion of fodder, which has been referred to, was absolutely necessary. For a considerable period, the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) has acted for me in Western Australia to supervise the marshalling and conveyance of fodder to the seaboard. That work has been done at Commonwealth instigation and expense. Yet the Government of Victoria has never* expressed appreciation of the Commonwealth's efforts in this direction. A few days ago, members of the Victorian Country party vehemently attacked the attitude of the State Government, because they knew the true position, and the degree of Commonwealth aid that had been given. I have received' from the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association a bitter complaint about the failure to send fodder from Western Australia into the",23,Fodder
40,"Mr Mccredden, I Stipulated That The","country districts of Victoria. The distribution was not supervised by the State Government, as was done in South Australia in order to ensure ah equitable apportionment. It was left to private enterprise to make the distribution as it saw fit. The honourable member for Gippsland submitted his case with moderation; his approach to subjects is always fair and reasonable. Eef erence has been made to the provision of fodder for race-horses. Of course, supplies for this purpose have been reduced considerably in Victoria and New South Wales. I have been in frequent consultation with the Minister for Transport regarding the fodder position. For many months permission has been given for horses to be transported to country districts where agistment is available in local centres, and where there is fodder that could not be railed to metropolitan areas. I was also in consultation, a few days ago, with the Acting Premier of New South Wales and with officers of the Australian Jockey Club, and I was informed that a considerable reduction had been made in the number of horses in training; consequently compulsory action was not needed. L have also been in communication with the Minister of Agriculture in New South Wales, Mr Graham, who made the following points in regard to fodder control in that State:New South Wales controls fodder distribution by the issue of transport permits. There are no permits for fodder for racehorses. No Western Australian fodder goes to racehorses. Four thousand bags of oats were confiscated from race-horse owners in New South Wales. Returns are obtained from all persons holdto whom the Minister for Commerce and ing more than 10 tons of fodder. Ft will be apparent, therefore; that New South Wales has taken certain action to control fodder. Whether its control measures have been as effective as those of Victoria, I am not in a position to say. The diversion of 2,000 tons of fodder from Victoria to New South Wales has been made the basis for this attack; but 1 point out, as I have done earlier, that the fodder was urgently needed for colliery horses. I am aware that fodder is also needed for horses doing essential work in some country districts of Victoria, but I am sure that all honourable members realize that, unless fodder were provided for colliery horses, coal production would be seriously affected, and coal is essential to the maintenance of the war effort. {Extension of time granted.] I made a public statement that 2,000 tons of Western Australian fodder was being diverted from Victoria to New South Wales. I know nothing of any additional diversion, and it could not be effected without my approval. When I made the statement. I also understood that the amount so diverted would be made up to Victoria subsequently, and I guaranteed that that State would receive the 14,000 tons which had l>een allocated to it. I admit that the allocation of 24,000 tons of Western Australian fodder purchased with the help of a subsidy from the Commonwealth Government was not made on a proportionate basis between New South Wales and Victoria, but the special circumstances of the case had to be considered. The attack that has been made on the Commonwealth in this regard has come principally from the Premier and the Minister of Agriculture in Victoria. There is no more astuto politician in Australia than Mr Dunstan, and he and his colleague, in my opinion, have made this attack in order to cloak their own deficiencies, and to take attention away from their own bungling. The honourable member for Gippsland is, no doubt, doing his best to get them out of the difficulty in which their mishandling of fodder has put them. [11.40] -I do not intend to bake up the cudgels on behalf of the State Ministers Agriculture ( Mr Scully) has referred; but I have no hesitation whatever in saying that that honourable gentleman is himself far from blameless for the difficult fodder position that has arisen. I am not so foolish as to blame him for the drought. I say, frankly, that seasonal conditions, the lack of man-power, and insufficient superphosphate have all contributed to the situation. But I remind the Minister that I warned him in 1943 of what would happen unless reserve stocks of fodder were accumulated. In order to refresh the honourable gentleman's memory, I shall read from Mansard",24,Fodder
41,Mr Mcdonald (Corangamite),"of -the 1st July, 1943, page 699, the following report of my remarks on that occasion:I take this opportunity to draw the attention of tlie minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) to something which w ill react seriously against the industry unless something ibe done about it . Recently, a ceiling price was fixed for oats and hay. The producers of these products have mot previously sought assistance from the Government. They have ploughed their lonely furrows and have taken the consequences. The ceiling price of oats has been fixed at 2s. l i d . per bushel. to do with this bill. portant that oats and hay be grown in order to provide a reserve fodder in case of drought. Unless something he done, farmers will not sow oats. The present cost of threshing and bagging oats is equivalent to one-third of the selling price fixed by the Prices Commissioner. It costs 2s. Cd. a bushel to thresh a bag of oats. Allowing another 5d. a bushel for freight, 1 bushel in every bag is required to meet those charges alone. reduce tbe price of oate. farmers had on hand stocks which they could not thresh because the price was too low. T b j position will become worse unless the Government is prepared to say that a certain area of land must 'be sown with oats in order to provide reserves and guard against periodical droughts. The position is serious, and .1 urge the Minister to consult his officers with a view to doing something which will permit these producers to get a l a i r return. If that he not done, hundreds of acres which should be sown with oats will be used for other purposes. The Minister has to-day admitted that the Commonwealth Government is subsidizing ""Western Australian fodder producers to the amount ofi £6 a ton in respect of hay that has been purchased from them to meet urgent requirements in the eastern States. That situation could have been avoided had the ceiling price of hay been fixed in 1943, not at £3 15s. or £4 a ton in the metropolitan areas, which, in some instances, was equivalent to only £3 5s. a ton in country districts, but at a reasonable price which would have given producers a fair return. In 1943, thousands of acres of ploughed land could have been sown for hay, hut the fixed ceiling price was so low that farmers could not afford to sow. That low ceiling price must also be considered in conjunction with increased wages of from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. have unloaded a portion of its caTgo an hour which farmers were comat Melbourne, leaving only sufficient to pelled to pay to rural workers under National Security Regulations. Those high wages., combined with the shortage of men owing to the military call-up, and the knowledge that at harvest-time only a limited number of partially incapacitated men would be available, caused many farmers to withhold from sowing oats and other grain for hay. The statement by the Minister to-day that a subsidy of £6 a ton has been paid ,<m this hay, 'constitutes an admission that the Government acted wrongly when, in 1943, upon its attention having been drawn to the danger with which the country was confronted, it refused to guarantee to the growers a price which would have induced them to provide a reserve stock of fodder, with which we could have carried on. These facts are indisputable. There is another point in connection with the diversion of the shipment of 2,000 tons from Western Australia. The Minister will, remember that early in the week I asked him two questions. There had .been a lot of newspaper commenit. I read in one newspaper that the purpose of the diversion was to feed pit ponies In reply to my question, the Minister pointed out that, in addition to pit ponies, there were colliery horses. He also informed me that the total number was 2,000. The diversion of 2,000 tons of fodder for 2,000 animals was a most liberal ration, and was not necessary at a time when cattle and horses were dying throughout the country districts of Victoria. The action of the Commonwealth was particularly unjust, having regard to the fact that the foddier had been stored for a specific purpose on behalf of the Victorian Government. I remind the Minister also that the arrangement by South Australia and Victoria was made with the full acquiesstand, had full power in the matter. My main contention is that, even though it might have been necessary to provide temporary relief for the pit ponies and horses engaged in coal mines, the diversion of 2,000 tons was not justified at the time.",25,Fodder

The Minister has stated that 7,000 tons of fodder has been purchased in New Zealand, and that Victoria will get a portion of it. What will he the use of this feed if the stock have died before it becomes available? They require sustenance when they are starving. supplies in the Victorian districts mentioned were sufficient to last for three weeks; consequently, it was not a case of life or death. Mr MoDONiAIil) -That is not correct. Men supplying some townships with milk had to cease doing so. It is impossible to get even a pint of milk for an infant in some townships. 1 cannot believe that it was necessary to divert 2,000 tons of hay to New South Wales for the purpose of feeding 2,000 horses, when other supplies were being procured from New Zealand. [Extension of time' granted.] I admit that pit ponies are engaged on essential work. But I remind the Minister that 6,000 horses carrying on essential services in the city of Melbourne have to be fed. They have been put on a ration that has been ""out to the bone"". It has been rightly said that the steps taken by Victoria to eke out its supplies of fodder are not paralleled' in any other State. exists in connection with horses in the other States. ' same. Tbe Minister has admitted that the conditions are infinitely worse in Victoria and South Australia than in New South Wales. Only Gippsland has had anything like a normal season. A portion of New South Wales is enjoying a good season. I realize,of course, that the northern coastal districts which experienced a disaster last week will need fodder. Had they participated in the hay that was diverted, I should not have complained. The Minister cannot absolve himself of responsibility for what has happened, because in 1943 he was told of the likelihood of the present position arising; yet he and other Ministers, particularly one Minister, said that there was no need for us to prompt the Government as to what it should do, and that it wa3 quite capable of taking whatever action might be necessary. If it be possible to acquire hay from New Zealand in the near future, I implore the Minister to divert 2,000 tons to Victoria, to replace the quantity of which that State has been deprived for the benefit of New South Wales. Onlyi f it be obtained in the near future will the lives of thousands of stock be saved. The point that impressed me most in the case stated by the honourable members for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) and Corangaand their complete ignorance of the real facts. Australia as a whole is passing through the dual tragedy of a war and a drought, but Victoria has the triple tragedy of the war, the drought, and the Dunstan Government, whose complete blundering in connection with the fodder position has led that State into a very serious position. Let us consider the 24,000 tons of Western Australian hay which, because of action' by the Commonwealth Government, was set aside as a reserve upon which the eastern States were able to draw. As far back as the 5th October last, the agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States that, in the absence of an emergency, approximately 14,600 tons should be distributed in Victoria and 9,400 tonsin South Australia. A little later, however, Mr Martin altered the figure, and issued is not the permits to private merchants to purchase 13,230 tons. How he arrived at that figure, we do not know. In the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, on the 22nd May, he said that approximately 3,000 tons had been received from Western Australia, and that it was believed that a further 8,000 tons would be received. It is clear that he had no knowledge of the facts. The statement of the honourable member for Gippsland-, that Victoria received 3,600 tons, is quite incorrect. The merchants given permitsby tbe Government of Victoria hadreceived up to last week 5,542 tons. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture said that probably an additional 500 tons has since been delivered. In Western Australia, 750 tons has been loaded and",26,Fodder

54,"Mite ( Mr Mcdonald) Was Its Inaccuracy,","is probably on the way to Victoria. This will bring the total deliveries to 6,792 tons. The Commonwealth Government promised that by the 30th September, 24,000 tons would be brought from ""Western Australia and distributed between Victoria and South Australia. Only 10,717 tons remains to be transported to fulfil that obligation. The Commonwealth has more than honoured its promise to maintain supplies. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture was responsible for having 4,000 tons stored at Fremantle. Arrangements were, made with the Director of Road Transport in Western. Australia to establish a pool, and to ensure that no chaff would be left behind the cutters. A pool was established on North Wharf, Fremantle, for the purpose of maintaining a steady flow of supplies. The position in Victoria could not have been affected by any action of the Commonwealth, because as yet no hay has been diverted. The 2,000 tons said to have been "" grabbed "" has not yet left the coast of Western Australia. The honourable member for Gippsland claimed that party politics had been introduced by Mr Cain, when he moved the adjournment of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria to discuss the fodder position. A debate on the fodder position was first instituted on the 22nd May, hy no other than a Country party member, Mr On the 4ith of this -month a permit was Dodson, the representative of Ouyen. In the course of his remarks, he said that had the Parliament been meeting for more than one day a week, he would have brought the debate on a fortnight earlier. [Extension of time granted.] means that the conditions in Victoria to which reference has been made to-day, were operating on the 8th May. Yet the direction to divert 2,000 tons was not given until the 7th June. Members of the Australian Country party say that party politics should not be introduced into the discussion, but they are themselves attempting to screen the incompetence and the inaction of the Victorian Government. This is what Mr Dodgshun saidI have made representation to the Minister tons was obtained, besides 8,000 tons to the effect that we -should have acquired from South Australia and 6,000 tons earlier in the year the stocks of hay, grass, from Western Australia. and of other growths that can be used for stock fodder. My reason for that is that because we did not acquire those on the other States. Mr Lemmon. stocks some persons have been able to build up their supplies, to the detriment of people in more urgent need and having first priority businesses to attend to. I have been informed by reliable authority that a machine has gone to, say, ten farms and has found that there are no oats for seed on those places. In that area there may be a proportion of six or seven to one among the farmers who have no oats for seed. That means that the oat crop will be depleted in those areas this year, and I think that condition applies generally throughout the State. The honourable member for Gippsland claimed that racing has been reduced in Victoria, but horses are still being raced there. As one who knows something about racing, I say that more than 3,000 bushels of oats is being fed to racehorses in that State each week and this grain might well be used as seed. statement of the posi tion. statement by a Victorian member of the Country party who had no axe to grind. Mr Dodgshun went onA n instance in my own electorate was brought under my notice, in which a man was offered £2 10s. a bag for oats if he could get the fodder to Melbourne to feed racehorses. I know that £20 a ton has been paid for hay in the black market. Hay and other fodder are being devoted to unessential uses. Mr Cain, in the course of the discussion, saidissued to a man, who owns half a dozen horses, to buy a truck of chaff; in other words 11 tons or 220 bags. This man was permitted to buy 11 tons of chaff, sufficient to last him for three months; yet we are told that infanta are That going without milk because there is no fodder for cows. The statements I have quoted have not been challenged, so it would appear that the responsibility for the present state of affairs in Victoria must be accepted by those whom the honourable member for Gippsland defends. The Victorian Government cannot escape blame. According to the figures cited by the honourable member for Gippsland there was 460,000 tons of fodder in Victoria in March of this year.

The Dunstan Government failed to arrange for the proper distribution of fodder, because Mr Dunstan did not approve of interfering with private enterprise. A vast amount of fodder was left in the control of merchants. In such circumstances, I am justified with charging the Dunstan Government with collaborating with black marketeers. The Dunstan Government also failed to co-operate with the Commonwealth in arrangements for the proper distribution of wheat. When it was found necessary to arrange a distribution scheme, all the State governments agreed to co-operate except the Victorian Government, and the Commonwealth was compelled to go ahead without it. appeal to Mr Martin for co-operation, and he refused it. vernment vies with Ghandi as a promoter of non-co-operation and civil disobedience. So serious has been the bungling of the situation by the Government of Victoria that, unless there is an improvement in the handling of fodder which the Commonwealth makes available, it will have to take control for the duration of the war of the Victorian Department of Agriculture, so that there may be equitable distribution of whatever supplies are available. support the protest of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) against the diversion of 2,000 tons of chaff which had been obtained by the Victorian Government for the feeding of stock in drought-stricken areas. I doubt whether the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) realizes how bad is the position in parts of Victoria. In the northern and western districts conditions are tragic. Never before in the history of the State have they been so bad. which is needed to save the lives of horses to cut hay, but it was impossible to do and cattle is a crime. Hundreds of good horses have already been shot, and a great many more will have to be destroyed unless the weather breaks. other States, also. Australia is having its troubles, too, but fodder has not been taken from that State. Victoria is the aggrieved party. Notwithstanding the accusations which have been made against the Victorian Government, the fact remains that it is the only State government which has tried to distribute to the best advantage what fodder is available. There is no merit in the criticism that much of the fodder has been used in the metropolitan area. That is largely because the Commonwealth Government, admittedly as part of the war effort, imposed restrictions on motor transport. There are about 6,000 horses employed in essential work, delivering food, &c, in the metropolitan area, and they must be fed. Only the other day the people of the little town of Wedderburn informed the Minister for Agriculture in Victoria that they were without milk, because there was no fodder with which to feed the few dairy cows still alive. Their experience is typical of that of many towns in the northern and western areas. The Commonwealth Government cannot be acquitted of blame for the present fodder shortage in Victoria and South Australia. The last opportunity to establish a reserve of fodder in Victoria occurred in 1943. The Victorian Minister for Agriculture, Mr Martin, asked the Commonwealth Government to arrange with the Prices Commissioner to raise the selling price of hay, then fixed at about £5 a ton. The man who actually grew the hay received only about £3 15s. or £4 a ton. Labour was scarce, and it paid the farmers better to harvest their crops for grain, and that they did. Although Mr Martin made representation over a period of two months, the Prices Commissioner waited until March before raising the price to £7 a ton, and it was then too late to cut hay. Mr Martin was prepared to make a drive in the Wimmera area, where there was fairly good crops, to induce the people",28,Fodder

It is probable that an extra 100,000 tons of fodder would have 'been available if the Commonwealth Government or its servants had had enough sense to realize the position. In the electorate of the honourable member for ""Wimmera( Mr Wilson) there are thousands of miles of water channels which must be cleaned out so as to be ready for use when water is available. Otherwise the whole countryside will revert lo desert. Horses are needed to do this work, and those horses must be fed. Therefore, I urge the Minister to replace the chaff which has been taken and to get additional fodder, if possible, for those States in which the effects of the drought are most severe. honourable member for Gippsland ( MrA schoolboy would know that in a time of Bowden) must 'be a very innocent and faithful follower of Mr Dunstan. He seems grieved because I suggested that the distribution of fodder in Victoria had been faulty, and he charged me with attacking the Victorian Government. I see no reason why I should not attack the Victorian Government, if necessary, when every newspaper in Australia carries attacks against the Commonwealth Government, and particularly against the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully). Not. one is well founded. The honourable member accused the Minister of bungling and incompetence. The only bungling and incompetence disclosed is that of the Dunstan Government. Several questions I asked about fodder were asked with the purpose of establishing its guilt in that respect and the answers I received had that result. In certain areas of Victoria last year there were reasonably good crops. There were good crops in the western district. I had a fairly good crop. There were good crops in the district represented by the honourable member for Gippsland. Why did the Minister of Agriculture in Victoria not then take a census of the fodder on hand, both Victorian grown and imported? Victoria imported 16,000 tons from New South Wale's. last the Victorian Minister of Agriculture was asked by the Director-General of Agriculture to take a eensus. because, like all other members of the Australian Country party, Federal or State, instead of representing the primary producers, as they claim, he represents big business-in this instance, the fodder merchants. I was told, in answer to one question, that there was 1,000 tons of hay at Werribee when horses were starving in the north. That is the result of having distribution in the hands of merchants. No wonder there is a black market. It was only when he saw that the farmers were at last waking up to his shortcomings that Mr Martin took refuge in an attack on this Government, particularly the Minister for 'Commerce and Agriculture, doubtless on the theory -The that attack is the best means of defence. shortage maldistribution of fodder occurs if it is left in the hands of the merchants to dispose of. of it? vernment should have purchased all fodder stocks in the State and placed the control and distribution in the hands of the Department of Agriculture. occurred in South Australia where the State Government acquired the fodder. torian Minister of Agriculture has now announced a coupon system of rationing of fodder, but it is too 'late. There is a big gap between the quantity of fodder disclosed by Mr Martin's census and that which, on my reckoning, should be on hand. Who can tell where it has gone ? The questionnaire did not compel the disclosure of all the needed facts. Aware of his administrative failure, Mr Martin has used the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) as his "" stooge"" in order to divert attention from his own incompetence by charging the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture with bungling. He was guilty of criminal negligence in allowing hay stocks to get into private hands during the worse drought we have known.

Then we should not have had all this humbug from the honourable member for Gippsland about the incompetence of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, when all the Incompetence is really to be found in the Victorian Ministry. [12.21] -No amount of eloquence can hide the bungling of the Commonwealth Government on the fodder question. The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) had. legislation passed by this Parliament in 1940 for the establishment of fodder reserves in Australia, but, not long afterwards, the Curtin Government took office, and, from the time that the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Scully) took over the Commerce portfolio, which was later changed to Commerce and Agriculture, there has been one long consistent record of bungling and misunderstanding of the agricultural position. The honourable memread what he forecast. I will not burden the House with the statements I made from time to time, but I do tell the Minisdoes not know what he is talking about. ter for Commerce and Agriculture that to-day you cannot buy oats for seed. Oats were sold in my district at Christmas, and for a little while afterwards, at auction, for £1 a bag and no weights. I tried to buy oats for my own property[ do not need many-bu t I could not get one merchant in Adelaide to accept an order, although the price is fixed at 3s. 6d. a bushel for seed oats and 3s. 2d. a bushel for milling into oatmeal. The result is that at the Hotel Kurrajong, \Vhere many honourable members stay, we get semolina for breakfast instead of rolled oats. That is due partly to the failure of the Government to make prices worthwhile and partly to the labour shortage position, plus the ridiculous wages that the farmers are compelled to pay for incompetent hands. The wage rates were put into operation by regulation after Parliament adjourned, and the regulation was withdrawn the day before it met again, so that this House should not have the opportunity to debate and vote upon it. We shall have the ill effects agriculture. as long as the Scully wheat plan lasts. Never has a Minister for Commerce and Agriculture done more towards producing uncertainty, inefficiency and want in the wheat industry than has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture under what he has been pleased to call the ""Scully wheat plan"". If ever we appointed in this country a commission to try men as war criminals, I believe that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture would be the first to be placed in the dock. The Border Watch, of Mount Gambier, on Saturday, the 26th May, 1945, published the following illuminating article:Mr L. A. de Garis, speaking at a meeting of the District War Agriculture Committee on L4th May, 1945, saidBefore proceeding, I point out to .the Minister that at Millicent the whole District War Agricultural Committee re>signed in protest against its treatment by the Minister. Mr de Garis said in regard to production of meadow hayIn September last we passed a resolution te the Government that they give publicity and advertise that the price of £0 per ton would be paid for meadow hay. He is ignorant of the facts. We do not control district war agricultural committees; they are the responsibility of the State governments. district war agricultural committees were formed as a part of the war organization of this country. you know something about. know something about it. One of the jobs of district war agricultural committees is to make recommendations to Eederal Ministers; for instance, in relation to the release of man-power from the forces, and that is something with which the States have nothing whatever to do.

Mr de Garis went onI t was apparent (or definite) that this would be a very useful product. The committee became so enthusiastic that an urgent telegram was scut to Adelaide. While at that time there was no height or length of grass there was a good body and with the normal September and October rains in the southeast it was quite possible tliat a large area of land would be closed up for this purpose, no notice was taken of this committee until tlie grass was ready to cut. The people as a body did not know of any guarantee of price, and consequently grazed hundreds of acres which could have been closed up, and produced a very great quantity of meadow hay. So, through lack of co-operation from the Commonwealth, the opportunity was lost. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, if tbe ""Agriculture"" part of his title means anything, must have some powers in regard to agriculture. He has powers in regard to wheat. A colleague fixes the price of hay and oats. The Ministry fixes the price of barley. It fixed the prices of clover seed, meadow hay, and everything else, but the Minister says that this has nothing to do with him, and that it is a matter for the States. Time after time he has risen in this House and assured us that the dairying industry is all right. No one could truthfully say that everything is well with the dairying industry. If everything is well with it, why was the subsidy to the industry increased by £2,000,000 only this week? That is one point. The other is this: Will the Minister deny that the Department of Commerce and Agriculture is subsidizing the price of chaff in certain quarters? He knows that it is. I received to-day from a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia who lives in my electorate a letter which was in the Minister's office before this debate opened. In it he can see for himself the names of persons in my electorate who have been charged £11 a ton for chaff. Can wheat be grown for 4s. 3d. a bushel if you have to pay £11 a ton for chaff to feed the horses needed for the sowing? It is very doubtful, indeed. The whole administration of agriculture by the Minister is such that the sooner the Ministry is reconstructed the better. ber's record as Minister for Commerce was the most sorry of any Minister in the Menzies Government. ence to Hoynsard will show that my record of things done well ranks among the highest. The Department of Commerce and Agriculture has no definite policy, and no perception of what confronts the agricultural industries of Australia. Given another dry season this year, disaster will overtake them. No rain worth mentioning has fallen in South Australia this year. Seed wheat has been sown although only half an inch of rain has fallen, and unless the country receives bountiful rains between now and harvest time, huge areas of South Australia will have suffered three successive years of drought. There are no reserves of fodder and grain, and there is no sign of grass, so that stock losses in Victoria, to which the honourable member for Corangamite referred, will be small compared with the losses that will occur in South Australia. ber has exhausted his time. My interest in this controversy as to who is to blame for the present fodder shortage in Australia is that the problem shall be resolved in a rational and sensible manner, so that primary producers in drought-stricken areas, who are suffering so acutely, shall receive all the fodder that can possibly be made available to them in order that they may continue their farming operations and their stock may survive. Some weeks ago, I referred to the controversy on fodder which has arisen in Victoria. The Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association communicated with me on the subject, and. I raised the matter on the adjournment of the House. Prior to that occasion, no other honourable member had mentioned it. Subsequently, I received from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) assurances that no discrimination would be shown between States in the distribution of the limited",31,Fodder

84,Mr Wilson (Wimmera) [12.31],"supplies of fodder available. Tbat is m .v approach to this problem. The shortage of fodder, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, calls for a proper survey and acquisition of surplus stocks, as has been done in South Australia, so that supplies may be distributed equitably to primary producers in urgent need of them. In my district, we are experiencing the third year of drought. Supplies of stock feed are exhausted, and are being imported from wherever they can be obtained. The water reticulation system, which is choked with sand, constitutes our greatest problem at present. The channels must be cleared, so that a run of water will be possible. Stock are dying from lack of feed, and the shortage of water. With the passing of time, that position will be accentuated. I take no sides in this controversy as to who is to blame. But responsible governments should co-operate for the purpose of alleviating the plight of settlers who are suffering from the drought. Let them cease playing the game of party politics in regard to this great national problem! I agree that, in Victoria, the position has not been so effectively dealt with or handled so courageously as it was in South Australia. 1 commend the Government of South Australia for having followed the right course, even though it was the unpopular one. In pursuing its plan of acquisition, the Government met with the utmost hostility from farmers and others who were holding stocks of hay, but that did not deter the Government from doing what, in the circumstances, was obviously the correct thing. In Victoria we have witnessed a continual ""passing of the buck"". We all are aware of the reluctance of the Government of Victoria to interfere in any way by means of regulations or controls, which it has opposed and denounced on every possible occasion. But what is the result of the shortage of fodder ? The whole field has been left open to all sorts of abuses and black marketing. That view has been sustained by the recent statements of members of the Parliament of Victoria, representing the political party to which I belong. Undoubtedly, those abuses are occurring; and when we are told that supplies of milk for children and invalids may have to be rationed, surely the time has come to drop party politics, and do something effective to solve the problem. A practical solution would be for the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, even now, to call another conference of all State Ministers for Agriculture for the purpose of deciding upon a policy, which could be put into operation uniformly throughout droughtaffected areas, for the equitable distribution of the limited quantities of fodder available. If that conference were held, we should see whether any State government was prepared to withhold its cooperation, and, if necessary, we could call its bluff. I suggest that to the Minister as a way out of the problem. Question resolved in the negative. 1945. In committee: Consideration resumed from the 14th June (vide page 3126). Clause 155(3.) Where the Back enters into an arrangement under section thirty-seven of this Act, or the Savings Bank enters into an arrangement under section one hundred and twenty four of this Act, the Bank may appoint to the Service of the Bank officers of the body corporate or savings bank with which the arrangement is made although they have not passed a prescribed entrance examination. the Opposition) [12.39] I move That, in sub-clause (3.), the word ""may"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""shall"". This elause deals with the requirements for appointment to the service of the Commonwealth Bank, and is an extremely important provision, because it establishes a new method of recruitment of staff for the bank. It provides, in effect, that the system of selection of entrants which was previously followed shall disappear, and that a system of competitive examination shall be substituted for it. This is one of several provisions in the bill which will approximate the service of the Commonwealth Bank to the general Public Service. I do not desire to occupy much time in discussing this clause, but I believe that when we are dealing with a financial institution in which the relations between the bank",32,Fodder
85,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r ofstaff and the public are relations of great trust and confidence, the method of selection of staff by the bank is very much to be preferred to a system of recruitment simply by competitive examination. I could elaborate that view at very great length if time permitted, but I merely desire now to state my own view that, in the long run, it will be found that a great disservice has been rendered to the Commonwealth Bank by making it, in effect, another department of the Commonwealth Public Service. The second aspect of the clause to which 1 draw attention, is one which engaged us in some discussion last night. I refer to the question as to what is to happen when the Commonwealth Bank absorbs another bank under clause 37, or the Savings Bank absorbs another savings bank under clause 124. One honourable member declared last night that clauses 37 and 124 merely provided for the taking over of some institution that has become unstable. That is not so. Not one word in this bill refers to the instability of a banking institution. It is quite true that, in the Banking Bill which we shall consider later this session, there is an elaborate set of provisions dealing with instability of a bank, and authorizing Bank, under certain conditions, to take over the business of a bank, and control it. But in this hill, we are not concerned with that problem. Clause 37 is in clear unequivocal terms. It is not conditioned by the instability of a bank, but. merely outlines the case where, in the ordinary course of events, the Commonwealth Bank may decide, in agreement with some other bank, to take over that institution and absorb its business. Clause 124 deals with the simple case where, by agreement, the Commonwealth Savings Bank decides to absorb the business of some local or State savings bank. For example, in Tasmania there are at least two relatively small savings banksthe Hobart Savings Bank and the Launceston Bank for Savings. In the case of small institutions of that kind, the day may come when the Commonwealth Savings Bank, in negotiation and agreement with them, may agree to take over and incorporate their business in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. That is the ifr. Menzies. kind of problem that is dealt with in sub-clause 3. In those circumstances, all that, this clause does is to give a power to the Commonwealth Bank over the staff of the bank which is being absorbed a power, I repeat, not a duty. Having regard to the circumstances, it is most desirable that the absorption by the bank of any smaller institution of that kind should be accompanied by the absorption of its staff. Otherwise, the first effect of the absorption would be to throw a number of bank officials out of employment. There are other aspects of that which arise in a later clause, and I need not deal with them now. In order to bring the other matter to a head, with the very brief prefatory explanation I have made, I submit my amendment. for Home Security and Minister for Works) [12.44] -We are prepared to give, subject to the prescribed entrance examination, unfettered powers to the Governor in the management of the bank and the appointment of staff. I do not propose to examine closely the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) regarding the entrance examination, but he considers that the the Commonwealth departure from the existing system will be unfortunate. However, the Government believes that no obstacle should be placed in the way of any young man or woman, who passes the prescribed entrance examination and desires to become a member of the staff of the Commonwealth Bank. In the past, almost a bar sinister has existed through the present form of control of the hank. For example, a questionnaire used to be submitted to applicants asking them who their grandmother was, and what their grandfather did in business. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. any doubt in the minds of honourable members about what I said before the suspension of the sitting, I wish to say clearly now. and a little more loudly if necessary, that the Government does not accept the amendment.

The Leader of the Opposition is anxious to provide in the bill that if the Commonwealth Bank takes over a private bank it must necessarily employ the whole of the staff of that institution, irrespective of the circumstances of the case.

If the Commonwealth Bank could carry on the affairs of absorbed institutions with its existing officers, and without the help of the former employees of the institutions so absorbed, it would indicate that it had had a serious surplus of officers. As I 3aid earlier in the discussion of this measure, there is no immediate intention to absorb other institutions.

In short, it appeared that the employees' interests hod received no consideration in this matter. The delegation gathered the impression from Mr Chifley's remarks that the likely legislation will result in a curtailment of the activities of the private trading banks and that, to the extent of such curtailment, the interests of members of the associations will be adversely affected. It must 'be apparent, therefore, that there is considerable room for doubt, and the assurance the Minister has given us on the matter is, to use an expression of which he is fond, is so much ""hocuspocus "".

The men driven out of the service of the trading banks will be tellers, ledgerkeepers and clerks, doing what may be described as a normal, almost a routine, job, and it will be very difficult for the Governor to certify that there is no officer in the service of the Commonwealth Bank capable of filling a position to which an appointment has to be made.

If that obligation cannot be fulfilled hecause the business of the trading banks has sensibly diminished, and those men become disemployed, then there ought to be a specific provision in this legislation placing on the Commonwealth Bank the obligation to take up and carry out the obligation which reposes in the trading banks. I shall not -move a specific amendment, because the matter requires detailed 'consideration; but I point out to the Minister and to the Government that there is no satisfactory obligation in -this clause whicb will cover the cases of those men. I believe that honourable members on both sides of the House desire that the position of these men shall be protected.

If the Commonwealth Bank expands, and branches of the private banks are closed down here, there and everywhere, the men to whom I have referred will have to look to the Commonwealth Bank for employment. The odds will be heavily weighted against them if they have to pass a written examination immediately upon their return. They cannot be expected to compete in a written examination with youths fresh from the university or from schools. They are well-educated men and had reached a position of some authority in their banks, but for some years they have been employed in work of another kind, work in which they have acquitted themselves very well, if they are to be required to pass a written examination, it will not be preference to ex-servicemen, but rather the reverse. meet the case of those men. to exempt them from having to sit for a written examination. in sub-clause 1 of clause 160. which I am speaking. fied by sub-clause 2. clause 1 would apply to bank managers or senior officers whom the Commonwealth Bank may want to take over, but it would not apply to the general range of bank officers who are now members of the fighting services. them. an assurance that it will.

A Minister may find that he has not the power to do so. glad that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has not moved a specific amendment to the clause. Like him, we are anxious to avoid inflicting injury or hardship upon those who have been in the employ of the private banks. Every honourable member on this side of the chamber has raised this point with the Government, and the Federal Executive of the Bank Officers Association, as well as some of the State branches, have discussed the matter with the Government. In reply to my representations, I forwarded to the Western Australian association a letter from the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), from which I quote the following:I quite appreciate your interest in the well-being of the employees of these institutions and I am myself just as interested. It is obvious, however, that it is impossible for either the Commonwealth Bank or the Government to foresee the rate of possible expansion of the Commonwealth Bank or to foretell how many new employees will be required during the period of expansion. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty what the private hanks arc likely to do in respect of their staffs, and, bearing these points in mind it is plain that the Government is not in a position to give any guarantee as to the ultimate disposal of the officers concerned. The interest of the Treasurer in the welfare of bank officers is just as keen as that of any one else, but it is impossible for him to forecast at this stage what will be the effect on the private banks of the expansion of the Commonwealth Bank.

125,Mr Burke (Perth) [2.51],"I amwill give officers the right of entry into the Commonwealth Bank, though there are some limitations, I admit. However, their position is safeguarded by other clauses in the bill, notably those dealing with the amalgamation of other banks with the Commonwealth Bank. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr court concerns itself only with the Harrison) quoted the wording of a memorandum by the Treasurer on this subject. It is, perhaps, unfortunate that members of the Opposition-n o doubt we did the same when we were in Opposition -wil l sometimes quote a Treasurer's memorandum as if it were the expressed policy of the Government. At other times, they will complain that such a memorandum is not worth anythingthat the only thing of importance is the wording of a bill. The memorandum quoted discussed certain specific casesextreme ones, it may be said-showin g how certain officers might be affected. It referred to the position of cleaners on the one hand, and of bank officers on the other. It will be admitted that there is a wide difference between their positions. I do not share the view of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this legislation will have the effect of strangling the operations of the private trading banks. I believe that they will not be able to earn such large profits as in the past, but their profits will tend to be stabilized. We all are anxious that officers employed by the private banks shall be able to enter the service of the Commonwealth Bank without any loss of standing, and without sacrificing their accumulated rights in the matter of superannuation, &c. I am sure that the rights of bank officers in this direction will be adequately which we can be sure of being in. Theresafeguarded. The honorahle member for Perth( Mr not afterwards be charged with having Burke) has made a most extraordinary admission. He said that all members who support the Government are in favour of affording protection to the employees of .private banks. The Government is also sympathetic. Honourable members on this side of the House are 100 per cent, in favour of it. Nevertheless, the bank officers are to be left out on a limb which can be sawn off at any time. My experience in this Parliament has taught me that when the supporters of the Government believe that a certain thing should be done, provision should be made in the law for doing it. When the High Court comes to interpret legislation, even official pronouncements by Ministers as to the meaning of specific provisions is not taken into account. The meaning of the words in the act. It is a scandal that Parliament should be practically unanimous on the need for protecting employees of private banks, and yet that nothing should be done about it. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Bryson) referred to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) had abstained from moving an amendment. Of what use is it for honourable members on this side of the House to move amendments? We have been moving them day after day, but none of them has been accepted. If the honourable member will himself move an amendment designed to ensure the protection of the interests of bank officers we shall support him. Otherwise, the professions of sympathy by Government supporters are no more than hypocrisy. The only way in which they can demonstrate their sincerity is to ensure that provision shall be made in this legislation. I believe that he made representations to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), who, in his memorandum, agreed that something ought to be done. Well, the time to do It is now. My experience has been that once a measure passes through Parliament it is very difficult to vary any of its specific provisions. It is often easier to have a radical alteration effected to the whole act. This is the only Parliament fore, if we believe that something ought to be done, let us do it now, so that we canevaded the issue. able members on this side of the House are just as much concerned as any one else for the welfare of employees who may be displaced because of the expanding activities of the Commonwealth Bank. It is good to have the assurance of the Minister that he will take up the matter with the Treasurer in order to ascertain whether some policy can be evolved in that regard. No doubt, in",39,Commonwealth Bank Bil L

127,Mr Morgan (Reid) [2.59],"Honor-the light of what happens, the Government will be in a better position to evolve such a policy. With others, I believe it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to consider the interests of bank officers if they should be -displaced, but I do not share the fears of some honourable members opposite that the private banks will be more or less done away with or over-ridden by the Commonwealth Bank. The opening up and development of this country will provide plenty of scope for all the financial Institutions now operating, in addition to the extended activities of the 'Commonwealth Bank. Apart from that, there will be many schemes in which any officers displaced should be able to find suitable niches. Special consideration should be given to men whose service can be utilised in the developmental schemes, such as public works and housing, in the administration of which skill in accountancy will be necessa-ry. If the Commonwealth Bank desires further staff, preference should be given to men whose service with private banks bas been terminated, particularly those with war service. I have every confidence that the Government will fully protect their accrued rights and privileges and that there is no need for the concern expressed on their behalf by honorahle gentlemen opposite. -We should have from the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) and the honourable member for Reid( Mr thetic consideration, at the meeting of the Morgan) an explanation of their changed attitudes since they sent telegrams to the Bank Officers Association in reply to telegrams from it asking them to protect their interests. The honourable member for Perth said that in the fears we express on behalf of the bank officers we are exaggerating the position as the trading banks will not be detrimentally affected by this legislation. Rather are they likely to be stabilized. The March issue of the New South Wales Banker, which any honourable member may buy for 3d., contained the following telegram sent by the honourable member to the Bank Officers Association:I have your two telegrams regarding proposed banking legislation. I regret the delay in answering your communications, but this has been due to the difficulty in obtaining clerical assistance . . . He deals with other matters and then proceedsThe result of the legislation, should, in my opinion, greatly expand the activities of the Commonwealth Bank, and would, no doubt, affect a corresponding decline in the operations of private banking institutions. If this should be so, the transition should be an easy process and your members should not be penalized if they are able to transfer to the staff of the Commonwealth Bank. I will not read the rest unless it is desired. The point is that he first promised to look after their interests. Then he told them that they need not worrythat everything in tbe garden was lovely. Having said that, he let the bill go through the caucus in its present form. Now, months afterwards, realizing that he failed to honour his promise to them when the party was considering the legislation in caucus, he hopes the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) will do something to protect their interests. He well knew that their interests would not be preserved when he sent the telegram. The honourable member for Reid trusted that the Government would give the bank officers special consideration. But look at what he said to the Bank Officers Association in a telegram published by the New South Wales Banker, in FebruaryYour telegram is to hand in which you express concern as to the effect which proposed banking legislation may have on the position of bank officers, and I wish to say that the matter was given f u l l and sympa'Parliamentary Labour party yesterday. WhilstI am not in a position to discuss details until the bill is introduced into the House, I feel confident that officers will not in any way be prejudiced by the legislation, and in the case of those who may transfer to the Commonwealth Bank they, too, will be protected. He assured them that they would not be prejudiced, but now he hopes that the Treasurer will look after their interests. The honourable gentlemen had the opportunity when this bill was before the caucus to do something to protect the interests of these unfortunate people, but neglected to do so. sponsible Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) goes from blunder to blunder.",40,Commonwealth Bank Bil L

ThenI said that the banking legislation would ensure that the banks would not be forced into a cycle of boom and slump, and that in that iway their position would be stabilized.

Yet clause 165, which deals with promotion, provides for appeals to be made by bank officers against the promotion of other bank officers. Clause 173 provides that an officer dismissed, retired, transferred or reduced for inefficiency or misconduct shall have tlie right of appeal. It is an odd distinction. Commonwealth Public Service Act does not contain the same provision. is why I raise this matter for consideration.

I raise this matter not in a spirit of! antagonism, but simply to correct an injustice. My complaint is about the almost callous treatment that has been meted out to a member of the fighting forces. I shall not mention the man's name, but his military number is TX3545. He has had more than dive years' service in the Army, and has served in Darwin and Timor. In deed, he was one of the 40 Tasmanians who escaped into the jungle when Timor fell before the advancing Japanese. After having lived under most unpleasant conditions for about twelve months, he eventually escaped. He was an inmate of the Hobart Hospital for a period, and received treatment for a cyst, abscesses and sinus trouble. When his health had sufficiently recovered he was transferred to the 7th Division and sent to New Guinea. After some months he contracted malaria, and also underwent an operation. He period, and, after eleven months, was brought to the mainland in a hospital ship. He has had bouts of malaria on nine or ten occasions, and has been a patient in the Heidelberg Hospital. Because of his illness, caused through war service, he was reclassified medically B2 and was recommended to be .sent to a cool climate. The Army selected the "" cool climate of Queensland"", and he was attached to a war graves maintenance unit. Application was made for his of his ill health, and the health of his parents.

151,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [3.27],"I shipping was even made available so thatmorning. I mention those facts to indicate that the attitude of the Government towards the newspapers has been reasonable. In the rationing of printing paper for Australian novels, we have not been quite so fortunate. Paper required for this purpose is manufactured in flat sheetsand not in rolls as is newsprint, and there has been a lack of storage for it. We are being held up in the printing ofi books for the lack of a mere 50 or 60 men. Many novels have been written by Australians on timely subjects, but their sale will depend largely upon their availability before interest in the subject fades. Some of the stories relate to areas of active service in which Australians have been engaged, and they should be published before the immediate interest in the subjects is lost. The Australian Commonwealth Literary Fund has given approval for the printing of about 40 books, but a bottleneck has been created because so few tradesmen are available for printing and bookbinding. A representative of Angus and Robertson Limited-, one of the biggest publishing firms in Australia, has informed me that the firm would not be able to place on the market before next May even the best Australian novel ever submitted to them, because the existence of this bottleneck would make the printing of it impracticable. Releases are being made overseas, however, and 'it -may easily occur that our Australian writers will once again lose the cream of the Australian market, and fall back to the position they were in before the war. I ask that something be done to assure our writers of reasonable access to their own market. If 50 or 60 men, including 40 printers and the remainder bookbinders, could be released from the Army, the needs of the case would be met, and the Australian people could have made available to them works by their own fellow citizens. It is urgently necessary that bookbinders be released. Because of the lack of these craftsmen, there is being placed on the market a series of what we know as "" quickies "", which are paper-covered books that are stitched by girls. They sell at a cheap rate, and have not a high literary value. Men are prepared to write and edit them for the time being, but it is desirable that facilities should be provided for Australian writers of high quality, of whom there are many, to place their productions on the market. It is regrettable that because ofi the lack of quite a small volume of man-power this cannot be done. I ask that strong representations he made to the Minister for the Army to release a sufficient number of printers and bookbinders to make available to the Australian people Australian works which will assist in the development of the cultural-side of Australian life. The next matter to which I shall refer relates to the need for the release of more adequate supplies of supercalendered or glossy magazine paper. This matter comes under the authority of the Minister for Trade and Customs. The magazine publishers of Australia have carried on as best they could during the war. Their magazines have achieved a fairly wide circulation within the limits of rationing, but considerable quantities of overseas magazines are entering Australia as pulp, which, in effect, means they are being dumped here. These highly coloured journals are placed on the market at a small price, and they are selling to the detriment of the Australian publications. I know that anti-dumping regulations are said to be in force, but, nevertheless, these magazines are circulating widely. For this reason it is highly desirable that additional quantities of supercalendered flat magazine paper should be made available to printers in the interests of the Australian magazines which, during the war, have performed a most useful public service by the publication of morale-building articles, pictures, and the like. I ask that these representations be considered promptly, and if a favorable decision be given I shall have no need to continue to press the claims of Australian writers and publishers. [3.35] I direct attention once again to the urgent need to make tyres and tubes available, under less restrictive conditions, to essential users in country districts, including primary producers. It is well known that large stocks of tyres and tubes are held in",44,Government Wate R From Rheumatoid Arthritis
152,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"Australia. With the cessation, of hostilities in Europe and the improvement of the war position in the Pacific, I consider that there should be some relaxation of the regulations. Our tyre position is not nearly so serious to-day as it was when the restrictions were first imposed. The distribution of tyres and tubes is controlled in Queensland by the Directorate of Emergency Road Transport. I do not desire to reflect upon the administration of the officers of that department, for, of course, their activities are controlled by government policy. .But, to illustrate the extremely unsatisfactory manner in which the regulations are being enforced, I 'bring to attention the plight of two school teachers in the Gympie district. These men applied for tyres and tubes because they lived a considerable distance from Gympie, and have no means, of transport apart from their own motor vehicles. Each received a reply in identical terms from the Directorate of Emergency Road Transport to the effect that whilst the department appreciated the difficulties of the situation, tyres and tubes could not be made available. The letters read, in part. .. . the release, in. view of the serious stock it is necessary for him to keep a change (position and tlie difficulty being experienced in 'maintaining satisfactory tyre equipment on vehicles operated by highly essential users, cannot be authorized. It is regrettable that such a strictenforcement of the regulations should still be insisted on. I say the stock position is not serious. The prospect of rubber supplies eases with every island conquest north of Australia. ' One of these school-teachers lives 15 miles from the nearest railway or store. He has to go to Gympie for. provisions and. for all dental and medical requirements. His wife is undergoing medical treatment, but no omnibus service or public conveyance of any kind is available for her iise. This school-teacher's tyres are almost worn out. They have been, retreaded. The teacher has experienced several dangerous blow-outs. He has not had any new tyres for over four years. Three of the tyres he is at present using were on the vehicle when he bought it eight years ago. This man has a son in the Army and a. Ifr. Bernard Corser. daughter in the Women's Auxiliary Australian A i r Force, and when his children go home on leave they have to be met at the railway station and driven 15' miles to their home. If the man is not given a permit to obtain tyres and tubes he will be absolutely marooned. The fact that he is still using tyres whicb were on his vehicle eight years ago shows that he has not been extravagant, and, of course, he cannot have used his vehicle except for strictly essential purposes. I find it hard to believe that so strict an enforcement of the regulations is necessary as to justify the rejection, of his application. The other case is that of a schoolteacher who lives 18 miles from Gympie. Hisrequest for a permit to obtain tyres and tubes was supported by a petition from the parents and children of the school. He is the headmaster of the school and lives 5 miles from it. No housing accommodation is available any nearer than that. He is often compelled, to walk in all weathers both to and from school, and he must obtain his food supplies from Gympie. He has to cross rough gullies and water channels, when he takes short-cuts to get to school, and of clothing at the school. His wife is a sewing teacher and has to give lesson*, at the school once a week.. For this, purpose, she must be conveyed there and back. Unless her husband is given a permit, to obtain new tyres and tubes, he will have to jack up his car, his wifewill have to give up her teaching workat the school, for she is not able to. walk over the bushtracks that her husband uses. This will mean that the children at the school will be denied teaching in essential domesticsubjects. There is no telephone at the school and there are no near neighbours. In the event of accident or sudden sickness, the teachers and pupils of the school would be in a serious difficulty. These two applications were endorsed favourably by the Department of Public Instruction of Queensland, and the second one was also recommended by the District War Agricultural Committee as the case was regarded as urgent. I appeal to the Government to give this matter immediate attention. It ie surely not too niucli to ask that schoolrationing scale for clothing and household teachers, primary producers and other linen? essential users of tyres and tubes be granted the necessary permits to obtain have frequently referred to the inadesupplies. ask the Government to give consideration have discovered that the amount 'appropto a further liberalizing of the coupon riated annually for this purpose does not scale for women's clothing. The present permit the commission to become really scale is, in any opinion, too harsh and active. The appropriation last year was somewhat unbalanced. For example, £200,000. In 1943-44, the appropriation nine coupons are required for a pullover was £2S,000, of which £25,000 was exor cardigan, hut eleven coupons would pended ; and in 1942-43 the figures were be required to purchase the wool respectively, £25,000 and £22,000.

If the position has been changed since then, f am glad to hear it. I fear that the Minister is wrong, and that he does not know the act under which be works. Only 31 war service homes have been built in five years. The commission holds 3,829 building allotments, and has as much money as it needs. When it does not go ahead with the building of homes, it is guilty of shameful inactivity. The number of homes constructed for civilians is extremely small. The latest figures, which I obtained last week from the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), reveal that 13,094 of the 29,600 applications received have been approved. 'Civil construction is tripped at every turn by restrictions. I sent to the Minister applications dating as far back as February and received only a bare acknowledgment. When I asked that action should be taken, the Minister said that he was not aware of any delay. The people have every reason to be indignant. The Government will have to face a lot of trouble in the near future speech made in committee. by reason of its neglect of domestic priorities. If the Minister in charge of War Service Homes is indifferent, there are others who are not. Some weeks ago I mentioned in this House that widows of Royal Australian. return to Australia. Some of them have been waiting for two years or longer, yet are unable to secure a passage. TheMinister assured me that a shipload of widows was being brought to Australia and suggested that I should advise thorn aking of a fresh application by theperson on whose behalf I had made was a shipload of soldiers' widows, but said that some widows were coming toAustralia. Why not keep somewhere near the truth? say "" yes"" or "" no"" without beingabusive. I wrote post-haste to the personsconcerned. I had known the deceased airman, who had an excellent record in Great Britain as an instructor and in operations in which he was eventually killed. I advised his parents of what the Minister had said; in fact, I sent to them the Hansard report of the statement. A fresh application was made, but the parents were merely referred to an unfavorable reply which the Minister sent to me some months before. SenatorArmstrong also has interested himself in this English widow, who has made repeated applications at Australia House for a passage to this country and has received the assurance that something will be done. It is the same old story. One is put off with any sort of a statement in this House, and nothing happens. The position is anomalous in that a man who marries overseas can be followed to Australia by his wife, even if he has been married for only a week, whereas a widow who was married for two years cannot obtain a passage.

164,Mr White,"Then it would seemmember for Lang( Mr Mulcaby) cannot be corrected. ber may discusswar service homes, but may not refer to a previous debate. Mr ""WHITE -The honourable member for Lang said yesterday that during the Lyons regime approximately 100 men had been evicted from war service homes. I consulted Hansard to check the accuracy of that statement, and found that, on the 25th September, 1935, the honourable member had asked a long question in which he sought information concerning the number of men evicted from war service homes during the years 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935. He was informed that there had been 68 applications to courts in New South Wales for ejectment orders against purchasers of war service homes in 1932, 127 applications in 1933, and 121 applications in 1934. But the evictions were, in 1932, nil ; in 1933, one; and in 1934-35, four. to the government of the day. bably never read the report of the committee appointed by the Lyons Government to inquire into war service homes administration during the depression. It was found that many returned soldiers could not pay their rent, and prosecutions were launched by the department. The Government intervened, however, and directed that no returned soldier should be evicted unless another home was found for him. Some men who had taken on too great liabilities were found smaller homes. The Minister should, read this report. It would help him in the administration of the department over which he presides. There is great disappointment among servicemen and their relatives that an order has not been issued by the Acting Prime Minister, in accordance with bis undertaking of the 1st June, that men who have had five years' service should be given the opportunity to obtain their release from the Army. I have asked that extra pay should be given to those who elect to stay on. It is a cruel thing that, men from war service homes. The after the Acting Prime Minister made his statement, immediate steps were not taken to give effect to it. I received letters only yesterday refusing the release of men with five years' service. They were not trying to get out on that account, but because they wanted to return to rural industries, or because they wished to be discharged on compassionate grounds. There is consternation among servicemen and their relatives because nothing has been done, although more than a fortnight has elapsed since the Acting Prime Minister made hisstatement. In the circumstances, the relatives of servicemen might be justified in feeling that they have been misled. I was going to say hoaxed, but. I know that there is nothing deliberate about it. It is merely that there has been undue delay. Service chiefs should be given their directions on the subject immediately, so that arrangements can be made for replacing those men who are to be released. months past, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has been strenuously endeavouring to make political capital out of the subject of war service homes. He has been riding on the backs of the returned soldiers. He has lost no opportunity at question time, and during debates, to introduce the subject of war service homes, and always he has posed as the champion of returned men. certainly is not. honest. The ""honourable member for Balaclava mentioned evictions from war service homes. ing to evict the wife of a prisoner of war from her home in Canberra to-day. ber is a member of the committee which has been given the duty of considering whether she should be evicted or not.

About three weeks ago I made representations to the Minister in relation to two matters which arose out of statements made by the State member for the district, Mr John Fletcher. The first complaint, which was well reported in the Adelaide press this week, relates to the flax industry and the Government's intentions in regard to it . It is reported that land which had been set aside for the growing of flax is being planted with pines, and the local people fear that that indicates that the local mill to process flax is likely to be transferred to another crops to provide food for man and beast. State. That fear should be removed. Much of last year's flax has not yet been treated because of unsuitable weather conditions. This is an important matter to the people of the Mount Gamhier district, as the Government has encouraged the production of flax there. I understood that it was the intention of the Comanonwealth Government to retain two flax mills in South Australia after the war, and that one of them would be that in the Mount Gambier district. The Government should state clearly its intentions regarding that mill. I should like the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to make a statement regarding the Government's intentions in fears and suspicions of the people of the Mount Gambier district may be set at rest, A difficult situation has arisen because of the present high prices for rabbit skins. It is claimed hy people in the Mount Gambier district that the carcasses of large numbers of rabbits are being destroyed because trappers will not trouble to handle them on account of the big incomes they are making from the sale of the skins. Valuable meat is being thrown away. This complaint may interest the Commonwealth Leather Board and I ask that it be given consideration. The third matter to which I wish to refer came through the Primary Producers Union at Tarpeena, which states that superphosphate is being made available in a portion of my electorate for the cultivation of pine trees, although dairymen, market gardeners, graziers and others claim that they cannot get sufficient manures to meet their requirements. As honourable members know, the wheat industry is suffering from inade-, quate supplies of superphosphate. If it be true that superphosphate is being allotted for the cultivation of pine trees, an explanation of the Government's policy should be given. I believe that after the war Australia must embark on a well-considered scheme of re-afforestation, but I doubt whether, at the present time, superphosphate. should be devoted to pine cultivation to tbe detriment of Last Sunday the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) made a statement regarding the milk and",50,Government Wate R From Rheumatoid Arthritis

There is nothing on which to pay it. The other subsidy is given per pound of butter and per gallon of milk. Unfortunately, many dairymen will not be helped by that, because their cattle are dry. So much per pound of butter or per gallon of milk is no good to a man who is producing none. That position is fairly general all over Australia. The difficulties have been accentuated in the last few days by disastrous floods in northern New southern Queensland, where half of Australia's butter is produced. I have received from a constituent of the honorwho is absent in San Erancisco, a letter which shows that the position in Victoria is equally bad, in that the dairy cattle there are also dry. The writer saysAny extra price given for butter will not priate Ministers, but I shall answer the benefit me, as X had to dry my herd off iu February to save them from dying. They will not be in again till August. So the production suhsidy helps him not at all. In northern New South Wales and southern Queensland the green crops are under water and will rot. Therefore, I suggest, not as a permanent measure, but for the next two or three months, that the Government, which has heen fortunate in getting a certain quantity of fodder from New Zealand, should make a substantial part of it available free to those whose stock are practically starving. One dairy farmer at Hastings told me that, whereas he had always made a profit in his 30 years in the industry, this year, because of the weather, he was already £400 behind in his accounts. To load him with extra debt for fodder would be to prejudice his position and perhaps discourage him from continuing in the industry. involved would not be great. It would be offset by the saving that the Government is making in not being called upon to pay the subsidy on the fodder, for the Sir Earle Page. simple reason that few are able to buy it. That would ensure that the cattle would be kept alive during the winter and ready for milking in the spring. Otherwise they will not be. Nothing in the world can prevent us from being extraordinarily short of milk in the next six or seven months, but if we lose the dairy cows, we shall be short, not.merely for six or seven months, but for a couple of years, because it will be necessary to breed back again. I make this as a constructive suggestion in the interest, not only of the dairy industry, but primarily of Australia.

If so, is .this to be taken as an indication of the policy fallowed by the Munitions Department in relation to war contracts generally ? a. Has he seen Mr Rodgers's further statement that .preliminary investigations convinced him that the contract to make the revolver parte was wasting public money, that he told .this to the Ministry of Munitions, with the result tliat the contract was taken away from Howard Auto Cultivators Limited?

I have seen the statement referred to, but I do not know what is meant by the check mentioned.

I am advised by those competent to express opinions in such matters that the expenditure indicated is not a.t variance with expenditures normally incurred in tooling up for arms production. It is to be noted that production on this project was exclusively undertaken by private enterprise. 4. The Munitions Department acted in respect of war contracts with the advice of very competent men, many the highest executive and .technical experts from private industry, who were appointed by the Menzies Government.

The men appealed against the decision, but the Stevedoring Industry Commission upheld the action of the Port Chairman in disciplining 34 of the men and gave the remaining ten the benefit of the doubt. When the result of the appeal became known, all the registered men at Newcastle ceased work. The Stevedoring Industry Commission and the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation instructed the men to resume work.

199,Mr Chifley,"The answers to the Minister, upon notice1. Are the conditions of entry to the Commonwealth Public Service to be altered as from the 1st July, 1945, to include the requirement that applicants must have reached the leaving certificate standard? 2. If so, will this requirement deprive many members of the Services of opportunities, which, but for their service with the forces during the period of the war, they would have been able to exercise? 3. What provision has been made or will be made to safeguard the position of service men and women? honourable member's questions are as f o l lows :l . No. 2 and 3. See answer to No. 1. for Hume( Mr Fuller) yesterday asked me a question concerning statements made by the ""Voice of Freedom"" over Station 2SM, Sydney. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:The information given regarding the potato industry by the "" Voice of Freedom"", over 2SM is completely at variance with factsThe acreage planted to potatoes in tlie Guyra district in 1941-42 prior to control was 3,238. For 1944-45, it rose to 8,000 and not from 2,000 to 12,000 acres as stated by the ""Voice of Freedom"". In order to ensure tliat deliveries would be in proportion to market requirements, New England growers were allotted a quota of 1,000 tons a week. Contrary to the allegations of bureaucratic control made by the "" Voice of Freedom"", a meeting was called at Guyra of representatives of growers' organizations and others interested, and they worked out the details of the scheme which was to operate. Actually, growers did not deliver half of the district's quota during the three weeks' period of its operation from the 19th March, to the 7th April. As from the 9th April, the quota to individual growers was doubled and still the 1,000 tons per week was not forthcoming. A week later quotas were lifted and have not operated since. Again, contrary to the statements made during the "" Voice of Freedom"" session, if any individual grower was given a smaller quota than he desired to deliver, that was the result of a local arrangement as the potato committee did not receive the quantity it asked for. The fact is that the potato moth has been a major problem almost every year for the past fifteen years, and during March and April, the threat was so serious that growers were afraid to dig because the moth would have attacked the tubers as they were brought out of the ground. Actual deliveries from the Kew England district in each week from the 20th January, to the 20th May, were as follows:18 tons, 87 tons, 110 tons, 249 tons, 352 tons, 522 tons, 352 tons, 402 .tons, 437 tons, 589 tons, 736 tons, 205 tons, 044 tons, 824 tons, 079 tons, 913 tons, 752 tons, 1,022 tons, and 937 tons. It was not until rain late in A p r i l and -May checked the moth, that deliveries started to improve. ister for 'Commerce, and Agriculture, upon noticeT h e answers to the 1.

South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania report no evidence that repeated applications have been called by a number of municipal councils and that qualified men are not available to fill the positions. Victoria reports that in isolated (not frequent) cases, qualified men have not been available when applications have been called for by councils, due mainly to the fact that the positions to be filled are of a temporary nature only-n o permanent positions are being offered by Bhires and municipal authorities. Queensland reports there are three positions in which non-certificated men are acting, and tliat there are two or three other vacancies which cannot be filled. Western Australia reports that a limited number of municipal councils have advertised for qualified men but it has not been possible to fill the vacancies because the applicants are in other employment of high priority or in one of the Services and not eligible for discharge. 3. Recommendations for the release of qualified health inspectors from the Services have been made by the deputy-directors in Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. Some of these have been approved and others not approved, because of service requirements. South Australia and Tasmania have no record of any application for the release of a qualified health inspector from the Services.

TYR ES AND TUBES . honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) asked a question and have been mode by the Acting Premier of subsequently submitted a letter from Mr A. W . Murray, of Bordertown, South Australia, regarding two applications for cycle tyres and tubes which had been returned to the applicants hecause the forms had been typewritten and not handwritten in. ink. I have had the position, examined and find that when the 'Control of Cycle Tyres and Cycle Tubes Order was promulgated a method had to be devised whereby the application forms could be handled by distributors of cycle tyres and tubes, and not departmentally, because of the volume of applications to be dealt w it h expeditiously. It was appreciated that there were weaknesses in the scheme devised, and that the application for m lent itself to manipulation, particularly as to the number of tyres and tubes required. The number of typewritten applications which has been received is negligible, and typewritten forms have been accepted as a general rule. However, in South Australia, the official representative of the Department of Supply and Shipping had strong suspicions that the system was being abused, and, therefore, issued instructions that it would be necessary for the person requiring the cycle tyres or tubes to complete the application in his own handwriting in ink. These instructions have now been with drawn, and typewritten forms w ill bo accepted in future. 1.
