I trust that the Government will appoint a Committee to make a thorough investigation with a view to preventing these people from carrying on as they do to-day, absolutely squeezing out of existence all Australian attempts to embark in the picture industry, and leaving Australian picture theatregoers absolutely at the mercy of American film producers. bine in existence to-day is known as the Australasian Film Company. Its operations are camouflaged by the use of a name which would convey to most people the impression that it is an Australian company operating an Australian industry. As a matter of fact, .it is an American Combine, which does not prodiice one picture in Australia, but imports the larger percentage of its films from the United States of America. It has under its control almost the whole of the city picture theatres, including those of the Union Theatres Limited, Spencer's, ^Vest's, and J. D. Williams', while,quite recently, an arrangement has been made whereby the new firm of J. C. Williamscai and Taits are working, in conjunction with this American Combine. If a showman attempts to .present in Australia a terms, and give it a big percentage of thc proceeds derived from the presentation of (Formal). its pictures, it will refuse to supply him FILM INDUSTRY INVALID with a programme, so that he will have OLD-AGE PENSIONS INCOME only the one picture to show. In this lapses, and his financial ruin is brought ""about. This has been going on for some while, and it is about time the matter was able inember suggest as a means of protecting our local picture film producers? we should have a very much increased import duty on films, so that the Australian' producer may have a chance to compete with this American Combine. member think that the Combine would immediately put up prices? duty is ridiculously low, and the Combine has complete control. Last year 17,000,000 feet of films were imported by the American Combine. The members of this Combine have control of the whole of the pictures that are being shown, and unless a picture theatre proprietor will agree to their terms they will not give him a programme, with the result that he is obliged to close his doors. By way of i l Thc Comlustration, let me cite the case of a film known as The Silence of Dean Maitland, a very fine Australian production, which did much credit to the picture film industry of Australia. The moment an attempt was made to show that picture at the Lyceum Theatre, Sydney, a representative of the Combine informed the man who was conducting the theatre that if he did not take it off they would deprive him of, the whole of their pictures, thus leaving him with only .the one picture to show. The proprietor of the Lyceum refused to do this. The result was that the whole of his regular programme was withheld by the American Combine, and he had to close down. This Australian production has thus been forced out of Australia by the action of an American Combine. Today it is practically impossible to induce",26,Papers

ThisI consider ho be a serious grievance under which an Australian industry is labouring, and I am, therefore, ventilating it to-day. Having briefly stated the facts, I shall ask the Government to take effective steps to loosen the grip that this Combine has on an Australian industry. . suggests that a high duty would bring about that result? would, urge the Government to appoint a Select Committee with the powers of a Royal Commission to force, if necessary, the giving of 'evidence and to investigate the operations of the whole Combine. In this way the Government would obtain first-hand information. wbich the honourable member complains amount to a restraint of trade? trade, but the unfortunate picture showmen are in the grip of the Combine to such an extent that if they dared to complain publicly at this stage they would be p ut out of business just as was the man who was showing The Silence of Dean Maitland. Picture-show proprietors are threatened that unless they agree to the terms and conditions imposed by the Combine, they w ill be put out of business. I am credibly informed that the Combine demands 35 per oent. of the proceeds of a picture before they will allow it to be shown. These people from America, who do nothing whatsoever towards the production of Australian pictures, practically charge Australians a licensing fee of 35 per cent, of the takings from the presentation of a picture filmed these facts been in Australia. It is about time that sort of thing was stopped, and the Government ought not to regard the position I do not know. I lightly. I am speaking on statements made to me by people engaged in the industry, and I should not so speak unless I was satisfied of their sincerity and reliability. Mr Spencer was the pioneer of picture production in this country, and W h y not wait t ill the in ten years he and those associated with him made £400,000 out of local productions. There was no Combinei n those days. money made ont of local pictures? erected a studio at Rushcutters Bay, Sydney, where he produced for the screen the well-known play, The Fatal Wedding, at a cost of £ 4 0 0 , and from its exhibition gained £18,000. I quote these figures in order to give some idea of the enormous profits which this American Combine must be making, and to suggest the dangerous power and influence they can wield over' those engaged in the local industry. When Mr Andrew Fisher was Prime Minister there was a duty of 2d. per foot on imported films; but I understand that In the first place, I subsequently, Mr Jensen, when Minister for Trade and Customs, under the discretion given to hi m by the Trade and CustomsA c t , reduced that duty to l ^ d . By that Act the Ministerf or Trade and Customs is'-given power, if he thinks a local industry cannot reasonably supply the wants of the community, to lower the duty, within certain limits, or, on the other hand, if an industry is able to meet local requirements, to increase the duty. ference to Parliament? legal and legitimate under the Act , and I make no complaint on that score.

67,Mr Mahony,"Yes ; that is quitethe moment that Mr Jensen reduced the duty the Combine began to grow and increase in strength-bega n to get its grip on the local industry. There are many illustrations that could be given of the effects the Combine has had-ho w it has closed up picture shows and threatened to withhold its own productions if any exhibitor produced a local work. I have to desire, however, to labour the question. We all know that the picture industry is one that has come to stay. It will be one of the greatest educational factors in civilizations and, provided' we have a decent type of pictures of educational value, it must do incalculable good. But the Australian community must not be left at the mercy of an American Combine, whose sole idea is, not the education of the people, but the control of the industry, with a view to. still greater profits for itself. Such a position is not in the interests of Australia generally 7 it is certainly not in the interests of the young folk of this country that, when they visit a picture theatre, they should be continually shown American slang, which almost makes one sick to look at. Good old English, as «we know it , is quite sufficient for us, and it ought to be good enough for use at picture exhibitions; in any case, our young people ought to be taught pure languageThe claws of the American Combine must be clipped in so far as they affect this country. I hope that some of the Minister^ present will take a personal interest in this question, and direct the attention of the Cabinet. to it , with a view to steps for the protection of the local industry, have pictures of Australian character, to build up Australian sentiment and an Australian ideal. Let the pictures tell us something about our own country, about the problems that confront and trouble this community. America is big enough to look, after her own interests, and we ought to look after ours. I trust the Government will do something to rid Australia of the incubus of the American Picture Combine. desire briefly to support the position taken, up by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony). For some years ' I have felt that there is need for improvement, not only in regard to the picture show industry as it affects the Tariff and the revenue, but also in regard to the pictures themselves, as they affect all classes of minds in Australia. During the short time. I have been a member of this HouseI have noticed that when honourable members rise with a desire to ventilate .a grievance, and to emphasize the need of protection or preference for an industry in Australia as against some institution or persons in another part of the world, they immediately suggest, "" Up with the T a r if f "" as a cure. I do not think for one moment that.if the Tariff on films were increased 100 per cent., those who are now putting foreign pictures on the Australian market would be affected one iota; because immediately the Tariff goes up the price to the frequenters of the theatres will also go up. We had an example of this when the entertainments tax was imposed. My own opinion is that taxation of that kind is a matter for domestic legislation by the State Governments and Parliaments.

When an honourable member ventilates a subject of the kind now before us, he ought to be prepared with some suggestion of a way out of t\e difficulty. We should endeavour to imbue our people with Australian sentiment, and the most effective way of bringing about an improvement in the pictures, and of increasing their effect for good, would be, not to impose a very high duty on imported We ought to films, but to cause the production of pictures in Australia. Then, if American, producers wished to keep this market, they would have to come here, and make their pictures, and we could control them, or if the Government had not the constitutional power to do so, we could appeal toi Australia for an amendment of the Constitution which would give us that power. Of course, if the duty on films is not sufficient from the revenue point of view, I am willing to have it increased. But what I suggest for the improvement of our picture shows and the inculcation of Australian sentiment is that the picture theatres should be given notice that within twelve months at least one-fourth of their programme must consists of pictures produced in Australia;",28,Lieut Publicly Ventilated And Action Taken To

71,Mr Charlton,"I am glad to hearits old and infirm. The war has, of course, severely strained our finances, and ifc will be a considerable time .before we can hope to obtain release from this strain, but we should not lose sight of thc necessities of our aged poor. standing the war, statistics show that the number of persons with banking accounts has increased, and that many persons now possess much more than they used to possess. The question is, should we nofc get money from these persons to assist the poor? Those who are wealthy should not object to being called on to assist their less fortunate brothers a^d sisters, who, in all probability, have^ad much to do with the acquirement of their wealth. It is due to'the efforts of the pioneers of this country, who bore the heat and strain of the day, and are now infirm and aged, that others have become wealthy, and something should be done to assist these old persons. If the Treasurer finds that a majority of members favour an increase in the pension rates, w ill he, notwithstanding the statement of the Prime Minister, be permitted to propose taxation to recoup the increased expenditure of thc Government, and thus to balance his accounts ? He should not mind who pays, so long as he can get the money necessary to increase the pension rates. If we do not; deal with the matter this session, it cannot be dealt with for at least a year, and it is crying for attention. Having regard to the increased cosfc of everything, I wonder how the pensioners manage to get along at all. If the Treasurer would take a more favorable view of this matter, notwithstanding the present were to increase the exemption to £300 financial stringency, and allow the House we should be doing no more than a fair an opportunity of deciding, I believe the thing, bufc, instead of increasing it , we House would agree to a more generous have, in the case of single men, reduced treatment of the old-age pensioners and to it from £156 to £100. Every single man the Treasurer obtaining taxation for the who earns £ 1 0 0 per annum clear is suppurpose from some other source. I am posed to pay income tax, but there are o aware that he w ill not have the money at many men in t h e country, following prohis disposal without imposing further fessions and other callings, who cannot; taxation, but the people who have thc live on £ 2 a week, particularly if they money should not object to an additional live away from home.

The time has arrived There should be bufc one exemption,, and when some step in that direction should it should be much higher than it is now. be taken. Most of us told the people, Action to that end should be taken at during the war, thafc they were engaged once in a war , to end war, but the huge expenditure in connection wifch defence would make it appear thafc we are expecting other wars in the near future. We should be able to cut that form of exNotwithpenditure down to a minimum. We might be able to save a couple of million pounds in that way, and if we can do that, and expend the money in paying increased pensions to the old people, such expenditure, would be more beneficial to the country than defence expenditure, from which we get no return. Ifc would be a good thing for the w o r l d ' if an understanding could be arrived at which would prevent all wars in future, so that everybody might be employed in the production of things for the betterment, instead of the destruction, of mankind. If we can cut down our armaments and increase the old-age and invalid pensions we shall be helping the country far more than we are doing now by the heavy expenditure upon defence. Yesterday, I made reference fco the subject of income taxation, and I shall lose no opportunity of calling attention to the anomalies of the present Act. When the Act was passed in 1915 the exemption was fixed at £ 1 5 6 , but since that time the cost of living has increased exactly 60 per cent. I said afc the time fchat an exemption of £156 was too low, and I opposed it , but my party did nofc agree with me. However, if the cost of living has increased 60 per cent, since 1915, there ia an unanswerable argument for the increase of the exemption to afc least double what was fixed then.

But certain anomalies are so glaring, and amendments of the Act are so necessary, that there is no need to wait for the Commission's report. What is to prevent the Government from introducing at an early date a short amending B ill providing for an increased exemption, pending a further amendment of the Act in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission if they are approved by the Government. There can be no escape from our duty in regard to this matter, and the Treasurer might recoup himself for what he loses in this way by increasing the incidence of taxation on the people who have large incomes. He should get the money he requires, and that is'the only way that he can gee it . We shall be merely doing justice to those who to-day are working forvery low wages if we increase the exemption as I have suggested. The House should have an early opportunity of deciding whether or not it is in favour of such an amendment. As public men we are not justified, after three or four months of recess, in merely dealing with the Tariff for two or three months, and then adjourning for a period while certain matters of urgent public importance are awaiting consideration. The assessments for the current financial year are now being collected, and the collection should be completed by the end of June. If the Act is not amended immediately, the collection for the next financial year will be on the same basis as at present. The returns must show the individual's income for the year ended the 30th June, and unless we act promptly every taxpayer who is in receipt of an income of over £156 will be required to f u r nish a return for the taxation year ending 30th June next. amended the A ct before the end of the session, could not the amendment be made retrospective in order to apply to the current taxation year ? makes his return in July, and the Department issues the assessment early in the New Year. If the Act is not amended before the beginning of the new financial It w ill cost £3,400 to year, returns on the present basis will be required, and the Government will not be I understand that likely to agree to a retrospective amendment which will upset the departmental arrangements. We must either amend the Act now or leave the law to operate in its present form for the next financial year. This matter is worthy of early consideration by the House. I asked a question of the Prime Minister to-day in regard to the delay in hearing applications for a reduction of hours owing to the inability to get three Judgesi n the Arbitration Court. The Prime Minister answered my question evasively. He said, in effect, that Mr JusticeH i g gins would not expedite the work of cases which h3d been listed in fche Arbitration Court before the amendment of the law last year, that those cases had been before the Court for a considerable time, and that, although the Judge had power to deal wifch them, he had not done so. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether there are not cases which do not come within fchat category, b u t which have been referred to Mr Justice Powers, and whether it is not a fact that in consequence of the inability to' get three Judges to sit together in the Arbitration Court, applications for a reduction of hours cannot be dealt with. I understand that a statement to that effect was made by Mr Justice Powers. If that is the state of affairs, it is clear that a necessity exists for either the appointment of three Judges, or for an amendment of the Act, so that hours of labour may be fixed by one Judge. In my opinion, it is farcical to require that hours of labour shall be fixed by three Judges, when' one Judge may deal with any other question. In New South Wales Mr Justice Beeby deals with applications for a reduction of hours, but under the Commonwealth Act we placD obstacles in the way of the settlement of disputes by saying that' this question of hours of labour must be dealt with by three Judges, and then the Government omit to appoint them. Either the laws should be carried out by the Government, or they should not continue on the statute-book.

77,Mr Charlton,"The taxpayerJudges, and there are not three Judges."" Either the Government should give effect to the legislation passed by Parliament or Parliament should amend the law in order to permit of these applications being dealt with by either two Judges or one. We often hear bitter complaints when the workers seek redress by adopting other than constitutional methods. How can they adopt constitutional methods when we deny them the opportunity? Nobody desires industrial trouble. Throughout my life I have advised the men to adhere to constitutional means of getting justice, but how can they do that if the law provides for a certain thing which is not given effect' to by those who administer the law? When we were discussing th§ Basic Wage Commission's report the Prime Minister said that the Government would take temporary action pending further consideration of the matter. The Government decided to give all Commonwealth Public Servants a basic wage allowance of £12 per annum and 5s. per week for each child under the age of fourteen years, but instead of adding that £12 to the wage which the employee was then receiving they started from a basis of £196,"" making the total wage £208, notwithstanding the fact that most public servants were receiving £164. Thus the difference between £164 and £196 was lost to the employees. They complained bitterly, and rightly so, because they have not received justice. Many public servants are not getting the wage to which they are entitled, having regard to the increased cost of living. The Government employees were loyal to the country during the war period, and did their work well. Postmasters in particular did exceptionally heavy work throughout the war, and are continuing to do it, because, in addition to the ordinary departmental work, they pay the war pensions and gratuities. increase in salary to compensate for the increased cost of living. The PrimeM in ister is responsible for the position in which he finds himself with regard to the basio wage. In the course of his policy speech at Bendigo, he saidIf we are to have industrial peace, we must he prepared to pay the price, and that price is justice to the worker. Nothing less will serve. Mr Charlton. Thc Government is, therefore, appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to tbe minimum or basic wage. The Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated during the war; also, how the basic wage may be adjusted to the present purchasing power of the sovereign, and the best means, when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and fall of the sovereign. The Government will, at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect to these principles. Later the Prime Minister created the Basic Wage Commission, which reported that a weekly wage of £5 16s. was required to keep a man with a wife and three children. That recommendation rather astounded the Prime Minister, and, notwithstanding his pre-election pledge, and the fact that he appointed a Royal Commission to advise the Government, he set ' about devising some means of evading the Commission's recommendation. Therefore, if confusion or dissatisfaction has resulted, the Prime Minister has nobody but himself to blame. Since the Commission's report was submitted nothing has been done by the Goveniment to give effect to it. We are told that the Federal Parliament has not the constitutional power to take any steps except in regard to the Commonwealth Government servants. But we have power to deal wifch our own servants; and why have the Government run away from the Commission's findings? They have never paid the wage which, the Commission recommended, but have undertaken to pay £4 per week and 5s. for each child. And, in order to make that appear all right, the Prime Minister stated here some time ago that he had taken the total wealth production of the country into consideration, and had found that, if the basic wage were applied, Australia would not be able to bear the burden of its application; there would ""not be sufficient margin to carry on. It would be Yet they have received no interesting to ascertain exactly what figures were used as the basis of the Prime Minister's argument. I understand thafc his remarks were based on statistics furnished by Mr Knibbs for 1918. The figures having to do with that year were very much below those of 1920, because there were increases, meanwhile, in the cost of almost everything. In the period between 1918 and 1920, although it ia difficult to state the exact amount decision that they should report in favour of the*, general increase, it would probably of the basic wage being £5 16s. It is total between 30 and 40 per-cent. In of no use to say that the production of the circumstance^ it would have been this country will not stand the payment only fair for the Prime Minister to of that wage. If the Goverument take take that very considerable factor into that attitude, as tbey do, tbey have a consideration so that his comparisons right to order a further investigation. might bear due.weight. Another point is that Mr Knibbs, in compiling his statistics, haa taken into account only member has been talking for about threethe wholesale price. How can any one quarters of an hour, and he bas already thus determine the country's full amount cut up about £6,500,000 sterling. of production ?

If the people outside had the right of recall who would be carrying on this Tom-fool game? I suppose that Sir Samuel Griffith was the keenest legal mind that ever came out of Queensland. I have not been able to obtain the whole of the information as to. the amount he actually received from the Government, but I am informed that in all he drew over £80,000 from the Queensland State Government, and subsequently from the Commonwealth Government. God only knows how much he received by ' way of allowance. That information has not been supplied.

Inquiry has showed me, however, that Sir Samuel Griffith died a wealthy man.

Under the present regime, however, to be a profiteer is to he one of the most respected members of the community. The income tax as now levied is an absolute fraud. 1 think it was Gladstone who said it was the duty of a Government to jnake its laws so simple that the average man could understand them. The only country that has done that is France. Thanks to the genius of a great man, France has the Code Napolion, and Napoleon placed it on record ih his memoirs that he had to do his level best to prevent the lawyers from making it a puzzling code. I asked an official of the Taxation Department to oblige me with a departmental readyreckoner, so that I might assist those of my constituents who pay Federal income tax, and who come to me for help in determining the amount of the tax they should pay. Later on, the Treasurer said' that a departmental which' would enable the average individual to ascertain what tax he should .pay would he issued, but the departmental publication is such that most people are inclined to laugh at it. The taxation officials to whom I have spoken are sick and tired of the present system."" A book comprising a great number of pages is necessary to explain the present Federal income tax, whereas a few lines is sufficient to explain to the people the method of assessing the State income tax. I have not been able to learn of any other country which has such an'absurd, even if it he a highly scientific, system .as that of the Commonwealth. Is it not ridiculous also that we should have to pay both State and Federal income tax? Surely a law to simplify State and Federal taxation, and to secure economy in its collection, should not be treated as a party measure. Isi t not absurd that we, the created thing of the people outside, are not to be permitted to deal with any business other than the Tariff during the absence of the Prime Minister in England? If the Government would agree to bring in at once a measure designed to simplify our system of taxation, and to provide for a uniform tax, I would undertake to vote for it. I am certain that the members of my party generally would assist in the passing of such a measure. Yet, because of the rules of this fool place,-called a Parliament, we must not pass any such measure, no matter how beneficial it might be, during the Prime Minister's absence. .The rate of income tax imposed on co-operative societies, which do not .pay dividends-whic h do not amass capital to ibe hidden away or converted into shares, but exist solely to supply their own members with goods at the lowest possible cost-is also absurd and unfair. Coming to the question of picture films, I think that every picture-show proprietor should be required by law to include in his programme at least one industrial picture or a film of travel calculated to have an educational value. I am a defender of the average picture show. I certainly have not seen any picture as vile as are some comic operas. I know of no educational influence greater than that of the picture show, ready-reckoner and I have always resented the Entertainments Tax Act, under which a person entering a picture theatre is required to pay a special tax. The income earned by picture-show proprietors should be taxed, but it is an infamy to require every person who goes to a picture show to pay a separate tax. Imagine the passing of a law requiring the purchaser of a pair of boots to pay a special tax of Id. in respect of every Is. that the boots cost? The entertainments tax is infamous. As to the complaint that has been made in regard to the operations' of an American Film Combine, we could encourage and protect the Australian filmmaking industry by requiring that an Australian film shall be included in every programme. We could also legislate to compel the' Combine and others to sell their films at a stated price. If ib be true that the Combine is acting in the way described this afternoon, then it is as infamous as the refusal of the millers to supply certain bakers with flour, because they would not agree to build up fche price"" of bread. I suppose, however, fchat the same old game will go on until fche people, the creators of this Parliament, axe able to take a hand. God never made anything more powerful than Himself. Parliament is the only created thing of which I ""know that can make itself more powerful than its creator. In my opinion it will be impossible to put a stop to the corruption, bribery, and fraud whioh is rampant in Melbourne and every other Australian city until the people obtain control by means of the referendum, -initiative, and recall. Is it not ridiculous to be told that we must deal only with the Tariff while the Prime Minister is away? If the Tariff were disposed of in a week we would go into recess, and have what some people describe as a holiday; but I would invite those who think I have a holiday during recess to come to my rooms, 513 Elizabeth-street, any Monday morning. they do they will be quickly disabused. I want it to sink into the minds of the people, who pay for everything-from salary of the Governor General to the wages of the policeman-who us-that they should ask those who are seeking their suffrages whether they are prepared to devote the whole of their time to the making of laws for their country, or ""whether they are merely ""halftimers"" or ""quarter-timers."" I have been trying for thirty years to secure legislative recognition of the principle of the referendum, initiative, and the recall. I have lived to see the principle adopted by the strongest fighting party in Australia, by the Australian Natives Association, and also by the Nationalist party, although they keep the fact in the background-. I want to see this Parliament dominated by that principle, which it has unanimously affirmed. party follows the example of the great Country party of the United States of America, it will also adopt the principle, and with all parties in the House in favour of it it should speedily receive legislative sanction. ber, when he goes before his constituents, says, "" I shall esteem it the greatest honour to be returned as your representative-to many men on being elected to this House or to another place turn a somersault, and vote as crookedly as they please, . We have at all times wondered why men vote in a certain way. I think I can make a claim which cannot be. made by any other parliamentary under the British nag; it is that I am the only member whose constituents are afc liberty fco remove me from my position at any moment. I glory in the fact fchat I -had the courage to give them that power, and fco leave it with them for thirty years. I would not stay here for a mo. ment if I did not feel I represented a Dr. Maloney. majority of my constituents. The referendum, initiative, and recall have cleansed away the so-called "" g r a f t "" of the TJnited States of America. Over 340 communities in America have adopted the reform, and their cities are ruled by .Commissioners subject to the recall. Every State east of a dividing line of the TJnited States of America has it in some shape or form, and, with the exception of five of fche older states on If the eastern side it is to he found in operation. the chief advantage? fraud,corruption, and bribery. With the | referendum, the initiative, and the recall it would be impossible to lose 5,000,000 bushels of wheat, most of which wa3 stolen, though nobody was arrested. Imagine a quantity of wheat sufficient to fill lorry after lorry from the Melbourne post-ofiice to the Sydney post-office, and a little further on towards Newcastle, and then imagine that to be lost, and most of it stolen without anybody being punished.

During my electoral campaign, I said that history repeats itself; that many heroes of the Peninsular War, of Waterloo, of theCrimea, and of the Indian Mutiny were allowed to die in the workhouses of Great Britain, and that the further the recent The honourable war drifted behind us, the more it would be proved thafc our Australian soldiers needed the assistance of the Labour party.

Surely, if the man's ill-health were not due to the war, he would not have been granted the pension in the first instance. As to the recommendation that he should apply for an invalid pension, there seems to be an attempt to substitute eivil pensions for war pensions. I hardly know the object of-that, unless it be that only It seems to 15;s. a week can be paid by way of invalid pension, and that the war pensions are on a more liberal scale.

127,Mr Gabb,"I am speaking of Southdrew a war pension, is in such a condition that the Principal Departmental Medical Officer recommends h i m to t r y to obtain an invalid pension, the Repatriation Department should see that justice is done to him. Let me read what Gunner Yates, ex-member of this Parliament, a returned man, now, secretary to the South Australian Branch of the Labour party, writes of this case:I have sent him to the Repatriation Departexistent ? ment here, also drafted a letter for him to Merry, all to no purpose, and they refuse him any redress. The man hobbles into my office frequently, and is a total wreck, although he was a strong railway navvy when he enlisted. They have granted him half cash for his gratuity, and on this he is living, and I hope that his pension will be restored to him from the time it ceased, for there is no gratitude to a man to give him something with one hand and then take it from him with the other. I personally ventilated this case at a meeting of thc R.S.A., and the man continually haunts the. Eepatriation Department, only to get worse treatment than Bell spoke of. Evidently ""he refers to the honourable member for Darwin. The second case is a little different, but behind it is the same principle of cutting back the soldiers' pensions, irrespective of whether or not justice is done. The man in this' case was for eight months in a tunnelling company in France, and then he became ill . I shall read the ruling that has been given in regard to hispension, because I do not believe that the exofficers, who are members of this Parliamnt, will sit back and allow such a ruling to continue. The man did not appeal when his sustenance allowance was cut down, but he did appeal when his pension was reduced from £ 3 3s. to £ 1 Is. per fortnight..; This is the reply he received from the DepartmentReceipt is acknowledged of your letter of 1st July regarding the cancellation of living allowance received from this Department, which has been paid up to and including 30th June, 1920, and I have to advise that a ruling has been received from head-quarters of this Department to the effect that the Repatriation Commission has decided that men who eniisted, when advanced in years, and were discharged for pre-existing constitutional diseases, conI have sufficient knowledge of the world cealed or latent on enlistment, would not be eligible for sustenance, nor can the Department accept any liability in connection with medical treatment. In view of this decision, your case was subject to review, and, under the circumstances, no furtber allowance can be granted you by this ^Department over and above the war pension that you are at present receiving. Ur. Gabb. I am perfectly confident that when members of this Parliament appealed for-recruits from the platforms throughout the country, they did not say that if recruits were advanced in years, and it was later discovered that they had pre-existing diseases, concealed or latent at the time of enlistment, they would be treated differently from others. officers know that the diseases were preto ask. If the Department is to be allowed to sneak out of its obligations to these men by saying that they had preexisting constitutional diseases, concealed or latent, a way w i ll be opened for the cancellation of many pensions which soldiers are at present enjoying. If this particular man was able to do tunnelling work in Francef o r eight months the germs of disease must have been very much concealed or latent. Unless honourable members are prepared to see that justice is done to returned soldiers, the hardship which, under the plea of financial stringency is at present being imposed UJIKHI the old-age and invalid pensioners, as is admitted by the Treasurer, who says that he cannot find the money to do what should be done, will be extended to the* men who did their duty overseas, and as time goes on that injustice will become greater unless we, as a Parliament, do oiir duty. I hope that honourable members who were'officers during the war, and led these men through many a fight, will see that the Government do not hide themselves behind the Repatriation Commission. It would appear as if the main object of the Commission were to prevent members from getting no c'ose quarters, as'they did when they were dealing w i th the Minister, and so & ble the Government to cloak the cutting down of the pensions. has great foresight. my first name is Moses1 A t any rate, to be aware that the great consideration in life is not to heed what the newspapers say, or the opinion of the day or the week or the month, but to look at the verdict of the century.

Prime Minister is departing for England these matters are to be allowed to stand over until next year, but I know that if men had been told before they went to the war what they are being told now they would have said, a3 many of them are saying to-day, "" When there is another war they can have it on their own."" sire to bring two cases before the House, because for the last six or nine months I have failed to get any redress from the Departments concerned. The first case is that of Wilfred J. Hodgkiuson, late able seaman in the Australian Navy. This young fellow was employed upon HMAS. Australia and, during coaling operations in Sydney harbour a hawser snapped, with the result that he was severely injured. He was taken to hospital, where he remained for a considerable time, and his left arm was amputated. The boy's mother came down from Brisbane, and later the Navy Department sought to settle all claims on behalf of the boy for the loss of his ur n by the payment of £132. When the mother related the circumstances to me I told her that the boy was injured in the service of his country, as much as if he had lost his arm in the war. The Navy Department was again approached and consented to increase the amount to £198, which the mother was informed was the maximum amount that could be granted tinder the regulations. That amount was paid to the mother. The War Pensions Act provides that a man who has lost an arm or leg shall receive a pension of ment's duty to find work for him. 15s. per week, or £39 per annum, so that the amount paid by the Navy Depart; tion. The monetary compensation will merit to this young seaman is equivalent serve him until a position is found for to only a five years' pension for a benehim. The Government might follow the matter to the Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith), who said he was very far. I suggested to him that if he found it impossible to give the boy any further financial help he had a moral responsibility to find him employment. The boy was injured in the service of the Navy, and if we are to build up an Australian Navy that will be worthy of the name, we must see that those who are injured in the service of their country are adequately cared for. I claim that a Apparently because the paltry payment of £198 is totally inadequate compensation for the loss of an arm by a boy 18 years of age who has practically the whole of his working life before him. ment found a job for him? partment tried to evade all responsibility and advised the boy to apply to the Eepatriation Department for employment. For months he has haunted the oflices of the Repatriation Department in Brisbance, but up to the present time no employment has been found for him. His people are doing for him what they can. At present he is attending college in the endeavour to fit himself for a clerical position. In the meantime the Navy Department is sitting back and doing nothing. The departmental conscience has been salved by the payment of a paltry sum of £19S, ancl now the authorities refuse to do anything further for the boy,. I mention this case to-day because I know that every lionorable member will agree that the treatment I have described is not such as should be meted out to any member of thc Australian Navy. I hope that, even at this late hour, the Minister will, if necessary, annul the regulation in order that something further may be done for a boy who, when he lost his arm, was as much in the service of his country as he would have heen had he been engaged in warlike operations when he sustained the injury.",43,Maloney Yes And You Have

Even private employers accept responsibility for injured employees, but a great institution like the Navy. Department shelters itself behind a regulation, and does practically nothing. The other case is that of D. W. Jones, a returned soldier. Upon his return from active service he was adjudged worthy of a pension, but at the end of six months he had to submit himself for re-examination. The Medical Board pronounced him physically fit, and accordingly his pension was cancelled. But he was a Eederal public servant, and when he submitted himself to the ' departmental medical oflicer he was pronounced physically unfit for re-employment. On the one hand he is denied , a pension because he was pronounced physically fit, and on the other hand he is refused Te-employment because he is said to be physically incapable of carrying out clerical duties. The records show that ever since his return ' from the war he has never been absent from duty except when he was ill for a number of days during the influenza epidemic. This man has applied to the Department over and over again, without success. He rightly claims either the pension or the right to work. He asks for no favours. If he is not entitled to the one he is fully entitled to the other. is he employed? the Postmaster-General's Brisbane. His case has been brought under the notice of the Minister concerned, and of the Public Service Commissioner. A few weeks ago,, he was notified that in twelve months' time he would have to submit to a medical examination, and that if it was then found that he was in a fit condition he would be re-appoinfced to his position. Pending that examination, he has been appointed temporarily in the Records Branch of the Postmaster-General's Department, Brisbane. The young fellow is either fit or unfit. If he is physically unfit to do his pension? There are many widows who work, he should be given the pension. If he is physically fit, he should be debarred from the pension, and a position found for him such as he is entitled to. desire to ' voice my feelings regarding various anomalies which exist in respect of old-age and invalid pensions; but I recognise that, in view of a notice of motion appearing on the business-paper of the House-to which, sir, you have already drawn .attention-it will not be competent for me now to deal with one specific phase which has my heartiest sympathy, namely, the matter of increasing the"" pension Tate. Apart from that, P desire to point to certain directions in which pensioners could be relieved. The provisions of the Act are so hedged with technicalities that many people are subject to injustice because the administrating authority haft not adequate discretionary powers. I have already brought one certain matter before this House; and, since the pensioner concerned has not received the consideration to which he is entitled, I have no hesitation in again stating his case. The circumstances have to do with a young man who is suffering from tubercular complaint. Eor the reason that he is living at home with his parents, and that the father is earning more than £1 per week, the young pensioner-althoug h he has reached the age of manhood-is not permitted to benefit by the provision for an invalid pension. If he were to remove to some other residence, the pension would be given him; but, because he remains in his father's home, where he can receive the best of treatment and sympathetic ccfusideration, both he and his parents are penalized. This .anomaly should be removed. I wish to refer to one otheT matter, which I have previously Department, spoken upon in this Chamber, and that is with respect to giving pensioners the right to earn more than they may do' without having their pensions reduced. At prev sent, the earning capacity of an old-age pensioner is limited to the same amount aq that which was decided-upon when the purchasing power of money was far greater than to-day, and when economic difficulties were not so pronounced. Would it not be possible for the Treasurer to relieve the hard lot of our aged and infirm by permitting a higher margin of earning capacity without reduction of receive pensions, and who, as thoy get . older and feebler, find that they cannot continue to maintain their own homes.",44,Maloney Yes And You Have

That inquiry was duly made, and, as a result, the Commission presented the recommendation that £5 16s. per week was a fair and reasonable wage for a man; his wife, and three children. But immediately that report was submitted, the Prime Minister, in an endeavour to side-track it, called upon the Chairman of the Commission ( Mr sale prices have increased by 37 per cent, Piddington) to prepare a memorandum showing how the basic wage might be paid, and whether industry could afford to pay it. That memorandum was, I Piddington, but there are features of it which are certainly open to contention. Mr Piddington was prepared to base his figures upon an amount at the point of wholesale price instead of at the point of retail consumption, but he included a great army of workers he had no right to include, seeing that he had taken the wholesale price as the basis of his calcuinstead of basing them on the values °t lations. factures in -1913 was £161,560,000, whereas the wages paid during the same period amounted to £33,606,000. is to say, for every £100 worth of goods £20 16s. was paid in wages. In 1918 the value of the output of manufactures had increased to £298,000,000, while the wages paid during the same period had only increased to £38,300,000. was a comparative reduction in thc amount of wages paid to the extent of £4 per £100 worth of goods manufactured. Instead of deriving an advantage the workers of Australia have during recent years suffered an actual reduction per £100 in the value of manufactures. This is a fact that should not be overlooked by the occupants of the Treasury bench. They promised to institute this inquiry and apply the finding of the Commission to the workers of the Commonwealth, and it is their bounden duty to see that that is done. which represents the value of production in 1918, represents the value at wholesale rates of the six principal items of producWage Commission.'

Mr Makin. of fact, the ability of the community to pay should be estimated at the point of consumption and not at the point of dington. also. It is most important to note that the value of production for 1918 was the lowest since 1914, that since then 200,000 men have returned from the Front and re-entered industries, and that as wholebetween 1918 and the 30th June, 1920, the value of the £298,000,000 would consequently have been £409,000,000 at ton had based his figures on this calculation, his finding as set out in the memorandum to the Prime Minister would have been materially altered. In respect to the fixing of a basic wage -and the ability of industries to pay it, it is a fair request that we should take our figures at the point of retail consumption The value of Australian manuthe point of production or wholesale prices. In any case, opportunity ought to be given to the House to discuss That the basic wage question fully before it rises, because we have a duty to perform to the people of Australia, who are suffering under the disability of not securing a wage that affords them a reasonable standard of comfort. There What a great indictment it is upon this country to admit that its industries cannot pay a wage which will give that reasonable standard! I am desirous of fostering these industries, but unless they are prepared to give a fair return to the wealth producers I shall be reluctant to afford them that measure of Tariff Protection they request. On the SOth October, 1919, the Prime Minister said that in order to secure industrial peace we must be prepared to pay the price, which, he said, was justice to the workers. Nothing less would serve, he I find that the £298,000,000, said.

There is not, in the minds of the Prime Minister and his supporters, any desire to meet the position fairly and squarely. The right honourable gentleman, as reported in Hansard, stated last yearOne thing I do reject absolutely, and without reservation. I reject, because of its impossibility, any proposal to pay £5 16s. 1 reject it because it will bring ruin to the country, and ruin to every man that it is intended to benefit. Recognising the difficulties in the shape of the high prices of necessities, with which the workers of Australia are contending, we should take steps at once to secure t'o them a wage that will insure them a reasonable standard of comfort. The industries in which they are employed, and whose wealth they produce, should pay them' a wage that w ill give them ample opportunity to enjoy those privileges which are a fitting reward of citizenship of the Commonwealth Our natural resources and the great potentialities of this country are such as would allow for a basic wage of, not merely £ 5 16s. a week, but infinitely more, provided that we had a. more equitable form of wealth distribution. I find that 82 per cent of the people of Australia secure only 15 per cent, of the wealth of the country; the remaining 18 per cent, have, in their possession, 85 per cent, of it . While that state of affairs exists I shall not cease to protest against it . It is a most, inequitable distribution of wealth, and I shall avail myself of every opportunity as a member of this Parliament to stress the fact that those who are rendering f a it h f u l service to the community are not receiving their just due. It is a reflection on the industries of the Commonwealth to say that they are unable to pay such a wage as w ill allow of a reasonable Standard of comfort being enjoyed by the workers.

174,Mr Higgs,"The question how much,the pioneer squatters, miners,.and hushmen who have followed in their tracks. Scores of men perished in the early days of this country's development. We cannot determine the money value of the developmental work done in this country. I believe that there is nothing comparable .in the TJnited Kingdom to the hardships that are being endured by families isolated in the Australian bush. In Queensland, itinerant teachers go from house to house, at one home setting the lessons for the following month before proceeding on their lonely journey to some other family many miles distant. It L a common thing in Queensland to see children, some of them seven and eight years of age, leaving by a goods train at 8 o'clock in the morning to travel 20 miles to a school, from which they return at 9 o'clock at night, having been away all day from their parents, and largely dependent for their safety during the train journey on the kindly offers of the guard of the train, who may not even know their names. These families are developing this part of the Empire so that it may be a home for the sons and daughters of Britishers, and their .efforts and sacrifices must be considered when the question is asked, ""What are we doing for the maintenance of the Empire?"" The need of the Empire before the war was a Navy strong enough to maintain the supremacy of our flag on the seas; and, while we should not reduce our naval strength beyond the point of national safety, to use the words of the Covenant of the League of Nations, we should do all we oan to bring about a reasonable disarmament of the nations, and thus reduce the expenditure on defence. The right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), I know, has not too much faith in the League of Nations, but I plead with h i m to use his great eloquence, wit, humour, .and pathos in an effort to make it a success, so that its aims and objects may be realized, and that the peace of the world may be established, if it is possible for human beings, with all their weaknesses, to remain always at peace. will do much with the League of Nationsu n t i l the Versailles Treaty is amended in some way. asked whether the war has changed the [309]2 hearts of men; and, if so, whether the change is more than skin deep. . When one reads the story of the exploration of the ruins of Empires that have passed away, and remembers the present unrest of the world, it seems not unlikely that our civilization may, like those that, have preceded it, ' pass into oblivion. I believe, however, in Progress, and' I take the view expressed by Professor Tuckeri n one of his essays, that the man of the future will be as far removed from us as we are from the savages who preceded us. I hope, therefore, that the League of Nations may become a success, and that our public men of all parties w ill strive to make it so. The honourable member for East Sydney interjected that the Covenant of the League of Nations will have to be amended, and I suggest to the Prime Minister that his efforts at the Imperial Conference should be directed to ascertaining the objection of the United States to that Covenant. I am sure that the Americans would accept some of its clauses in their entirety. Isi t the clause which declares that the League of Nations will preserve the integrity of existing States or the regional understandings that they object to? Whatever be the reason for their objection the statesmen of Great Britain and the Dominions should t r y to ascertain it , and then endeavour to remove it by an alteration of the Covenant. I am sure that that Covenant might be altered so as to make it acceptable to the American people. Were the United States of America a member of the League of Nations, it would become the success that those who most believe in it wish it to be. not join the League of Nations because they do not wish to interfere in the affairs of Europe. long desired to keep free from European entanglements; but if they were satisfied that the forty-three States that are members of the League do not wish to erect a sort of super-State which w ill rob the smaller States of. their powers of self government, they would, I think, join the League. I do not think that, you In conclusion, I wish the right honourable the Prime Minister bon voyage.

178,Mr Higgs,"The Americans havethink thafc every honourable member recognises the importance of the matter that we are discussing. Like those who have preceded me, I realize the need of conducting this debate on a high plane. Ifc is necessary that we should weigh every word, and should,, as far as possible, avoid saying anything that may injur e this ' country in its international relations. The subject fco be discussed is a delicate one, and I propose to express nothing b ut friendship for the nations to which I may have to refer. There is no need for host i l it y , and I am sure we feel no hostility to the Japanese. We have the friendliest feelings towards them. Every State and every people should have an opportunity for the legitimate fulfilment of its aspirations, and enough of the surface of the earth to live upon. While we stand for a White Australia, which is now the recognised policy of the country, we are prepared to allow room-and there is roam-for the development of every other race and nation. A t the same time, we should avoid suggesting to others how they should put their house in order. It is not within our province to tell the United States of America what should be its attitude to the League of Nations. In eonference we may p ut forward our views, b u t in a debate of this sort ifc is out of place-of . course, I express only my ownviews-to suggest thafc America should have accepted the Covenant of the League of Nations.^ Thafc was a matter to be decided by the Amerioan people themselves. Ifc has been f u l l y discussed before them, and they have come to a decision upon it . It w ill be quite unnecessary for the PrimeM i nister to go to London to find out the reasons why the American people rejected the Covenant of the League of Nations, because those reasons have been made known by discussion upon the publio platforms in the United States of America. I must confess that many of the points in the Covenant Nations, to which exception was taken during, the discussion in fche United States of America,, do not commend themselves to my judgment. the people .of that countrywere quite justified in desiring fco make a reservation on the question of immigration. They desired that that matter should be one for their own decision, and should not be submitted to the arbitramentof the I League of. Nations. And I m i g h t . go through all the various objections taken in the United States of America to fche Covenant of the League, and there is no honourable member b u t would admit t h a t there was reason and sound sense behind fche contention of those who opposed the United States of America joining the League, even although we might not agree with them in every particular. However, that is a matter for the people of the United States of America. We must all agree that it is unfortunate thafc we have nofc a Covenant of a League of Nations that commends itself to all the great powers of the world. That is something we all desire,and I am so optimistic as to believe that if the matter is approached as ifc ought to beit will yet be possible to formulate such a Covenant, to which all the great nations of the world w ill be signatories. But w t Bhall not promote that objective by taking any captious exception, at the present moment), to the atfcitute taken up by the great United States of America. The most remarkable feature that I have noticed in listening to the debate on fchis motion is the great change that has taken place in the public utterances in regard fco important public questions during the last few years. It was not so long ago thafc we were told by the Prime Minister that as a result of the war and the Peace Treaty Australia had taken her place amongst the nations of the world. Now3 we hear the same honourable gentleman belittling this country, for I think that one of the outstanding features of his speech was the manner in which he decried Australia. He said, w i th regard to the people of Great Britain Why Bhouid they spend their money to defend usT What do they s»nin from us? I do not ask what we Rain from them, because our gain is obvious. Later on he said, in reference to the proposed Anglo-Japanese allianceNow here is our dilemma-our , interest, our of the League of safety, lies in the renewal of. theAnglo-Japanese Treaty.

Another notable change is that whilst we were told that the late war was fought to end war, ' to protect the rights of small nations, and to give self-determination to small nations, we know that since then, even within the bounds of our own Empire, there have been struggles for self-determination, and certain conduct on the part of the GovernmentI do not say on the part of the people-which , has drawn very severe criticism from two large parties in Great Britain. enly. I am showing that there is a remarkable change in many respects from the attitude taken up, and the protestations made, while the greatwar was in. progress.

The Prime Minister has voice of the people of this country should turned from the League of Nations, and be heard.

He says it is necessary that he should attend that gathering in order that we stated the conditions upon which he would might majkel such arrangements within agree to the Treaty. the Empire as would enable us to resist aggression from without.

On the other hand, the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) and others point out that, in their opinion, there has been a drastic change made in our constitutional relations by reason df the 1917 Conference, and of the fact that Australia has been made a separate party to the covenant of the League of Nations. And, in support of their contention they point out that the Prime Minister of South Africa and the Prime Minister of Canada have said so in so many words. I agree with those who contend that there has been a change, and that it has been proclaimed by the Prime Ministers of South Africa and Canada.

That can only be ascertained .by perusing it , and I invite honourable members to do so very carefully. The Treaty ,has largejy to do with interests in India and China, and, unless it is to be extended in some manner, those are the only interests .referred to. There are three documents. first was signed in London on the 30th January, 1902, on behalf of Great Britain and of Japan. The second was signed in London on the 12th August, 1905, and the third was signed, also in London, on 13th July, 1911. The preamble of the last of the three statesThe Government of Great Britainand the Government of Japan, having in view the imis clause 4, which reads as follows:portant changes which have taken place in the situation since the conclusion of the AngloJapanese Agreement of the 12th August, 1905, and believing that a revision of that Agreement responding to such changes would contribute to general stability and repose, have agreed upon the following stipulations to reprice' the Agreement above mentioned, such stipulations having the same object as the said Agreement, namely: (a) The consolidation and maintenance of tlie general peace in the regions of Eastern Asia and of India. (b) The preservation of the common interests of all Powers in China by in the practice hitherto, when Australia consuring the independence and integrity of the Chinese Empire and. the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations in China. ie) The maintenance of the territorial -rights of the.

There are set out the whole of the objects. member is asking that f u l l power in this They have to do with India and China regard should be vested in the Prime and Eastern Asia. The next important article is Article 2, which readsIf, by reason of an unprovoked attack or aggressive action wherever arising on the part of any other Power or Powers, either high contracting party should be involved in war I do not care what those in defence of its territorial rights or special interests mentioned in the preamble of this There is the obligation that, in the event, say, of Japan being attacked by China in this part of the world, the other contracting party has to come to its assistance at once. that was not unprovoked in the eye of the party attacked?

It is quite a possibility. Another clause to which I wish to refer ^Should either high contracting party conclude a treaty of general arbitration with a third Power, it is agreed that nothing in this agreement shall entail upon such contracting party an obligation to go to war with the Power with whom such treaty of arbitration is in force.

238,Mr Ryan,"It is;, but, after all, arepeople would say that h& has broken his pledges. Others would say that he has interpreted them differently. To return to Article 4, which I have already read, I maintain that there is no treaty of general arbitration with the United States of America. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) has suggested that there is, but T have only to refer in this connection to an answer which was given in the British House of Commons recently by the Under Secretary of Statef o r Foreign Affairs. . Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Frederick H a l l askedWhether the terms of the Treaty arrangements between Great Britain and Japan precluded the possibility of assistance to Japan in any conflict which might arise between that country and the TJnited States of America, and if assurances on this point had been given to the American Government in connection with the consideration of. their naval building programme ? The Under-Secretary, in his reply, quoted Article4 of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, which I have already read, and then proceeded to sayAt the time when the Agreement was under negotiation a General Arbitration Treaty between this country and the TJnited States of America was being concluded, and this circumstance inspired' the adoption of the terminology of Article4 by His Majesty's Government anil the Japanese Government. spirit in which that Article was conceived the Japanese Government have always shared, and continue to share, the views of His Majesty's Government. The General Arbitration Treaty was not ratified by the United States of America Senate. Subsequently, however, on 15th September, 1914, a Peace Commission Treaty was signed and duly ratified, under whioh, when all diplomatic methods of adjustment had failed, all disputes between the two countries of "" any nature whatsoever other than those disputes the settlement of which is provided for "" are to be referred to an investigation commission. Treaty is not, technically, a general arbitration treaty, but their objects are the same. There we have, on the word of the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the statement that the Treaty which now exists between Great Britain and the United States of America is not a general arbitration treaty, in fact, is not a treaty within the meaning of Article4 of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. it , he says. Dr. Government Government Mr Ryan. Treaty was equivalent to an arbitration treaty. Foreign Affairs said so in his reply. He said that it was not technica l y a general arbitration treaty, but that the objects were tbe same. However, what I am contending is that, in the wording of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, there is no general arbitration treaty existing between GreatB rita in and the United States of America, and we know how differences in the matter of wording subsequently lead to great international difli. culties. A t the present time there is a serious dispute between Japan and the United States of America, owing to the fact that the position of the Island of Yap was not made clear at the Peace Treaty w it h Germany. made perfectly clear. great nations disputing the matter, and France intimating to the United States of America that she w ill approach the question diplomatically when it comes up for discussion again. over facts, and not over words. As to the true tain, Japan, and the United States of America or Australia that is concerned in this alliance. What about those other countries referred to in the preamble, India and China? Surely they are entitled to be heard. I have with me a report of an interview with D r . Wang, the Chief Justice of China, who is now passing through the United States. The report reads as follows: China, says Dr. Wang, has three dread enemies. The first enemy is Article XXI . of The Peace Commission the covenant of the League, which lays down an untenable doctrine in regard to thc so called regional understandings, which is a direct challenge to China's integritv and destructive to ihe League itself. The second enemy is thc Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which Dr. Wang hopes to show Canadians will, if renewed in any form whatsoever, lead to war. in which China must necessarily participate, aiding the United States. The third enemy is the Lansing-Ishii exchange of notes with their untenable doctrine that geographical propinquity confers rights. The people of China have some rights, announced to the Japanese agreement which may do them an in that the Peace Commission justice we might surely consider the",58,Imperial Conference

W it h that I entirely agree; but in war time that fleet should be under one supreme command, and controlled by the head of the Britisli Navy. The Prime Minister is going Homo to represent us, and I think we must all admit that he has not got what I might call a naval atmosphere. To-night,.however, I am going to talk to Hansard, and also, of course, to honourable members who have been so kind as to remain i u the chamber; because I know that in his "" old kit bag "" the Prime Minister will take one or two Hansards containing the speeches that have been made during this debate, and I wish him to arrive in England with all the latest figures relating to naval expenditure by England, Japan, and America. Honourable members who peruse their newspapers have, no doubt, seen that a great mad naval race for supremacy is going on at the present time, which, if continued, will lead to two things-the bankruptcy of the Powers concerned, and, perhaps, revolution of the peoples of these Powers. To-day Japan is afraid and suspicious of the American programme; the United States is suspicious of ,Japan's Naval Estimates, and suspicious of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. But tliere is nothing in that alliance between JaDan and England that means anything aggressive to the United States. very well. America is suspicious that there is something underlying that treaty, but there is absolutely nothing. Lord Northcliffe,. for many weeks, has been The Prime Minister said carrying on a long correspondence witli Mr Daniells, the late Secretary for' the Navy of America, on that very point. These two are very great friends, and Lord Northcliffe has been trying to convince Mr Daniells that there is nothing whatever against America in the alliance. If lie approves of what is Whab is England's position ? The British lion, between these two great countries, is being dragged by the tail into a position he does not appreciate or covet. MrL i k e . the Treasurer Lloyd George, I think, ought to be cheered by everybody in the Empire for being quite open, and throwing on the table all his cards in connection with the Navy. Tliese cards show us to day a huge decrease, not only in expenditure but in ships. Mr Lloyd George has thrown down his cards, for what purpose ? Por the one purpose of bringing America, Japan, and ourselves around a table in full, open, and frank conference in an. endeavour to stop this mad naval race, and come to an understanding with one another. In the House of Commons the other day it was, stated that since the Armistice the British Navy had cost £150,000,000, apart altogether from the great expense of demobilization and other heavy cbarges. The British Estimates for 1920-21 showed £105,000,000 gross for the Navy alone. For 1921-22 the Estimates are £91,000,000gross, showing a reduction of £14,000,000. The net amounts show a reduction of £8,500,000. And now as to-the Britisli Navy itself. I am not giving away any official secrets-I would not for ono moment dp so-and the figures with which I am dealing honourable members could ascertain for themselves. It is intended to havo thirty effective capital sliips, sixteen in full commission and fourteen in Teserve. The personnel, officers and men, in war time was over 400,000; up to three days ago it was 121,700. Two days ago a cable appeared in fhe Argus whichshowed that the personnel has been increased, for what reason I do not know, by 25,000, making, in round figures, 146,700 instead of 400,000 officers andmen.. The decrease still goes on. Eight obsolescent capital ships are to be sold.. I know every one of them, and they areI know my America fine ships, still useful for many purposes.

The Atlantic destroyer flotilla is in reserve; the South American Squadron is withdrawn, and the North American and the SouthA f r i can Squadrons arc each reduced by one light cruiser'. The only point that sticks oat here in all these reductions is the fact tliat £2,500,000 only has been placed on hand as' the first instalment for the replacement of capital ships. This means, as honourable members will see when I give them the Japanese and American figures, that by 1924 the British Empire, instead of being mistress of the seas, which sbe has been for 300 years, will be the third-rate naval Power. Just think what that moans. If such be the case, no longer shall wo be inspired and uplifted, as I always am, when I hear that grand old air "" Rule, Britaunia."" Never again shall we hear those strains if this mad raco goes on; and it is open to every one of us to try to stop it. That is why I am preaching this sermon, not to honourable members, but to Hansard, so that when the Prime Minister goes Home he may, as ho passes through America, endeavour to get the great Powers concerned around the conference table. The position is dead serious. Listen! England is spending 6 per cent, ""of her. national income on _ her Navy, while America is spending 10 per cent.; but Japan is spending one-third of her whole income on her Navy. America, according to General Pershing a very fine man-is spending £1,250,000 every day of the year on her Navy and Army. ment recently at a banquet at New York. By 1923 she will have built four new post-Jutland, first-class battleships, with all the latest improvements, and by 1924-5, eight first-class battleships. She will be superior to Great Britain in big ships and big guns, but weaker in light cruisers and destroyers, and in the air. She will be superior to Japan in effective ships in the rato of 1.4 to 1; she wili be weaker than Japan in battle cruisers and light cruisers. of the American House of Representatives' estimates that £108,666,000 more than the original estimate of £134,567,500 will be required to complete America's naval programme, making her expenditure, on the Navy alone £243,233,500. It is to he remembered that America is not carrying out a new programme, but is completing one made during the war, that of 1916. ""What is America's opinion of battleships? Recent press reports inform us that she is in favour of them. As honourable members know, a great controversy has been raging in England until only a few days ago as to the value of the battleship.. It was raised by Admiral Sir Percy Scott, a very great man. It was he who invented thc system of fire controls for our great ships. Many of our war vessels were not equipped with this system of control until half way through the war. He was sent for by the Admiralty, and went to Scapa Flow, where, in the quickest way possible, ho fitted out the ships. Sir Percy Scott predicted, years before the war, that the capital ship would be driven off the seas by the submarine. ""Was he far wrong? : Ninety thousand tons of our best ships wore sunk by submarines. His' statement is that when a great ship goes to sea-and having seen them at sea, I agree with him-it has to be shepherded on every side by those wonderful little wasps, the destroyers, to keep off the submarines, and has to be protected ahead by fleets of mine sweepers. To-day one big mine or one torpedo can send to. destruction a battleship costing between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000. I have followed this controversy closely. There aro pros and C07W. MT. BOWKEN -What cloes Scott say? ship is no good. There are three notable opinions which he has received. One of thom is rather amusing. It came ' from a midshipman of the Grand Fleet, and is short and sweet, the midshipman's opinion of battleships being, "" They arc of no dnmn use."" The second was from Captain Dewar, who has been sitting on the Naval Committee. He said that the object of battleships is to fight the battleships of the enemy when they come The Naval Committee' out; but, should the enemy's battleships not come out, then they are of no use. _ The third reply was from RearAdmiral Sir Reginald Bacon, under whom I had the honour to serve for ten months at Dover. He said that battleships arethere for the purpose",63,Eable Page In 1914 The British And Before We Commit Ourselves To An

Scott replies, ""What of the 90,000 tons lying at the bottom? ing their will on the waters that are above to another decision: ""Improvements them."" While on this point I wish to give an argument that Scott put forward in support of his statement that the battleship is no good. will come up at the Imperial Conference. Northcliffe, the other ""day, wired to one of his newspapers in Australia, the Sydney Sun, a fine and up-to-date journal, that the representatives of the Dominions should go to the Conference with concrete proposals for every position that may arise. our Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) should arrive with some'idea as to what Australia's part sbould be iu the next Navy. That is why I am directing my attention to these matters somewhat thoroughly. Scott points out that in their naval programme of 1911-12 the Germans devoted ""themselves building of great ships, . and to the widening, deepening, and improving in every way of the Kiel Canal, so that these vessels might pass through it. They were led into that programme by Admiral Lord Fisher-Jacky Fisher, as he was popularly named, and as I prefer to call luma strong believer in submarines as against the battleship. Fisher, as First Lord of the Admiralty, entered upon a big ship programme. made known the otlier day by Sir Percy Soott, who was sitting at the Admiralty with Fisher. The Germans at once said, "" We must follow Britain's example,'' and, luckily for us, they adopted our lead, and built the big ships instead of submarines. Scojtt says that had they had fifty more submarines in 1914, we should to-day be a German possession, because the British Navy could not have escaped destruction. The British Board of Inventions and' Research, of which Lord Fisher was chairman, and Admiral Sir Percy Scott a member-Scott was also at the head of the Anti-Submarine Board at the Admiralty-wen t into the question of the great ship, and came to this decision: "" We oould not build abattleship, or any other ship, strong enough to withstand the attack of a torpedo or a mine, and there could be no limit to the size of these under-water weapons of attack."" That is to say, that Mi-. Marks. improvements in mines and torpedoes would be too much for any big ship that They are enforc-. we could design. Later, the Board came could be made iu the great ship to withstand the attack of the torpedo or a mine to prevent her from sinking, and to enThese matters able her to get back into port for repairs, but her size would have to be from 40,000 to 50,000 tons."" About twelve months ago the cost of a large battleship was about £7,500,000. What a 50,000ton battleship would cost, I leave it to honourable members to guess. Furthermore, these big ships ""require a bath,"" as In other words, he thinks that Sir Percy Scott puts it , every six months. Where, in Australia,' have we a dock which would accommodate one of them J We have not a dock in which a big battleship could be cleaned, and a serious question for the Commonwealth to face is the matter of providing a great"" naval dock. Such a dock would cost millions of to the pounds. But whatever the size of the British Navy is to be in' total quantity of ships, if it is decided that there are to be big ships, Australia must provide a dock in which they can be cleaned. Jacky Fisher's opinion on the subject of big ships is worth having. He sides with Scott. Almost his last words were: "" Scrap the lot. Future fighting will be in the air."" Lord Jellicoe's opinion is that, whilst we The facts were have a great mercantile fleet of ships, which are absolutely necessary for conveying troops and food, we must continue to have a great Fleet of large war-ships to guard them. In other words, so long as we have a surface mercantile marine, great capital ships will be necessary until something better is devised. Both America and Japan endorse that view. The Imperial Defence Committee will thresh out this very important point-in my opinion, the paramount one-as to what our Navy is to bo, and what Australia's share in it shall be. Already a Sub-Committee, composed of Mr Bonar Law, Mr Winston Churchill, Mr Walter Long, Sir Auckland Geddes, nnd Admiral Beatty, has been sitting; and no doubt its conclusions will be placed before the Imperial Conference. The decisions of the Conference will come back to us, as fche Prinie Minister has rightly promised, for discussion in this Parliament. That is why I shall not deal with the matter at greater length. to-nifjht. position of Japan, it is a strange which I know will be of interest to honourable members, that the egg of maritime and naval strength was hatched in an American incubator. able members are familiar with the name of the late Admiral written some most wonderful naval matters, which I advise honourable members to read. Interest of America in Sea Power, Present and Future, Japanese language in April, 1899, the Hon. Kentaro Agriculture wrote a preface to it, in which he said, inter alia-Our Empire, recognised as the foremost of maritime countries in the Pacific, should,, in spite of the short time since her awakening, become conscious of this fact, and increase more and more her power as such among the nations of the world. My desire is that my fellow countrymen should read this book in such a spirit, and put forth an effort to make their country a great Power in the Pacific Ocean. That book ancl preface were distributed throughout Japan; it was placed in the Naval Colleges, and on every ship. Japan is to-day giving. effect to those principles which were inculcated by the great American, Admiral Mahan. "" In to-day's Argus appeared the following cablegram : CALL TO ST?BJECTS ABROAD. New York, 20th April. Washington official circles have been warned that all Japanese between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-seven years, without previous service, have been ordered to return for military training to Japan from the Philippines, Indies, and South Sea Islands. Departmental officials point out that thc order indicates tlie general inclination of Japan since the war of adopting more rigorousmethods to place herself in a state of military and, naval defence. Hitherto Japan has allowed considerable laxity in enforcing the law providing for the military training of her subjects abroad. Now as to her naval plans. They are these: Sixty-eight millions for the new programme. Sixteen capital ships, that is, eight battle ships and eight battle cruisers. Twenty submarines, and large numbers of destroyers and light cruisers. In regard to the Where is the League of Nations?

I am surej sir, that when I give you information of that character it w ill certainly counterbalance that which has been given by the honourable member for . Wentworth ( Mr Marks) .

The first is. that no obligation into which Great Britain may enter, and which seeks to bind this country in any shape or form to fight alongside of Japan, or of any other Asiatic race, against the TJnited States of America, shall ever receive our endorsement.

313,Mr Anstey,"We should not forgetinvolved in not creating any more enemies. The Prime Minister has asked, W h a t does the Old Country owe to Australia 1 She owes an' immense deal; and in saying that I am not posing as an Australian born, for I came from the Old Country. There are Englishmen who have answered the question for us. The late Joseph Chamberlain, speaking to an immense audience in St. Andrew's H a l l , Glasgow, after the Boer war, said, "" Do you not recognise that these great Dominions do something more than furnis h a market ? Theyf u r nish us w it h men, and these are of immense value to the centre of the Empire."" I do not wish to be performing t h « patriotic stunt, but I think I can remember reading something concerning what the men of this country have done away on Gallipoli or on the Somme. HaveI not read that it was the men of Australia who, either by reason of their superior social status, or from the advantages of their physique, and from their abilities as in States of America. She bas builtup a dividuals, or because of all these things, were really the finest storm troops that the war produced? A nd have I not read that it was the Forces of this country which, . when the British were overwhelmed, stemmed the German flood, poured into the gap left by the F if t h A r m y , and so protected Amiens that the fortunes of the war were turned to victory for the Allied cause? Thus, then, <loes not the Empire owe something to its outlying Dominions? But if neither material advantages from the view-point of the creation of markets, nor the fact of the outlying portions furnishing the finest storm troops amount to any real reasons why the-centre of the Empire shouldfind adequate naval and military protection for these shores against any and all foreign invasion, there is another reason. E ven if this were ablack man's country, and even if we were not a patriotic people and had not sacrificed ourselves as I have read that we have done in the Great War, there is another and a more cogent reason fhan all-on e that is more powerful -than either the blood ties of k it h and k in or racial obligations. That other reason is, money. Great Britain has invested from £500,000,0(30 £1,000,000,00 0 of British capital in, the Dominions; and, even if she should not be prepared to fight for the maintenance of a white race within this land, it is certain, at least, that she will fight for Mr Anstey. the protection of her bond-holders. So let us not be afraid t h at Britain w ill fai l to furnish protection for Australia against foreign aggression. share! being called upon to go over this patriotic stunt business again, let me say that surely we have done our share. We have to consider the problems of this country The Anglo-Japanese Treaty has been entirely altered, in its every aspect, from what it was before the war. In those days Australia's position was that whatever might have been the arrangement between Great Britain and Japan, we were largely ignorant of it. But the risks that face ns to-day d i d not confront us before bhe great war, for that conflict has developed two gigantic powers. One honourable member has already^pointed out the enormous new power of the TJnited tremendous army, and a huge navy. J 1 have before me a review which gives striking particulars of the development of the forces of offence and defence in the TJnited States of America. Does America, at this hour, think of the curtailment of her army and navy? No. Britain to-day'is. exactly in the same position aa theTJnited States of America before the War. In those days Britain said, "" We are prepared to arrange for and to enter into any treaties w it h any and every nation on earth for the curtailment of armaments. We do not wish to participate in a continuance oi this mad race of armaments. But there is just one fundamental condition which w must lay down and observe; that is, thai Great Britain should have two for you* one. If you have 200 ships we shall have 400; if you have 2,000 we shall have 4,000."" Now the war is ended and Britain can no longer maintain that ratio. Britain to-day is in the position of the United States of America before the war, ana America occupies the pre-war position of Great Britain. America now says, "" Oh, yes, we believe in the limitation of armaments, but if you have two we shall have three; if you have 200 we shall have to 300;. if you have 2,000 we .shall have 3,000. We are bound to maintain ourselves as the most powerful naval and military nation on earth.""

315,Mr Anstey,"Surely; and, withoutof our Prime Minister, who is now «i member of the United States of America Cabinet, said, "" The American Republic never retreats. The American flag is the only flag that has never known defeat. We follow it because the hand that carries it is the unseen hand of God; and we shall follow it ever to victory."" Every nation, of course, has its own glorious flag, which is carried by the unseen hand of God. The unfortunate circumstance is that there are so many gods. However, that does not matter. All the nations pray to their Godf or victory, and should he fail them they have the sense to ' lame their own wickedness, by way of explanation of the defeat of their God and themselves in battle. The situation ex isting between Japan and the United States of America ^is not a mere matter of the occupation of some American soil by a comparatively few Japanese. And -the situation between Australia and Japan is not a mere matter of colour in volving just a few men. The whole businessis, in fact, a struggle of the great nations for the conquest and exploitation of China and her gigantic assets. Great Britain and Japan are in alliance for the exploitation of the four hundred millions of Chinese people, for the seizure of their railways, the realization of their tremendous iron ore deposits, the spoliation ot their wealth. Japan, under an arrangement with Great Britain, has marched into. Eastern Siberia and overthrown the authority there established; and, in that territory, Japan, proposes to pur;ue a policy of exploitation. There are two clear and definite stateknow very well the position in Avhich ments which must be embodied in any the Treaty that in any way identifies us with, -America, w i th all the forces at her an Asiatic race if it is to be acceptable command, had not entered into the recent io the people of this country.

We could say w i th equal Japan we should be compelled to treat force that British Ministers do not under* the American citizens in this country as stand the psychology of the Australian we did the Germans during the recent conflict. Are we to be hound upon-a -declaration of war between America and Japan to treat every American citizen in the Commonwealth as an enemy subject and' confiscate his property ? I s it likely that we can be called upon to seize their ships, and at the same time be inevitably bound to grant social privileges to the Japanese, which will be deified to American citizens ? Shall we be asked to give the Japanese the right to coal their transports while denying those rights to the ships of the American nation ? That, I fear, is the position int o which this conntry is being driven. Take the situation that is developing in the Atlantic. We have been told in the newspapers that the Americans have: taken their fleet througn th© Panama Canal into the Pacific, where it is concentrating. For what purpose? We can see with what contempt British naval strength is being treated at this very. hour. The recent conflict has taught us that America is the master of the economic situation. The closing of the ports ia Russia, the Black Sea, and the Baltic has thrown-trade intoi a country which is a large producer of foodstuffs. Because of the policy that has been adopted in the past these things have become a menace, and the Avar has shown us that to an extent we are dependent upon the ' productions of the American Republic to supply us w i th the material w i th which to fight. The American Republic exercises f u l l economic control, and we Allies would have been if It low the example of Lloyd George, when people. There is no government, no law, or no power which could compel the people of Australia by reason of their peculiar psychology to fight side by side witb an. Asiatic race against a white man's country. Our loyalty to the Empire, if nothing else, necessitates that this point should be made quite clear, whatever Treaty may eome back to us-if any does come back -afte r the Imperial Conference. It has been stated-wh o was it who said it thab this last war was a war to end all wars ? Who was it who put forward such a preposterous proposal ? Men have been sent to gaol for saying that the conflict was being waged for the benefit of commercial interests. Someono said that the struggle was being waged in the interests of rival robbers, who were anxious to secure the markets of the world. Human material was provided, and sacrifice and suffering endured merely for the benefit of those who were really traitors to their nation. suggestion, then, that the war was to end war! saying, not long ago, that the war had achieved its object, and that it had produced what it was intended to produce, and had brought to us a long and lasting peace. The same gentleman said it had landed us in the green fields of a perpetual peace; but he now says, "" W h o would be so stupid as to say that the war would end all wars."" I do not intend to . mention names; but those who are interested can look up his speech, and see what was actually said. member read his own speech? Is this a performance ? ance such as the right honourable gentleman has put up from time to time w i th great success, and to the admiration of his supporters. orable member say a little more about England, Japan, and America? has asked me to say a littl e more about England; -but I have said all I desire to say. I do not desire to cast any reflections in any shape or form. I endeavour to be a pro-Australian, because I recognise that this country has given me many advantages which the land of my b i r t h denied me. I have nothing more to say, except that it is our clear and solemn duty to Australia to at least tell the Old Countryt h a i we are net prepared to link up with an Asiatic race in any conflict against white people. That is clear and definite. Many of us have been condemned as traitors to our country, irrespective of the fact that we are linked to B rita in by 1 ties of race and blood, because we endeavoured to speak the truth , and point out -to the working people of Australia that war can produce nothing but misery. The last conflict has shown that war can produce nothing but hardship and privation for the working classes of a l l countries, and that it ia only those who did uot make any sacrifice who benefited. We see to-day that the Gorman miners are working for an allowance of bread and sausage; the miners of Prance, flooded w it h German coal, are walking destitute in the streets of their cities; the miners of ^England, many of W h at a preposterous whom fought on the field of battle, bave had their wages reduced by 5s. in I remember one gentleman five weeks, while thc steel-workers of England have suffered a reduction of 40 per cent, in their wages. That is the reward which the blood-stained rulers of Empires have offered to the masses of their working people. Even Mr Lloyd George has exclaimed at the miserable and repulsive conditions under which the miners in some of the poorer districts of Great Britain are working. would they have been if Germany had won ? is any one except a few dominant rich men ? W h a t is the condition of the masses ? MT. HUGHES -Al l the Germans are tarred with the same brush.

"" "" The sugar industry,"" I repeated, because I remembered the sugar industry in the East End of London, and how, when I was a boy, nearly every Englishman had been driven out of it to find room for cheap continental labour. The engineer replied, "" Yes, the sugar industry."" Thereupon I said, "" He employs every race on earth except his own."" The engineer said, "" No, you are making a mistake."" Then he leaned across to the chairman, and said to h i m, "" Mr Anstey has been misinformed about you. Some one has been telling him that you employ every race on earth except your own in your industry."" The chairman, sipping his soup very comfortably, immediately said, "" Yes , it is true; but not a German-no t since the war."" Englishmen like that. Englishman who would degrade his fellow -countrymen in that way is a bigger enemy of the Empire than is a foreign workman. When I told mv brother of this incident he said, "" The y have employed nothing but niggers and Chows since the war started."" that trumpet' the British Empire have loaded every ship which carried the British flag with niggers because it costs more to employ English sailors.

The question of naval defence and the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty boiled down amounts to the same thing, and requires no argument. The answer was given by the Treasurer when he went to Sydney the other day and told the people fchat we were face to face with declining revenue and increasing expenditure in the shape of interest.

These difficulties face every country in the world except, perhaps, Japan and America, because of the fact that they were free from the world's conflict. Every big belligerent country has to face the facts as I havestated them. Therefore it is useless to talk about increasing our naval expenditure. We cannot do it . As far as the Treaty is concerned, quite apart from our White Australia policy, it is only fair that, before giving acquiescence to it, we .should see definitely what terms it contains. I hope that the gentleman who follows me will not be subjected to the numerous interjections which have not only occupied my time, but also so disturbed my thoughts as to make my speech more theatrical than it otherwise would have been. -There is one thing, I think, with which honourable members will agree, namely, that boiled down into a splendid sentence arrangement to finish this debate at a reasonable hour to-morrow, we must sit till a later hour than usual to-night. speakers, apart from the honourable member for Melbourne, and including the sidine), who wishes to address himself to the amendment.

We shall not sit all night, but we must sit a little later than usual this evening. to that. There is one thing which the honourable member for Bourke( Mr sist them. In such a contingency I trust Anstey) made quite plain, namely, that Australia will not fight America. The Prime Mimster agrees with my statement. plainly that we could not think of such a thing, and it is only fair to say that England would never agree to any alliance which would involve the chance of war with the United States of America. opinion. The Old Country would not accept any Treaty which would compel her to fight upon the side of another nation against the United States of America. 3,000 miles without a single soldier upon it divides Canada from the United States of America. That is the greatest monument of humanity. At the same time, no word of mine will be used in"" disparagement of Japan. I understood the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) to say that, if the Germans, instead of following the British example of building large warships, had possessed fifty more submersibles, the flag of England would have been defeated during the recent war. I hold that, had Japan been an Ally of Germany, we today should have been endeavouring to speak either German or Japanese. Nothing could have saved us. Japan has been a loyal Ally.

336,Dr. Maloney,"A frontier of overfrom the East. Italy, as England's best friend, was endeavouring to induce her to unsheath the sword. I am .always sorry to hear Australians unjustly decrying Americans. As the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) has truly said, America fed England during the early days of the war. As far back as 1905 I wrote the following:So far as we in Australia are directly concerned, I see, first of all, and more important than all, though ultimately worthless, unless knit with all, one effective ally, one union, that will beget a confident hope, or rather, a sure trust in any future, that is with the United States of America. The road thither may be very distasteful to much that is aggressively, rather than self-sacrificingly British. even if , with cap in hand, it were better thither, and with that purpose, than ultimately, with sackcloth on our loins and ashes on our heads, to put our neck beneath the heel of the Eastern Conqueror. I am proud that I had the prescience to foresee what would happen. Japan has honoured our race in a way that no country ever honoured it before. Recognising the trouble that Eastern nations experience, knowing that after the missionaries come the traders, Japan asked our greatest philosopher what was the best means of avoiding quarrels with other nations. In reply, Herbert Spencer wrote thc most important letter that ever the brain of man devised, and Japan loyally followed his advice. The position is not merely, as the Prime Minister has not allow any foreigner to own , land there, that she will not permit the importation of foreign labour, and that she has actually repatriated Chinese labourers. Ifc is far more than that. In Japan to-day, owing to the advice of Herbert Spencer, no foreigner can hold land or have an interest in the tramways or railways of the country. ' The late Sir Malcolm McEacharn was Consul for Japan in Victoria, but he could not get a franchise from the Japanese Government. He had to trust'to the honesty of the Japanese. Foreigners may not hold land under lease in Japan, and provision is made for only annual tenancies. At one time ho European was allowed to remain in Tokio, the capital, unless he was a Government servant. not allowed to hold interest in mines or coasting steamers, nor to have shares in the principal banks. I do not think I shall weary honourable members if I read the wonderful letter which Herbert Spencer addressed to Kentaro Kaneko, on 26th August, 1892, and upon which these provisions were based. It is to be found at page 321 of the Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer, by David Duncan, LL.D. It is as follows:Your proposal to send translations of my two letters to CountI to , the newly-appointed Prime Minister, is quite satisfactory. I very willingly give my assent. Respecting the further questions you ask, let me, in the first place, answer generally that the Japanese policy should, I think, be that of keeping Americans and Europeans as much as possible at arm's length. In presence of But the more powerful races, your position is one of chronic danger, and you sliould take every precaution to give as little foothold as possible to foreigners. It seems to me that the only forms of intercourse which you may with advantage permit are those which are indispensable for the exchange of commodities and exchange of ideas -importatio n and exportation of physical and mental products. No ""further privileges should be allowed to people of other races, and especially to people' of the more powerful races, than is absolutely needful for the achievement of these ends. Apparently, you are proposing,by revision of the treaty powers w i th Europe and America, "" to open the whole Empire to foreigners and foreign capital."" I regard this as a fatal policy. If you wish to see what is likely to happen, study the history of India. Once Jet one of the more powerful races gain a point d'appui, and there w ill inevitably, in course of time, grow up an aggressive policy which w ill lead to collisions with the Japanese. These collisions w ill be represented as attacks said, that Japan will by the Japanese which must be avenged; Forces w ill be sent from America or Europe, as the case may be;, a portion of territory w ill be seized, and required to be made over as a foreign, settlement; and from this there will grow eventually subjugation of the entire Japanese Empire. I believe that you w ill have great difficulty in avoiding this fate in any case; but you w ill make the process easy if you allow any privileges to foreigners beyond those which I have indicated. In pursuance of the advice thus generally indicated, I should say, in answer to your first question, that there should be, not only a prohibition to foreign persons to hold property and land, but also a refusal to'give them leases, and a permission only to reside as annual tenants. To the second question,. I should say, decidedly prohibit to foreigners the working of the mines owned or worked by Government. Here there would be obviously liable to arise grounds of difference between the Europeans Foreigners are or Americans who worked them and the Government, and these grounds of difference would immediately become grounds of quarrel, and would be followed by invocations to the English or . American Governments or other powers to send forces to insist on whatever the European workers claimed, for always the habit here and elsewhere among the civilized peoples is to believe what their agents or settlers abroad represent to them. In thc third place, in pursuance of the policy a subject race in the position, if not of slaves, I have indicated, you ought also to keep the coasting trade in your own hands, and forbid foreigners to engage in it . This coasting trade is clearly not included in the requirement I have indicated as the sole one to be recognised a requirement to facilitate exportation and importation of commodities. The distribution of commodities brought to Japan from other places may be properly left to the Japanese themselves, and should be denied to foreigners, for thc reason that again thc various transactions involved would become so many doors open to quarrels and resulting aggressions. To your remaining question, respecting the intermarriage of foreigners and Japanese, which you say is "" now very much agitated amongst our scholars and politicians,"" and which you say is "" one of the most difficult problems,"" my reply is that, as rationally answered, there is no difficulty at all. It should be positively forbidden. It is not at root a question of social philosophy. It is at root a question of biology. There is abundant proof, alike furnished by the intermarriages of human races and by the interbreeding of animals, that when the varieties mingled diverge beyond a certain slight degree, thc result is invariably a bad one in the long run. I have myself been in the habit of looking at the evidence bearing en this matter for many years past, and my conviction is based upon numerous facts derived from numerous sources.' This conviction I have, within thc last half-hour, verified, for I happen to be staying in the country with a gentleman who is well known as an authority on horses, cattle, and sheep, and knows much respecting their interbreeding; and he has-just, on inquiry, fully confirmed my belief that when, say, of different varieties of sheep, there is an interbreeding of those which are widely unlike, the result, especially in the second generation, is a bad one-ther e arises an incalculable mixture of traits, and what may. be called chaotic constitution. And the same thing happens among human beings-the Eurasians, in India, and the half-breeds in America, show this. The physiological basis of this experience appears to be that any one variety of creature in course of many generations acquires a certain constitutional adaptation to its particular form of life, and every ether variety similarly acquires its own special adaptation. mix the constitution of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a -onstitution which is adapted to the mode of life of neithera constitution which w ill not work properly, because it is not fitted for any set of conditions whatever. therefore, peremptorily interdict marriages of Japanese with foreigners. I have, for the reasons indicated, entirely approved of the regulations which have been established in America for restraining the Dr. Maloney. Chinese immigration; and had I the power would restrict them to the smallest possible amount, my reasons for this decision being that one of two things must happen. If the Chinese are allowed to settle extensively in America, they must cither, if they remain unmixed, form yet of a class approaching to slaves; or if they mix they must form a bad hybrid. In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The samo thing will happen if there should be any considerable mixture of the European or American races with thc Japanese. You sec, therefore, that my advice is strongly conservative in aU directions, and I end by saying as I began-kee p other races at arm's length as much as possible. I give this advice in confidence. I wish that it should not transpire publicly, at any rate during my life, for I do not desire to rouse thc animosity of my fellow countrymen. P.S -Of course, when I say I wish this advice to be in confidence, I do not interdict the communication of it to CountI to , but rather wish that he should have the opportunity of taking it into consideration. In order to show how well-founded was the fear of this great man that this advice would rouse the animosity of his fellow countrymen, I propose only to quote the following paragraph from the same work:Though he did not wish this letter made public during his life, Spencer has endorsed on the copies of the correspondence, "" My letters of advice contained in this batch should be read and published."" Shortly after his death, the letter of August 26, was sent from Tokio for publication in the Times (18 January, 1904), which wrote of it as giving "" advice as narrow, as much imbued with antipathy to real progress, as ever came from a self-sufficient, short-sighted Mandarin, bred in contempt and hatred of barbarians."" I conjure my fellow Australians to approach Japan, if we must do so, with the magic word, ""reciprocity""-that wonderful word that comes from Confucius. Let us say to the Japanese that as they honoured our race and language by going to the greatest of our philosophers for adThe consequence is that, if you vice, they cannot blame Australians if we follow their example and desire to keep other races at arm's length. We occupy the wider spaces of a whole continent. We have 11.4 times the terriBy all means, tory of Japan. We may say to the Japanese, "" If you can show that Australians are settled in your country, we will permit eleven times as many Japanese to settle in Australia, and will allow them to have eleven times more territory in Australia than an Australian is permitted to have in Japan."" The population of Japan is 11.4 times that of Australia, and if 100 Australians go to Japan, let us welcome 1,100 Japanese to Australia. But let us have reciprocity with Japan in the fullest sense of. the word. After much reading and great study of their arts during weeks and months spent in the British Museum, I came to the conclusion that the Japanese are the greatest and most artistic race that the world has ever seen. I may be reminded of the sculpture of the elder Greece? and I am prepared to own that it is more beautiful, and for a single reason. The Japanese did not choose beauty as an attribute of their gods, whereas the older Greece more than any other nation that -the world has ever seen, not even excepting our own race of the present day, made their gods beautiful. Honourable members have only .to look at the copy of tlie great classic made by Richardson, the Australian sculptor, who was the first to win the double prize of painting and sculpture in England's Academy. I refer to his glorious classic ""Mercury,"" a copy of which may be seen on the top of the Age newspaper building. "" Mercury"" was the god of thieves and murderers, but his statue is made beautiful by the genius of the elder Grecian race. The bronzes of Japan equal those of Greece. with the Japanese in lacquer work. Their carving on wood is unequalled. In black and white the works of Hokasai, whose period closed in 1859, are equal to the very highest productions of Erench artists, and Whistler said that the genius of painting was left with Velasquez and Hokasai, of Japan. The genius of the Japanese people is evident in everything they have done. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) will agree with me that the genius of the Japanese in medical and surgical science is admitted. course is required for one of their medithe curse of poverty, aiid the giving to eal diplomas. I can never forget that every man and woman a fair deal. I have when a case of small-pox was discovered seen some of the miseries of England, and on a Japanese vessel by which I was they seared my mind. I hated and loathed travelling with our worthy Serjeant-atArms, the first man to come up to be vaccinated was the captain himself. Wagesi n Japan have risen 200, 300, and 400' per cent, since the time. I published the notes to which I have referred. I do not wish to take credit for thc book in which fchey appear. There is glorious language in that book, which is not mine, but that of my dearly cherished friend, Prank Myers, the genius who made the name of "" Telemachus "" ring through not only Austraha, but the United Kingdom, by the articles he published in the Australasian. When I speak of Japan, no word of mine can be construed into contempt of the Japanese people. I trust that the unjust, cruel, and ridiculous criticisms of those people which have marred Australian journalism have passed for ever. They were prevented during the war, and they certainly should never bo resumed. The Japanese are the cleanest race in the world. The first thing a domestic servant in Japan asks for is that she may have two hot baths a day. I can fancy a domestic help going to Toorak and asking the lady of the house for one hot bath a day. I can smile at such a request when I remember some of the dens in which I found servants accommodated when I was in active medical practice. The Japanese servant asks for two hot baths a day, and she will not accept service unless she can get one hot bath a day. The rickshaw man who No other nation can compete drives you in Japan will give you a gilt edged card, and will have his hot bath at the end of each day. The Japanese people were forced te> open their doors. I wish them good luck, and I do so in gratitude for the help which they recently rendered us in Australia. But I want this beloved Australia of ours to be handed down as a white man's heritage. I want Australia, if possible, to surpass little Switzerland,fchafccountry of three nationalities buried in the bosom of the Alps, which has earned the name of "" the school-house of Europe.""

338,Dr. Maloney,"A seven years' example of just laws, the elimination ofnot the race from which my mother, a good old Somersetshire woman, sprung, but the laws which they permitted to obtain. One or two members of this House were present when I told a combined Committee of the House of Commons and House of Lords that the British franchise was worthy only of a barbarian nation. If honourable members care to turn to the Statesman's Year-Book for 1914, from which I have quoted more than once in this House, they can verify the statement. I made,jjfc the time, that the franchise in Great Britain was not equal to that of China, Japan, or Turkey. I was robbed of my vote for four years in London. I told the people there that their franchise was fitted only for a barbarian race, and that until they gave every man and woman in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales a vote, they were nothing but a barbarous people. England to-day is cursed with the House of Lords, which is an embodiment of the vile and wicked past. She does not give human beings a fair show. Let any man look at the wheat lands of England, and he will find vast areas of wheat lands in that country had gone out of cultivation for a period of fifty years prior to the war. Go into the English workhouse and see how the poor are kept. That little land, fifty years before the war, used to grow more food for its people than it grows now. As a boy I was told that the laws of Ireland were unjust; that Irish landlords spent money in London that' they ought to have spent in Ireland, leaving their agents to extract all they could from the tenants; but I was enjoined to remember, that England had more poor people suffering from unjust laws than Ireland had, because there were more people in England. The death rate in England was as high as 800 for every 1,000 children in the first year after birth. The next highest death rate was 3Q0, and the difference of 500 died from want of proper food, shelter, and clothing. I love England and honour its greatness; I recognise that its language has not only conquered the .Celts of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, but is the language of 300,000,000 people in the TJnited States of America. The outlook for England will be great if she does not allow her cursed love of money and capital to cause her to sign a Treaty which Australia will Dr. not permit. I endorse the by no means uncertain words of the Prime Minister, which were deadly in their determination, to the effect that by no act of his would he agree to a Treaty between England and Japani f it might mean war or disagreement between us and-the TJnited States of America. of Great Britain, too? of the House of Lords-that abomination of the past and laughing-stock of the present. The House of Lords, which numbers *600 members, deemed a quorum of three sufficient to manage the whole British Empire. The House of Lords must go. I believe the majority of the House of Commons would hate the idea of war with the United. States of America, and that ninety-nine out of every one hundred average English-speaking people have the same feeling. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) echoed the thoughts that have been enunciated by the Prime Minister, only much more determinedly. We should show America our appreciation of the .glorious words spoken by Admiral Sperry, when he called at New Zealand, on the occasion of the visit of the American Eleet. He was asked about the yellow peril, and, though I forget his. words, they were to the effect, "" You need never be afraid so long as the Stars and Strip.es float over the oceans of the world."" These were glorious words; and this House will determine that under no circumstances shall Australians be put into a position which would lead them to fight alongside an Asiatic race against the United States of America. If I am any judge of the fighting instincts of that great country, which fed England, Scotland, and Wales during the war, and did so much to end the war, it will look on Australia as a younger brother, and carry on the work she has undertaken. The United States of America stands sentinel between the diseases of the East and Australia.

Asf o r myself, my old and beloved friend, the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) , and the President of the Senate, we were vaccinated with what I call filth, so-called Australian lymph, which sent our temperatures up unpleasantly high. I feel certain that the Prime Minister w ill keep imbedded in his mind the thought.that we Australians, loving the Homeland as we clo, would be glad if a Treaty is arrived at with Japan with which we can agree, and which cannot, under any circumstances, be construed into an agreement to take part with Japan against the United States of America. -^ 1 am very sorry that I am compelled by force of circumstances to address myself question at such a late hour.

The motion before the House is that a paper should be printed. It is a favourite method with the Prime Minister for invitin g and securing discussion on matters more or Jess related to the paper in question. T hope the paper will ultimately be printed because, by that means alone, rather than by anything that is said in the course of this discussion, we shall gather what is involved in the Mandate to us of certain territories in the Pacific. For the rest, I shall not defile my soul with the base falsehood that I agree in any substantial part with what the righ t honourable the Prime Minister said in moving fche motion. I am not worrying over the new and mysterious status which Australia is assumed to have won, and now to possess, whatever may be meant by this phrase of "" new and enlarged status,"" because my view is that if the Australian Labour party come into power, as they doubtless will at no very remote date, they will be influenced in regard to foreign affairs more by the deliberately expressed w ill of the Australian people than' by the expression of persons outside, however emiment, or in however solemn convocation they may be assembled. On the other hand, if what I may call by the somewhat vulgar title of "" Hughesism "" is to prevail, we shall doubtless pursue our easy alternate r6le of sycophant and boaster On the one hand we shall continue to declare, through our responsible statesman, that we are a nation new-born and giant-like, almost invulnerable, and to a very serious with, the other voice we shall continue, abject and toadying, to insist in cringing tones that Australia is nothing save what it is by the grace of B r it a in , and' fchat we are but as the f r o t h blown from the cup of Britain's I had come to greatness.

I recollect h i m saying 'that, as sure as we stand here, this Empire of ours would never have been buil t without British control of the seas. "" By an all-powerful British Navy this Empire has been built u p ; only by a powerful British Navy can it be maintained."" What the right honourable gentleman says may or may not be true. If it is true, it is a dreadful confession. It is an admission and a re-statement of the first principle of his creed that might is right. It bears out what we have always thought of him : that it is sti.l his view that our greatness stands on guns and gasconading, and that fight and force are at the base of our mightiness. words, it is just such a crude expression of Prussianism as an international policy as we had good reason to expect from thc present Government. Ministers appeal to history in support of the policy when they say that we live by virtue of the allpowerful British Navy. Thus every cut throat pirate returning with, his ill-gotten gains to lay them at the foot of a grateful British Kins', is, according to this view, to be our inspiration and our model. It is true that when the Prinie Ministeri n sisted that might is right, and that our greatness and our salvation depend upon the carrying power of our guns and the number and variety of our ships, he made the tardy acknowledgement that the Almighty may play some little part -thoug h a part clearly ancillary to that of the Navy. The Almighty is secondary to the Navy, and acting in a subordinate capacity. Empire is to-day with local industrial upheavals, distracted as it is by the Irish and Indian risings risings against savage and persistent in justice-r-this Empire cannot hope to endure, and wil l not deserve to endure, unless it substitutes a moral claim for the claim of force majeure. We are indebted to the Leader of the Government ( Mr Hughes) for the statement that every Australian citizen realizes that the destiny of this country is to be played on the mighty stage of the Pacific. That may be; but why ie it not to be played within the very extensive domain of this continent, which is surely large enough and broad enough to stage even so great a drama? we first fruits of our policy of annexation, which, under the name of Mandates, compromises our safety in the Pacific, and makes it necessary, as the Prime Minister says ia obvious to every citizen, that the destiny of this country is to be played on the mighty stage of that ocean. honourable member is satisfied that we should have onr responsibilities indefinitely and indecently extended beyond our needs. If it had not been for this mischievous policy of annexation, carried on in breach of the solemn pledges we made on. entering the Peace Conference, we In other might still have thought that as a. peaceloving people, with well-defined boundaries and an insular situation, we stood in a very hopeful situation for a long, if not perpetual, peace in the country to which we have established at least some sort of prescriptive claim Now as to the policy of White Australia, which, as I said a moment ago, is compromised by the alliance which, the Prime Minister has assured us in advance, he is going to the other side of the world tb approve, because he told us that on White Australia he would, insist. "" I shall have my way "" were his words. That is a very curious position for the right honourable gentleman to take up. It would not be curious for members on. this side of the House; i'-, would be logical and natural for them to say that, but what right has the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Government, Torn as the centre of the and in view of what he has said, to declare that he w ill have his way against Britain? Has he not declared that we are but dross to Britain? Has he not declared that we should kneel at the foot of Britain, acknowledging our complete dependence? Has he not declared that we owe her everything, and that in ourselves we are nothing? And yet upon the very first matter in regard to which there is likely to be a clash of opinion between Britain and ourselves he has the temerity to assure this Parliament, the country, and the world, so far as his voice reaches, that he will have his way.

343,Mr Brennan,"Apparently , thethey take up in this regard. I may be asked if I am in favour of the ideal of a White Australia. I am whole-heartedly in favour of it as an ideal, and I would not be afraid or ashamed, if I understood their language, to carry that view into the heart of the Japanese nation itself, because I believe, as many spokesmen of coloured races themselves have said, that there are sound reasons-economic , religious, and other-whic h should move the people of any race differing as the Oriental races do from our own, to accept the principle of a WhiteAustralia as being in the best interests of all the nations concerned. In other words, th© purity of the race, whatever it is, is involved; the maintenance of the ideals of the race, whatever the race may be, is involved, together with much else. Therefore, I would not be afraid or ashamed to advocates a White Australia even in the capital of Japan. But I do not admit for a single moment that the Prime Minister's view-point is the correct one. I do not accept for a second his statement that this country lives only by the grace of Britain, nor will I submit to the view, without challenging it, that the national safety depends upon ships and cannon and force>. I contend that there are other better, more effective, and cheaper means of securing our immunity from war, and that, therefore, not only great material good may be obtained, but infinitely higher moral benefits accrue to the nation so acting. I would not for the world hurt the feelings of members, of the Government or their friends outside^ but when they would persuade me that the safety of this country and Britain and the world depends upon these ships floating somewhere in other seas, and the guns contained in them, and the men who man"" them for the purpose of blowing the lives out of their fellow-men"" I ask, "" What did this Navy do during the great war?"" First of all, it did not prevent war. Secondly, it did not take any part in the war that is worth considering. It did not even prevent the seas being overrun with raiders and submarines, which in ' their turni also were found to have pursued a futile and useless course. The British Navy on the one side and the ships of the enemy on the other side-the one lying idle' in its harbors, and the other lying at the bottom of the sea-remai n to-day splendid tributes to the uselessnes.3 of the policy of destruction. Mr Brennan. And now, after all the money we have spent upon the great British navy, after all the taxation we have heaped upon the people of Great Britain and Ireland, and incidentally upon the people of this country, for its maintenance; after all our vain boasting that we owned and controlled the seas-thoug h God knows why the people of any country should claim to control ocean highways destined for the use of the world-w e are told that the navy is inadequate for the protection of Australia. This is the end of it all. This is the end"" of our sacrifices to build and maintain a navy that to-day, at the zenith of its power,is admitted to be inefficient for the purpose for which ' it was createdMore ships, more blood, more fight. Let us take up the burden again and set out on our long road without a goal carrying our chain without an end. My own view is that our claim to hold this Commonwealth of Australia Tests on two grounds, interwoven one with the other, partly legal and partly moral. In the first place, if we are to assert the principle of a White Australia we must be able efficiently and effectively to occupy this country. We cannot hope to pursue definitely the dog-in-the-manger policy of occupying a country unused and unpeopled, placing a handful of people in certain portions of this great territory, while allowing other portions to remain unoccupied. We cannot, with 5,000,000 of people, hope to possess indefinitely a continent capable of adequately maintaining hundreds of millions of people. On legal and on moral grounds we must effectively occupy Australia if we hope to retain intact our White Australia policy. .Is the policy of this Government calculated to make Australia a white man's land? Why, at this very, moment this Government, while expressing their determination to have their way so far as the exclusion of the colored races is concerned, are equally determined to have their way in excluding some people of the greatest white races in the world"". Out of the folly and bitterness oi the recent war; and the spirit of futile vindictiveness which it engendered. the Government now refuse to admit into the Commonwealth colonists from countries with which, in recent, years, we have been at war. Only recently the Government passed legislation through this House imposing restrictions on immigration which will render it very unlikely indeed that desirable immigrants will be attracted to this country so long as those restrictions stand. instance ? insists on passing naturalization laws which must discourage desirable people from presenting themselves for naturalization; and generally, by their insane policy of exclusion, they are making this country as unattractive as possible to the people of other lands. I was not addressing myself for the moment to the position of any distinguished men of letters of the kind referred to by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) when he mentioned Mr Esmond. does a man of such distinguished parts come here, and so far as general administration of our immigration laws is concerned, it is not worth our while to particularize the case of any individual, since the vindictiveness and stupidity of .a policy which"" would exclude such a man are only part of the general mismanagement of the affairs of this country. I hope that, by means of a sane international policy, which I do not expect from the present Government, we shall be able to sustain our ideal of a White Australia. I believe that, when we finally abandon this baleful theory that we live by virtue of our guns and ships; when we are prepared to extend the right hand of fellowship to the people of every country in the world, whatever their colour may be; and to argue the question of immigration on sound lines of conciliation, we may hope to make Australia secure and to further indulge the hope that the Commonwealth will then be effectively occupied and substantially populated by people of the white races, people who deserve to retain it. -Before dealing with the amendment submitted by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan), I desire to refer to clause 2 of the Treaty. In the agreement of 1902, clause 2 provided that if one contracting party, in the defence of its territorial rights, became involved in war, the.'dther contracting party would remain neutral. But in the agreement [310] of 1905 and 1911 that particular section was considerably altered, inasmuch as it provided that, "" If by reason of an unprovoked attack or aggressive action, wherever arising-"" . That is, instead of keeping within the limits of the territory it goes further. It will go into the Pacific and into the Atlantic. It will go anywhere. It is not strictly confined to China or to Japan, or to India. Article II . , from which I have just quoted, is set forth in the agreement of 1911 thus:If by reason of an unprovoked attack or aggressive action, wherever arising, on the part of any other Power or Powers, either High Contracting Party should be involved in war in defence of its territorial rights or special interests mentioned in the preamble of this Agreement, the other High Contracting Only seldom Party will at once come to thc assistance of its Ally, and will conduct the war in common, and make peace in mutual agreement with it. The agreement as it at present stands cannot possibly be subscribed to by this Parliament or by the people of Australia, and most certainly not by the Government of this country. The enthusiastic protestations of the Government and their supporters, their general attitude regarding the White Australia policy, have been such as to preclude their subscription to anything in the nature of the terms of Article II . I am wondering what truth there is in that which is freely stated in Europe generally, and in America particularly, namely, that the many late converts to the White Australia policy have merely adopted that attitude for the purpose of working up the people of Australia into a frame of mind in which it may not be hard to get 30,000 or 40,000 Australian, troops sent into Asia. Sir Charles Rosenthal, speaking at Orange, New South Wales, some months ago; stated that he would not be at all surprised if within a few months Australian soldiers were participating in a war on the Indian frontier. Following' the publication of those remarks the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) asked the Treasurer ""( Sir Joseph Cook), who was at the time in charge of the House, whether it was a fact that Sir Charles, Rosenthal had made such a statement, whether he was in the employ of the .Commonwealth, and what authority he had so to speak. The Treasurer, in a more or less flippant reply, said he",80,Japan S Military Plan S Strict Compulsory Teai^Ing

346,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [11.47],"was not responsible for what Sir Charles Rosenthal might have said concerning the participation by Australian soldiers in a war on the Indian frontier. There are two facts outstanding in connection with the position in India. One is that the Indian Nationalist movement is determined to secure some kind of freedom from the present oppression exercised by the capitalists of Great Britain, and the other is that the British Government, representing British capitalists, are just as determined that there shall be no such measure of freedom afforded the peoples of India. And it is frankly stated in Europe, and even more frankly stated in America, in militarist circles, that there will be war in India shortly. Interrogations have emanated from London concerning the attitude of Australia in the matter of her participation, should war break out in India. It is said that the modus operandi will take the form of Afghan risings on the frontier, which will grow to such dimensions as to necessitate the use of large bodies of troops in that theatre. Due to the state of mind created' by the enthusiastic adulation of certain recent converts to the ""White Australia policy, the Australian people will be expected to say, ""Yes, is for God's sake let us fight in Asia."" It is quite freely American press, and in certain sections of the London press, that already military operations have been planned in India, that transportation plans have been prepared, and that Australian and New Zealand officers aTe already thereWhether they were sent with the cognisance of this Government I do not know, but would like to learn. When Sir Charles Rosenthal tells the people of Australia that he would not be surprised if within eighteen months we"" are fighting in India, and when we have these pertinent , observations in Europe and America, it ' is about time the people were informed exactly what is meant. I. should like to know from Ministers in this House whether it is a fact that there are Australian officers ready to take up their duties in India, and that it is intended to raise 40,000 soldiers in Australia to go to India. This matter will come before the Imperial Conference. vernment have been, already notified that the Indian question will be one of the Mr Blakeley. most important arising for discussion. I dare say the Prime Minister has given some thought to the attitude he will adopt on behalf of Australia with respect to any troubles developing in India. One can quite understand the necessity for getting troops other than British to go to India. In the first place, the British Government have more than sufficient trouble on their hands at Home. They are finding it increasingly difficult to get soldiers to go to Ireland. There has been something like a six months' recruiting campaign, and only the force of public opinion has prevented its continuance. Last month the authorities were appealing for troops for Ireland and for India. The industrialists of Great Britain are becoming more emphatic in their objection to British soldiers being sent to portions of the Empire to subdue possible risings or subjugate a section of the nation to which they belong. One can readily see that the massing of an army to go to India to suppress that nation would be extremely difficult. Hence an attempt will be made to drag Australia, willy nilly, into a conflict in India. Possibly this is merely something that has been discussed in certain circles in London and in Europe. Probably at has only been, an if Australia academic discussion, and the questions to be threatened by Asia, sent to Australia as to our opinion on such a proposal are also academic, stated in the having been sent merely with the idea of getting information. Probably the statement made by Sir Charles Rosenthal was merely for the edification of a few men who desired to continue their military career, but the sinister significance appears to be that the matter was discussed by an officer who occupied an important position in the Australian Imperial Force. A t the same time, statements are published in the American and European press on practically the same lines. Before this discussion closes, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) or a representative of the Government should inform this House and the people of Australia whether the very grave position which exists in India is to be discussed at the Imperial Conference, and, if so, what course the discussion will follow. It is saidI am asking for confirmation or denial-in London to-day that a campaign will very shortly be started in No doubt, the GoIndia, and we know that for %long time troops have been gathering there ostensibly for the purpose of preventing the natives from rising, and overthrowing the Government. The people are well organized, and any attempt to suppress a rising will result in a loss of a large number of British soldiers. We know oerfectly well that it is not so much for the good of India that the natives are being suppressed as it is for the aggrandisement of the people who have capital invested there, and which the British Government desire to protect. It would not, of course, be the first capitalistic war in which Australian soldiers had been engaged, and I do not suppose it would be the last, because so far as one can understand there has not been any war which has not been essentially capitalistic. I strongly protest against anything being done at the forthcoming Imperial Conference which will embroil Australia in any such quarrels, and I object to the manhood of Australia being transported overseas for the protection of interests other than Australian. When we are told that the White Australia policy is to be determined in India instead of in Australia, no doubt many of those recent converts to the policy will consider that they have achieved their object. Ih regard to the Anglo-Japanese causepeople lian Treaty, it is quite understandable that of the working class. the British Government, apart from the Dominion Governments, should enter into an agreement with Japan to protect convince them that they should vote for capitalistic interests. But when such a you.

The Prime Minister first said that Australia had to ratify the Treaty, and that it would be brought back to this House to be ratified; and then he said' that, irrespective of what this House did, the Treaty would go on. He cannot be pinned down to any statement. His speeoh was delightfully vague.

Some honourable members on the Ministerial side have said in unmistakable language that they are prepared to subscribe to an Imperial naval system. They1 claim that if the Empire is to have a navy it must be controlled by a central head. It is a fairly plausible argument, and under other conditions would be logical, but it is altogether a different question when the people of Australia are to be asked to get a fleet together and maintain it in peace; and have it taken away from them in war. In fact, during the last war our fleet was taken away, so that instead of Australian men-of-war being in our harbors, Japanese cruisers were substituted for them. I am against the Prime Minister going to the Imperial Conference, because he is not truly representative of Australia. Neither he nor any member of his Ministry has laid on the table a f u l l statethat the present position is grave in the ment of the questions to be discussed at the Conference. I am opposed to Australia entering into any system of an Imperial Navy. I am quite convinced that, notwithstanding the protestations we have heard with regard to the White Australia policy, and notwithstanding the many enthusiastic rejections of the points made by this side, Australia, by virtue of the fact that its Prime Minister is attendafford to incur any fresh obligations in ing this Conference, will find itself, whether we like it or not, with yokes upon it which it will take years to remove. a.m.] After having listened very patiently to the many contributions to this debate, I realize the gravity of the position facing the people of Australia involved in the question at present demanding the consideration of honourable members. The consequences may be more far-reaching, perhaps, than the great bulk of the people comprehend. If the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) is to be allowed to use' his own discretion upon many matters of an Imperial character in which Australia is to be involved, I am satisfied that before many years have passed the people of this country will regret that he was ever intrusted with the responsibility of representing them at an Imperial Conference. We are told that there are two great factors to be considered at the forthcoming Conferencethe ratification of the Treaty between Great Britain and Japan and the future defence policy of the British Empire. Australia is evidently to be regarded as accepting her share of the obligation which will be imposed upon the JSmpire in connection with these two matters without her people being afforded an opportunity to fully understand the merits of the proposals to which she will be committed. The Prime Minister has told us that we are confronted with a position which is grave in the extreme. "" What are we to do?"" he asks. ""What is our policy to be? We depend for our very existence upon the maintenance of control by Britain. Britain says that she cannot longer afford to maintain the Navy at its relative pre-war strength, and calls upon the Dominions to consider the question, and presumably to contribute their share."" I ask the right honourable gentleman what reason there is for assuming extreme. After the greatest war upon record, a war which has burdened the Empire with a staggering debt, we are told within three years of the signing of the armistice that we are threatened with another war. If that be so, the people of this country should realize that they have been tricked'in regard to the part which Australia played in the war. To-day we are so involved financially that we cannot order to provide a more adequate defence for the Commonwealth. We have a war debt of £350,000,000, and our public debt to 30th June, 1920, totals more than £405,000,000.

373,Mr Bell,"My country is satisfiedand Japan as would include the TJnited States of America, and be entirely satisfactory to that country Unless that be so, as sure as night follows day we shall be involved in a struggle the consequences of which we cannot estimate. I have no doubt that the question of a White Australia will be raised, and that that very laudable ""sentiment will be exploited, as many other laudable sentiments were during the war. It will be very interesting, in the future history of the world, and of Australia in particular, to observe how public men were at this time prepared to take advantage of the greatest of all Australian sentiments in a time of international crisis. I desire to say a few words on some other matters which are likely to be discussed at the Imperial Conference, and in which Australian interests may be involved. The Prime Minister, on the present occasion, has endeavoured to make us believe that he is opposed to Imperial Federation-that he feels it would be most undesirable to entertain such an idea. But while he tries to allay fear and suspicion in this connection, the deliberations at the Imperial Conference will very largely determine what questions will engage the attention of Imperial and Dominion statesmen when they come to deal with the constitutional aspects of the Empire. I find that in June, 1916, the Prime Minister, when speaking in London, said of Imperial FederationThis is a policy for the whole British Empire, which should cover every page of our national, social, and economic life. Yet he would have us believe now that he has no desire to involve Australia in any form of Imperial Federation. As a people we have great need to fear it, because of the manner in which it would be likely to intrude on our self-governing rights. Imperialism and Democracy do not present merely a subject for academic controversy over forms of government, but represent a basic division of the publio mind regarding the whole theory of government. Nationalism and Imperialism are essentially capitalistic, in that they rest upon an economic foundation, and are inspired by the desire of the profiteering agencies for wider spheres of exploitation. there has already been impressed upon the minds of some of those who have visited our shores a feeling that any proposal to relieve Australia of its self governing rights, and subordinate this country to a form of Imperial Federation, does not meet with our approval. Mr B. K . Long, the Dominion'editor of the Times, who was in Australia about September last, says° The. Australian is jealous of the right to govern himself and is resentful of dictation from outside. . Imperialism in the conventional sense is most unpopular. I hope the Prime Minister will not forget that impression which Mr Long received, but will realize that Australia is for the f u ll rights of seK-government to the Dominions with no form o£ Imperial Federation. Mr Long further says that wherever one goes in Australia it is only necessary to mention Imperial Federation to find the instant resentment of Australians to dictation from Downingstreet. In this connection it is interesting to refer to an incident at a banquet to the Prince of Wales, held in Adelaide during the recent Royal visit. Mr Barwell, the then Premier of South Australia, who is certainly an Imperialist, said that some unitary authority for the Empire was desirable. The newspaper account of what occurred said that the remark was received "" w i th chilling silence."" That"" chilling silence "" exactly represents the feeling of the people of Australia towards any foTm of government in which their voice cannot effectively be heard. We have learned to value our self-governing rights as a Dominion, and we hold that we have established our claim to govern ourselves; so far from assenting to any curtailment of our powe'S, we regard it as essential that they should be widened. Instead of being, subject to the veto of Imperial councils, Australia should have full jurisdiction over its own affairs. I do not say that with any intention of being disloyal to the best interests of the Empire. I respect our association with and relation to Great Britain, but I am certainly not going to be allured by the so called glories of Empire, when I learn that there are to-day, .according to Board of Trade estimates, 3,000,000 people on the verge of starvation. A nation's or Empire's true greatness is not to be meaI am pleased to find that sured by geography or commerce, but by the happiness, contentment, and righteous inclinations of the people constituting that we are reasonably assured of ample pronation or Empire. AU I say is that whilst we, as Australians, desire to associate ouroperate in a cordial manner with other selves in the most cordial manner with the United Kingdom, we are not involved in any obligation to subordinate our rights to an Imperial Council. During recent menths, I have noticed how the Imperial financiers have endeavoured to use their influence over Australian affairs of State. When the Labour Premiers of two Australian States approached them for financial accommodation, they were subjected to certain embarrassments, and were requested to repeal certain legislative enactments of their States before they could receive the accommodation they required. I am pleased that the Premier of Queensland ( Mr Theodore) was sufficiently seized of the importance of retainBoer War demonstrates the truth of my ing to the people of his State their self governing rights to refuse the assistance of Empire was fighting in that contest by the London financiers on such conditions. The strength of public character shown by Mr Theodore in that case might well be emulated by other public men who may require to go abroad on missions connected with the affairs of the States or the Commonwealth. to-day, from an Imperial stand-point, is to vest immense powers in a central authority to which all other interests are subordinated. perialism is to invest those powers in the people themselves, and that is exactly what the amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney proposes. Instead of submitting these important matters to a small body of men seated round an Imperial Conference table, and perhaps subjecting the citizens of Australia to proposals with which they are not in sympathy, we contend that the people must have a direct opportunity of voicing their opinions on them. thc Australian Labour party justifies its claim to be an Australian movement. What is required .in Australia to-day amongst our public men is a more correct estimate of their position as Australians. We want better Australians, among our public men than we have now. We want men who are prepared to place the interests of Australia first, and to recognise that their first duty as representatives of the people of this great continent is to those people. Then, when Afr. Makin. tection for our own people, if we can coportions of what is known as the British Empire, we shall be only too happy to do so, but I am not going to be a party, nor is the movement to which I belong prepared in any respect to be a party, to subordinating the interests of Austi'alia to any Imperial Council, or to any Imperial statesmen. When I read the pages of history, I find that many Imperial statesmen have had very little sympathy with the sentiment of a White Australia, and that they would De prepared at the first opportunity, if it paid them, to subordinate that principle and involve us in an embarrassing position. What happened in South Africa after the contention. Although loyal support was given to the cause for which the British many citizens of various parts of the Empire who went to South Africa to fight, what was their recompense and reward? Only to see a flood of coolies and Chinese labour let into the South African mines.

May I refer my honourable friends to the permission given for indenThe position taken up by tured coolie labour to F i j i , and the startling disclosures in the Imperial Bluebook. The way in which we find to-day the best interests of national life subordinated, and even prostituted at times, for financial gain, proves to me that even a nation's soul will be bought and sold by those capitalists and financial agencies who have as their representatives and agents many men who sit in the Parliament of Great Britain. Their object is the aggrandizament of British capitalism, and the individual British citizen is to them no more",87,Japan S Military Plan S Strict Compulsory Teai^Ing
