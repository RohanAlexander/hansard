WAR SERVICE HMS. day the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron), drew my attention to a press statementregarding war service homes. I have now ascertained that the number of reverted homes at the 31st May, 1931, equals 531, of which number 294 were occupied by tenants. Various reasons have been given for the abandonment of homes by purchasers, the principal being:-(a ) availability of other homes at cheaper rentals; (6) intention to share home occupied by another family with the object of reducing rental outlay; (c) returning to parents and living rent free. The Commission has provided 36,808 homes for ex-service men, and having regard to the present difficult times the small number of reverted homes possibly demonstrates the extent of the assistance given by the Government to those purchasers who are unemployed and who are unable to meet their obligations. The total instalments due by purchasers at the 31st May, amount to £11,476,392, and of this sum, £239,077 was unpaid. The arrears, therefore, equal only 2.0S per cent. The following papers were presented:Post and Telegraph Act-Regulation s Amended-Statutory Rules 1931, No. 80. Wine Industry-Report by the Honourable John Gunn, Commonwealth Director of Department of Trade and Customs. Export Guarantee Act-Return showing assistance granted to 30th June, 1931.

Notwithstanding anything contained in any other act . . . all salaries of officers and employees, whether such salary is payable under special appropriation or otherwise, shall be reduced by thirty-four pounds per annum in the case of adult male officers or employees and of married officers or employees who are not adults, by twenty-two pounds ten shillings per annum in the case of adult female officers, and by seventeen pounds per annum in the case of unmarried officers or employees who are not adults. Senate's amendment -Omit the words "" Twenty-two pounds ten shillings"" and insert in lieu thereof the words "" Twenty-eight pounds."" ter) [10.47] I move That the amendment be agreed to. This amendment was made to remove an anomaly. When the bill was before this committee it was proposed to make a reduction of £34 with respect to all salaries of male and female officers, but it was pointed out that, under the cost of living adjustments, the rates had not been increased as much for females as for males. It was agreed to remove the injustice, but the amendment that was made was wrong. The Public Service Board has drawn attention to the necessity to correct what was done.

36,Mr Scttlliw (Yarra,"Prime Minissame class of work; under it the difference between the respective salaries is maintained at £6. unable to accept the explanation given by the Prime Minister. The bill originally provided for a reduction of £34 for both male and female employees. We urged at that stage that the margin of difference between the salary reduction of male and female officers should be one-third. That was agreed to by the Minister in charge of the measure, and I believe that it gave satisfaction to the officers of the Public Service organizations that were handling the matter. If the bill were now under complete reconsideration in this chamber, exemptions would probably be provided on the basis adopted in Victoria. Under the Victorian scheme the minimum is fixed at £26 a year higher than under this bill. I ask the committee to reject this amendment. Service generally has been heavily penalized already under this measure. Under an award, it agreed to a reduction of wages due to the annual adjustment on account of the cost of living three months earlier than the reduction would ordinarily have applied. The Public Service representatives left Canberra in the belief that this anomaly had been corrected, and the action taken by the Government in submitting this amendment in another place is provocative, and will, I believe, make the dissatisfaction more general than it now is.. ter) [10.50] -Prio r to 1924 the salaries of males and females rose and fell in accordance with the variations in the cost of living, and there was no differentiation between them. Prom 1924 the increase due to the rise in the cost of living was £9 in the case of males and £7 in the case of females. The increases were £6 and £4 respectively in 1927 and 1930. It was felt, when the bill was before this committee, that the ratio of £6 to £4 observed when the salaries were going up ought to be retained when the salaries were coming down, but that principle disregarded the fact that up to 1924 the respective salaries had risen on the same scale. Owing to the hurry with which the calculation was made, a mistake occurred which was not discovered until after the bill had left this chamber, so that it was necessary to insert this amendment in the Senate. The following illustration will explain the position. Take the case of a male officer and a female officer, who, on the 30th June, 1924, were receiving £250 per annum. By the cost of living adjustments, the salary of the male officer was then raised by £21, making the total £271, and that of the female officer by £15, making the salary £265. There was a difference of £6 in the cost of living adjustments. If the male rate were reduced by £34, and the female rate by £22 10s., as originally proposed, the salary of the male officer would be £237 and that of the female officer £242 10s., although both were doing the same class of work and under the same classification. Since there was a difference of £6 in the cost of living adjustment, we should retain that difference at the present time. The object of the amendment is to avoid the dissatisThe Public faction that would result from an inequitable adjustment. Motion agreed to. Clause 12(1.) The last two preceding sections shall not apply to officers and employees to whom this section applies and the salaries of such officers and employees shall be subject to reductions as follows:( i i ) Where the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration has made an award prescribing the rates of pay, salary or wages payable to any class of employee specified in the award and that or any other award of that court provides for reductions in rates of pay, salary or wages based upon the index-numbers, and for a further reduction in rates of pay, salary or wages at the rate of ten per centum per annum, the salary of any employee of that class to whom the award is applicable shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the award, and no further reduction of the salary of the employee shall be effected under this act except to such extent, if any, as the Minister, upon the receipt of a recommendation of the committee, directs; and Senate's amendment -Omit "" and "" at end of paragraph ( i i ) and add the following:"" Provided that the salary of an adult male employee, or of a married male employee who is not an adult, shall not be reduced under this sub-paragraph below the equivalent of one hundred and eightytwo pounds per annum unless the Minister so d irects; and "".",12,Financi Al Emergency Bill

38,Mr Scullin (Yarra,"Prime MinisThat the amendment be agreed to. At the end of the proposed proviso a discretionary power is given to the Minister which seems to introduce an entirely new principle. The Minister would have power to reduce the salary of a married male officer, who is not an adult, below £182 per annum. The committee should have some explanation of this amendment before it accepts so extraordinary a principle. ter) [10.56] -The object of the amendoient is to prevent the award being re-iuced below £182. The amendment affords additional protection; otherwise the salary might be reduced below the now accepted basic wage. The proviso was inserted to meet any special case in which the rate was already below £182. -It seems to me that the proviso should be amended by omitting the words "" unless the Minister so directs."" No male adult employee should be asked to accept less than £182, which is much below the basic wage in the States. I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) that the amendment would give the Minister too great a power. A provision of this description is far too dangerous. tor Defence) [11.0] -The honourable onember for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) and the honourable member for Werriwa( Mri i) where the Commonwealth Court of Lazzarini) are labouring under a misapprehension. The object of the amendment is to improve the clause to which it refers. When the clause was passed by chis chamber it was thought that no awards had fallen below £182 per annum, but it was found upon investigation that the wages of certain employees of the Commonwealth covered by outside awards bad actually been reduced to £176 and £179 per annum. Originally the clause conferred no discretionary power upon the Minister. If awards fell below £182 per annum the Minister was obliged to take notice of the fact, and to act accordingly but now a discretionary power is given him. In the absence of such a provision he would be obliged to take into account certain extra payments in different industries, such as merit money and so on. The Government has no intention of reducing the basic wage applying to the Public Service. I still cannot see why the words "" unless directed by the Minister"" should be retained. We are told that the Government desires to ensure to its own servants a basic wage of £3 10s. a week, but it seems to me that the inclusion of these words will make possible a reduction of this amount to any extent. In my opinion, the plan has been arranged to allow wages to fall to 40s., 35s., or even 30s. a week. If the words "" unless directed by the Minister"" are left out the Government will be able to reduce wages in this way. stand plain language, and that is the meaning of my proviso, in my opinion. member to read the clause as it left this chamber. about the proviso and not the clause. ter) [11.7] -The clause, as it left this chamber, reads as follows:The last two preceding sections shall not apply to officers and employees to whom this section applies, and the salaries of such officers and employees shall be subject to reduction as follow:Conciliation and Arbitration has made an award prescribing the rates of pay, salary orwages payable to any class of employee specified in the award and that or any other award of that court provides for reductions in rates of pay, salary or wages based upon the index-numbers, and for a further reduction in rates of pay, salary or wages at the rate of ten per centum per annum, the Balary of any employee of that class to whom the award is applicable shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the award, and no further reduction of the salary of the employee shall be effected under this act except to such extent, if any, as the Minister, upon the receipt of a recommendation Of the committee, directs.",13,Financi Al Emergency Bill

The effect of the provision is to give the Minister a discretion so that, notwithstanding anything that the court may determine, the wages of these employees may not fall below £182 per annum. The need for this ""discretionary power is due to the fact that some existing awards have already fallen below £182 per annum. Government to continue to pay these lower rates? in this measure to increase or decrease any awards. Some employees of the Commonwealth are working under outside awards which are at present below £182 per annum. This is so in the metal trades, for instance. If the clause were left as it is the Government would be compelled to take notice of any new awards of less than £182 per annum given by the court. It is desired, however, that no more Commonwealth employees shall be obliged to work for less than £182 per annum. The clause will be vastly improved if honourable members will accept the amendment -There is undoubtedly some ambiguity agree that if the clause is amended in the way proposed it will be improved. In its original form it would have compelled the Government to reduce the wages of its employees below £182 per annum if the court made any additional awards for wages below that figure. The Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley) has assured us that there are certain adult or married male employees of the Commonwealth receiving as little as £176 or £179 per annum, which is less than the £182 which I understand to be the basic wage under the rehabilitation plan. My complaint is that even if the amendment is agreed to the Minister may still take notice of any future adjustments below £182 per annum, although the declared intention of the legislature is that £182 per annum, or its equivalent purchasing power, shall be the basic wage. The Prime Minister has said that it is not the intention of the Government, under this legislation, to increase to £182 per annum the wages which are at present below that rate. under this measure.

Attorney-General say that, and I do not think that his remark is recorded in Hansard. ment is, as a rule, regarded as the mere expression of an opinion; but this resolution will be an invitation to the Parliament at Westminster to pass very important legislation affecting the powers of this Parliament, and, so far as that can be done, the powers of the Imperial Parliament itself. The question, therefore, arises whether this procedure is appropiatc for a matter of such profound importance. described as being designed to bring the legal status of the dominions into accord with the actual constitutional position. The Attorney-General referred to the resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1926, which was in these termsThey are autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. That resolution is generally known as the Balfour Declaration. The report of the Imperial Conference of 1926, which I attended, went on to say that existing legislative and judicial forms admittedly did not wholly conform to the position so described, and that it was desirable to inquire how far changes should be made to alter the legal position in conformity with the constitutional position. Consequently, a committee was set up to inquire into, report upon, and make recommendations concerning various matters, including the competence of dominion parliaments to give their legislation extra-territorial operation, and the principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity Act. The declaration of the Imperial Conference in 1926 was that the dominions were fully self-governing political entities. This was a recognition of the existing position. There was no doubt, in Australia at least, as to the reality and extent of our self-government, because we knew perfectly well that, whatever the legal position, the supreme legislative Statute of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Westminster. power of the Imperial Parliament would never be exercised contrary to our will. So far as Australia was concerned, I did not hear the nothing called for a legal change, because no real difficulty existed. In certain other parts of the Empire, particularly A resolution of this Parliathe Irish Free State, South Africa, and, to some extent, Canada, there was opposition to the maintenance of the existing formal legal position. The committee of experts was charged with the duty of reporting upon possible legal changes to bring about a closer correspondence between the legal and constitutional positions. As a result of the work of that committee-whic h was substantially a committee of lawyers-cer The proposals have been tain proposals were made which were approved by the Imperial Conference of 1930, and some of them are now before us in this motion. The motion is divided into six clauses, which should be considered separately. Speaking generally, the object of the motion is to extend dominion legislative powers in certain directions, and to limit the power of the United Kingdom in relation to the matters as to which the powers of the dominion parliaments are extended. Of course, the Parliament of the United Kingdom is not able to limit or divest itself of its legislative powers. Whatever act it passes it can, technically, repeal or amend immediately; but the constitutional position is altered when the Imperial Parliament deliberately declares that it will not exercise certain powers which it possesses. A remarkable piece of legislation was passed by the Parliament at Westminster in the reign of George III . , during the American revolution, wherein that Parliament declared that it would never tax the colonies. At that time there was a contest between Great Britain and her American colonies, largely over the principle that subjects should not be taxed unless represented in the taxing parliament. The British Parliament passed an act declaring that it would never impose taxation on the colonists so long as they were not represented there. That act, of course, was not legally binding on succeeding parliaments, and the Parliament which passed it could have repealed it ; but it had a profound constitutional significance, recognizing",16,Statute Of Westminster Dominion And Merchant Shipping Legislation Imperial Conference Resolutions

We are now asked to make a departure from that practice, and to endeavour to express in a rigid legal formula what is perfectly well understood as a practical, political convention, a convention which causes no difficulty or trouble in working. I should, therefore, prefer very much to leave things as they are. inevitably become the subject of legal interpretation. honourable members to follow me in an analysis of these very important words. First, it must be remembered that we are living under a federal constitution, and that the Commonwealth and the States each has a place in a federal system which depends upon a division of legislative powers between the Commonwealth and the States. This resolution does not affect, is not intended to affect, and certainly should not affect, the position of the States in relation to the Commonwealth or to the United Kingdom. The States have not been represented at any of the conferences from which this resolution has ultimately emerged, and they cannot be compromised or affected in any way by this legislation. I am sure that all honourable members will accept that proposition. I now ask them to examine the words of the proposed clause. It appears to me that these words have been drafted without -a sufficiently acute and active realization of the legal and constitutional position under a federal system. The words areNo act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this act shall extend or be deemed to extend to a dominion as part of the law of that dominion unless, &c. What is the meaning of "" dominion "" ? In relation to Australia it means the Commonwealth of Australia. What is the meaning of "" the Commonwealth of Australia""? The Commonwealth of Australia is an ambiguous term. Eor example, in our Constitution, covering clause 3 provides that "" the Queen may 11401 declare or proclaim "" that the people of N certain colonies have united, or shall be united in a federal commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia. "" Commonwealth of Australia "" there means a political entity, a political organization, for discharging legislative, executive and judicial powers. Covering clause 6 contains another example of the use of this word. There we find the phrase that certain of the colonies are "" part of the Commonwealth."" The States are part of the Commonwealth; that is, in the territorial sense. In that clause "" Commonwealth"" means a territorial area, namely, Australia, in the geographical sense. When we come to clause 3 of this resolution what is meant by saying that "" no act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this act shall extend or be deemed to extend to the Commonwealth of Australia, as part of the law of that Commonwealth unless, &c."" ? The States, as I have said, are unaffected by this legislation. They are entitled to preserve such relations as they like with the British Parliament. We do not control the relations between the States and the rest of the Empire. They have independent relations. accepted. ject of conjecture. ample. Take, for instance, the criminal la% v of the Commonwealth as applied to Australia as a whole. Very little of the Australian criminal law is federal law; practically all of it is State law. This Parliament has not the power to legislate, speaking generally, with respect to crime. Our criminal law is chiefly State legislation. Certain Imperial statutes, such as the Fugitive Offenders Act and the Jurisdiction in Territorial Waters Act, apply to the geographical area known as Australia, and are important in relation to the effective administration of State laws. This Parliament can, under its' immigration power, deal with the influx of criminals, but is not able to legislate upon the subjects affected by the Fugitive Offenders Act and the Jurisdiction in Territorial Waters Act.

100,_ Mr Latham,"I think the declaraWhat is meant hy "" that dominion "" ? Generally it means, in practice, the executive government of the dominion. I propose to ask the House by requiring that the request and consent shall be made and given by the Parliament and by the Government. We are asked to do something very remarkable. The proposal is that no legislation shall be enaoted for a dominion by the Imperial Parliament unless "" that dominion"" has requested and consented to it. When a request is received from the government of a dominion for the enactment of certain legislation, is the British Government to go behind that request to ascertain what degree of support it commands? It appears to me that the British Government would be in a very difficult position if it were to cross-examine on a request made by a dominion government pursuant to this statute. I am afraid that if the Statute of Westminster, which purports to define and settle inter-governmental practice, is passed in its present form, the practice of the British Government will be to accept, without examination, any request from the government of a dominion, and to legislate accordingly. That will mean a marked change from the existing procedure. At present, there is a general understanding that the supreme legislative power of the British Parliament will not be used unless that is .substantially desired by the people of the dominion concerned. That is a loose power, to be applied according to circumstances. I say, with hesitation, but with a sense of responsibility, that in the unsettled economic and financial condition of the world at the present time, and in view of what may happen in the next few years, recourse to the supreme legislature of the British Empire may be a valuable privilege, especially having regard to the legal complications of the Australian federal system. statute is passed as drafted, a request by the government of a dominion will be final. come from the Parliament. tion. The Government of the day might mitted a piece of legislation .to this Parbona fide regard a certain matter of liament and it was rejected, does -the policy as vital to the well-being of the Commonwealth. In regard to monetary policy, for instance, widely divergent views are held by members in this chamto amend that provision ber, whilst the Senate is directly opposed to certain government proposals. If the statute were passed, the Government could request the Imperial Parliament to legislate as the Government wished, and so override both the Opposition in this chamber and the Senate. I do not .say that the Government would do that, but no government should be able to do it. In extreme circumstances, there might be a strong temptation to a government to resprt to this power. Unless the statute is amended, I am afraid that the British Government will often be embarrassed, because it will practically have to legislate in accordance with every request made by the government of a dominion. I prefer to leave things as they are. This clause is not required, and the Statute would be better without it. that we have no authority to insist upon the British Parliament passing any act; in the last r.esort it must exercise its own discretion. I agree that it probably would act at the request of the executive government of tiie dominion; and I should hope so. prepared to entrust any government with the power of obtaining legislation by a mere request to the British Parliament. jected legislation arising out of the declaration of the equality of the. status of the Mother Country and the dominions.

The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) suggested that a measure which had been rejected by this Parliament might be passed by the British Parliament. was a party to such an action would run the risk of passing out of existence. At the present time there is no possibility of that happening; but, if this statute is passed, it appears to me that the only practice that could be adopted in Great Britain would be to refuse to look behind the request of the government of the day. As the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has indicated, to deal with dominions in the same way as foreign countries, and to regard the government as representing the people, without looking behind the request, would be too dangerous, and I am not prepared to accept such a proposal. orable member for Werriwa has been left under the impression that there may be a motion of appeal to the British Parliament against a decision of this Parliament, whereas, in truth and in fact, the general scheme of this proposal is that no legislation of the British Parliament shall operate in Australia without the consent of its people. minion "" I am proposing to insert the words "" parliament and government"".

Should this clause be accepted, there should be a method of obtaining the concurrence of a dominion parliament in any Imperial legislation applying to the dominion.

124,Mr Latham,"There was a generalof the said Parliament adopting any provision of this act may provide that the adoption shall have effect either as from the commencement of this Hct or us from such later date as may he specified by the adopting act. I have circulated an amendment that a similar provision should be included, so that the statute shall not come into operation in the Commonwealth until, and then only in so far as, this Parliament has adopted its provisions. Let me refer to another aspect of the matter, with a view to further extending the powers of this Parliament. On looking at clause 2, it will be seen that it is proposed that the Colonial Laws Validity Act shall no longer extend to a dominion, as distinct from the states or provinces constituting part of a dominion; and it is provided that the powers of the parliament of a dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend any act, rule, or regulation of the British Parliament extending to that dominion. But there is no power, so far as I can see, conferred upon this Parliament to amend the Statute of Westminster itself, if passed, or to repeal it. If the statute is passed by the Imperial Parliament, it provides that a dominion parliament is to have full power to repeal or amend other Imperial legislation extending to it. This Parliament should have power, at least, to repeal the Statute of Westminster itself, so far as it relates to Australia. Other wise, the statute, while conferring powei to repeal any British legislation apply ing to Australia, will have the unique characteristic of being itself unrepealable. Therefore, I propose to add to the clause the following provision:and the Parliament of the Commonwealth may, at any time, repeal any provision of this act which has been adopted by the said Parliament. I think that we ought to have that right, although we may never desire to exercise it. Why should such a clause as this be riveted upon us indefinitely? that it applies to us, why should we not have the right to repeal it? exercise our enlarged powers, in our discretion. of clause 4 is essential, and unobjectionable. It readsNothing in this act shall be deemed to confer any power to repeal or alter the Constitution or the Constitution Act of the Commonwealth of Australia otherwise than in accordance with the law existing before the commencement of this act. The second paragraph is as follows:Nothing in this act shall be deemed to authorize the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia to make laws on any matter within the authority of the States of Australia, not being a matter within the authority of the Parliament or Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. The object is apparent; but I suggest that there should be an addition, in these termsNothing in the Statute of Westminster shall be deemed to authorize the Parliament or the Government of the Commonwealth to request or consent to the enactment of any act by the Parliament of the United Kingdom on any matter which is within the authority of the States of Australia, not being a matter within the authority of the Parliament or the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. In other words, this Parliament should have no licence or right to invite the British Parliament to legislate on matters which are exclusively within the State sphere. That ought to be stated plainly. rights, and do not lay claim to them. place the matter beyond doubt, ou account of the generality of the phraseology used in clause 3, which refers to laws which "" extend to a dominion "". Clause5 providesNotwithstanding anything in the Interpretation Act 1889, the expression ""Colony"" shall not, in any act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this act, include a dominion or any province or state forming part of a. dominion. I am unable to see why we should concern ourselves whether the "" colony "" includes "" state"". Sof a r as Australia is concerned, the words "" or state "" ought to be omitted. We are concerned only w it h matters in the federal sphere falling within the powers of the Government and the Parliament of the Commonwealth. comes into conflict with clause 3, after all, because a dominion, geographically, in cludes states.

Nothing is gained by the provisions in those sections.

I approve also of the proposal with respect to Colonial Courts of Admiralty, although I regret that the opportunity was not taken to clear up the dubious and ambiguous position in Australia in relation to admiralty jurisdiction, as disclosed by the decision of the High Court in the case of John Sharp& Sons v. The Ship Katherine Machall reported at 34, CJLR. 420. All the States are exercising admiralty jurisdiction. The judges of the States have for many years heard admiralty matters; but, in view of the decision of the High Court, I doubt whether a State has any real authority in admiralty matters. It was held by the High Court that the Commonwealth is a British possession for the purposes of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, and that, therefore, it may holdColonial Courts of Admiralty; but surely it necessarily follows that the States cannot hold such courts, although they have certainly been exercising this jurisdiction for many years. position will arise in this connection. As this Parliament is unable to cure the matter by legislation, I am sorry it was not discussed at the Imperial Conference with a view to clarifying the position. The remainder of the motion is in the form of recitals. The first paragraph of the recitals is practically a repetition of clause 3 of the schedule. I consider that both clause 3 of the schedule and paragraph 1 of the recitals should be omitted. The final paragraph in the recitals, I think which is also the final paragraph of the motion, relates to the succession to the throne, and the royal style and titles, and provides thatAny alteration in the law touching the succession to the throne or the royal style and titles shall hereafter require the assent unwell of the parliaments of all the dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. istic examination of the relations between the various parts of the Empire has been made, and that such an issue has been raised.

However, that is a question 'that one oan hardly discuss under existing circumstances.

He has given honourable members a much clearer perception of the effect of the motion. I regret that there is no provision for such far-reaching proposals as those now under consideration to be referred to a committee of the Some day a serious House for examination and report.

134,Mr Coleman (Reid) [12.35],"1object of the statute is to give legal form to the declaration of the equality of status of the various dominions which was made at the 1926 Imperial Conference. But the giving of this legal form to that declaration must, in the future, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed out, impart an element of rigidity into the interpretation of the Constitution which may not be found in practice to operate as well as the present system operates. declaration of an existing condition. few words, with the point to which I wish specially to refer. As a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, Australia has a peculiar status. Canadian constitution provides for a more unitary system of government than the Australian Constitution, while the South African Constitution provides for a wholly unitary system as does that of New Zealand. In Australia we have six sovereign States within the federal union, and although this statute purports to give us complete constitutional authority, it does not give us such authority. Even though a majority of the people of Australia should declare their desire to alter the character of our Constitution, it could not be done. of the schedule were omitted. even though we may alter certain part3 of our Constitution, we have no power to alter the first six sections of it, which are part of an Imperial statute. There is no provision in our Constitution for the alteration of those sections. member contend that we cannot alter the basis of the federation unless an act is passed by the Imperial Parliament? which is the centre of a very great legal controversy at the moment. I do not intend, as a layman, to express an opinion on a subject, which is now engaging attention of leading King's Counsel. The political aspect of this matter is of great importance in view of the relation of New South Wales to the other Australian States at the moment. While the Statute of Westminster vests in us, for all practical purposes, complete political sovereignty as a federal union, we shall still have the State parliaments limited by certain vice-regal powers expressed in letters patent and royal instructions dating back to 1901. It is generally admitted that with our present constitutional status the Governor General must act upon the advice of his advisors, whereas the State Governors have a discretionary power. As a matter of fact, under letters patent and royal instructions they have a considerable measure of discretionary power. Whether this is desirable or not will depend upon one's point of view at the moment; but it is surely paradoxical, and indicative of our peculiar status as a member of the British Empire, that while The the Governor General of the Commonwealth may act only on the advice of his advisors the Governors of the States may exercise a considerably Avider discretion. It is a pity that attention was not directed to this point at the Imperial Conference. As it is, Australia is still in a more or less ambiguous position. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition directed attention to the important legal complications that may ensure owing to the fact that provision has not been made for the extraterritorial operation in Australia of criminal jurisdiction. It seems to me that while the statute represents a remarkable advance in the evolution of Imperial relationships in a political sense, it may lead to complications. It certainly does not cover, in a comprehensive way, many problems that have arisen owing to Australia's peculiar constitutional system as a federal union. Sitting suspended from 1241 to 2.15 p.m. -This motion, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has stated, marks the arrival of a new era in the history of the constitutional relations of the dominions and Britain, and is of immense importance to Australia and to the Empire. I disagree entirely with the principles underlying the motion. To attempt to crystallize Empire relations in a legal formula is an act of supreme folly. They rest upon two principles which are antagonistic: the complete autonomy of the parts, and the unity of the whole.

141,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [2.15].,"and unique in the history of mankindworks at all, is due to the genius of the British people for self-government. In the hands of any other race it would have certainly failed. We are considering an attempt to give legislative sanction to resolutions of cabinets and conferences made during and since the war. These set out in terms leaving no room for doubt, that the old order of things has passed away, that the overlordship of B r it a in has now been replaced by equality of status-no t of stature-of every dominion with Britain. The dominions, or most of them, still regard Britain as their mother, and freely and gladly acknowledge her pre-eminence. This equality of status, which has been freely granted by Britain, with it implications of immense importance. If the powers now vested in the dominions arc exercised unwisely, the disruption of the Empire is inevitable. I have opposed every attempt to reduce to writin g the constitutional relations of Britain and the dominions. It has been stated' freely in this debate that this motion springs out of the resolutions of the 1926 conference; but that statement is misleading. The 1926 conference added nothing to the constitutional position as it then stood. Different opinions were expressed as to what had been done, and it is not without interest to quote some of them. On his return to Australia, Mr Bruce saidThere is really nothing new in the status of the British dominions as a result of the recent conference. Mr Mackenzie K in g saidI believe that the work of the conference will take its place in history beside those charters which have stood in one form or another for a larger freedom. While General Hertzog was of the opinion thatThe British Empire now exists as a name only. When opinions so divergent can be expressed in regard to a set of circumstances which, it is now generally admitted, did not in substance add one tittle to the powers of the dominions, or widen the ambit of their legislative or general jurisdiction, it is evident that the attempt to reduce to a formula the conventions and other instruments that govern the constitutional Mr JIughrs. relations between Britain and . the dominions is, to say the least, an experiment of doubtful value. The 1926 conference, as I have said, added nothing to the constitutional powers of the dominions. A t the 1921 conference an attempt was made to summon a constitutional conference for the purpose of setting out in written form the constitutional relations as they then stood. A number of drafts were submitted to Cabinet, and I shall quote from my work on Empire relations, The Splendid Adventure, page 145, my opinions in that matter. 1 laid it down thatThese drafts arc in the main Declarations of Bights recognized by existing practice. carries Unlessi t is contended that these rights or any of them are in danger, such declarations are unnecessary, and serve no useful purpose. On the contrary, they may do much harm. They relate to the distribution of powers vested in the dominions. . . . Originally all the powers now vested in the dominions were exercised by Britain. The present distribution is the result of voluntary surrender to the dominions by Britain of some of the powers inherent in her as a sovereign power. This surrender has heretofore been made by(a) Statutes of the British Parliament creating dominion parliaments and governments, and defining the ambit of their legislative and executive powers. (b) In despatches and communications passing between the British and Colonial and Dominion Governments. . (o) By conferences of the representative* of Britain and of the dominions. The distribution of powers had been gradual, extending over a long period of time. During the last few years the distribution has proceeded more rapidly. It has never been the practice to attempt to set out in writing the precise limits of the powers surrendered by Britain to the dominions or those retained by her. The reasons against any attempt to delimit the respective spheres of power and define the constitutional relatione between Britain and the dominions are obvious and overwhelming. The great merit of the constitutional relationship existing be. twjeen Britain and the dominions is, and always has been, its elasticity. To this is .due its wonderful adaption to changing circumstances arising from the growth and development of the dominions. To attempt to substitute for this a rigid constitution or to define or set out in writing the relationship between the dominions is most undesirable. . . . As things now stand, it is impossible in practice to reconcile that complete autonomy which the dominions possess -whic h they exercise by virtueof British statutes and waivers by British governments -wit h the sovereign rights of the Parliament declaration that, South Africa, for inof the United Kingdom and the unity of the Empire. Speaking before representatives of the Dominions of Canada and South Africa, who were pressing for this so-called reform, I asked them what power could be added to those they then possessed, if to-morrow their dominions declared themselves to be independent? What thing of substance could be given to any dominion, if it were an independent power, that it does not now enjoy under this wonderfully elastic Constitution of ours? That the dominions would lose the substance in attempting to grasp at the shadow, is evident. This motion, and all that preceded it at the 1926 conference, arises from the inability of some of the dominions to understand the nature of the Imperial pact. They think that membership of the British Commonwealth of nations limits their sovereignty. They are anxious to strut the world's stage in the toga of complete independence. In ""1926, to satisfy the demands of their partisans, they foolishly insisted upon putting into writing what can never be reduced to writing, the constitutional relations between Britain and the dominions. expected, for you cannot imprison a living organism in a formula. Our Constitution to-day is very different from that of even twenty years ago. What it will be in twenty years to come no man can say. Its outstanding excellency is its elasticity. Its adaptability to change and to progress has been strikingly demonstrated. The circumstances of the Empire have radically changed; but so smoothly has the mechanism worked that these changes have passed almost unnoticed. It may be contended that while the equality of status is only set forth in a resolution, it lacks that completeness which would be given, to it by a statute. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) pointed out. what; is obvious, that no statute of the British Parliament is to be regarded as the final settlement of anything. It is, of course, owing to that common sense and genius of self-government that mark the British that the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not exercise its undoubted power, but it cannot strip itself of it, and therefore a statutory stance, was an independent nation, or that it had the right in the preamble to its legislation to omit reference to His Majesty the King, could be altered by a subsequent, or by the same, parliament. Let us consider the practical application of this motion and of the resolutions of the 1926 conference which are responsible for its introduction into this Parliament. The folly of attempting to reduce the Empire Constitution to writing has been sufficiently revealed by events subsequent to 1926, and by the motion now before the House. No sooner were the resolutions of the 1926 conference-themselves sufficiently vague-oommitte d to writing, than doubt, uncertainty and anxiety arose in many quarters. When the Prime Minister of Canada attended the Imperial Conference of 1926, he came hot from an election in which he had won a signal victory. The appeal to the Canadian people arose out of circumstances not without interest to members of this Parliament. Mr Mackenzie King had advised the Governor General of Canada, Lord Byng, to dissolve the Canadian Parliament. His Excellency refused to accept the advice, The result was to be and sent for Mr Meighen, and asked him to form a government. He did so, but met with a hostile reception in the new parliament, and was compelled after a few months to appeal to the people. As a result Mr Mackenzie King was returned with an overwhelming majority. After such a triumphant vindication of himself and his policy, Mr Mackenzie King very naturally asked that something should be done to define the position of dominion prime ministers in relation to the representative of the King. He pointed out that if the status of Canada was equal to that of Great Britain in regard to affairs within her jurisdiction, then the advice of the Canadian Prime Minister ought to be followed by the 1 representative of the King in the same way as the advice of the British Prime Minister was in fact followed by His Majesty himself. As is well known, His Majesty has, for many years past, always accepted the advice of his Ministers in respect to dissolutions of parliament. The attempt of the 1926 Imperial Conference to define these matters in writing was in part an effort to give the assurance to Canada that she really did enjoy in substance that equality of status which had been freely granted to her, -and that her Prime Minister occupied the same position in relation to the Governor General as the Prime Minister of ""Great Britain occupied towards His .Majesty in person. No sooner were these resolutions shaped into the newest charter of liberty tardily granted to a downtrodden people than the Canadian legislature became like an ant heap on which hot water had been poured. Members became alarmingly aware that in getting what they had asked for they had involved themselves in unforeseen difficulties. If the status of Canada was equal iu all respects to that, of Britain, then she could do everything that Britain could do in regard to her internal affairs, and, among other things, could amend her own constitution. The British. Parliament has power to do anything and everything; even to amend the Act of Succession, or to remove the King from the throne. The constitution of Canada is based an the federation of two races differing in language, historical background, religion and general outlook. The French, who were in the minority, joined with the British with reluctance and misgiving, and only on the distinct understanding that the bases of the constitution were to be so firmly fixed that no chance majority in the Canadian Parliament could undermine it. Otherwise the French would have been at the mercy of the Anglo-Saxon section of the community. When this issue was raised after the framing of the Balfour Declaration, the Canadian Parliament was in a quandary. If parliament declared that Canada w'as not mistress in her own house, it was to expose the Balfour of equality if , on the other hand, it said that Canada could amend the Constitution, stable government and the Confederation itself were in grave danger. those admirable explanations was made by the French Minister, Mr Le Binte, in which ambiguity trod on the heels of ambiguity, and men who, when they rose up, saw some glimmer of light, sat down in Cimmerian darkness. In South Africa, too, the position was hardly less unsatisfactory. Mr Hughes. to South Africa from the Imperial Conference declaring that the overlordship of Britain had passed away. South Africa, he said, was no longer in any way subordinate to the King of England. There was a king, it was true, but he was King of South Africa. That he also happened to be King of England was one of those unfortunate facts on which Mr Hertzog did not dwell. In every direction, the attempts to crystallize the status of the dominion in a formula, to resolve doubts by setting out constitutional relations in writing, resulted in the creation of a veritable legion of doubts. Where there had been certainty, there arose not only doubt but fear. The resolutions, in the very nature of things, left some matters undeclared, and it is a maxim of law that those things which are not covered are omitted; those rights which are not set down in the bond, do not exist, or, at any rate, are not firmly founded. And so in South Africa, Ireland and Canada, men began to ask for fuller information regarding the powers they were supposed to have obtained. In short, these resolutions defining the powers of the dominion settled nothing and disturbed everything. One cannot define Empire relation in other than general terms, and I declare the terms to be these: That whatever power is necessary for the well-being of this Commonwealth, or of any dominion, that is compatible with the unity upon which every dominion depends for its safety and existence, is vested in the dominions by virtue of their equality of status with Britain, and can be exercised. Beyond that one cannot safely go. This motion proposes to give legislative sanction to the declaration of the last Imperial Conference, and Declaration to crystallize in a formula the conas a hollow sham; stitutional relations of the various unit."" of the Empire. Is it possible to achieve this? Has it uot been shown during the course of this debate, that the attempt to And so one of define Empire relations has given rise to a hundred difficulties for every one it has removed. I do not hesitate to say that since the 1926 Imperial Conference, and indeed since the end of the war, all power has been vested in this Commonwealth Parliament to deal with matters within its jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction was General Hertzog returned not limited to the terms of the Commonwealth Constitution, but was as wide as to the Colonial Laws Validity Act no was considered to be necessary by this objection whatever can be raised.

I venture to say that there are many other sections of that act which would have caused serious trouble if the same legal argument and interpretation had been applied to the written document. member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) has asked for an example. There has been difficulty in Canada in regard to admiralty jurisdiction. I am not speaking of a difficulty such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred to affecting this Commonwealth and the States. It was thought that Canada had ful l power to establish a court of admiralty with equal authority to the English court and it had exercised it, but an amending act of the Imperial Parliament has raised the doubt whether that right exists. instances may be only minor ones. The right honourable member for North Sydney has said they are; but we cannot have equality, and at the same time allow the legislation of another country to affect us. Although these are minor matters they may become important, and it is far better to settle them now than at some future time when friction may be caused thereby. I regard this attempt to legalize by statute the existing dominion status as quite unnecessary. We are an independent nation, whatever the Statute of Westminster may provide. That statute is entirely superfluous, and although there is no harm in passing it, we should, to preserve our independent status, pass legislation based on our own charter of liberty. I do not care what the legislation is called so long as it is in proper form. It is only' our own act which we should recognize. Liberty is never granted to a people; it has to be taken. The right honourable member for North Sydney has quoted what Lloyd George said in 1917. How can we be equal to the English people if we have to ask them for a grant of additional liberty? We are equals only to the English people. I object very much to clause 3, which I consider should be struck Out. It says that no English act of Parliament shall affect Australia in the future. The very presence of those words is an admission that Great Britain has the right to interfere with our legislation, and that it has power to legislate for us. It should have no right to do that. I would repudiate completely any legislation that declared .that any parliament outside Australia has power to legislate for this country or to give us powers to The honourable legislate. We have those powers, and Australians are as much masters in their own house as Englishmen are masters in theirs. Any honourable member who does not agree with that attitude places the stigma of inferiority on our people and upon their inherent rights. Even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) admitted such inferiority, but I refuse to acknowledge it. If , for legal purposes, and to influence a conservative and unobservant High Court, clause 1 of this statute is necessary, I accept it under protest, but I ask this Parliament to insist on declaring its These independence by its own legislation and passing its own Act of Westminster. Clause2 I accept reluctantly, but section 7 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act should be retained or section 51 of the report be carried out. Clause3 should be omitted. I come now to clause 4, the first part of which readsNothing in this act shall lie deemed to confer any power to repeal or alter the Constitution or the Constitution Act of the Commonwealth of Australia, otherwise than in accordance with the law existing before the commencement of this act. To-day Australia is up against the greatest difficulties in its history, and this statute proposes that the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament shall not be extended beyond the written terms of a constitution which embodies a bargain made entirely by the States amongst themselves and endorsed by the Australian people. The necessities of the time required the English Parliament to pass our Constitution Act. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) referred to the difficulties that were experienced preliminary to the union of Canada. The French minority would not trust the British majority^ and, believing that an outside authority would deal more justly with them, insisted that the BritishNorth America Act should be the basis of the Canadian Constitution, which would, therefore, be incapable of amendment by the dominion parliament. I am glad, however, that the French province of Quebec, after a recent conference between the dominion and . provincial governments of Canada, decided to accept the provisions of the proposed Statute of Westminster without any such reservations Government is proposing to insert in relation to Australia. The Colonial Laws Validity Act, section 7, gives to us complete power to make our own laws except in so far as they may be repugnant to the provisions of any Imperial statute. Canada has accepted the proposed Statute of Westminster as an amendment of the Dominion Constitution, to be used for the advantage of the Canadian people. Clause4 of the proposed statute can be struck out without endangering the general agreement between the dominions, because it affects only Australian rights. If the clause is omitted we shall be able to amend our Constitution as the people wish, because the repugnancy provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act will no longer apply. that. If the honourable member will read the report of the Constitution Commission, and will study carefully section 128, he will find that certain conditions inserted at the instance of Mr Reid, and in accordance with the demands of a section of the New South Wales people, make it forever impossible, without the consent of all the States, to amend the Constitution, and certainly make impossible the creation of new States. If we accept clause 4 of the proposed statute, we shall bind ourselves helplessly to the existing Constitution, which the whole of the Australian people wish to alter. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) will agree that the latter portion of section 128 imperatively prescribes certain conditions precedent to an amendment of the Constitution, and many leading lawyers are convinced that if we accept clause 4 of the statute we shall bind ourselves in such a way as to be forever unabJe to amend the Constitution on vital matters. That seems to be the decision of the High Court in the Legislative Council Referendum case in New South Wales. I appeal to honourable members to retain the constitutional rights of this Parliament. Almost from the inception of federation the Commonwealth has been the paramount authority in Australian finance, and the financial agreement has brought about what is equivalent to financial unification. as the Commonwealth Although we control finance, which is the basis of government at all times, and particularly now, our hands are tied by expensive State Parliaments and Governors, and we are burdened with a defaulting State. Those who are advocating the creation of new States will find in section 128 an absolute negation of their desires. member knows the trouble he will never consent to clause 4 of this proposed statute. crease any existing difficulty. member to these wordsNothing in this act shall be deemed to authorize the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia to make laws on any matter within the authority of the States of Australia. leaves things as they are. provision ? extend the Commonwealth power shall be taken, in Australia, and to make dear that this statute shall not amend the Constitution.

He has always been a strong Imperialist, and against Australian national sentiment. out of place in reference to that conference, which Sir Harrison Moore attended as a legal expert. to preserve Imperial rights.

Sir Harrison Moore, with characteristic ability, upheld Australia's claims, based upon dominion status, as declared in 1926. Ma-. CROUCH -He accepted dominion status grudgingly. It is .clear from hia report that he accepted just so much as the conference ordered. South Africa has accepted the statute posed under clause 4. I have heard to-day that New Zealand has requested that the measure should be returned to it, and I wish it to come back to us, but for an entirely different reason from that of New Zealand; I desire our complete liberty to be preserved and by passing our own statute not to admit the necessity for another legislature passing laws affecting us. As the narrow view of the High Coui'it requires the written word and not the accepted constitutional position, it might .be necessary for another legislature to pass such laws.

Many instances of interference by English law arise in Australia; but as they do not raise great public issues, or affect large numbers of people, little is heard of them. Ever since I have developed a political sense, I have felt entitled to object to English laws which conflict with those of Australia in regard to Australian matters. sible to be friendly with those who assume unauthorized superiority; but friendship with the Old Country on the part of the dominions will be assured if they are regarded as equals and co-partners. The various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations must deal with one another as man to man; as brothers in a family. When a son leaves the parental roof, and establishes a home of his own, he does not lose his friendship for his father. On the other hand, the right given to the son to control his own household removes the irksome restriction that is sometimes felt by a son because of parental domination. Since the dominions have been accorded self-governing powers co-equal with those of the Motherland, my regard for the Old Country has increased and will ever remain absolutely unshaken. [3.20]I enter this debate with some trepidation, after the excellent speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and, in some respects, the no less admirable address of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). I shall consider the subject from some of the broader aspects which appeal to a layman who has endeavoured to take an intelligent interest in imperial matters. profound importance of the proposal before the House has been admirably stressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but I have no intention of following him in. his contentions. The motion before the House has arisen almost wholly from the proceedings of the Imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930. addressing the House eight or ten days ago, he took the stand that these proposals would increase community of interests in the Empire; that the self government now enjoyed by the dominions would be strengthened. To my mind, that rather savours of taking our history from a collection of Border Ballads, or our theology from a hymnary. These conclusions he based upon what has come to be known as the Balfour report. Robert Stokes, in New Imperial Ideals, makes the following reference to the Balfour report:The report is almost frankly disruptive, and It is not always posin two cardinal matters, it goes, or appears to go, far beyond'the 192G report1. In the first place it goes beyond its own terms of reference from the 1920 conference in recommending that dominion parliaments should have f u l l power to make laws having extra-territorial operation, whereas the terms of reference had limited this to "" all cases where such operation is ancillary to provision for the peace, order, and good government of the dominion "". 2. In the second place, the 1920 report did not devise any legal means whereby dominions might be at liberty to secede, and by a well established rule of law, a dominion parliament could not legally pass a secession law having validity, because that would be to transgress the purpose for which it had received its powers from the Imperial Parliament and for which it existed. Such a law must be reserved and disallowed. Accordingly, the only means of peaceable secession open to it was to t r y and pcrsuad6 the Imperial Government to pass legislation dissolving the tie with it . Such legislation would naturally not be passed unless the Imperial Parliament were convinced that the change was desired by an overwhelming majority of the citizens of the dominion. But the present report provides for the abolition of reservation and disallowance, except in respect of the Governor's constitutional powers as the personal representative of the King, and these can be overcome by the refusal of supplies. The report, therefore, would leave it possible for, say, the Irish Free State, even with an opposing Governor General, to secede legally from the Empire by processes which could not be legally checked at any point by the rest of the Empire. A French writer of weight contends that this is the effect of the position The already described in the 1920 report itself. However that may be, it certainly appears to be the position likely to be ensured by the 1929 report. The general design of this report is to carry the principles of the 1926 report to their logical conclusion by placing the dominions in a position of absolute equality with the United Kingdom. This involves divesting the Imperial Parliament of the last shadowy When the Prime Minister was remnants of its capacity to legislate of its own motion for the dominions, and it leaves the Empire without a legislature entitled to",34,Statute Of Westminster Dominion And Merchant Shipping Legislation Imperial Conference Resolutions
174,Mr Morgan (Darling Downs),"make laws for it as a whole. It can only attain legislative unity in any matter by means of agreed concurrent legislation by the various parliaments. Of the difficulty of securing such unity let a very eminent Australian lawyer speak"" Any one who has had experience of the difficulties involved in passing identical legislation through six State Parliaments in Australia, will not be over optimistic as to the chances of obtaining identical or reciprocal legislation with a reasonable approach to simultaneity in five parliaments sitting in every quarter of the globe "". That opinion is the opinion of the Honourable J. G. Latham, M.P., Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this House to-day. Continuing, Mr Stokes reaches these conclusionsIn practice the result must inevitably be to leave the Empire without any effective constitutional means of maintaining any kind of legislative unity. It would be reduced, in fact, to a mere league or community of nations united by a moral tic and by allegiance to the person of the King. It would be an empire almost without common institutions of any kind, and in its constitutional structure going far to justify the suggestion that it may be steadily dissolving into a precarious alliance. That illustrates the point that I have taken, and it disagrees entirely with the view of the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) that the passage of this statute will increase, and not weaken, the community of interests among the different, rjarts of the Empire. We know very well that the decisions of the 1926 Imperial Conference were the outcome of a set of circumstances which, if I may use the phrase, have ""lef t the world wondering "". That conference met under most peculiar circumstances. We had the spectlacle of an enraged and politically-minded Prime Minister rushing from Canada to elicit the sympathies of the disgruntled representatives of the Irish Free State, and the equally disgruntled representatives of the South African Union. He obtained their aid to secure approval of a policy which, in my opinion, was formulated in a spirit of revenge that was awakened because of the political conditions which had arisen in his own dominion. sense; the committee was presided over by Lord Balfour. ney-General( Mr Brennan) regards it as nonsense or not, it is my considered opinion. I sincerely regret that the Australian representatives at that conference gave their approval to that policy, which was subsequently brought before the 1929 and 1930 Imperial Conferences. It is true' that the committee was presided over by Lord Balfour. In that connection, I wish to say that it was entirely due to a system of political metaphysics, applied by a master political metaphysician, that the conference adopted the course that it did, and paved the way for the formulation of the Statute of Westminster. servative Prime Minister, was at the head of the conference. my opinion one iota. This opinion is also held very widely throughout the British Empire. member know that? my reading and my intelligent interpretation of what I read. I believe that at the 1926 Imperial Conference we saw the first definite evidence of the crumbling of the British Empire. At that conference, the bridge heads were surrendered, the boats were burned, and the key to the door of the citadel delivered up. Honourable members may remove from their minds any idea that the British Empire can continue along the old lines. It was transmuted at that conference into the kind of thing that it is shown to be by this statute that is now proposed. I hate the raising of the legalistic position in this connection, and agree with the attitude that has been adopted by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). I attribute the raising of the legalistic issue wholly to the proceedings of the 1926 conference. statute is to remove the legalistic position. emphasizes it. The most important single factor in the maintenance of the peace of the world is the unity of the British Empire. It is therefore eminently desirable that we should do our utmost to preserve this unity, for once it is disintegrated the door will be open for all sorts of national and international",35,Statute Of Westminster Dominion And Merchant Shipping Legislation Imperial Conference Resolutions

182,Mr Morgan,"In my opinion, itembroilments. Statute of Westminster will <lo anything to maintain the unity of the Empire. In my opinion, it is much more likely to have a disrupting influence. The Prime Minister has said that the statute will preserve dominion status as we know it -to-day; but I think that it will destroy it. It may be true, as we have been told, thai the statute will not involve any change in the United Kingdom; but it will certainly involve very definite and serious changes in the Empire. Believing, as I do, that the maintenance of the unity of the Empire is the best guarantee that we can have of the continuance of peace, I feel it necessary to do my utmost to resist anything that is likely to interfere with that unity. As»jriou3 and widespread propaganda is being conducted to-day by communistic influences against the solidarity of the Empire. .It is therefore all the more necessary that we should not do anything which might even tend to impair our unity. Take, for instance, such a subject as extra-territoriality. Into this vortex the 1926 conference definitely precipitated this country. toriality is likely to involye us in serious trouble. Australia is a country with a small population, and no adequate scheme of defence. factors, coupled with the wide legislative powers which Australia is to be given in relation to extraterritorality multiply the possible causes of war. It is contended that .the forthcoming disarmament conference is a matter of prime concern to Australia. The Prime Minister said that it was essential that Australia should be represented at that conference. As in the case of his remarks regarding the Statute of Westminster, which, he said, would strengthen, rather than weaken, Australia's position in the future, I submit that the Prime Minister ip again wrong; for surely there is no need for Australia to be represented at the disfor -financial assistance has been received armament conference, seeing that for all practical purposes we have already disarmed. On ithe question of disarmament Australia does not count. I submit that any system which will require this icountry to subscribe to any written document in the matter of inter Empire relations is not calculated ;to .serve its best Sir. Morgan. I cannot see that the interests. By adopting that system we should be abandoning political conventions which have stood the test for many years in favour of something nebulous. We must ask ourselves whether it is wise to depart from a practice which we have tried and proved to be satisfactory. The history and the traditions of the British Empire teach us that it would be unwise to adopt the proposals contained in this resolution. I agree generally with the views so admirably stated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and I intend to vote for the amendments he has tabled. I conclude by repeating that I agree with the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that it is infinitely better to leave things as they are, than to walk into this legal straight-jacket that has been prepared, for us in a resolution unwisely adopted at the 1926 conference. adjourned.

186,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [3.48].,". It is time that we had a definite declaration of the Government's intentions, not only with regard to the shipment of timber which has already reached Australia, but also with regard to other shipments which might arrive. The Melbourne Age of 15th July contained the following cable message:Kiga, 14th July. The Soviet's Supreme Economic Council has appointed a special commission to devise urgent measures, including the mechanization and increase of the timber export trade. An official report on timber operations at Archangel says that barracks and public feeding places are unhealthy, and are often filthy. The workers could not be expected to respond to the now plans to f u l f i l the export programme unless the conditions are improved. Whether the information contained in that cable is correct or not, there is evidence of an intention on the part of the Soviet Government of Russia to export wheat, oil, and timber to other countries, including Australia, and to sell them at almost any price. In marketing that timber peasant labour, indentured labour, the labour of imprisoned and unimprisoned convicts, of women and children, and political prisoners of the Soviet worked as slaves, is employed. We have official information to hand indicating that the death rate among those workers is exceedingly high, and that, owing to the inhuman treatment that is meted out, only a small percentage survive the rigours of slave service. has come to hand from officers and sailors of various nationalities as to the harrowing conditions of slavery that obtain on the wharfs of Russia. But, bad as are those conditions, the state of affairs in the lumber camps is infinitely worse. In six of the camps, the names of which are unpronounceable, employees numbering respectively, 30,000; 25,000; 30,000, 10,000; 20,000 and 20,000 are engaged in hewing and loading timber, and the hardships to which they are subjected are almost indescribable. we took notice of what is going on in Russia, and determined how we shall act in connection with the importation of this timber. member was in Canada he shut his eyes to the labour conditions obtaining in that for Trade and Customs) [3.56] -Reply dominion. tunity is afforded me I shall inform the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), and the House generally exactly what I learned about labour conditions in Canada, after consultation with Labour and Trades Hall representatives at Vancouver. Protests are coming to hand from every State in Australia with regard to the importation of Russian timber. The latest is a circular from timber interests in Queensland, which I do not intend to quote. The following paragraph appeared in the Age of the 15th instant:There was a large attendance of representatives of primary producing industries and others concerned in Australian primary productions, as well as local organizations, at a meeting held in the board room, Temple Court, yesterday, to consider plans for combating Soviet activities in Australia, particularly in regard to imports of Russian products. At that meeting the following resolution was carried:That the Lord Mayor be asked to convene a meeting for the purpose of pointing out to the general public the danger arising out of Russian importations to Australian commerce and industries. I do not suggest that the Minister for Customs is sleeping at his post. The honourable gentleman is too alert and too good a protector of Australian industries to do that. My words are not directed at any individual, nor at the Government. Information I believe that the stage has arrived when we should definitely decide not to tolerate this invasion by the products of slavery. I ask, not for a declaration that the Tariff Board will inquire into the matter, that a surcharge will be imposed on the shipment of Russian timber that has already arrived in Australia, or that anti-dumping laws will operate in future, but that the Government will prohibit the importation of Russian timber into Australia.

If at any time a clearance is granted, a security duty of 10 per cent, per 100 super, feet will be demanded, in addition to existing duties. That amounts' practically to prohibition. assure honourable members that the Government is determined to continue in 'the future its policy of the past, that of giving adequate protection to the Australian timber industry, and that there is no reason to be apprehensive with regard to timber consignments from Russia. Obviously, the Government cannot act upon hearsay, or on paragraphs that appear in the press. The proper steps are being taken to investigate the conditions under which the timber industry of Russia is being carried on. to bring under the notice of the Minister in which the proposed reduction in war pensions will affect a case that has been brought under my notice. of a lady who had two sons killed at the war, and whose husband is crippled, and in receipt of an invalid pension. She is in a worse position than that of a widow. The recent conference between the Government and representatives of returned soldiers made no provision for cases of this description. The following letter was sent to Mr Booth, the State representative of Kurri Kurri: Killingworth, 3rd July, 1931. Mr Booth, M.L.A. Dear Sir,-Seeing an announcement in the Newcastle Morning Herald regarding war pensions, I thought it best to write to you and sask would I ho exempt from same. I am a mother of two deceased sons, and, although my husband is living, he is unable to do any kind of work, and has not worked during the pa6t two years. I receive 7s. a week for one son, and 15a. a week for the other, making a total of £2 4s. per fortnight. Yours sinconely, 1. GREENFIELD. The Mr Booth, in a covering letter to me, stated that he believed that Mrs. Greenfield's husband was in receipt of an invalid pension. Cases such as these were not considered by the soldiers' committee which dealt with the Government's proposals to reduce war pensions, and the committee had no right to accept any I have instructed the Subcompromise without consulting the rank and file of the various organizations. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to this and other similar cases which may be brought under his notice. A matter to which I direct the attention of the Minister for Health( MrI McNeill) is the need for providing medical attendance for the unemployed. There are approximately 5,000 workless people iu the vicinity of Kurri Kurri, Cessnock and the surrounding district. They are being attended by the local doctors, Who are now unable to procure the necessary medicines, &c. As might be expected, sickness is more prevalent among the unemployed than among the more fortunate people who are in employment. The Federal Government should do something to aid the doctors in the humane work of attending the sick. They are willing to give their services free; but the Government should compensate them for the expense to which they are put. It is that State Government? Minister for Health, and I should like to hear what he has to say. The health of the people is not the sole responsibility of the State Government. It has enough difficulty in providing food and other necessaries without being also accountable for the health of the unemployed. Some responsibility rests upon the Commonwealth Government. Why have we a Commonwealth Minister for Healthi f he is not to function in the interests of all the people?

It is not possible for parents to keep their children in good health on the miserable dole handed out to them. I hope that the Minister for Health will give these mutters his most sympathetic consideration. attention to the latest development in connection with the default of the New South Wales Government. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), in his discretion, cannot go on paying out millions of did not this afternoon take the House fully into his confidence. I do not blame him for that; but I do claim that honourable members representing other States have a right to express the apprehension which they feel, because of the extent to which Commonwealth revenue is being used for the benefit of New made clear for some months that the Premier of the State has deliberately embarked upon a policy of getting ahead of the other States, so far as possible, with respect to advances from the Commonwealth, and, notwithstanding his insolence, he has succeeded in obtaining very large sums from the Commonwealth Government to make good the default of his Government in its interest payments on overs.eas loans. In addition, the negotiations which have been proceeding for some time with the Commonwealth Bank for the re-opening of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales will probably greatly add to the financial responsibilities of the Commonwealth. In all these masters, this Government has so far acted without authority from Parliament. Now it is reported that there is a demand by the Premier of New South Wales for further very large sums. Honourable members representing other States are vitally concerned about these repeated demands from New South Wales, and I think the House should be consulted regarding them. The Premier of New South Wales should be told plainly that this policy of paying up for his Government cannot go on indefinitely, and that he cannot continue in the role of the rogue in politics. No one wishes the public servants of New South Wales to go short of their salaries or wages, but surely honourable members realize that the Commonwealth cannot accept responsibility for the shortcomings of the New South Wales Government in this respect. The people of that State' put the present Ministry into power, and must take the consequences of their action, or else turn the Government out. I do not wish to complain personally of the attitude of the Prime Minister in this matter, but I direct attention to the urgency of the situation that has arisen, and suggest to him that the Commonwealth Government pounds to New South Wales without consulting this Parliament.

I am prepared to support every proposal for reasonable economy, but I remind the House that we have received no fewer than three copies of the printed report dealing with the sugar industry. Will the Prime Minister state whether the report on the wine industry is to be printed? Those interested in the sugar industry have been able to buy, at Ss. each, copies of the SugarI n vestigation Committee's report, and it is desirable that copies of the other report should be available to those who want them.

When the New South Wales Government first failed to meet its interest obligations, I made a full statement to the House, placing before it all the information at my disposal. an offer to re-open the Government Sav-. ings Bank. Board did. agree that negotiations should be conducted between the two banks with a view to re-opening the New South Wales Government Savings Bank.

This Government is determined that every State shall meet its own obligations, andon that point we have never wavered. Is there, however, any honourable member in this House who disapproves of the action of the Government to date in meeting interest payments regarding which the There is a legal obligation on us to do that. legal proceedings against the Government of New South Wales, and if that governproceedings will be gone on with.
