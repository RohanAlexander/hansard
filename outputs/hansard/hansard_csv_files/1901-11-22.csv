Has the honourable member leave to proceed 1 Housef o r their courtesy, because the it, only I wish to show that the vote in my matter to which I wish to refer is rather favour, as well as that given to Sir' Edward important to me. It has been repeatedly stated by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, that he was elected by some 9,000 odd votes over me, and that I was elected upon his surplus votes. I may explain that the Hare system under which every member bas to receive a certain number of votes, or what is termed a ""quota,"" was in vogue at the late federal election in Tasmania. When the primary count was finished, the votes recorded were as follow :-Braddon, 4,713; O'Malley, 3,939 : Cameron, 2,092; Fysh, 1,792 ; Piesse, 1,788. In other words, I was returned, without any votes from anybody else, in the third position on the poll. The quota was 3,595 votes. Sir Edward Braddon obtained his quota in the first count, and so did the honourable member, Mr O'Malley. I did not. Now this is the point at which I wish to particularly direct the attention of honourable members to the statement of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley. H is surplus votes were 344, of which Mr Blanchard received 7, Ireceived 20, Mr Fenton 31, Sir P. Fysh 32, Mr Hartnoll 21, Mr Picsse 31,and Mr. Whitelaw 202. When the other candidates were struck out, as they were struck out in order, the figures for the first three on the poll were Braddon, 4,713 ; O'Malley, 3,939 ; and Cameron, 3,684. ThusI had a surplus over the quota of 89 votes, whioh were afterwards distributed between Sir P. Fysh and Mr Piesse. Therefore, honourable members can see how much truth there is in the. statement that I was returned on the surplus of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr. As the necessary O'Malley. purely personal matters should he discussed in this way, because there will be no I think that limit to them. However, I shall not refuse to put the question to the House that-the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr. O'Malley, have leave to speak in reply to tlie honourable member.

The Minister for Trade and Customs referred to New South Wales and Tasmania -as States into which there might possibly be some importations from New Zealand. I cannot speak as to Tasmania, but so far as my recollection goes, and it extends over a great many years, there have been no importations of stock for food consumption into New South Wales, where, of course, there has been no d u t y A few years ago an immense number of British breeding sheep, Lincoln rams particularly, were imported into New South Wales, and it soon became evident to the people of New Zealand that there was no market for them in the former State. As a representative of the farming and pastoral industries, and as one who thereby gains his living, I am quite prepared to give every opportunity to the consumer, believing that the worse subject for taxation is the food supply of the people. I am quite prepared to support the amendment, feeling that the proposed duty would be inoperative. The exportation of stock to the old country from both New Zealand and Victoria is increasing year by year; and, such is the surplus stock, that in Victoria, notwithstanding the prejudicial effects of the stock tax, three orfour exporting factories have been making good profit. A factory, with the starting of which I had something to do at Geelong, as an outlet for our stock, -even when the stock tax was in operation, was purchased the other day, at a handsome price, by, I believe, an English company. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I was -one of the strongest advocates of the stock tax in Victoria, and I have never seen reason to regret my action, because no duty in Victoria has done so much substantial good to the farmer. MrA . McLEAN -Larg e stock-owners, like the honourable member for Grampians, can take advantage of the fluctuations of the market. The small farmers have to send their stock to market when ready, whether the market be flooded or not, whereas tlie large owners are able to hold over and obtain high prices ; and it was in the interests of the small farmers that the stock tax was imposed. As to the item under discussion, I have no doubt that the Government propose it with, the best intention. Buti t is I know that this an item which will lead to a great deal of discussion, and if the Government persist, we shall probably lose the greater part of the day. It is an item not worth wasting time over, because it will not produce revenue to any appreciable extent, and will be of no substantial benefit to the farmers. Under the circumstances, and with a view to saving time, it would be better for the Government to withdraw the item. The honourable member for Flinders stated that farmers could not be benefited in any way by protection; but I contend that there are many items in the Tariff which will be of substantial use in that direction. This,, however, is not one of the useful duties. The only stock imported consists, perhaps, of a few draught horses occasionally from New Zealand; but in Victoria the duty on horses was abolished some years ago. There is no doubt that the object of the Government in proposing this item is to give a sop to the farmers after having proposed heavy duties for the benefit of secondary industries. According to their own figures, the Government show that this duty will not result in any revenue; and although I should be loath to do anything to prejudice the farmers, I cannot see that this is a duty which will be of any benefit to their industry. The only argument which can he advanced in favour of a stock tax is that in times of scarcity the consumers are called upon to pay high prices. because our own people would not go into the industry. There was only one season of scarcity after the imposition of the stock tax. of taxation which takes advantage of drought or failure of crops to raise the price of the food supplies of the masses. .

Treasurer) I am very pleased to be able to claim the vote of the honourable member for West Sydney. This duty is not imposed for revenue purposes, but as part of our policy to protect the natural industries of the Commonwealth. The production of arrowroot is an industry natural to the States of Queensland and New South Wales. going to protect it at the expense of the children and invalids of the Commonwealth. so, because I am told on very good authority that arrowroot does not form the basis of infants' and invalids' food, and that benefit it is ostensibly designed. it is not one of the necessary ingredients. I who has no object in misleading me, that arrowroot does not form the basis of these foods which we have placed on the free list. If we are going to make this a revenue Tariff pure and simple, we must strike out this and many other items, but we have never pretended that this is a Tariff for purely revenue purposes. The Tariff is a revenue Tariff, which will also give protection wherever we think that it is perfectly justified. If we are to help the producers, we must assist those who are engaged in the production of arrowroot in Queensland. Queensland should not supply the whole of the arrowroot required in the Commonwealth. doing it now. going to help her.

I am sorry that the honourable member for West Sydney has moved his amendment, because he will have to vote against it, as I claim his vote for this duty as a protectionist impost. very glad to have been able, at last, to draw from the Government an admission that-"" this is a protectionist Tariff. It has been described as a revenue Tariff, and now we find that it is partly forrevenue and partly for protectionist purposes, but apparently wholly protectionist in so far as duties of this kind are concerned. I do not understand how it becomes part of the policy of the Government to omit the stock duty and to persevere with a duty such as this.

55,Mr Joseph Cook,"Becaus e theyNew South Wales, prior to the introduction of the Eederal Tariff, ,no material importations were made from abroad, but nearly the whole of the arrowroot consumed in that State was obtained from Queensland. In Victoria, a large sum has been extracted from the pockets of the taxpayers by means of the duty on arrowroot, and now it is proposed to extend the same operation to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. appointed at the remarks of the Treasurer. I . had hoped that he would have treated arrowroot in the same way as the previous item. surer says, arrowroot is very largely used as young children and delicate The Treasurer admits that this duty is imposed for purely protective purposes; but it will certainly fall upon the shoulders of those who are least able to bear it the sick and the young. Its only effect will be to increase the price of arrowroot throughout the Commonwealth, without in any way stimulating its production. I would point out that in New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia arrowroot was formerly admitted free, and that the same remark applies even to the highly protected colony of New Zealand. No good reason has been advanced why we . should not follow the example which has been set to us by four of the States, in admitting this commodity duty free. The revenue which such an impost will yield will be very small indeed. . The Treasurer himself estimates that he will receive a total revenue of only £13,790 from arrowroot, tapioca, and sago. How much of that will be derived from arrowroot? I am satisfied that the bulk of it will be derived from . tapioca and sago. Very little arrowroot is' imported from outside the limits of the Commonwealth. Even in New South Wales, where it was formerly admitted free of duty, the quantity imported in 1900 was 200,000 lbs., of which only 13,750 lbs. came from beyond tlie Commonwealth limits. Nearly the whole of the amount which was imported from abroad came from the New Hebrides. I wish, further, to point out the extraordinarily high nature of this duty of I d . per lb. The value of arrowroot is about 2Jd. per lb., so that the duty proposed represents considerably over 40 per cent. The sole effect of this duty will be to increase the price of the commodity to the consumers. The wholesale price which Messrs. Parsons Bros. Limited charged for arrowroot in Sydney on 1st September last was 2-|d. per lb. for 7-lb. tins. In Melbourne, where there was a duty of 2d. per lb., the price was 5£d. per lb. for 7-lb. tins. That represents a difference, of considerably more than the duty. If we compare the prices two days after the imposition of tlie Tariff, namely, on lOtli October, we find that in Sydney the wholesale charge had risen from 2|d. to 4d., whilst in Melbourne upon that day it was also 4d. The Government will receive practically no revenue Notwithstanding what the Treafrom this duty, as nearly all the arrowroot consumed within the Commonwealth is iman article of food for ported from Queensland. The only effect people. of this impost will be to increase the price of arrowroot to the people by 1 £d. per lb. Therefore, I shall vote in favour of placing this commodity upon the free list. I hope that the Government will remit this duty, which really constitutes a tax upon a class of the community who ought not to he taxed, namely, the sick and the young. I would .point Out that in a work recently published by Dr. Muskett, who is an authority upon children's ailments, it is declared that the mortality amongst children by reason of the fact that they are not able to obtain this class of nourishment, owing to its cost being beyond the means of the poorer people, is enormous. Yet the Government propose to tax this commodity. It seems to me that they could very well allow it to be placed upon the free list. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I hope that the Government wil] adhere to the duty proposed. In framing this Tariff, honourable members should recollect that they are legislating for a United Australia. They should bear in mind that there are a' diversity of interests to be considered, and that not only are we framing a Tariff for the Commonwealth, but that we are superseding the policies which have hitherto been adopted in the various States. Consequently, it is our duty to study the industries which have grown up under the State Tariffs as far as we can do so consistently with raising sufficient revenue to meet the needs -of the Commonwealth.

The manufacture of arrowroot is really one of the primary industries of that State. The country and conditions are suited for its cultivation, and the skill which has been applied in its production is bearing good fruit. I ask honourable members to look at this matter from the same .stand-point as did Grover Cleveland, who, when he wanted to reduce the Tariff of the United States by 70,000,000 dollars, s a i d Justness and fairness dictate that in any modification of our present laws relating to revenue, the industries and interests which have been encouraged by such laws, and in which our citizens have large investments, should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed. We should also deal with the subject in such a manner as to protect the interests of American labour, which is the capital of our working men. Its stability und proper remuneration furnish the most justifiable pretext for a protective policy. That is the utterance of a man who is inclined to he a free-trader. We are merely revising the Tariffs of the various Australian States, and it behoves us to see that the industries which have grown up in those States are not ruthlessly destroyed. As a representative of Queensland, I appeal to the committee not to alter this duty. In that State there are no less than thirteen factories engaged in the manufacture of arrowroot, and employing a large number of hands. 772,280 lbs., of which quantity they exported 463,617 lbs. In Queensland in 1900 the price of arrowroot varied from 2d. to 4d. per lb. This plant is not grown in Victoria. That the industry can be fostered and established by means of a protective duty has been abundantly proved by the experience in Queensland, and with the prospect of tlie wider market which the -Commonwealth affords, it promises to become one of the great industries of Australia. reduce the price? MrL . E. GROOM -In Victoria the price will be less, and in New South Walesi t will, I imagine, be very much the same as it has been hitherto. The imposition of this duty will foster the industry to such .an extent that it will become a very valuable asset to the Commonwealth, and -Queensland will have cause to congratulate herself that she joined in the federation. this item should properly be placed on the taxing invalids' and infants' food has been 22 K z free list. I am aware that the Government contends that arrowroot does not enter into the composition of invalids' food. I might even admit that. But if it does not, it forms of itself an invalids' food-on e which is in fact consumed much more largely than are the higher-priced invalids' foods. I believe also that a medical man like the honourable member for Laanecoorie might argue that this particular form of invalids' food is sometimes abused, and that children are fed upon it to an undue extent. But the abuse of an article of diet in certain respects must not be taken to condemn the use of the article generally. I know that in AVestern Australia arrowroot is an article which is repeatedly recommended for use by medical men, and that taken in combination with milk, it is necessary for the preservation of the lives of a very large proportion of the people, young and old, not only upon the gold-fields, but even in the more settled parts of the country. It has been pointed out already that in New South Wales, where it was formerly admitted free of duty, the Queensland article was very largely used, and I see no reason to apprehend that it will not continue to be so used throughout Australia, irrespective of whether there is a duty upon it or not. In attempting to carry out the principles of In 1900 they manufactured protection in relation to an article of this kind, the Government are making a big mistake. The people of Victoria adopted the policy of protection because they thought that by so doing they were benefiting themselves; and now for the first time in their history they are being asked to sanction protection to an industry outside of their own borders. That will cause them to reflect upon the true incidence of a protective policy. As a result, the protectionists throughout Australia will begin to realize that their pet policy means protection for one particular State to the detriment of the other five. They will begin to perceive that a protective policy always entails undue sacrifice on the majority of the community; and in view of what I have said, I hope the Government, even in their own interests, will consider the advisability of removing this duty. hope the Government will not consent to",21,Tariff

If doctors do not prescribe arrowroot, the bulk of the consumption is by invalids and children, the balance being so exceedingly limited as to be scarcely worthy of consideration. New South Wales particularly, but also I believe in Victoria, has been to increase the price of the article to the consumer; and the idea of bringing about such a result for the benefit of an industry in one of the States, is monstrous in its injustice and absurd, in view of the fact that that State has practically the monopoly of the supply. be admitted free, why Queensland should not continue to enjoy this practical monopoly. In New South Wales, South Australia, and AVestern Australia, there has hitherto been no duty on arrowroot, and the result of the proposed impost must be to increase the cost.

While I was Premier of Tasmania, I never attempted to defend the Tariff; on the contrary, I endeavoured to reduce it very considerably, and in regard to this very item, I hope the committee will see fit to relieve the public of an additional charge on an article which enters largely into the lives of the poorer classes, and a charge which cannot by any means give us revenue or advance the interests of the Commonwealth. MrA . C. GROOM (Flinders) A duty of 46 per cent, is enormous on an important article of food. It may be true that arrowroot is not a first-class food for infants, but, at any rate, it is in general consumption throughout the Commonwealth, especially amongst the poorer classes. A favourite high duties always decrease prices. On 1st September, 1901, when there was no duty To a certain extent in New South Wales, the price of Parsons Brothers' arrowroot was 2||d. per lb., whilst in Victoria, under a duty of 2d. per lb., the price was 5Jd. As showing the difference the new duties have made in the price of this article, we have the fact that on 10th October, two days after the Tariff was. introduced, the price, alike in Sydney and Melbourne, became 4d. In 1900, when there was no duty in New South Wales, The effectof this duty, in the importation of arrowroot into that State amounted to over 200,000 lbs., of which only 13,000 lbs. odd come from outside Australia. This shows distinctly that the whole supply of New South Wales was obtained from Queensland ; arid if the same be the case in regard to the Victorian supply, we see that in this instance, at all events, protection does not lower the price. There'is no reason, if the article The Government should be prepared to reduce the duty by one-half, or what-would he better, place arrowroot on the free list. told that arrowroot, in the opinion of the medical faculty, is an injurious article of food, and if that be so, I do not see why we should assist this industry. Our duty would rather be to bring a Health Act to bear in order to prevent the consumption of arrowroot. Potatoes contain more starch than do any other vegetable, but surely on that account it would not be suggested that we should not eat potatoes. When the view that arrowroot is unfit for human consumption is entertained by one honourable member, and another honourable member advocates this duty on behalf of a certain industry, are we to understand that arrowroot is to be used only for the purpose of bill-sticking ? If so, honourable members will have to consider their own interests, and, in view of the next election, have the article placed on the free list. There is no argument in favour of the duty from a revenue point of view, and as the industry does not seem to require protection, I am prepared to vote for this article being placed on the free list.",22,Tariff

I never wished the committee to understand that that opinion was held by medical men. MrM c C AY (Corinella) -As to the figures which have been quoted, showing the relative prices in Sydney and Melbourne on 1st September, 1901, I would point out that the 2d. per lb. levied in Victoria was a revenue duty, arrowroot not being manufactured in this State. MrA . C. GROOM -It is not a revenue duty now. MrM c CAY figures which were quoted in order to show the weakness of the Victorian duty of 2d., and the virtue of the free-list in New South Wales; and I am drawing attention to the further fact than when we impose revenue duties, which members of the Opposition so strongly advocate, the consumer certainly does pay an enhanced price. Now that Australia is federated, and the article is manufactured within our border, there will be no chance of making the consumer pay the duty, because there is no necessity for duty to be paid by anybody. As to the prices on 10th October, I should like to see a current price-list issued by the trade,and not a typewritten statement. I am not in a position to either confirm or contradict the statement as to the price being i d . per lb. in Melbourne and Sydney on date; but accepting the first comparative figures as correct, for the purposes of argument, an explanation can be found in the fact that the 2d. per lb. in Victoria was a purely revenue duty.

Honourable members appear to forget that the duty will be levied only upon the imported article, and that it is directed against the cheap labour of the West Indies and other places. that the duty increases the price of the article that is made here. we take the duty off arrowroot we shall also have to admit cornflour free. We know that cornflour is made in the old world from diseased potatoes, and that arrowroot is a much more pure and wholesome article of food. If arrowroot is placed on the free I am now referring to the list we shall find our markets flooded with the products of coloured labour in other parts of the world, whereas if the duty is retained a promising industry will be encouraged and the price will not be increased to the consumer.

MrA . M c LEAN We have not removed the duties on butter and wheat because they do no harm. Before we.imposed these duties we were large importers of those articles, but within a very reasonable time we became large exporters. We admit that the imposition of duties will increase prices at the outset, but as soon as we supply our own requirements local competition will become sufficiently keen to keep prices down.

It can also be successfully produced on the northern rivers of New South Wales.

Then Queensland began to produce it . The enormous superiority of the Queensland article at once enabled it to command a market. Of course, the protective duty imposed only benefited the industry in Queensland. When the Queensland arrowroot came to Victoriai t had to pay a duty of 2d. per lb. In all the Southern States, where it was subject to purely revenue duties, these were added to the price, and that fact accounts for the difference in cost which has already been referred to. Victoria? ate of Victoria is too cold for its successful culture. The cultivation of arrowroot being pre-eminently a primary industry, in which small men are engaged, the duty proposed will simply have the effect, not of interfering permanently with the price of the article, but of keeping out of the country inferior brands which might otherwise come from abroad, and which no doubt are being imported into Western Australia at the present time. In Queensland and Northern New South Wales the output can be increased to an indefinite extent. 'Consequently local competition will regulate the price, and result in the public being supplied with an article equal in quality to that obtainable in any part of the world, and superior to that of most places. that the Government will not give way in connection with this duty. I assure honourable members that the growing and manufactures of arrowroot havebecomean industry of siderable magnitude in Queensland since an import duty was placed upon that commodity. Prior to the imposition of that duty, although the industry had been in existencefor 30 years, it was anything but a success. Since then, however, it has taken very deeproot in that State, and if the duty is concontinued for a few years longer, I am inclined to believe that it will thrive withoutit.

I am, however, given tounderstand that it is the intention of morethan one planter in that locality to-erect new factories conditionally upon the I d . per lb. impost being retained. The industry is essentially a small farmer's industry, the area under cultivation in Queensland being divided amongst a considerable number of families. Altogether there are 700 acres under arrowroot cultivation there, and if this protective duty is retained, the industry' will become a very important one. Hardly any other than white labour is employed in this connection. Last year the production amounted to 772,280"" lbs., out of -which 463,617 lbs. were exported. I hope that the committee will allow the duty to stand. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I remember that this particular industry has been I believe that the climthe subject of discussion several times in the Queensland Parliament, and it has always been referred to as a sort of one-horse, industry.

We were told the other day that in the country where there is the highest protection, the negroes employed in the tobacco and cigar trade are paid starvation wages, and now we find that in a Queensland industry the wages are 12s. 6d. per week. If these wages are all that a duty on arrowroot will give, this is not a native industry we need care anything about. This commodity is found upon almost every table throughout the Commonwealth, and surely we ought not to ask the people to pay a duty for the purpose of providing work at such a rate of remuneration. We are told now that more protection will enable better wages to be paid ; but there is more protection now than If Queensland supheretofore, and yet, with an increase in the price, we haA'e lieard of no increase in the wages. The honourable and learned member for Corinella says that it is the importer who adds to the price ; but if the grower or manufacturer in Queensland had not added to his price, the, importer could not very well have asked for more from the consumer, because, in that case, other people would have started to import at the enI did not say that; I hanced profit.

If we turn to the table of the imports of South Australia, we find that out of the total of 213,000 lbs., 126,000 lbs. came from New South Wales. Therefore, we have evidence that in New South Wales, protection was not required to stimulate the industry, because that State seems to be a large exporter. It is a large importer chiefly in connection with BrokenH ill . is another matter in this connection which we ought to consider. Four of the States are exporters of bacon and ham, and upon the principle that an exporting country does not need to he protected, that is an argument in favor of those articles being placed upon the free list. Although Western Australia, as a matter of fact, imports in excess of exports £85,000 worth of bacon and ham, in New South Wales the excess value of the imports is £14,000 only. Tasmania, which is theotherimportingState, only takes an excess of £3,000 worth of bacon and ham from outside. We see, therefore, which 2d. per lb. has proved that the great importing State is Western Australia, that New South Wales is practically not an importing State at all, and that four out of the six States are exporters. Therefore, it appears to me, that the free-trade case is pretty strong. South Australia enjoys the highest protection. In that .State the duty is I d . per lb. more than is now proposed, and I know upon the evidence of a merchant, that they cannot produce in large quantities a good quality of bacon and ham there. Comparatively speaking, the biggest imI would specially ask him if he portation from England is into South Australia. In view of these considerations, the argument is in favour of placing bacon and ham upon the free list. to point out the position in regard to Western Australia. The total quantity of bacon and hams imported into that State in 1900 was 3,191,658 lbs. This was actually the produce of Australia. The quantity imported from the United Kingdom and other places outside the Commonwealth totalled only 150,941 lbs., notwithstanding the duty of 2d. per lb., which I suppose I find that of the total export of was imposed for protective purposes. That duty was fixed by the present Minister for Defence, with the view of producing revenue, The carriage of bacon is and as a protection to the local growers. A t the same time Western Australia imported very large quantities from the other 1 States, and we ought not to increase the duty, seeing that these hams are used on the gold-fields and in the back country, where in many instances fresh meat is very scarce.

159,Mr Kingston,"The honourable memapproach us. All I can say at this moment is that we regret that our relations with New Zealand .are not as close .as they are with the States of the Commonwealth. We should have been delighted to see New Zealand a member of the Federation in the first instance; and not only this Government, but any Government which happens to be in power, would undoubtedly give the most friendly consideration to any suggestion from that colony for more intimate relations with the Commonwealth. I feel that I am simply interpreting the wishes of all who have considered the question, but the honourable member for Tasmania will not expect me to say more on the subject. As to the amount of duty on this particular item, the honourable member for Wentworth has pointed out that 2d. is prohibitive. Sir WILLIAM 2d. very nearly approached prohibition. ber for Fremantle, MrE . Solomon, has urged that we ought not to cause the burden of taxation to fall on the backs of those, who are unable to bear it . I venture 'to think that the question chiefly resolves itself into one of taxing the 'dearer hams and bacon. These will be introduced and consumed by persons who can afford to pay for them under all circumstances, and may be regarded as absolute luxuries. To talk about those gentlemen who introduce these dearer hams and bacon, and who scorn the local product, as persons on whom the burden of taxation will bear, too heavily, is suggesting a state of things it is impossible to seriously contemplate. This is a question of taxing highly superior and much-desired articles, which are seldom secured except by those who can well afford to pay for them, and who will not unduly feel a little additional taxation. tation ? revenue from those who use these articles will be particularly agreeable. We cannot give too much attention to a duty of this sort, which is important to Queensland and other States, which have been mentioned as producing excellent articles of this description. I was sorry to hear the remark which fell from the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, as to the worth of our South Australian product, but of course that is a matter of taste, and tastes differ. I am happy, however, to be able to quote, against the honourable member, the opinion of the acting leader of the Opposition as to the value of our products. When the honourable member for North Sydney suggests that it is necessary to have competition with the outside world in order to secure the quality of our hams and bacon, he is suggesting a position which cannot be seriously defended. When the States were divided, and each had its little market with small competition, something of the sort might possibly have occurred; but the removal of the fiscal boundaries of the States will, I venture to think, supply that keenness of competition which the honourable member suggests is necessaiy to secure excellence. The Australian article is excellent already, and if further competition be desired for the purpose of perfecting it that competition will be provided by the means I have mentioned -' support the amendment, and I only regret that tlie proposal is not to remove the whole of the duty. The estimated revenue from this item is very small. We ought not to rely for revenue upon duties upon the necessaries of life. Looking at the matter from a purely protectionist point of view, there is no necessity for a duty on bacon and hams, any more than on mutton, and why the Minister for Trades and Customs has not proposed a duty of 3d. per lb. on mutton I do not know. There should be no necessity to import any bacon into the Commonwealth. There is ample scope and opportunity for the production of all the ham and bacon that we consume. I have a letter here, dated 17th October, from the BrokenH ill Chilled Butter and Produce Company, who ask whether something cannot be done to get r i d of the differential railway rates that are now charged on the South Australian lines. If a ton of SouthI think a little extra Australian bacon is sent from Adelaide to BrokenH ill , the railway freight is £ 1 17s. 7d., but if the bacon should happen to come from New South Wales or Victoria, or New Zealand, the freight is £ 5 14s. 5d. Therefore, the South Australian bacon-curers have had the protection of not only the import duty of i d . per lb., but of £ 4 per ton in the shape of a preferential railway charge. Still they have not been able to supply their own market or the requirements of BrokenH ill . Whether this arises from",33,Pairs

The editor of the Agricultural Gazette, of New South Wales, informed me recently that there was no more profitable occupation in Australia than that of growing pigs. The proprietor of a poultry farm, near Sydney, who also rears pigs, informed me that his pigs were more profitable than his poultry. No protection was afforded by the New' South Wales Tariff, and yet he could make a profit. If our own people will not produce bacon, let us get it from those outside who can supply us, and not charge our consumers 2d. per lb. more for the sake of protecting those who do not deserve any protection. This duty is of very little consequence from a revenue point Of view, because the total amount expected to be raised under it is only about £1,100, and the people will have to pay considerably more for their bacon in order to benefit the revenue to that slight extent. not risen I d . since the Tariff. use from a protective point of view. Treasurer is finding that his Estimates, which were challenged some time ago, requite considerable revision.. He expects to receive £ 6 2 from this duty in Western Australia, evidently assuming that British and foreign produce will cease to be imported, and that the requirements of Western Australia will be met by supplies from the eastern States. I quite appreciate the Treasurer's view, and I also understand the information which was volunteered by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who seemed to think that honourable members on this side were quite ignorant of the effects of the sliding scale. The Government are imposing a duty of I d . per lb. more than was levied under the Western Australian Tariff, and whilst I admit that that will operate against the bacon and hams introduced from Great Britain, it certainly will not have the full effect the Treasurer seems to anticipate. If it operates at all, it will obliterate the revenue entirely. port a very small quantity from Great country. Now that these industries are Britain. operates at all, we shall, import a larger quantity than will yield £ 6 2 in the way of revenue. I want to show that this duty is not required from a protectionist point of view. 1 wish to show the Treasurer that, with a duty of 2d. per lb. against the eastern States, the produce from those States will more than hold its own. Last year, Western Australia imported only 20,123 lbs. of bacon of British and foreign produce, as against 2,800,000 lbs. odd, the produce of the eastern States. The quantity imported from beyond the Commonwealth limits, therefore, is practically a drop in the bucket. The position in regard to hams is almost equally decisive. Last year the hams of British and foreign produce imported into Western Australia totalled 130,817 lbs., as against 378,593 lbs. imported from the eastern States. I contend; therefore, that this duty is not required, even from a protective point of view. That being so, it is an unnecessary burden ; and, therefore, I hope the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth will be MrA . C. GROOM (Flinders) I find that the quantity of bacon imported into The Victoria for 'the year 1900 totalled 21,074 lbs., as against 2,205,474 lbs. exported. The total quantity exported by this State to foreign countries during the same period was 183;749 lbs. ; showing that the duty of 2d. per lb. which has been in operation was not required at all, and was absolutely prohibitive so far as the imports from foreign countries were concerned. I shall certainly vote for the amendment. hardly an item in-the Tariff which will affect the southern parts of Queensland and the northern portions of New South Wales more than does this one. I speak on behalf of the southern portion of Queensland-for that""locality which is called the ""Maize Country,"" and which is the great pigraising district of Australia. So far, all the speeches which have been delivered have been in favour of the consumer. But we must not forget that the man who is a settler upon the soil, together with his family, are consumers also. During the great banking crisis of 1593, it was the pig assuming decent proportions, it would be",34,Mcmillan I Said That

169,Mr Wilkinson (Moreton),"There iscruel to take away that measure of protection which they have hitherto enjoyed, and to throw them into competition with the outside world. If we turn to statistics we shall find that settlement upon the landwhich is the most desirable form of settlement that a country can have-ha s been greatly stimulated by travelling dairies and ham and bacon factories in Queensland. I would further point cut to honourable members opposite that, after a short time, internal competition will bring down the price of any article which is produced local iy, and that fact has been abundantly proved in Queensland, where excellent bacon and ham can be purchased at as low a figure as it can be bought at in any other part of Australia. If we allow this industry to come into competition with the outside world it will certainly suffer injury. I hope that the Ministry will not consent to any reduction in the duty. worth) I can prove to the honourable member for Moreton that the imposition of this duty will make no difference whatever 1 to the State from which he comes. For ?iearly twelve months past it has been almost impossible to get bacon from Queensland into the market of New South Wales, because the people of the former State consume the whole of its product. A t tlie present time probably the best bacon in all Australia is produced in Queensland. To-day, without any duty at all, Queensland can hold her own against either New South Wales or New Zealand; and consequently it does not make the slightest difference, so far as the northern State is concerned, whether or not there is a duty. In 1900 Queensland imported 57,268 lbs. of bacon, and exported 1,650,000 lbs., and at the present time there is not one-tenth of the quantity of Queensland bacon going into New South Wales which that State would take if it could get it . The Minister for Trade and Customs when he talked of bacon must have meant ham, because he spoke of taxing the higher-quality article used by the extremely voluptuous man. portation of bacon from beyond the sea, except from New Zealand. There"" may be a small quantity of ham imported, but even that has been decreasing ; and practically the ham manufactured in Victoria and Queensland is equal to any which can be imported. I honestly believe that, 22 t except in times of drought, or in times of great necessity, we could afford, without injuring the industry in Australia, to put this article on the free-list. But I recognise the fact that this is regarded as a revenue item, and there is no use in attempting prohibition. No honourable member will have the temerity to say that in dealing with this Tariff every possible item should be raised to such a rate as to prohibit the foreign article ; but really that is what honourable members are trying to do. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I hope the acting leader of the Opposition will not press the amendment. So far as Queensland is concerned, this duty has done more than any other to assist agriculturists engaged in this industry. I know the honourable member is eager to give every assistance to the farmer ; and I would point out to him that in Queensland this industry had practically no existence until there was imposed a duty, which, however, was by no means prohibitive. I understand that the honourable member for Flinders is an advocate of moderate duties, and I appeal to him not to support the amendment. The possibilities of this industry are practically unlimited. There are four States In Australia which Queensland ought to be able to supply, and we have the country, the foodstuffs, and the factories, not long established, with men of the requisite skill. Last year Queensland exported 1,229,890 lbs. of bacon, of which New South Wales took 1,039,972 lbs.; and 61,671 lbs. went to the Philippine Islands. to understand what underlies the proposals of the Government in matters of this kind. We ' have here an industry, granted to be of considerable importance, which has thrived under a duty of 2d. per lb. An y one who wishes to produce pork can do it with advantage under such a duty; and if, in addition, we can get a little revenue, and also perhaps slightly ease the priceto the consumer, I cannot As a matter of fact, there is no imunderstand why the Government refrain from taking advantage of the occasion. We have been taunted from the other side that we are objecting principally to revenue duties, but it would be well for the people of Australia to fully realize that it is this policy of protection run mad which kills Kevenue.",35,Mcmillan I Said That
