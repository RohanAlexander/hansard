' about the new traineeship and apprenticeship schemes which the present federal government has announced in the federal budget. As we all know, of course, the number of apprenticeships in Australia has dropped to the lowest level per capita in 30 years. Some of the training schemes that were in vogue under the previous government did not seem to be able to do anything about this situation. In my electorate, there are communities whose very future depends on having skilled tradesmen.",137,Representatives Main Commitiee
300,Mr Hicks (Riverina) (10.00 A.m.),"I finished my speech yesterday by saying somethingWednesday, 9 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 5123 What we are worried about in rural Australia is the setting up of industrial bases: light industry and heavy industry. Even on the farm, because it is a highly technical operation now, we must have skilled people. If, in an area where a business is expanding, people find they cannot get skilled tradesmen, there is a very fair chance they will move out of that area and move into the capital cities, thus increasing the problems of the capital cities and helping rural Australia to die. I am certainly very pleased to learn about the new apprenticeship schemes the federal government is going to implement. One of the other major problems facing rural Australia is the matter of the provision of health facilities and, particularly, of doctors. Under the federal government's budget proposals there will be a comprehensive initiative to boost rural health, including scholarships to attract more doctors to rural areas, and six university departments of rural health. The first ones have been announced in Mount Isa and in Broken Hill, which was formerly in my electorate. We are very pleased to hear about that. It is great news for those areas facing a shortage of doctors. In many areas, the doctors who have been working there for many years are getting older and they will be looking to retire very shortly, and this will increase the problem. The government has recognised that problem and is taking urgent steps to attract doctors to rural areas, and it is delivering policies aimed at achieving that goal. There was a scare campaign before the federal election that Medicare offices would be closing in a number of areas. We have heard nothing about that from the coalition. In fact, when I questioned the minister about that, he said there was certainly no list and he did not know who would prepare the list for those Medicare offices that were to close. Certainly, we are hoping that, in some areas where we do not have Medicare offices, the pharmacies will be able to handle that situation. The other thing I would like to mention is national child immunisation. Presently, it is a disgrace in Australia that we are one of the most advanced nations on earth but that immunisation has dropped dramatically, probably to its lowest ebb in many years. People are taking a risk with their children and with our community. I know there are a number of people who do not believe in immunisation, but most of the problem is apathy. We really have to get out amongst the community and make sure that those young children who can be immunised against diseases that we thought were gone some years ago are protected from those diseases. If they are, of course, it will save a lot of anguish, heartache and illness within our community. I have touched on many things in the budget. There are plenty of other things I could talk about, but one of the things I would like to speak about is a matter touched on in question time yesterday by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) under the heading of Aboriginal stolen children. I think the title is very unfortunate. I would like to mention a matter that is something I do not talk about much: my own experience about 45 years ago. I must say that it is diabolical, there is no doubt about it: to have to take children from parents is a very difficult situation. I will tell you my own story because I think it touches on this very subject. When I was a young boy of 10 years of age I was taken from my parents. The reason I was taken from them was because they could not look after me. It was just unfortunate. My parents had difficulties-I will not go into those now-and I was taken from them and put into an orphanage because the powers that be at the time believed I had a far better opportunity of surviving, of being educated and not ending up in gaol. That is as it was at that time. And, as I say, I am not saying this for any other reason than because it really upset me when people were calling these children 'stolen children'. 5124 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 October 1996 That was the way it was done in those days. If your parents could not care for you, the authorities came along, took you from your parents and put you into an orphanage. It was traumatic-there is no doubt about that. I can remember it as if it was yesterday. I do get a little bit upset about this. I spent the first year in the orphanage crying every night, as did most of the children there. So it is very traumatic. AndI remember that my parents were crying when we left them. I spent five years in that situation. But, when you think about it, what was the alternative-you could not eat, you could not be educated, you could become a criminal, you could wander around the streets. It would be a tragedy if this was done based on the colour of someone's skin. But I must say that, in those days, it would have been better for me if I had been taken from my parents at an earlier age than 10, because then I could perhaps have had some loving family that would have adopted me, taken me in and given me all those things that young people should have. I really do think these people who took these children really did it with the best of intentions. I do not think there was any malice or anything else about it. I think it was done the same as it was done with me. Now, whom do you blame for this? Do you blame the parents? You cannot blame the parents, poor souls. They probably were in a situation where they could not provide those things that, in that time and age, people thought were needed for the upbringing of a child in the community. Do you blame the people who took those children away? That was the age and that was what they believed was the thing that had to be done to ensure a future for those children. Whom do you blame? Do you blame governments? I do not think you can blame anyone. I think it was one of those things that happened. It was unfortunate, it was traumatic, but I think it was done with the best intention. I might be totally wrong, but that is the way I see it. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.07 to 10.45 a.m. enough. I have not said it as eloquently as I would have wished to have said it, but that is a chapter in our history that is very sad. It is a chapter that we must record in our history books and make sure that it never happens again, but I think it is wise if we let the phantoms lie. I do not think that it is good for Australia that we continue down that vein, because it does not only affect Aboriginal children but also children right across the broad spectrum of the community. I will leave that subject there. I would just like to wind up by saying that I congratulate John Howard and Peter Costello on their budget. I think it augurs well for Australia. I ask the Senate to ensure the swift passage of our bills and not to try and hold them up. I know there are all sorts of reasons why they would want to hold them up; but, when you are in government and you have a large majority in the House of Representatives, you should be able to get on with the agenda. If it is not a successful agenda, it is up to the people in a democracy at the next election to make sure we do not make that mistake again. I will leave it there, and I wish John Howard and Peter Costello every success in all their endeavours, particularly for the future welfare of the people of Australia. contribution is the reality of representing a seat in western Sydney.

302,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (10.46 A.m.),"My fundamental accent in this budgetWednesday, 9 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 5125 clearly gave a delineation of the growth of the inequity within Sydney, within regions and between suburbs. That of course followed articles in the past year or so which also went to the different levels of crime, burglaries, car thefts, et cetera, between the poorer western suburbs of Sydney and the more affluent areas. The comparative article they did earlier was about Baulkham Hills. This budget fundamentally re-emphasises this trend. This basically condemns Australia to a drift towards private provision of public services. It indicates to us a future of isolated, entrenched, wealthier communities, perhaps reinforced by private police forces and security-a clear growth of concentration leading to ghettos of unemployment and ethnic concentrations within the western suburbs of Sydney. It reinforces a lack of interest in, and a lack of help for, the unemployed; and that is reinforced by their concentration in the demographics of Sydney. I do not want to speak about other cities but certainly the demographics of Sydney show the reinforcement of that trend. In my own electorate, for instance, the Municipality of Auburn has unemployment levels of 22 per cent. Whilst Holroyd is significantly below that, and Parramatta is marginally lower still, they are well above the national trend. In this budget contribution I want to mention the decisions by Auburn Council and Parramatta Council at this stage to condemn the budget on a wide variety of aspects. I want to mention that it is politically significant that, on those two councils, only 10 of the 27 aldermen are members of the Labor Party or in any manner affiliated with it. I think that does indicate the wider concern about this budget in western Sydney. I want to concentrate on two aspects of the budget. One of them is the question of the University of Western Sydney, the second largest employer in the whole of the western region after the electricity authority, and an institution which now takes 65 per cent of its students from the western region, where 40 per cent of Sydney's population and 10 per cent of the nation's population reside. It is worth noting that the monumental effort of the Labor Party in creating this university was well overdue. It followed decades of neglect by previous governments, and it followed the rather preposterous decision to site the previous new Sydney university at Ryde, convenient to car-owning North Shore residents and remote from public transport and from those areas in western Sydney where people are dependent upon private buses, which basically go every hour or so and which sometimes during the day have no service for three-hour breaks. The establishment of the University of Western Sydney was fundamentally important to the region. Significantly, one of the initiatives of this government is to attack access to education and thus to reinforce the reality we already have-one which Labor only partially tackled-of great inequities in access. To demonstrate the requirement for that university in western Sydney, while the rest of Sydney offers 32 places per 1,000 inhabitants in tertiary institutions, western Sydney only offers eight-one-quarter of the scale of the rest of Sydney. The University of Western Sydney now takes the highest proportion of non-English speaking background students of any tertiary institution in Sydney. In the last six years it has had 25,000 graduates. Some 58 per cent of the students who attend that institution are the first in their family to undertake tertiary education. It is also worth noting the university's interrelationship with the job question. Some 50 per cent of the graduates subsequently found employment in the western 5126 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 October 1996 region. The university has also made notable active affirmative efforts, with 50 per cent of its academic staff being females. The university has done work in the ethics of organ transplants and donations, on water quality in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment around the seat of Lindsay, on violence in schools, and on juvenile correction centres. It has run hundreds of weekday and weekend courses to reinforce basic accessibility. There is certainly a need for the University of Western Sydney. It is disturbing that this government has attacked tertiary access to such an extent, because a variety of diverse studies in this country have indicated that there is a problem. A paper by Dev Mukherjee, published by the Australian Centre for Equity through Education, gives an overview of the articles and studies in this area. The overview notes the 1987 article by Abbott-Chapman, 'Dropping out or staying on?' The analysis there showed that certain postcode areas were associated with positive or negative retention patterns. In the 1985 article by Carpenter, 'Passing on advantages from parents to children: some Australian data,' Carpenter noted significant differences in examination results between students from the upper white-collar class and those from the lower white-collar and working classes. Citing the results of the Department of Employment, Education and Training paper of 1987 entitled, Completing secondary school in Australia: a socio-economic and regional analysis, Mukherjee says that it reports that: Despite the clear link between socio-economic status and Year 12 completion rates the relationship was not linear or continuous. The lowest seven deciles showed little difference in completion rates but there was a large difference between this group and the highest three deciles. Power, in the 1984 article 'Factors influencing retentivity and satisfaction with schooling,' noted that the average levels of parental education and parental encouragement were high in schools with high retention rates. Beresford, in a 1993 article 'The really hard cases,' concluded that socioeconomic disadvantage was a strong predictor of early school leaving and that multiple disadvantage is likely to include chronic truancy and/or school refusal, unemployment, offending, drug use and emotional disturbance. Finally-not in terms of the number of studies, but in terms of my time today on this matter-Mukherjee, citing the 1993 paper by Teese, McLean and Polesel entitled Equity outcomes, says: ... Teese et al found that pass rates rose up the social status ladder, from a low of 71 % for students whose fathers were unemployed to a high of 88% for those from managerial backgrounds. Mukherjee has produced a significant study which goes to a large number of statistical works on this question. Yet what we are seeing in this budget is an attack upon the University of Western Sydney. That attack has been answered by the Vice-Chancellor. It has been answered by the entire institution. The reality of the government's policies is a lack of access for people in Lindsay, Greenway and Parramatta. The government has a phalanx of policies going in this direction. Those policies are in stark contrast to Labor's performance of a growth rate of 60 per cent in university enrolments for 17to 19-year-olds. Wednesday, 9 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 5127 In this budget, the government seeks cuts of $1.8 billion in the forward estimates. It has massacred the rolling triennium. It has reduced public funding and a pronounced swing is going to occur now with regard to charging full fees. Already the figures are coming through from universities around this country that fewer people are enrolling because of the systematic attempt by this government to move towards fee charging, to move towards favouring the people who can afford to go to universities, and fundamentally at the end of the day to allow places for a larger number of overseas students, to the detriment of Australian students and, more particularly, to the detriment of people in western Sydney. The government has, over a four-year period, reduced operating grants by $620 million-plus, compared to Labor's announced intention. It has, and this is just typical of a philosophical bent, a preoccupation with ideological issues, abolished discretionary funding of $215 million. The independently assessed quality assurance program noted that the outcomes of those discretionary funds for innovative programs were 'overwhelmingly positive'. It talked of 'significant improvements across the sector' and 'a marked improvement in quality assurance policies and practices in teaching and learning,' and said it was 'impressed by the magnitude and extent of attitudinal and procedural change in universities.' The very trenchant cutbacks in the actual degree of public funding of universities, and more particularly the impact that is going to have on the youth of Penrith, the youth of Parramatta and the youth of Granville, are the ways in which the government is giving a very clear signal to most working class and lower middle class children in this country that 'unless your parents can afford to send you to university you will not be going.' As I said, the figures are coming through in this country at the moment. The figures are being answered by universities offering incentives to students to enrol because of the very dramatic downturn in enrolments at this stage. The other thing the government has undertaken is to require from more students payments of their HECS. They have further directed it towards cost recovery-the user pays. They have at the same time hit students who do graduate with the threat that they will be paying back very quickly on levels of income lower than average weekly earnings. So what is the average person going to do in western Sydney, in Lindsay? They are going to question whether they are going to obtain a job out of this degree, they are going to question whether it is worth their while, they are going to question whether their parents can afford to send them there. There are clear indications from the Higher Education Council studies in this area over a long period of time that there will be a very direct impact with regard to lower socio-economic groupings and with regard to rural students. So here we have a very clear policy to deny access, to limit access to tertiary studies. The other matter I want to tum to is the question of employment. In the lead-up to the budget one of the messages the government was trying to give was about the very heavy youth unemployment in this country. It conveniently ignored the reality that we are talking about a very different pool of unemployed youth than we were speaking about a decade ago. We cannot separate the skills, the accomplishment, the employability of these young people from the reality of higher retention rates in education. We are talking about a very different pool of people offering themselves to employers now than we were a decade ago. We are not comparing apples to apples when we say the youth unemployment rate in 1995 or, for that matter, in 2000, is the same as it was in 1980. We also have an international phenomenon that is going to affect Australia and the new Liberal government: it is the reality that international5128 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 October 1996 ly, unless you have skills, unless you have education, there are fewer and fewer jobs available to you. In the lead-up to the budget there was a very strong coalition emphasis on youth unemployment, a supposed offer of hope and many mock tears about its concerns with this issue. But what we have seen since the budget is a very real change of direction, a very real slap in the face for anyone concerned with employment, and there has been a diverse range of ways in which this is shown. It is interesting to note that, in the Senate estimates in the last fortnight, even the Treasury has indicated the picture of retraction in the economy, the dire consequence of the government's cutback from expenditure, is going to be far worse. Although it is not mentioned in the budget papers, under questioning they have indicated that it is going to be worse in two years than it is in the first year. We also have in the Australian of 8 October an article by George Megalogenis which says: Unemployment is in danger of rising above 9 per cent within a few months, based on key figures released yesterdayHe further noted: The ANZ figures have been considered a reliable indicator of future trends in the jobs market. The heading of that article said that the jobless figure might reach nine per cent. The Reserve Bank's new Governor, Ian Macfarlane, has also assailed this remote possibility, this implausible theory, that if you force wages down low enough in this country, if you smash the unions firmly enough, if you reduce conditions in a wide enough spectrum then, at the end of the day, it will create employment in this country. I think we have seen the attempt in the United States by those who are the intellectual inspiration of these people to go down that way. The severe retraction of wages in America has had no correlation in employment growth. This budget does assail the unemployed in a very wide variety of measures. It takes the government to a large degree out of employment service provision. It says that only those people that have been unemployed and suffered long enough-for a year-will get essential services. It essentially goes to a pattern where those people who are viewed as unemployable, who have the most disabilities, will not be serviced. In my electorate, the Granville CES office, which has been closed, is indicative of the historic pattern of assistance by the CES to unemployed people. It would have had 50 years of existence next year, through Labour and Liberal governments, but now it goes on the scrap heap-part of a pattern to deny assistance to young people. If there was any sincerity and interest by this government in employment beyond the theory of reducing wages in this country so we can compete with Indonesia and the Philippines, and we do not have to compete with Taiwan and Korea in the educated, highly paid part of the market, then they would not do one of the most harmful, most negative things possible. That is, to take away the $200 employment and education access help for unemployed people. How can they have any interest in unemployed people in this country if they deny them even that $200 payment to enter employment? We also have Alan Mitchell's comment on 2 September that bringing unemployment below eight per cent was going to be a lot harder than it looked. His analysis was that it will only fall to 8.1 per cent on the most realistic scenario. Of equal plausibility, quite frankly, is the Wednesday, 9 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 5129 alternative that with growth of 3IA per cent a year, the reality will be far worse. This contrasts with Labor's perfonnance-not over six months, not over one year, but over a decade and more--of four per cent annual growth, an internationally creditable fall in unemployment from 11 to 8Y2 per cent, and a concurrent increase in total employment of three per cent a year. I would posit that this is genuinely more attractive than the perfonnance under the previous Howard sojourn, of 10.7 per cent inflation, unemployment of 10 per cent and a deterioration in social wage expenditure of a massive 17.5 per cent, including the legendary refusal to pass on a CPI payment to the country's pensioners. However, the budget performance is even more to be assailed for its hypocrisy and the assault it makes on those condemned to unemployment due to the government's policies. Over a four-year period, under the guise of concern that some labour market policies were not effective enough and under slogans of creating real jobs-whatever they are-the administration throws 30,000 public servants and their families on the scrap heap and, at the same time, slashes $1.8 billion over four years from employment programs in this country. How can the Australian electorate possibly construe that they are sincere in being concerned with employment when they are cutting back nearly $2 billion in help, supposedly because some schemes do not work? If some schemes do not work, why don't you replace them with those that will operate, that will succeed? We know that Minister Vanstone, in attempts to cover up this attack on labour market programs, has been shown to have misled the parliament by indicating that, before the last elections, Labor had access to information indicating that it knew its target of five per cent was not possible. Subsequently, it has been shown that the advice the government did receive before the election told it, from the growth patterns the previous government had had, that five per cent was quite possible, quite plausible, quite feasible. This government, indicative of its priorities, says, 'Oh, targets are too hard; it is false.' That might be construed as having some validity if there were some interest, some activity, by the government. As I indicated previously, there is no activity; there is, in fact, the reality of a very big attack on unemployed people. It is interesting to note that the study of Skillshare by Access Economics shows clear evidence of that program's effectiveness in helping the long-tenn unemployed through its ability to give that target group employment in a significant period after training.
