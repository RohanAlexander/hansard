Can he indicate the extent to which the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will participate in the investigations that will be made in connection with that project ? statement of the Premier of Queensland, to which the honourable member has referred. Preliminary surveys of the resources of the Burdekin Valley by the Queensland Bureau of Investigation have indicated that an irrigation .project -of very considerable magnitude may be developed in that valley. A dam site has been located at .a point 99 miles up stream. dam, at a wall height of 100 feet, will impound 2,500,000 acre feet of water, and at 126 feet 5,000,000 acre feet of water. An area of 400,000 acres of good land is potentially commanded by irrigation water. A further area of from 250,000 to 300,000 acres is subject to periodic floods, the effects of which could bo mitigated by flood control works. The Council for been requested by the Queensland Government to co-operate with the and Stocki n an effort to determine the agricultural possibilities of the irrigable lands of the Burdekin Valley.

4,Mr Dedman,"I have seen thetropical fruits does not appear desirable; but it is considered that there are definite for meeting the cost of equipment and possibilities for tobacco production in the Ayr district. It is also considered that, with irrigation, the Burdekin Valley is likely to become a major beef cattle fattening area, and as the region is practically frost-free, tropical pasture plants can be expected to make vigorous growth under irrigation for a high proportion of the year. I have approved that the Division of Plant Industry shall proceed to undertake investigations on irrigated pasture and fodder crop production on the Ayr farm, recently acquired from the Commonwealth Disposals Commission by the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock, in co-operation with that department. draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that the Minister is making a statement in answer to a question. I ask whether this is designed to cut across the rules of the House, under which a Minister must obtain the approval of the House before making such a statement. If that practice is to be allowed to become associated with the answering of questions, I suggest that you, sir, should take some steps to limit such obviously prepared answers. the Standing Orders to prevent a Minister from making a statement when answering a question. I have always held that many questions and answers are too long, but there is nothing in the Standing Orders to limit them. tions will include research as to the value of certain selected grasses, and legumes under grazing conditions; a study of fodder crops, both grasses and legumes; and a determination of the value in grazing trials of grass-legume mixtures as irrigated pastures. It is prois dated the 15th September, 1947? posed that the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock shall provide the land and the basic facilities for the investigation and also meet the cost of acquisition, clearing and management of the Ayr farm and of all other areas required. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will be responsible materials required for the conduct of the work. For the first year it is estimated that £5,383 will be provided by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and £5,142 by the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock. The greater part of the cost will be in respect of equipment and fencing, and the annual commitment of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the subsequent four years is estimated at approximately £2,000. Should the investigational work indicate the feasibility of producing irrigated pastures and fodder crops for the fattening of beef cattle, or the production of dairy produce, the way would be open for an economic development of great magnitude which would directly and beneficially affect the beef cattle industry of Northern Australia. Minister's statement in this House last week that neither he nor the Attorney General had any idea that Judge Sugerman intended to resign from the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration until the week-end before he tendered his resignation, and also that at the time when Judge Kirby was conducting an inquiry into land sales control and while he was preparing his report there was no indication that Judge Sugerman would resign, I now ask the right honourable gentleman whether he is aware that Judge Sugerman's resignation from, and Judge Kirby's appointment to, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court were announced in the press on the 28th August, 1947. Further, is he aware that Judge Kirby's report as a royal commissioner is signed "" R. C. Kirby, Judges Chambers, Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, Sydney"", and day that, so far as I was aware, the first indication I had of the possibility of Judge Sugerman resigning was one weekend when he was in Canberra.

There may be some factors of which I had no personal knowledge, but the honourable member for Reid may rest assured that I will examine all phases of the matter. It is only fair to say that I had heard six or seven months ago that Judge Sugerman was not happy in his work in the Arbitration Court because it required him to live in Melbourne. I had not regarded the Melbourne climate as possessing sufficient disadvantages to justify a man's resignation from his position, and therefore I did not take the report very seriously. I heard no more about it until I was informed that Judge Sugerman had been here at the week-end. There had heen no talk of the appointment of Judge Kirby until then. As I have said, I shall examine the points raised by the honourable member. It may be that some of the dates associated with the affair did not come readily to my mind. I will give the honourable member a full reply later. the Opposition)-by leave-Some little time ago, the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), made a series of allegations of .a most particular kind against Senator Amour regarding his conduct when abroad representing this country. They were allegations of a very grave kind, and they have subsequently been the subject of a statement by the honourable senator in the Senate. Naturally, I have no need to say that I matters myself, but I have been very concerned as, I think, many honourable members have been, at the existence of these allegations, uninvestigated and undetermined. It is a matter in which the Parliament has a great interest. It is a matter which, I suggest, cannot be allowed to rest where it is. If the allegahas made a clear statement in the Senate, tions made in the House against the honourable senator are in substance untrue, a very grievous injustice has been done to him, and a very grave injustice done to AusUp to that tralia, because the remarks of the honourable member for New England have been published. If , on the other hand, the allegations are true in substance, a great injustice has been done to Australia by the honourable senator's appointment, and by his conduct. I desire to say not one word that would prejudice a decision on the matter. I have only a nodding acquaintance with Senator Amour, and I have no personal feeling in the matter. The Parliament as a whole is affected by allegations of this kind being in circulation. I put it to the Prime Minister that it is a matter upon which further information can, undoubtedly, readily be. got. It is said, I do not kuow whether rightly or not, that there was on this aeroplane at this time a senior civil servant, a man of repute. It is said that a report was prepared on this incident which, undoubtedly, the Prime Minister can obtain. I suggest that this matter ought not, in the interests of everybody, be allowed to rest where it is. It should be cleared up so that if an injustice has been done it can be put right, and if the charges are well founded consequential action can be taken by the Government. Minister and Treasurer) -by leaveThe matter mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) was, deplorably, raised and given publicity by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) on the basis of newspaper statements. I believe that it is a very bad principle for an honourable member to join with certain newspapers which very often exaggerate such matters. That is the business of journalists, to put at least some colour into what they write. know nothing of these That is part of their profession, to make statements of that character without offering any proof except the mere publication of the report itself.

35,Mr Abbott,"I ask for the courtesytwo parts, firstly, incidents that occurred Honourable members of this House must, at the aerodrome at San Francisco, and, secondly, incidents that happened on the aeroplane prior to the ejection of Senator Amour. I desire to quote the words of a witness in relation to the incident that occurred at the aerodrome. At the aerodrome at San Francisco there is a bar and a coffee room out, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member is not proceeding with his personal explanation but is endeavouring to use the opportunity given to him to make a personal explanation further to defame a member of this Parliament. orable member for New England bas complained of certain words used by the Prime Minister. I think the words complained of were that the matter was deplorably raised and given publicity on the basis of newspaper statements. The honourable member for New England is now covering ground not covered by the newspaper statements. referred went with some friends to the royalty. One of the Americans said bar at the airport at San Francisco for "" What about Mountbatten ? "", to which a drink before eating their evening meal. he replied that Australians would not The witness states that Senator Amour have Mountbatten. He discussed with was in the bar talking to two or three the Americans the advantages of living American aerodrome personnel in overin Australia.' In reply to a question by alls. The witness states that Senator one of the Americans, he said that there Amour was drinking double whiskies, were plenty of houses for migrants. that he was ordering them two at a time, drinking one and pouring the other one like to know whether a member of this into a coca cola bottle, which the witness chamber is entitled to defame another believes was empty. that the honourable member for New uncorroborated testimony of an unnamed England has exceeded what is necessary person. This raises an important issue, to make a personal explanation in order and 1 submit that the forms of the House to demonstrate that his previous stateshould not he used for this purpose. ments were not based on newspaper reports.

I ask the honourable member for New England to continue. say that Senator Amour's conversation got louder and that he told the Americans that American working men were fools because they were not properly organized as they were in Australia where they had successfully "" outed"" the capitalists. Senator Amour then pointed out that he had joined the Army in World WarI . when sixteen, and after a few months' service was wounded and thrown out of the army with a miserable pension. In this war, with a Lahour government, the returned men, he said, had been treated very much better. perfectly fair to the honourable senator by giving the whole of the conversation as the witness heard it.

The gentleman who has given me this information says that one memher of the party was so disgusted with Senator Amour that he frowned at him. contend that an honorahle member is not entitled to read from a letter from a person whose name has not been disclosed to the House.

The honourable member for New England may just as well read the statements that he is quoting as repeat policeman hooked his arm with his own. them. had frowned at Senator Amour states that he was called over by the honourable senator, who asked why he had looked at him like that. The gentleman, while very polite, said that he thought it was about time that he got out of the bar. Senator Amour's answer was, "" You are a bloody 'pommy', not an Australian, and we don't want people like you in the country"". The gentleman repeated his suggestion to the senator but he took no notice. Senator Amour asked the Americans to have a drink with him, but they refused. Senator Amour then put his hand in his pocket and threw a lot of dollars on the table saying"" Look! We've got plenty of money "". This gentleman informs me that Senator Amour then produced a kind of document with .a large red seal on it. He began waving the document about and said""Look at my paper, signed by my old friend Ben Chifley "". The gentleman then left and went into a coffee shop. Senator Amour went in and had a cup of coffee and a "" swig"" out of a coca cola bottle into which he had previously been pouring whisky. He then disappeared. The gentleman did not see him again until he got on the aeroplane. As he took his seat, Senator Amour was going out of the aeroplane followed by the captain. Standing Order 272 statesNo member shall use offensive words against either House of Parliament or any member thereof, or against any Statute, unless for the purpose of moving for its repeal, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on members shall be considered highly disorderly. That is my point of order. of order involved. story, the captain followed Senator Aim our down the steps from the aeroplane where a United States police officer was standing. The captain turned to return to the aeroplane. Senator Amour was at the bottom of the steps with the policeman. As the captain turned to go up the steps Amour took a step forward with his arm raised, but the The captain returned to the aeroplane. The door was closed and the aeroplane went off, leaving Senator Amour with the policeman. Those are incidentsreported to me as having taken place on the aerodrome at San Francisco. I now give honourable members a short resume of incidents that took place in the aeroplane according to one witness. -Senator Amour, he states, had a window seat in the aeroplane. He states that the honourable senator was "" roaringly drunk "". In the aeroplane he was asking various passengers for matches to light a cigarette, although the warning lights against smoking were showing prior to the start. The passengers would not give him any. He then found a book of matches and was going to light a cigarette. In spite of the warnings of the hostess, he disregarded her and insisted on a "" d'raw "". One of the passengers is said to have protested to him about lighting a cigarette. He was then said to have attempted to strike this passenger a blow. The passenger is said to have pushed Senator Amour back into his seat. The second time Senator Amour got up, he is said to have knocked his head on the rack and fallen back in his seat. I am told that he then lay back in his seat and kicked the passenger in the stomach. The commander is then",15,Government Members Hear Hear

He is alleged to have aimed a blow at the commander. door wasshut and the aeroplane flown off. I have seen all these gentlemen. Another passenger informs me that Senator Amour was very drunk at San Francisco. He pirached' a passenger and made a swipe at the commander. He says the hostess got h i m off the aeroplane and that his luggage was put off with him. As soon as he was off, the door was shut and the engine started and the aeroplane went off. In my personal explanation I desire to say that these allegations have never been published in any newspaper in this country. game to publish them. posite cannot take it . They show they are lacking in courage, if they w ill not allow me to express the truth to the people of this nation. These gentlemen were on the aeroplane and they are reputable citizens. If the Prime Minister honourable member for New England was granted leave to make a personal explanation, not to indulge in personal abuse of a member of this Parliament. made certain charges. I too could read from a piece of paper as the honourable member is doing and say that some one bad made certain statements. I contend that the honourable member is entitled to make a personal explanation, but not to indulge in personal abuse of the lowest character. member for New England claimed the right to make a personal explanation based on a statement by the Prime Minister that he had deplorably raised and given publicity to certain statements. statement. he is endeavouring to show that his statements were not based on newspaper reports. The House has the matter in its own hands. The Chair is not going to l i m it the rights of honourable -members in making personal explanations: ister that there must be a report by the captain of theaircraft, which was an The Australian aircraft. It is allvery well for the Prime Minister to say that he would have to send to Americaf o r in formation. There must he a report in the log of the captain, and it is the duty of the Prime Minister to produce it to honourable members so that they shall know whether my allegations are false or true. There were many passengers for Australia on the aeroplane. I have seen several of them.. Others are undoubtedly available. A committee should be set up to take evidence on oath. There was a senior civil servant on board the aeroplane, as the Leader of the Opposition bas said, and no doubt the Prime Minister knows who he was. I do not intend to mention that oflicer in this House except to say that I have neither seen h i m or spoken to h i m since his return to Australia or for many months before he left Australia. I do not want any action to be taken in vengeance or spite against this Commonwealth public servant in the belief that he gave me the I rise to order. The information. orable member is on the wrong track He has now. leading for the Prime Minister to say that my allegations are not true and cannot be proved in Australia. In his remarks in the Stenate, Senator Amour said that I had not the slightest basis for my statements and that they were untrue. If they are untrue, if what I have honourable said cannot be proved before a parliamentary committee, and if I have lied to this House, let us have an open and f u l l inquiry. If I have lied, expel me from the Parliament.

(he statement by Mr W. A. Mathieson, Victorian president of the Australian Legion of Ex-service Men and Women, that a drastic cut in rehabilitation training would be a gross betrayal of ex-servicemen? Mr Millhouse and others have said that many ex-servicemen will be denied training because of the shortage of building materials and the restricted attitude of some unions to the reconstruction traininig courses. Have any unions restricted the entry of ex-servicemen into their organizations? If so, which unions have done so? Are they connected with the building trades? What action has been taken by the Minister to prevent this domination of the Grovernment by unions? Does the Government intend to carry out the obligations imposed upon it by the Re-establishment and Employment Act? If not, are ex-servicemen to remain untrained when houses are so badly needed and become mere hewers of wood and drawers of water? ment made by the federal president of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia and I am gravely disturbed about it. It is not true to say that the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme has broken down. It is true that certain difficulties have become apparent. First of all, I point out that the total number of ex-service men and women who have been accepted for training is over 300,000 and that the task of training such a very large proportion of the population at one time is very difficult tbe trade training side of the scheme. giving the total number of men who had been accepted for training in order that the House may realize the colossal nature of the task which confronted the Government when it undertook to provide was intended to ensure a regular outflow of trainees into the community. That outflow has to be related to the availability of raw materials It is true that, because of the general shortage of manHas he also seen power and materials, the materials that would be needed by trainees upon the completion of their various trade courses are in short supply. For that reason, the outflow of men, if we had continued the training scheme at the rate at which we had originally conceived it, would have been greater than the numbers who could have been absorbed into industry. We are not trying to deny training to any one, but we must regulate the intake of trainees so that the outflow shall be at a rate which industry can absorb. The whole matter resolves itself into this: The difficulties will not be overcome until greater production is assured of the raw materials necessary for those trainees in their respective trades. Therefore, I emphasize the importance of producing those raw materials in greater and greater quantities. the trade unions? decide how many individuals shall be trained in particular callings. That decision is made by a reconstruction training authority on which the unions, employers, and ex-servicemen's organizations are represented. I assure the honourable member that in spite of the difficulties that confront us at the moment, there is no question of denying to any exservieeman the training to which he is entitled. The training might have to be delayed to some degree, but it is far better to regulate the intake of trainees than to have an excessive outflow of trainees who, after all, are only trained to 40 per cent, efficiency when they go out into industry. If they are only partly trained, their skill can stagnate and become static more easily than that of fully trained individuals. The wisest course is to regulate the intake so that the outflow shall be at the rate that industry can absorb. That is what the reconstruction training authorities are doing at present. I conclude by emphasizing once again the importance",17,Reconstruction Training Scheme

In this statement, Mr many days. In fact, it is in constant use Aboud suggested that members of the Royal Australian Air Force and Australian Imperial Force at Morotai have been without beer, tobacco and cigarettes for five months. As statements of this character might create fears in the minds of the people regarding the welfare and care of our troops overseas, I ask the Minister whether the allegations are fact or fiction? tion of the report is fiction. To begin with, no members of the Australian Imperial Force are stationed at Morotai, and, therefore, that part of the statement must be inaccurate. I read the report, including the allegation that members of the Royal Australian Air Force stationed at Morotai had been without certain amenities for five months because the Australian Government could not send a ship there. Evidently Mr Aboud did not know that a courier service passes through Morotai each way three times a week. When I was at Morotai early this year and was quartered with Royal Australian Air Force personnel, I heard no complaints about their conditions. In fact, Australians stationed there painted glowing pictures of the amenities which were provided by the courier service. is safe to say that the statement was completely inaccurate.

Aircraft A65/123 has flown on for a similar purpose to that for which aeroplanes are provided for the honourable member and others to travel between Canberra and Melbourne for their convenience and to enable them to attend important meetings. The aircraft has been used for these purposes for the last two years without comment. I have asked questions on three occasions regarding the installation of obstruction lights within the circuit area of Cambridge aerodrome in Tasmania.

Garage proprietors, however, are insisting that customers shall take delivery of petrol when it is purchased. This will probably lead to the storage of large quantities of petrol in backyards, wash-houses, sheds and other unsuitable places, with consequent danger of fire, particularly in crowded areas. Will the Minister also give consideration to extending the currency of ration tickets from one or two months to three months as from the 1st November next? ber's question involvesa number of matters for consideration by the Minister for Supply and Shipping. However storage of petrol under dangerous conditions, particularly in crowded localities, is a matter for municipal authorities, who are quite competent to deal with it. Any extension of the period of currency of petrol ration tickets would undoubtedly result in increased consumption of petrol, and, as the honorahle member knows, the whole purpose of issuing ration tickets and of limiting their currency is to conserve dollars, which are so scarce at present. However, I shall refer the honourable member's question to the Minister for Supply and Shipping and obtain an answer. That Government business shall take precedence over general business to-morrow. In Oommittee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 21st October (vide page 1028). PAKT I -DEPARTMENT S AND SERVICES-OTHE R THAN BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS AND TERBIProposed vote, £19,297,000. I refer to the item under Division 10, Department of the Interior, "" Commonwealth Offices and other BuildingsAcquisition of Sites and Buildings"", for which the proposed vote is £952,000. This is a matter in which I am particularly interested, seeing that some nine months ago I submitted to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) a proposal in respect of it. Rockhampton is one of the largest cities in Queensland. Furthermore, its location is such that it has developed as the capital of central Queensland, and on that account must become more and more a centre in which a considerable volume of Commonwealth business has to be transacted. Yet at the present time the housing provided for Commonwealth departments in that city can only be described as "" rotten"". Therefore, it is highly desirable that at some time in the future, as shortly as possible, decent accommodation should be provided for the housing of those departments. However, because of the development that has taken place in the centre of the city, big building sites in that area are few and far between. But a site is available which is suitable as to size and location, and it was in regard to its acquisition that I made certain recommendations to the Minister nine months ago. The honourable gentleman studied my recommendations with interest, and has been moving in the matter. I understand that it is still under consideration. My point in referring to the item, which seems to provide means for acquiring the site referred to, is that the site is so suitable that it is not likely to continue to be available for any considerable time. At present I am referring only to acquisition, realizing that, because of the position in relation to building generally, it is quite likely that the erection of a building on the site would be deferred for some time. In order to ensure that the site will be available to the Government when it decides to proceed with the building, I strongly urge an early decision to acquire it. I confess to a feeling of disappointment at my inability to find anywhere in these Estimates provision for proceeding with the erection of the promised wool-selling centre in Rockhampton. As honourable members know, the decision to proceed with that building was made some time ago, before I became the representative of thearea. Certain moves have been",19,Petrol Rationing

76,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [11.20].,"made from time to time towards implementing that decision. In consequence of a position that is said to have arisen in a-egard to timber supplies, however, the building of the centre has been delayed. This was recently the subject of a deputation to the Prime Minister( Mr is the policy of the Government in that, Chifley), who received it favourably and promised to refer the matter for further discussion. I had hoped that provision would be made in these Estimates for proceeding with the building, thus indicating that the Government intended to go ahead with the project during the current financial year. The only item that I can see which might have some connection with it is at page 401, under the Department of Commerce and Agriculture"" Buildings, Works, Fittings and Furniture "", the proposed vote for which is £100,000. That sum suggests to me very definitely that provision has not been included in it for the erection of the entirely insufficient for that purpose building to which I am referring. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) to give some indication of what is the present intention in regard to the building. I pass on to an item in Division No. 15, under Department of Munitions"" Ships-Construction "", the proposed vote for which is £2,400,000. I request an indication by the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman), who represents the Minister for Munitions in this chamber, as to whether that refers to a Government programme for the building of ships for trading on the coast. I assume that it does. If so, I agree that it is very necessary expenditure. generally in favour of the Government engaging in such undertakings, but in view of the grave shortage of shipping, to which I have referred in this chamber on several occasions, the onus is on the Government to do all that it can to relieve the position by utilizing the facilities at its disposal with a view to increasing the number of ships available and expanding their operations. But the ultimate value of that expenditure will depend largely upon the type of vessel it is proposed to build, and in this connection also I should like some indication from the Minister as to the Government's policy. It will be remembered that I have referred on several occasions to the Mr Davidson. need for the provision of shipping to service the smaller coastal ports. Therefore, this programme must include provision for the building of ships which will be capable of performing that service. I ask the Minister to say what regard. In Division No. 16, under the Department of Civil Aviation, there is the item "" Buildings and Works-Including grants to councils towards cost of establishment and improvement of country aerodromes"", for which the proposed vote is £50,000. Particularly after listening last night to the statements of the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford), and others, and hearing sums amounting to millions of pounds being bandied around the chamber, I consider that this provision for the development of country aerodromes is which is vitally important if country areas are to have the development in aviation matters to which they are entitled. The position in this regard, as I view it, is that, u.p to two or three years ago, there had been established an efficient service along the coastal fringe of the continent from Perth round to Cairns. At the outbreak of the last war, an efficient aerial service had been established under private enterprise and was giving satisfaction, but there had not been very much development in country areas. Certainly, feeder lines -were being pushed out into those areas, but not very much progress had been made. Naturally I am not with war conditions operating, country services were the first to suffer and to be withdrawn. The Government, instead of turning its attention to the development of country services immediately the cessation of the war permitted it to do so, in view of the fact that the services on the coastal fringe were still operating, embarked on a programme involving a considerable expenditure, which merely resulted in the already efficient coastal service having superimposed on it another service, at very considerable cost to the taxpayers. The Minister for Civil Aviation, speaking last night, stated that a capital expenditure of £3,750,000 had already been incurred on Trans-Australia Airlines. Recently the statement was published in the press, almost, it seemed to me from the wording of it, with a. touch of pride, that the loss on the operations of Trans-Australia Airlines for the first twelve months had been less than £500,000. members to note the expression "" less than"". The Minister also said that £500,000 had been expended in the acquisition of shares in Qantas Empire Airways Limited, and £1,000,000 in the purchase of Constellation aircraft, whilst a further £1,000,000 had been expended in the purchase of Convair aircraft. It would appeal"" that nearly £7,000,000 has been expended in superimposing a governmental service on already existing services which were efficiently conducted account of the many problems which The Minister also claimed that the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr establishing aerodromes in country areas,, White) based his objection to Trans-Australia Airlines on his disapproval of government interference with private enterprise. In my opinion, that is a sound basis for objection, but it is not the only one. One of the strongest grounds for objection to such expenditure by the Government is the fact that the money is being used not in the development of the country but in supplementing services already in existence. In the event of an augmented service being necessary, there is no doubt that the private companies which had developed theso services would have met the situation. That is my main critioism of the Government's air policy. I have travelled in Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft and I agree with the Minister that efficient service is being rendered to the travelling public. If the organization did not give efficient service when it has merely to call will be thrown on the local people. Why on the Government for whatever capital expenditure it requires, it would be open to grave criticism. I make these points because I believe that the Government's policy in .respect of aerodromes in country districts is not adequate, particudirect cost to them as taxpayers? larly when I recall that only £50,000 is to be voted under these Estimates for such services in comparison with the millions of pounds being expended in other directions. People in many country areas had been awaiting an announcement of Government policy in this connection. The Minister, who is most co-operative and willing to reply io questions addressed to him, had told us that a committee had been investigating the development of country aerodromes and that the announcement of government policy I invite honourable would soon be made. Becently, an announcement was made which camsed bitter disappointment to many country people because it was far below their expectations. According to the statement of bhe Minister, the present Government's policy is that aerodrome sites in country areas must be considerably developed by local authorities before the Government will expend money on them. In my opinion, that aspect of the Government's polioy is wrong, in that it takes na local governing bodies must face in. particularly where the terrain presentsconsiderable difficulties. In some .places it is relatively easy to establish aerodromes, but in other places local governing bodies find it almost impossible to provide the finance necessary in the early stages of development. Nowhere is this disability more evident than in certain areas in my electorate. Por instance, the residents of Gladstone have been moving towards the development of a local airport for several years. It is true that the Department of Civil Aviation has given them considerable assistance, particularly in providing reports by engineers on various sites for aerodromes, but those reports show that the development of an airport suitable for the district will be particularly expensive. Therefore, if the early work is to be left to the local authorities, a heavy burden should the residents in such an area be deprived of a proper air service when people in other districts, particularly in the coastal areas, have services provided at no cost to themselves except the inAnother Queensland town facing similar difficulties is Emerald, which is situated on the main air route from western Queensland to Eockhampton. Should the local authorities be required to expend the sums necessary to provide a suitable airport out of their own funds, or even with a little assistance from the Government, the burden on the local ratepayers will be heavier than they can bear. That is unfair, when we remember that other areas mo: e favourably situated are provided with air services practically at no cost to the local residents. I submit that, had a greater proportion of the expenditure on air services conducted by the Government been diverted to assist local governing authorities, many country areas would now have the benefit of feeder services which as yet do not exist. Many ex-servicemen are desirous of supplying these feeder services. All that they need is permission to do so, and the provision of adequate ground facilities. Last night, the Minister also referred to an agreement recently entered into between the Australian and Queensland Governments concerning the establishment of further government services in Queensland. It may be that under that agreement some of the matters which had been causing concern to local authorities will be cleared up, but I confess that until recently I had thought that there was not sufficient co-operation between the Commonwealth and the State authorities in Queensland in the development of civil aviation. However, according to the Minister's statement, the agreement will ensure an expansion of air services in that State. I should like him to supply further information as to the terms of the agreement. I understand that there is reference to it in this morning's Brisbane press, but I have not been a'ble to ascertain what is intended. In the absence of further information, I greatly fear that all that is intended is that governmental services shall be superimposed on feeder lines which already exist in Queensland, and that there will be little relief to areas which are totally without air communications. I understood the Minister to say-and I hope that I heard him correctly-that the Commonwealth would agree to the conditions laid down in the Queensland Transport Act, which empowers the State to levy a fee not exceeding l d . for each passenger for every mile travelled and 2d. a ton for each mile that cargo is carried. I can understand the Commonwealth agreeing to that condition, but if the agreement means that the Commonwealth and the State are to cooperate in the establishment of the serMr Prwidson. vice under which those fees will be chargeable, in addition to the heavy charges already imposed by the civil aviation authorities, and will operate in opposition to private companies, there is little likelihood of these country services being developed to any degree. The outcome of the agreement could be that private enterprise in civil aviation will merely be struck another heavy blow. I hope the Minister will indicate his attitude towards the development of country aerodromes, and give some thought to increasing tlie amount set aside for this purpose. Obviously, £50,000 is a mere fleabite when we consider the amount of work that has to be done all over Australia. I should also like the Minister to give some information as to the Government's proposals for air services in Queensland. I should not have spoken but for the answer given by the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) last night to criticism by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) and the honourable member for Pawkner( Mr Holt). The Minister was evidently speaking from a brief in defence of the Minister for Civil Aviation (Mi-. Drakeford), whom I congratulate upon having sueh an excellent backstop. Unfortunately the Minister was not armed with the right information. The criticism .of the honourable member for Fawkner was directed against the extraordinary increase of expenditure on the Department of Civil Aviation as compared with last year, an increase of £5,500,000, and he deplored the fact that the taxpayers should be required to find so much more money. The honourable member pointed out that, for the most part, this increased expenditure was for buildings, a fact which must have an important bearing upon the general housing programme. The Minister for Works and Housing, defending the Government's proposals, said that the proposed expenditure was mostly for the establishment of new runways, and he passed lightly over the suggestion that some of the expenditure might be devoted to the acquisition of buildings and building sites. His statement moved me to examine the details more closely, and I now place on record",20,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

At page 399 of the Estimates, under the general beading of Department of Civil Aviation-Interna l Services-ther e appears this itemBuildings and works-includin g grants to capital councils towards costs of establishment and improvement of country aerodromes£50,000. I suggest that this is the item which sidetracked the Minister, and induced him to say that the money was heing expended on the construction of runways. However, if we turn to page 400, we find that there is an item-Acquisitio n of sites and buildings, £3,000,000-whil e a total of £2,400,000 is listed for expenditure by the Department of Works and Housing for the Department of Civil Aviation, under Division No. 16. templated? should like to know. We know that it is proposed to expend £3,000,000 upon the acquisition of sites and buildings That amount, at any rate, does not cover works. We now come to proposed expenditure on proposed flying boat bases, and we find that for buildings, worlcs, shore bases and marine facilities, fittings and furniture, it is proposed to expend £15,000, while for the same items in connection with the trans-Tasman section it is proposed to expend £10,000. Therefore, it is evident that the bulk of the expenditure is not to be devoted to the construction of runways, but to the acquisition of buildings, sites. &c. Evidently, the Minister for Works and Housing endeavoured to gloss over the inatter in the hope that nothing further would be said about this proposed expenditure. As a matter of fact, the Estimates provide for the expenditure of colossal amounts of money, expenditure that cannot he justified by any department or any government. T do not wish to comment upon the remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava about the acquisition of shares in Qantas. We know, and the country knows, that the Government is hell-bent for socialization. If it cannot acquire shares hy any other means, it will hold out all sorts of baits, including remissions of tax, to induce people to part with their shares. member is out of order in discussing that matter. provide for the voting of an amount of money to take over shares in Qantas. able member point out the item to which he refers? the heading "" Flying Boat Bases"", an amount is set aside for buildings and works for the trans-Tasman service. member may discuss the proposed expenditure on buildings and works, but no more. on buildings and works on this service is the outcome of the Government's decision to nationalize the service. page 393. of the Estimates provision is made for the acquisition of shares in Qantas. before the committee. item provision is made for works and sendees, and the acquisition of sites and buildings for the conduct of a nationalized air service. I congratulate the honourable member for Balaclava upon having made out such an excellent case. I now pass on to the summary of annual votes, at page 395. For the Department of Works and Housing the estimated increase of expenditure over last year is £5,081,830. The estimate for this year is .£7,334,000, while expenditure for last year was £2,252.170. The increase is extraordinary when we remember that the Department of Works and Housing is really only a directing centre situated in Canberra. It was only the other day that the Parliament voted £13,000,000 for expenditure by the States on their housing programmes. The Minister for Works and Housing has handed over almost complete responsibility for housing construction to the State governments.

I have no means of dissecting the proposed expenditure. The Department of Munitions was brought into existence during the war, but its proposed vote for this year represents an increase of expenditure of £1,114,000 over that incurred last year. Obviously, this department is not being dampened down. On the contrary, it is being inflated; and, naturally, one wants to know, why, in the light of the evidence brought forward by honourable members on this side of thc chamber, a department of this kind is being continued. It is not of use unless it he the Government's being continued to produce munitions, unless percussion caps for toy pistols can be classified as munitions. Last night Ihe honorahle member for Balaclava produced a letter which he had received from the department stating tthat there was a good export market for percussion caps for toy pistols, and, therefore, the department proposed to undertake that class of manufacture. If the department were producing pistols of use to the defence forces, I should support the increase of expenditure proposed. What is the reason for the proposed increase of"" over £1,000,000? I know also that the department is rapidly producing lipstick containers. What a great department of munitions! It is producing percussion caps for toy pistols and lipstick containers! The Government is now calling upon the taxpayers of this country to provide an additional £1,114,000 to produce percussion caps for boy gangsters and containers for lipstick to give to the women of the country an opportunity to repair the devastation caused to their looks as the result of beholding the horror of their sons playing with pistols. member must confine himself to the Estimates before the Chair. These Estimates deal only with additions, new works and buildings. generally, to the summary of the proposed votes. No less a sum than £19,297,000 is to be made available this year for additions, new works and buildings after deducting £2,553,000 provided for surplusbuildings, sites and equipment taken over from the Commouwealth Disposals Commission. The Minister for Civil Aviation in an effort to justify the proposed expenditure on his department, referred last night to certain buildings taken over by his department from the commission. But the cost of such buildings is not included in that expenditure. I point out that over £12,750,000 additional expenditure is to be incurred this year on additions, new works and buildings for a number of departments of which at lea9t six should now be abolished, because they were established solely for war purposes. They have ceased to be intention to use them to maintain its present inflated bureaucracy and thus help to justify its claim that it is providing full employment. These .bureaucrats should be engaged in productive employment. Works and Housing) [11.56] -The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has made great play in respect of items under the Department of Civil Aviation which cover sites, buildings and equipment. He stated that that expenditure would involve competition for labour and materials urgently needed for the housing programmes now being undertaken by the States. Last night, when dealing with that argument, I pointed out that the new works to be undertaken for the Department of Civil Aviation are, in the main, earthworks. The honourable member is leaving the chamber; that is n pity, because he has not even read the Estimates intelligently. At page 400 he will find a footnote explaining that of the sum of £3,000,000 for the acquisition of sites and buildings for the Department of Civil Aviation, an amount of £2,500,000 is for the purchase of buildings and sites from the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. Yet, the honourable member declared that these millions were to be expended on a works programme which would compete with the housing programme. In fact, the buildings and materials covered by that item have already been purchased from the commission, and the money is now sought in order to pay the commission.

92,Mr Lemmon (Porrest,"Minister forcomplete answer to the honourable member's charge that the work covered by that item will compete with the housing programme. The honourable member is Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Occupying such a responsible position, he should at least inform himself of what the functions of tlie Department of Works and Housing are. He asked the reason for the increase of the proposed vote for the department; and declared that such increase was not justified because the department was merely a. directive organization. The fact is that the works section of the department, in Canberra, is one of the smallest sections of its kind controlled by the department throughout Australia and the territories. Far from being merely a directive organization, the department is, in fact, carrying out an extensive works programme on behalf of other departments. For the Department of the Navy it is constructing buildings at Neutral Bay, and other works include the installation of oil storage tanks, certain work at the Garden Island graving dock and at South Head and other centres; For the Department of Civil Aviation, it is carrying out work at Broken Hill and at flying boat bases. Many of these works are being done under the day-labour system. For the Postmaster-General's Department, it is constructing telephone exchanges at many centres, including Glen Innes, Dee Why, Bohdi, Hunter's Hill-, Cremorne, Broken Hill, Vauehlsc and East Sydney, and also the cable tunnel in Sydney. The department is also tarrying out extensive works for other departments in every State and in the territories of Papua and New Guinea. If time permitted I should enumerate the works being carried out by the department foithe Repatriation Commission, (he Council for Scientific and In special consideration until the general dustrial Research, and the Departments of Aircraft Production, Munitions and the Interior; ih fact, the list of works being carried out for all the departments in the Commonwealth embraces five closely typed pages. The honourable member is surely award that the whole of the physical Work associated with the development of Mascot into one of the finest airports of the world is being carried out by my department. The construction of the guided weapons testing range in Central Australia is also being carried out by my department on a day labour basis. The undertaking of these many and varied projects has been made possible through the foresight of the Government in obtaining from the United States of America the most modern plant and equipment. The whole of the plant has been repaired and is now in service throughout the country. It was largely to finance its purchase and repair that the Estimates of my department were increased for the current financial year. Victoria, which particularly interests me, far too little direction appears to be exercised by the Victorian Housing Commission ih the allocation of . such houses iis are constructed. That matter concerns the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon), to the degree that he exercises some influence over State Ministers by virtue of the controls administered 1 by the Commonwealth, and therefore he cannot escape responsibility for their actions. Some time ago I wrote to the Victorian Minister for Housing concerning the provision of a house for an ex-serviceman wbo, with his wife and six children, was living'in one room in a residence at Carlton} which had been condemned by the Melbourne City Council as unfit for human habitation. The man concerned had every reason to expect that he would be given priority in the allocation of a new house; he had already applied for a war service home and for the allotment of one of the houses constructed by the Victorian Housing Commission. In his reply, the Minister, after stating that there were a great many unsatisfied applicants, ended his letter with the words, "" It is not possible to give this application position has improved "". That attitude is completely wrong. A degree of preference should be extended according to need and merit. As a result of being compelled to live in one room in a condemned house, two of the children died within the last year. The terrible state of affairs revealed by this case demands that the whole system of priority in the allocation of houses be further examined.",25,Tokies Of The Commonwealth
93,Mr Gtjllett (Henty) [12.2],"I hI n Victoria alone there are 23,000 unsatisfied applications for homes constructed by the Housing Commission, and 15,000 unsatisfied applications from ex-servicemen. I do not think the Minister will challenge those figures; they were supplied hy the Victorian Minister for Housing. The of housing is being overcome is extremely unsatisfactory. homes were constructed last year, compared with 10,000 in 1939, when a great number of offices, bridges, factories, and other buildings The attempt of homo building is therefore a poor one. Recently, attended a meeting of the Master Builders Association of Victoria and learned that, given adequate materials, the members of the association have sufficient labour and facilities available to undertake the construction many houses as they are now erecting. The reason for the present deplorably low rate of replacement materials. I draw the attention of the committee to the position in relation to the production requirements for home construction. examination of the production of bricks reveals a very sad and startling The production of brickmakers clined steadily with the result that the cost of house construction increased. employed in making bricks; to-day the number is 7.000. brickmakers bricks; but to-day the output of the 7.000 brickmakers has fallen to less than half that number, being -100,000.000 bricks a year. The average daily output of each employee is now 200 bricks whereas formerly bricks. costs. Instead of the Minister ing boards throughout the country to control the allotment of bricks, timber, wire and steel, he should consider the means whereby the overall production of these commodities may be increased. that the employees in the industry greater output of bricks, but tbey lack Mr Gullet!. the incentive to do so. One of the first things that should be done is to encourage increased output by making provision for incentive payments and profit sharing. In nearly every commodity required for house construction production is declining. Let us take at random rate at which the shortage three important items, namely, baths, basins and sinks. The production figures In Victoria, only 6,900 for the months of July and October, 1946, and May, 1947, show a progressive decline in the output of these essential items. What is the use of talking about were also constructed. increased housing construction when the Government's record in its Government permits the production of to overcome the arrears essential requirements to decline in that during last year way? Another factor militating against I the successful operations of enterprising private builders is the constant interference in their activities by the Prices Branch. I propose to cite certain examples to indicate how inept and foolish is this control. Take, for illusof four or five times as tration, one scandalous example. The price of sawn hardwood, 3 inches by 2 inches, is 31s. 5d. and of sawn hardwood, is the shortage of 6 hy 2, 37s. a 100 super, feet. A t present it is impossible to obtain 3 by 2 hardwood with the result that builders are forced of some of the basic to take 6 by 2 planks and have them An milled clown to the smaller size, which means that they have to pay an addistory. tional 5s. 7d. a 100 super, feet for it . has deThat is absolutely ridiculous, and is one of the irritations that mitigate against has greatly home-building in Victoria. Also, k i l n In 1939. 10,000 people were dried timber in that State costs 10s. less after it has been moulded than before. In 1939, the 10.000 How on earth could any responsible body produced ' 720,000,000 arrive at a decision like that? Another matter to which I wish to approximately draw attention is the growing arrogance of the prices authorities in Victoria, As honourable members are aware, it was 300 the Prices Commission has absolutely That inevitably means rising the last word in estimating the cost of a establishhome. It has power to fix the cost of a house, regardless of any evidence that may he offered, and there is no appeal from its decision. I draw the attention nf the Minister to a case that was brought We know to my notice recently: A contractor brickmaking carried out a repair job on a home for are capable of producing a a certain price. He submitted his figures to the Prices Commission which reduced rhem by £9, and directed him to pay that sum back to his client. That decision may have been right or wrong, but the basis upon which the action was taken was very wrong indeed. In a letter to the builder, who appealed against the finding, the prices authorities statedIn this regard, you are informed that it is not tlie practice of this office to disclose the departments which, whenever there is a basis of arriving at decisions. That is a very high-handed action, and is a wrong principle for any governmental or quasi-legal authority to adopt as the basis for a decision. In a letter to me, the Builders and Allied Trades Association points out, quite rightly, that it is impossible for any one viewing a painting and repair job after its completion to visualize the state of the item repaired before the work was commenced. In the case to which I have referred, certain preparatory work had to be completed. The letter concludesWe were under the impression that British justice required that a British subject be advised for what he wns being punished, not only for his own information, but so that he would be aware of his obligations for the future. Under our new bureaucratic "" l a w by regulation"", our masters (wbo were once considered to be our servants) apparently have not the obligation to advise us wherein we bave offended against the law -unsuitability of certain types of houses I put that to the Minister for his consideration. I wish to speak also of one or two other vital commodities that are in short supply. Take for instance cement: We all know that there is an acute shortage of this commodity, yet there is plenty of the raw material required for its manufacture. Kilns are available, and man-power can be procured to do the work. At Tynesford in Victoria where there arc five kilns, only one is in production. Some aotion should be taken to ensure that production of this commodity shall bo increased. Provision is made in these Estimates for the construction of Beaufort homes. I do not propose to' dwell upon the suitability or otherwise of this type of house, but I do say that at a time when there is such an acute shortage of steel, the proposal to erect steel houses is particularly ill-timed. Steel, of course, is difficult to obtain for the manufacture of almost any commodity. Steel is also a money producing commodity. It goes into engines, machinery, and factories, all of which make wealth and create employment. I say, therefore, that the proposal to produce 5,500 "" biscuit -tins ""-the y are not much more-is particularly unsuitable at present. I have some criticism to offer of the Housing Commission in Victoria. Following the usual practice of government threatened shortage of a commodity, grab all available supplies, and dole out a little at a time, the Victorian Housing Commission has taken up much of the available home-building land in that State. It now has enough to meet its requirements for 30 years at the present rate of building. This is quite ridiculous. It means that people who want homes are forced, whether they like it or not, to become tenants of government premises, whereas many of them would prefer to buy their own land and build their own homes. It might suit the Minister, and be in accordance with government policy, to proceed with this rather socialistic scheme, but it will not produce any .more houses, and I submit that it is wrong in principle. One other matter relating to the building industry that calls for criticism is the that are being built even by government instrumentalities. Only a mile or two from this building, the Government is erecting homes that are nothing more than rural slums. We hear a lot of talk about the necessity for more population in this country, and the desirability of bigger families, but in these "" dog-boxes "" that are being erected near the railway station in this city-the y are typical of many others throughout the Commonwealth-it would not be possible for a man and wife to raise a family in any degree of comfort. It is utter humbug and nonsense to talk of increasing the population, and of migration, when no effort is being made to increase the production of houses, and residences of a quite unsuitable type are being erected by government instrumentalities. like some information in regard to one item of these Estimates. Under Division 11, the proposed vote for "" Commonwealth offices and oiher buildingsworks, fittings and furniture"" is £290,000. The vote for 1946-47 was",26,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

This increase of more than £250,000 seems to warrant some explanation. Works and Housing) [12.19] I am unable to give the exact details of last year's expenditure, although I can mention some of the items. I shall have a detailed statement prepared containing the information that the honourable member seeks. Portion of the money voted last year was expended on hostels to house the labour forces required to carry out the Government's works programme. Some of sueh hostels were erected in Canberra, where, in the last year, our force of manual workers has increased from 1,000 to 1,700 or 1,S00. Qnarters, all of which are owned by the Department of Works and Housing, had to be erected for them. I shall have a. detailed statement prepared showing what we hope to do this year. One reason for tlie increase is that in the last six months ing to go to the expense of engaging a the Department of Works and Housing has taken over from the Department of External Territories for possibly five years what was the civil construction authority in Papua, New Guinea and New Britain. The Department of Works and Housing has the skilled technicians and engineers to do the job. It w ill be necessary for ns to provide office accommodation for the administrative staff, possibly at Port Moresby. I have nothing but good to say about the mism, because standardization of the work done by tiie Council for Scientific railway gauges is not urgent or warand Industrial Research at its research ranted. The Government has no right to station at Cunnamulla. called Gilruth absorb in that unnecessary work labour Plains, where research regarding sheep urgently required in primary and seconbreeding and grasses grown in the dary industries. That standardization heart of the sheep country is being is not now of the strategic value that it conducted, but, at the other end of would have been in the recent war, and my electorate, there is another Council now I see no reason why the standardizafor Scientific ancl Industrial Research tion of the gauges should proceed when Nation in the deciduous f r u it disall sections of industry, both primary and trict, nnd, doubtless, money will be secondary, are crying out for more hands. spent on new works at such stations Irrigatio n is a much more important prons that. One is impelled to ask questions ject than the standardization of railway ahout it when one hears the fruit-growers gauges. asking what the Councilf or Scientific and Industrial Research officers are in the locality for, because the extent of their work is to advise the growers when the apples are fit to pick. Practical men with years of experience of orcharding know more about that than so-called experts. Those experts are taking no steps to defeat the codlin moth, or to .assist the practical orehardists who are doing their best to contend with the pest, even though tlieir neighbours may be so careless as to let it breed undisturbed. SoI should like the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) to tell me whether money to be expended on the research stations for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will be unwirely used, as it appears to have been in the deciduous fruit-growingdistrict, OJwisely as it has been at Cuunaniulla, where the council is doing a commendable job. Earlier, the Minister for Works and Housing said that it was possible that more than 100 different designs of war service homes would soon be available, from which ex-servicemen might choose homes of the type they -want without havprivate architect to design homes according to their specifications. I should like to know what progress has been made. Can we expect the plans to be available soon ? The Minister for Transport ( Mr. Ward) has expressed optimism in having £500,000 set aside this year for standardization of railway gauges.

96,Mr Adermann (Maranoa) [12.21]. Vote Only Expresses The Minister's Opti,"I preface some criticism that I have to offer of the Department of Civil Aviation by commending the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Davidson) for his fine exposition of the need for the development of air routes in country districts. The Minister far Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford) said last night that Trans-Australia Airlines was brought into being because Australian National Airways developing into a monopoly. listened to him, I thought that at least one Minister was against the establishment of a banking monopoly and that we could rely on his support; but, as he went on, he showed himself as determined to establish monopolies of every sort, if they are government monopolies. The Government's intention to establish a monopoly in air transport in Australia was frustrated by the H i g h Court, but tliere is no need for me to labour that point, because it was effectively dealt with in the debate last night. All that I need to direct my attention to is that if Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was developing a monopolyI am against monopolies-it was forced to do so by the Minister and his department because of the department's continual refusal to grant licences or permits to other companies to establish air services. Hundreds of applications were refused. I agree that licences to conduct air services cannot be granted ad lib to people not capable of carrying out a service, but licences were refused to people well able to operate and desirous of operating country air services. Like the honourable member for Capricornia, I have been disappointed by the limited number of permits granted for the establishment of air services in Queensland. I believe that only six permits have been distributed amongst hundreds of applicants. When one examines requirements for air services in the remote areas of that State, one wonders why, for instance, a permit was granted for a service from Bourke to Thargomindah without inserting a condition that the route should be extended to Quilpie, Charleville, ancl Cunnamulla, and thence back to Bourke. Such a route would provide a badly needed service for the south-western area of Queensland. Residents of Quilpie have long sought an air service, and Qantas Empire Airways Limited, before the company was taken over by the Government, assured me that it was willing to establish a service over the route I have mentioned. I hope that the Ministerf o r Civil Aviation, now that he is responsible for the air services provided by the company, will take action to have that assurance fulfilled . If the committee Proprietary Limited was which advises the Minister had recomAsI mended such a service then it would have given practical help to the inland orable member is entitled to deal w i th the proposed advance to the Australian National Airlines Commission, but he is not otherwise entitled to discuss air services. items relating to air services in Division 16. One of these deals with the establishment and improvement of country aerodromes, and therefore I take the opportunity to deal with the subjects discussed by the Ministerf or Civil Aviationi n his speech. sion 16, at page 399 of the Estimates,, there is provision for an advance of £1,500,000 to the Australian National Airlines Commission to enable it to operate its air services, which the Minister said last night would be extended within the State of Queensland.

I submit that he should be permitted to speak on that subject. member is entitled to discuss the activities of the Australian National Airlines Commission, but not the proposed air servicesof private companies or their applications for permission to conduct air services. your ruling, Mr Chairman. I agree with what the honourable member for Capricornia has said about the allocation of funds for the construction of aerodromes in country districts. An anomaly lies in the fact that the Minister's policy is that no financial assistance shall begiven to local governing authorities for the construction of aerodromes until a i r",29,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

101,Mr Adermann,"I must acceptservices are established to the districts where the aerodromes are planned. Country districts cannot secure air services until they are provided with aerodromes which satisfy the requirements of engineers of the Department of Civil Aviation. This fact forces local governing authorities to expend their own resources on the construction of aerodromes so that air services may be extended to their districts, and then to apply to the departcountry. As the honourable member knows, ment for financial aid. The Minister's policy, which has heen plainly stated, is that in these circumstances the department will give only technical advice to the local governing bodies. Of course, they do not ignore such advice because the department's experts are competent men. assistance ought to be granted for the construction of aerodromes, which, in the present state of development of civil aviation, should be capable of meeting the needs of fairly large aircraft. The Minister's policy is topsy-turvy. Thc needs of country districts for air services of plans for war service homes. Archiwere discussed when the Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works Act was under consideration in this chamber. The measure made an allocation of funds to the States for the purposes of aerodrome maintenance and construction. We were informed then that the States would be entitled to allocate money to local governcants for war service home3 may have a ing authorities for such work. But what chance have local governing bodies of obtaining money from the State governments when the total allocation for aerodromes under the act for the whole of Australia was only £500,000 ? The States, naturally, are safeguarding their own interests. The Minister ought to reverse his policy when, in the opinion of his advisory committee, the establishment of an aerodrome is essential for the welfare of a country district. This would serve to decrease the isolation of country towns and would encourage people to remain in the country. In such circumstances, the Department of Civil Aviation should give financial assistance in the first instance so that satisfactory services can be established. Works and Housing) [12.35] I wish to reply to some of the statements made by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Maranoa( Mr Adermann) regarding the Adermann). I cannot be held responsible for the policy of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The honourable member asked what the council intended to do. I believe that it will continue with the valuable field work which it has carried on in the past. It has purchased a number of properties, including one in Western Australia, for the purpose of studying serious sheep diseases in clover field work of this sort requires also a considerable amount of laboratory experimentation. The Department of Works and Housing is endeavouring to build four or five structures for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research so that it may obtain the best results from However, immediate financial its field work. Such building work was completely stopped during the war, and we are now endeavouring to catch up with the lag by undertaking construction work in various States. I told the honourable member previously what I intended to do regarding the productiou tects and draftsmen have been engaged on this work, and some standard plans are already available in one State. They should be available in all States within the next four or five weeks. Then thc scheme will be broadened and more sets of plans will be produced so that applifairly wide choice. The honourable member also referred to the considerable sum allotted to the Department of Transport for the standardization of railway gauges. I disagree with his statement that this is a useless project, but I shall not argue the case. That sum, £425,000 of which is being used for the purchase from the Disposals Commission of equipment such as bulldozers, graders and ballasting machinery, is not lying idle. The Minister for Transport has already made some of the machinery available to the Department of Works and Housing, and it is in use in all parts of Australia. It is being used on the Mascot Aerodrome and on two aerodromes in Tasmania. The amount does not represent new capital. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [12.39].

102,Mr Lemmon (Forrest,"Minister forneed for the development of country aerodromes. There can be no doubt that the future of any decentralization plan in Australia must depend largely upon the proper development of aeriai transport services to country centres. honourable members have directed attention to instances in their own electorates of the obvious necessity for those services. There is in my electorate at least one similar case with which the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) is familiar. In a question which I asked a few days ago, I spoke of the contention that the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines would permit of pioneering work in this field, and the opening up of areas which would not be acceptable to the operators of private air lines. Here, I should like to pay a. tribute to the Minister for Civil Aviation, because on all occasions he has met in a most friendly spirit, my representations to him regarding aerodromes and the like in Tasmania. with Smithton aerodrome, which the local authority has developed to a f a i r l y high degree of efficiency and which, in the past, did operate a service with smaller aircraft than those which are at present being used for transport services throughout fhe Commonwealth. In his reply, the Minister referred to the fact rhat one transport company had resisted efforts to open a certain service in Tasmania, and that he had been instrumental in inducing it to begin the work. While that is perfectly true, and I pay .a tribute to the Minister for his efforts in that matter, I remind him that the contention that the aerodrome was not safe was advanced, not only by the airline company, but also hy members of the Department of Civil Aviation. I understand that, at present, a request for a permit to operate a service from Smithton was submitted to the department, which refused to grant the application on the ground that the aerodrome was not safe. Par be it from me to suggest to the Minister that the aerodrome is safe when officials of his department say that it is not, but I suggest that we should be well advised to examine thc. matter carefully in view of the history of the other aerodrome. It so happens, as :he Minister knows, that reason, air transport between Tasthat the particular line of which he spoke, mania and the mainland has developed and to which I now refer, was opened up largely on his recommendation by the company concerned, and has, I believe, developed into the best paying line in the whole of Australia; so much so that Both Trans-Australia Airlines is now about to duplicate that service. However, criticism is being voiced in parts of Tasmania, though naturally not in that area, but in other districts surrounding Smithton, that it cannot be called a pioneering service. In my opinion, that is a logical argument. The other point which I make is that since the policy was laid down that local committees must first develop their own aerodromes before the department will assist them, a new factor has arisen, namely, that charges shall be made for the use of aerodromes, so that whatever money is expended now upon an aerodrome which has anything like a regular service must, in some degree at any rate, be repaid to the department. I suggest The Minister is familiar to the Minister that in the light of that new development, he should re-examine the matter of the development of aerodromes. Regarding Smithton, I repeat to him now what I said to h i m earlier in connection with Wynyard, which is now operating and has proved to be so eminently successful. A service fro m that airfield, not to any other point in Tasmania, but to Melbourne, which may he called the commercial capital of the north of Tasmania, would in my opinion, be most lucrative. It would be to the advantage of the department to extend its policy of providing assistance to local committees to enable them to construct aerodromes, and to concentrate on the opening up of the service from Smithton to Melbourne. The Minister is well aware of the special circumstances which prevail in that part of Tasmania. The transportation of its products would make the development of a daily service a practical and lucrative proposition. Thp population of Tasmania has been demonstrated, on figures, to be the most air-minded in the whole world. Tasmania's own peculiar position in this regard is brought about by the rather turbulent waters of Bass Strait. Wherever practicable, most travellers are inclined to avoid the sea passage. For amazingly in tbe last few years, and must develop still further in the near future. Silting suspended from 12-45 to 2.15 p.m. It seems to me that some reply should have been made by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) to the remarks made by the honourable member for Pawkner( Mr Holt) last night. However, since no reply has been forthcoming I direct the attention of the committee to page 393 of the Estimates, where it will be seen that the cost of additions, new works, buildings. &c, for the financial year 1947-48 is estimated at £19,297,000.' That is not a small sum; indeed, it is approximately one-fifth of the highest pre-war budget, namely, that of 1939. The second column shows that approximately £13,000,000 was voted for the financial year 1946-47, but that less than half that amount was expended during that financial year. The sum of £19,297,000 is proposed to be voted for all departments, although last year they expended only approximately £6,400,000. I have felt for a long time that there is no control whatever by the Government over the expenditure of public money, and a perusal of the Estimates for Additions, New Works, Buildings, &c, fortifies me in that conclusion. I draw attention to two or three departments merely by way of example. The sum of approximately £1,600,000 was voted for the Department of the Interior last year, but of this sum material,it is depriving people of the it spent only approximately £3.1.8,000. Notwithstanding that fact' £1,554,500 is being voted for that department in this year's Estimates. partment of Works and Housing, which last year spent £2,252,170, now seeks a vote of £7,334,000, an increase of approximately animadversions can be made in respect of other departments, as for example, the Department of Civil Aviation. That department, which spent only approximately £2,300,000 last year, is now seeksubstantiated up to the hilt-as it ought ing a vote of £7,835,000. I should like to know what investigations were made by the Government before including these amounts in the Estimates. There is, as we all know, a Public Works Committee, but no matter how conscientiously that committee discharges its functions, the projects which it examines comprise only a fraction of the expenditure covered by additions, new works, buildings, &c. Unless some new method has been devised by the Government to 'check such grossly increased expenditure it seems to me that there is no machinery to assess the necessity for the construction of new works. The matter may be summed up in a few words. The Government seeks to obtain the committee's consent to the appropriation of £19,297,000, although the expenditure on similar projects last year amounted only to approximately £6,000,000. If it were really necessary to undertake the construction of works costing £19,297,000 during this financial year, no member of the committee would criticize the expenditure. But that is the whole point: Is the carrying out of the proposed works essential? A large part of the community is now anxiously seeking to erect homes hut is unable to obtain materials. I am not speaking now of the Wealthy classes, but of poor people who want to build modest homes for a small outlay, of whom there are many in my electorate. Those people are Unable to obtain materials or the services of builders unless they go on to the black market, and we all know that a huge number of transactions of that kind take place. To the extent to which the Government engages in a vast building programme, which makes demands on labour and ability to construct homes for themselves. That is the gist of my comment upon this matter. Something not dissimilar The Dehas taken place in England, and I simply mention it in passing so that the lesson may be applied here. One of the chief reasons why production has fallen below £5,000,000. Similar its target in Great Britain in that much of the vast sum which the British Government has expended has borne no relation whatever to production. Unless each of the items listed in these divisions can be to be, because those items are making demands on labour and materials in short supply-the n the Government should withdraw these Estimates and present fresh ones, including provision only for works which are absolutely essential.",31,Tokies Of The Commonwealth
103,Mr Spender (Warringah) [2.15],"Another matter which is of some though much lesser importance is referred to on the page of the Estimates T have indicated, and is in-clud'ed in the total sum proposed to be voted of £19,297,000. I refer to Divisions 36-37, Department of Labour and National Service, which proposes tospend £37,000during the current financial year. The greater portion of that amount relates to the acquisition of sites and buildings, estimated to cost £22,000. The sum of £7,126 was spent for this purpose last year. I believe that this department is guilty of gross extravagance. It operhave been speaking about will be found ates throughout Australia and employs a large number of people who have little to do, and I have received complaints from many sources regarding the money which it wastes. I cannot understand why the department's existence is being continued in the way proposed, and I eau only surmise that it is the natural consequence of establishing a government -department. Once established, a department seeks to perpetuate itself, which, in the case of bureaucracies, is just as natural as it is for a fish to swim. Accordingly, we find that this department, which is the direct successor of the man-power department, is now absorbing a vast amount of public money at a time when there is no need for a Department of Labour in the sense that a Commonwealth department is required at all to place people in employment. Any man who desires a job can get a job for himself to-day, and I wish to know why this department's existence is being continued, and what justification exists for providing 393. such a large sum of money for expenditure by it this year. The amount proposed to be voted is approximately five times the amount it spent last year. However, I do not wish to sidetrack myself. Can the Government give an assurance to this committee in precise terms that an accurate survey has been made as to the necessity for carrying out works which are estimated to cost approximating £20.000,000, so that the people can be satisfied that those works should be carried out during the current financial year ? I shall be very happy to know that that has been done, but I shall not be additions, new works, buildings, &c. satisfied by a mere general statement, more so when one recollects that £13,000,000 was much more than sufficient to cover similar expenditure last year. It is in this way that either money becomesextravagantly expended or the budget reflects an artificial expenditure, which, in turn, prevents a reduction of taxation. Those remarks apply only to the sum of £19,297,000. I have not dealt with the rest of the Estimates because I am not permitted to do so> hut I have a shrewd suspicion that the extent to which control is exercised in connection with what I to be reflected in every other department of government. There is only one observation that I wish to make in continuation of that. If one looks at page 394. one finds that the total of the proposed votes for additions, new works, buildings, &c, is nearly £30,000,000. A portion of that amount-£8,442,000-is for business undertakings, and another portion £2,228,000-is for territories of the Commonwealth. If I found that a larger proportion of this vast sum was to be expended upon business undertakings and territories of the Commonwealth, I should have more sympathy with the expenditure, but two-thirds of the total amount relates to various departments of State, and before being approved by the committee it ought to he justified up to the hilt by the Government. The second subject to which I desire to direct the attention of the committee is to be found in the item, ""Aluminium Industry (Act No. 44 of 1944) "" on page matter is not before the committee for discussion. It is the subject of a special appropriation, which is covered by an act of Parliament. not a matter for discussion, seeing that it appears in the Estimates for additions, new works, buildings, &c. ?

I regret very much that I am prevented from making some observations as 10 how this committee is being denied essential information. [ draw attention .to another matter, which will give me an opportunity of making a somewhat similar point. It seems to me that I am clearly entitled to refer to it, because it'appears under the estimates of the Department of the Treasury on page 397, the total of the proposed so. One warning which I sound, and votes for which is £51,300. Particulars are given, showing how that £51,300 is made up. It is shown that, in the year 1946-47, the sum of £100,000 was expended on the item "" Commonwealth Engineering Company Limited-Acqui sition of major interest "". Apparently, that is not a matter for a special appropriation. For some time, I have wondered whether the Government has obtained any legal advice, and if so when, as to its right to take up shares in indusengaging in. It is important that this trial concerns. I have always taken the view, and I believe it to be supported by the decision of the High Court in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case, that the Commonwealth has no power to appropriate money except for Commonwealth purposes, and Commonwealth purposes a re only purposes in respect of which this know, on this particular inatter, whether Parliament has power to make laws or the Executive has power to act, and they must be found within the Constitution. There is no power in the Constitution which will enable the Government to carry on industrial affairs or activities, and the only way in which its action can be supported is speaking in general terms by reference to the defence power. The point that I want to have answered is this: Under what authority was this sum of £100,000 expended on theacquisition of shares in Oommonwealth Engineering Company Limited? What is the nature of the company? What are its objectives, and its proposed developments? I ask that, because I have in -mind-if 1 may again make a passingreference-that , in respect of thealuminium industry, the attainment of an economically efficient production presupposes an ingot output of 10,000 tonsa year, and it is obvious from the report that has been tabled in the Senate, not here, that there is in contemplation in the minds of some members of the commission an extension of its activity intofabrication. This is important in my mind, because I have noticed, and I am sure that other members of the committee also have noticed only too often, that the Government is not concerned very much with the spirit of the Constitution; if it can find a way round the Constitution so as to defeat its spirit and expand a programme of socialization, it proposes to dowhich ought to be examined very closely by the committee, is that, by means of powers which are being exercised by the Government-for example, the power given to the Commonwealth Bank, under the Commonwealth Bank Act of 1945, to take up shares in industrial concernsmethods are being exploited by the Government for by-passing the Constitution and enabling it to engage in activities which it has no legislative war-rant for trend should be arrested, because I know that if and when a matter finally comes up for determination the High Court, in determining whether or not power is or is not existent, must in some sense take into consideration existing economic cuuditions in the country. SoI want to any legal advice has been obtained at any time as to the extent to which the Government is entitled, to invest its money in industrial organizations, and if so, whether there is any reason why that legal advice should not be made known to the members of this committee, so that they in turn may, armed with it. be able to keep watch over expenditure, so as to ensure that it shall be incurred within the limits of the legal advice that has",34,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

109,Mr Spender,"I how to your rulbeen given ; and in particular, what legislative warrant there was for the expenditure of £100,000 last year upon an investment in Commonwealth Engineering -Company Limited. Especially, I want to have an answer from the Minister on the point that I -have made in respect of the total of the proposed votes for additions, new works, buildings, &c, because I am sure that he will agree with me, and that no member of the committee will dispute, that, to the extent to which there is unnecessary competition between the Commonwealth and private citizens for goods and services which are in short supply, that it could uot be justified. Competition on the part of the Government can be justified only if there be an overriding necessity for it to make a prior claim upon the goods and services that are available in the community. I fear that the expenditure of the large sum of money contemplated for the current financial year will mean that claims will be made on materials and labour which are in short supply, and that the result will be a hardship to many people who wish to build tlieir own homes. Minister for Labour and National Service) [2.35] -The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) referred to the Commonwealth Employment Service. On other occasions I have answered questions relating to this activity and I have made some public statements regarding it. Nevertheless, it was quite proper for the honourable member to bring the matter before the committee, and I shall reply by drawing attention to some features with whicli, perhaps, he is not familiar. [ know that the honourable member does not criticize the expenditure involved in the re-establishment of ex-service men and women or other persons who had to be transferred from war work to peace work. That work has been carried out successfully, although at considerable cost, but I . ficient finance to keep the business funcdo not think that any honourable member will criticize what has been done. The honorahle member for Warringah then drew attention to the fact that something like'normal conditions had returned, and he contended that as the bulk of the demobilized ex-service men ancl women had been placed in employment, the cost of the Commonwealth Employment Service in respect of those now seeking jobs is too great. In different circumstances, that would be fair criticisim. Indeed, it is an aspect of government activity which has caused a great deal of concern. However, the Public Service Board is gradually, but surely, getting matters placed on a permanent basis, and many persons who had been only temporarily employed have been placed in other jobs. Some of thc criticism of honorahle memhers opposite has been unfair; they have divided the aggregate cost hy the number of persons placed in employment, and have reached the conclusion that it cost £3 a head to find jobs for demobilized men and women. The total sum shown in the Estimates was not expended in placing men and women in employment, as the staff did many other things besides that. That kind of criticism is unfair. I do not suggest that the honorahle member for Warringah has heen unfair. is necessary to expend £37,000 this year when most of the problems of re-employment ought to have been solved. necessary to expend all that amount this year, but it is thought wise to provide sufficient, to meet all possible contingencies. The honourable member referred to matters associated with a company which had been formed to take over an engineering establishment formerly conducted by Waddingtons Proprietary Limited. During the war that company carried out some most important work for the Government, but when those who previously stood behind it financially withdrew their support, the firm got into difficulties. Recognizing the importance of the work which the company had undertaken, the Government came to its rescue and provided suftioning so that work would not be held up. So successful was the result that the -Government recently decided to enter into an agreement to acquire a major interest in the concern. The advice received by the Government was that its action was according to the law; but, of course, that point could be contested at any time.",35,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

119,Mr Lemmon,"I do not know whatnot perform the physical work to anything like the same degree as does the Department of ""Works and Housing now. When the Allied Works Council went out of existence, and the Department of Works and Housing was set up, a Cabinet direction was given that any work for other departments, which the Department of Works and Housing undertook to do, should be examined by me, and 1 have laid it down that all major works which require materials in competition with housing must be examined by the Public Works Committee. Five proposals, which will be brought before the Parliament within the next fortnight, will eventually be referred to the Public Works Committee. I do not refer to the committee proposals for aerodrome construction, even though the cost may be considerable, because the technical draughting work is done by officials of the Department of Civil Aviation, working in collaboration with engineers of my department. In any case, such works do not -compete to any great degree for materials with the housing programme, and I generally pass the proposals myself. It was natural that when the housing problem was not so acute as it is now, the government of the day did not consider it necessary to refer many undertakings to the Public Works Committee, but under present conditions it is desirable that proposals should be examined by an outside body-that is, a body outside the -department. I know that it is very easy for executives to develop a departmental -complex. I thank the Minister( Mr Lemmon) for replying to my observations. It is obvious, from the remark of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Minister did, to the work done by the Holloway), that, in some instances, money is to be appropriated, not because it is really needed, hut because the Government thinks it might have to spend the money. Mi-. BARNARD. -Did not the honourable member do the same when he was Treasurer ? observations ever made in this House are such remarks as, "" What did you do last vear. or even 50 years ago?"". I am concerned with what is happening now. If we were wrong, let us correct it. Before the war, the total estimated expenditure for a year used to be less than £100,000,000, but now we are budgeting for an expenditure four or five times that amount. The Estimates are the basis upon which taxation is determined, and upon which taxation concessions depend. Therefore, it is important that the Estimates should represent a fair judgment of what is likely to be expended-no t of what the Government might like to have in hand in case it wants to spend more. The important conclusion is that there is no over-all economic survey of the demands which the Government is justified in making upon the resources of the community. The actual figures are not important except insofar as they reflect the effect of a survey of economic resources. The ability of a country to finance public undertakings depends on the materials and labour available, and on a marriage between those materials and labour. It is proposed to appropriate the huge total of £19,297,000 for new works, apart from business undertakings and territories of the Commonwealth, but, as I have pointed out, these figures do not in every instance present a fair estimate of what will be expended this year. If any evidence were required beyond the admission of the Minister for Lahour and National Service it is to he found by examining what took place last year. At page 395 of the Estimates it is set out that the total vote under this heading was £12,992,000, whereas the amount actually expended was only £6,436,844. I should have thought that it would have been as plain as a pikestaff that the same thing will take place this year. The first observation I make is that it is not sufficient to refer, as the Public Works Committee. I do not criticize the work which the committee does; I merely say that however important and valuable its services may be it is quite impossible for it to make a survey of all that is involved in all public works in terms of man-power and material. If one looks at any particular project from the angle as to whether or not it is one in which the Government should engage, unless one is able to evaluate the demands",37,Tokies Of The Commonwealth
120,Mr Spender (Warringah) [2.51],,38,Tokies Of The Commonwealth
121,Mr Spender,"The most futileof the project in. terms of material and Labour in relation to the requirements of other works, any judgment formed would be judgment in the abstract. At a time when the community is subject to heavy shortages the essential need is to have a picture of the total works and of the demands they are likely to make on materials and labour which are in short supply. Then only are we in a position to determine whether the totai withdrawal of materials and man-power for governmental purposes is justified. No honourable member on this side of the chamber disputes the provision of approximately £7,000,000 for the construction of war service homes. Whilst[ accept the explanation of the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) in relation to his own department, on the assumption limits, the money to be provided is likely to be expended for that purpose, I do not agree with his defence of other departments, such as the Department of the Interior. Under Division 10, item 1, £952,000 has been provided for Commonwealth offices and other buildingsacquisition of sites and buildings. Last year the vote for that item was £1,169,000, but only £206,924 was expended. One has only to look at these figures to realize that this is not the the money. He then proceeded to say way for us as a committee to determine how the moneys voted for the Government are to be expended or, what is more fundamentally important, to what extent their expenditure draws upon the resources of the community. establish some organization to keep a close survey of the estimates of the departments so that two things will result, firstly, when the estimates are brought in they will he substantially equivalent to what will actually be expended in the year, and second, the estimates will present to the committee data which will show the extent to which governmental expenditure is expected to draw upon resources in short supply. Only lien will the committee be in a position to advise the Government as to whether or not a particular project or projects should or should not be undertaken. Approximately £8,000,000 of the total provision for additions, new works and Mr Spender. buildings is to be devoted to home building. In other words, the total amount to be expended on housing represents lesa than one-third of the total votes for additions, new works and buildings. Saving regard to what is taking place in the community, with the large number of people struggling their hardest to get homes but being unable to obtain materials and certain requirements essential to the equipment of homes, there is a prime obligation on the Government to ensure that its demands on the limited resources of the country are only commensurate with its actual needs. Minister for Labour and National Service) [3.3] I am afraid that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr that, within reasonable Spender) has taken up the attitude of a professional debator and has erected a straw man for the sole purpose of knocking him down again. Some of his debating points are, to say the least, contradictory. In the first place, the honourable gentleman said that the amount of money provided in these Estimates-whethe r it be £20,000,000 or £50,000,000-doe s not matter, that what was of importance was the drain on materials, labour and services represented by the expenditure of that the Government should not provide money on the Estimates and then not expend it. mittee can deal with these proposals only I urge the Government to on the basis of what is provided in the Estimates. member complained that the Government placed too much money on the Estimates and that it expended too little. The answer to that criticism has already been furnished by the honourable gentleman himself. In many instances the amounts provided last year were not expended because of the shortage of materials and labour. The Government has no alternative but to place on the Estimates sufficient money for the purposes it has in mind. If insufficient moneys are provided, the Government may find itself unable to proceed with its plans during the ensuing twelve months. Why not place the whole of the money expected",38,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

What harm can result to the community from the method now adopted? not understand stand. I agree with the honourable member to the extent that materials, labour and services are the real things that count and not the estimated cost of a project expressed in terms of money. The honourable gentleman criticized the estimates of my own department for last year, seeking to convey the implication that the estimates should have been more closely related to the expenditure. Let me give the honourable member an illustration of how difficult it is to foresee what expenditures are likely to be encountered. I was under the impression that the Government's scheme for the training of ex-service men and women in professions, businesses, trades and callings would gradually peter out. I warned my colleagues in the Ministry not to overdo the provision for that purpose. I thought that this year would see a very great diminution of the number of applications for training courses; but I was wrong. We find now that hundreds of thousands of pounds will be required, both this year and next year, for the continuation of the scheme. Rather than be short of money for that purpose, full provision has been made. Surelyi t is not bad government to have too much money to meet legitimate requirements instead of too little, as was too often the case in the an outstanding admission in, "" What is past.

I want to make one observation with respect ito the remarks of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway). The Minister said that there is an inconsistency between saying that the real test is the economic resources of the country and finance. Government finance, after all, is represented by the figures submitted by the Executive, which are supposed to represent the demand which it proposes to make upon our resources of labour and materials. It seems to me that if a provision is simply made in the Estimates on the hypothesi? that we should expend the mpney if we can, without any real indication being given as to the need to expend it in the financial year, having regard to the competing claims of the community, the utmost encouragement is given to the department concerned to expend as much of the money as it possibly can. In other words, there is a complete lack of control of expenditure. This raises a matter of fundamental importance. For a long time past it has heen obvious to most honourable members that finance has slipped from the control of the Government to the control of the departments which prepare the Estimates. But here we have wrong with putting into the Estimates a sum of money on the offehance that we shall be able to expend it ? "" No greater",39,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

Worlcs and Housing) [3.10] -The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) said that no explanation had been given of the proposed expenditure on works, but I claim that there has been. said, that I had explained only £10,000,000 of the £29,967,000 proposed to be expended. That is not true. I pointed out that £9,000,000 was for technical equipment and otlier works for the Postmaster General's £10,000,000 was for housing. That amounts to £19,000,000. ThenI indicated the work that the Department of Works and Housing was doing for the Repatriation Commission, and that it was proposed to spend £7,000,000 on behalf of the Department of Civil Aviation. I cannot remember the other two items, but they with the balance practically made up the whole of the money proposed to be expended. Before any item was placed on the Estimates it had to run the gauntlet of, first, an inter-departmental committee presided over by the Director-General of Works and Housing, myself and, finally, a sub-committee of Cabinet. The admission of any item was governed by the availability of labour and materials. What the honourable gentleman suggested is practically in operation to-day, for the first time, I think. future time a summary of how the money is to be expended. as Minister responsible for carrying out the works, that it is physically possible to finish the jobs we hav:: in hand with the money proposed to bo voted leaving a. balance at the end of the financial year to enable works to continue until the next budget. We hnve not exaggerated our needs to carry out the works provided for. When the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) says, "" It is hoped that we shall be able to carry out this work"", he is speaking truthfully. Some proposed items of expenditure were vetoed. We allowed provision to be made for only those works considered absolutely essential and possible of achievement within the next twelve months. Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [3.15] -Honorabl e members sought information about the provision of facilities for the Department of Civil Aviation in various parts of Australia. He One of the matters which have been stressed, and stressed fairly by the honourable memher for Capricornia ( Mr Davidson), the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), and the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Department and that Francis), was that insufficient provision has been made for facilities and landing grounds in country centres. matter. member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) raised the matter earlier, when we discussed the general Estimates. However, those doubts have no foundation, and I have taken the opportunity to obtain some of the details showing where the money will be expended and what kind of facilities will be provided. The policy of the Government wasenunciated some time ago by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), and I do not see any reason for deviating from it. No matter what political party was in oflice, it should not provide ianding grounds at places which are so close to one another as to take away from a community centre the traffic which would ordinarily come to it, and endeavour to divide it. We had this experience with our railway systems. As a former railwayman, I know of it. Large sums of money were expended on constructing railway stations so close to one another that after a period of years some of them had to be closed or became woman-in-charge or no-one-in-charge stations. That happened because of the foolish policy of yielding to political pressure to provide railway stations at any point that was sought. I hope that we shall never return to that condition of affairs, because civil aviation, like the railways, would be overcapitalized and it would be difficult to meet interest charges. Such an undertaking would have around its neck",40,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

Any suggestion that the Government is neglecting the interests of country centres is wrong. I shall repeat, very briefly, the policy which the Government has adopted. It provides that the Commonwealth shall accept responsibility for the provision of airfield and airways facilities, at centres which are approved, as regular stopping places on an approved air service. The provision of such facilities at centres approved as optional stopping places, or at places not served by a regular air service, must remain the responsibility of the local authorities concraft which use them. This number of cerned. On the basis of that policy, we are not able to accede to requests for the construction of aerodromes here and there, unless sound reasons can be advanced for the expenditure. If honourable members opposite are sincere in their claim that the Government should reduce taxes to the lowest level possible, they will not advocate wasteful expenditure on providing facilities in excessof those really required for the benefit of the community. As Minister for Civil Aviation, I personally am opposed to doing that, although I desire to see civil aviation in Australia developed to the greatest possible degree with the means at our command. The number of landing grounds outside capital cities, which will be improved or extended during the current financial year, exceeds 70. The cost of this work, according to the Estimates, will exceed £1,900,000 and the greatest expenditure on any one ground will be £60,000. for Coolangatta ? the details of the expenditure in a few moments, but I do not want the honourable member for Moreton, to be too parochially minded about a particular town in his electorate. penditure would be greater if sufficient plant, materials and labour were available. During World War II . civil aviation was starved. Many men, such as technicians, surveyors, engineers and radio experts, who were required for its development, were on active service. When they were demobilized, they became available to the department, and, necessarily, expenditure on civil aviation hasgreatly increased this year, compared with last year. I hope that there will be a greater increase next year, because that would indicate a development of civil aviation which would he of benefit to the people of Australia. The funds authorized or to he authorized for maintenance alone amount to£275,000. As soon as practicable, the Department of Civil Aviation will take over all essential grounds on scheduled air routes and bring them to a condition to meet the full requirements of the airlanding grounds will exceed 100. The department is particularly concerned regarding the necessity to provide passenger facilities at all grounds under its control. For example, plans are being prepared for buildings suitable to cope with the traffic at each aerodrome. These buildings will include waiting lounges, toilet facilities, offices, and, where needed, places for technical equipment. The building of these units will proceed in order of priority as materials become available. A few days ago, an air terminal building, not completely new and not permanent, was opened at Mascot so as to provide greater conveniences for the handling of the growing number of passengers from overseas. In my opinion, the facilities at the Canberra aerodrome are not adequate to meet the volume of traffic to-day, and we hope to extend them. However, many other places have little or no provision of this kind, and they are included in the list. With the concurrence of the committee I shall incorporate the information in Hansard rather than inflict on them the reading of a long list of figures.

The honourable member for Capricornia asked that additional facilities should be provided for coastal areas, yet he also desires established at Smithton it would inevitthat an aerodrome shall be provided at Gladstone. I do not know in which class he puts Gladstone, but I understand that it is about 60 miles by air from Rockhampton and about 150 miles from Maryborough, which places already enjoy services. I sympathize with the honourable gentleman's desire that Gladstone should be included in any programme for aviation facilities, for it is a town with a fair population; but I am informed that it would be most expensive to construct an aerodrome there. Gladstone was a stopping place at one time for the flying boats, but now that it is not a stopping place for that service the circumstances in relation to it have altered. Representations enough business for two services. have been made for some years for better facilities at Gladstone. I have obtained technical advice on the subject from time to time, and I have been informed that the only place suitable for an aerodrome is close to the beach, and that a considerhope of anything being done at Smithable expenditure would be needed to make it usable. The Department of Civil Aviation will not be able to provide an aerodrome there, in the near future at any rate. If approval were given to all the proposals of the honourable member for Capricornia, it would be necessary to expend £250,000 on coastal areas. Requests made by the honourable member in this respect are similar to requests that have been made by other honourable gentlemen whose electorates include both coastal and inland areas. I sympathize with the honourable gentlemen who make these submissions, but I regret that it is not practicable to accede to them. The suggestion that the Government is juggling with millions of pounds, to the disadvantage of country districts, is, however, quite unjustified. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has asked that an aerodrome should be provided at Smithton. I visited Tasmania, and discussed this subject with a local deputation. However, it has been decided to establish an aerodrome at Pardo, which, although not actually in the honourable member's electorate, is very close to its border. In the circumstances, it will not be possible to construct an aerodrome at Smithton. Wr. Drakeford. I have already pointed out that an amount of more than £30,000 is to be spent at Wynyard. If an aerodrome were ako ably mean that the facilities to be provided at Wynyard would not be so fully used. I can appreciate the desire of the honorahle member that an aerodrome should be constructed at Smithton, and I realize that Smithton is in a very good district, but, as the result of most careful investigations, it has been decided that Pardo shall be the location of an aerodrome for that district. If an aerodrome were established at Smithton also, the volume of passenger and goods traffic from Wynyard would obviously be curtailed. Dame ENID LYONS -There would be but considerable additional expenditure would be involved which, under present conditions, the Government does not consider to be justified. There is not much ton in the near future. I regret the decision, but cannot escape it. The' honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) referred to the circumstances existing in his electorate and was quite justified in presenting his case as he did. The Government, however, has to take a. comprehensive view of this subject, and it must keep future prospects in mind. In this connection, the interdepartmental committee has recommended in relation to Queensland-thoug h I am not saying that all its recommendations will be adopted-that the services be established from Brisbane to Oakey, Roma and Mitchell and from Brisbane to Tenterfield and Glen Innes. The next is Rockhampton-Longreach. Another, in which the honourable member for Herbert will be interested, is Townsville-Charters Towers-Julia Creek-Cloncnrry. One in which the honourable member for Moreton will be interested is Brisbane-Coolangatta-Casino. The last is Cairns-Georgetown-Croydon. Those are services which the inter-departmental committee recommended that the Government should operate. I point out, however, that under existing constitutional powers the Government cannot provide those services because, with the exception of that from",44,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

Calling at Coolangatta might be regarded as outside its jurisdiction. generally have not been co-operative. One cantaot expect companies such as Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and they will not be induced, to operate developmental services which will not return a profit to their shareholders, unless the Government gives -them a sufficient amount, by means -of either a direct subsidy or a high payment for the carriage of airmails, to enable them to obtain approximately 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, on their capital outlay. some people who, so far, have not had operating experience, are prepared to undertake a service without a subsidy. Buti f the Government took them at their word, it would be found that when their aircraft or equipment had to be renewed, or there had been some change of circumstances not originally contemplated and involving them in more expense, they would immediately say, ""We cannot carry on without a subsidy "". An honourable member would then come to this Parliament and say that his electorate must have this service, and the only alternative to allowing it to cease to operate would be to pay it a subsidy. That has been the experience in the past, and we do not want it to happen again. Trans-Australia Airlines can operate on a developmental basis. To-day, in the -centre of Australia, a very good service is being operated by a man named Conellan, who has 39 stopping places on the round trip that he makes once a fortnight, and probably has a few incidental services. I pay tribute to that young man, who has done a very good job indeed. ment get power to conduct intra-state services ? [37] ing to explain that it is because we have not the necessary power that we cannot do what honourable members want us to do. There is no doubt that they want, us to conduct intra-state services.

I hope that I have answered most of the points that have -been raised during the debate. I conclude by saying that there is no justification whatever for suggesting that country interests are being neglected in favour of city interests. It is well for honourable members to remember that practically all It is true that services eventually come into the city, from whatever point they may begin to operate. Hardly any of the airlines operating anywhere in Australia to-day are merely from one country centre to another. Those that come into the cities have to be equipped with radio apparatus, which is fairly expensive. We have no desire to shut out the enterprising young man who wants to establish a service such as that which is operating in Central Australia and is receiving a subsidy of £10,500 per annum, which is gladly provided by three departments. A government, if it is to operate on sound lines, must he sure that the money which it, puts into civil aviation will not be wasted, but will return the utmost value and provide the best service. ' I do not consider that obtaining a return on the money expended is the paramount consideration as far as country interests are concerned. I should like the outback areas to be given a service which will enable people who are suffering disadvantages and are not receiving sufficient amenities under present conditions to have further amenities provided for them through the development of Trans-Australia Airlines, which is prepared to give that kind of service.",45,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

152,Mr Drakeford,"I am sorry if ILave had the usual reply from the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford). Last night, he read an eight-page statement, in the course of which he tried to explain why the Australian National Airlines Commission had wasted millions of pounds. Now, he has tried to baffle the committee by referring to towns in which, according to him, aerodromes are being built, although some of them have had aerodromes for the last twenty years. He has brushed aside the proposal of the honourable memher for Capricornia ( Mr Davidson) that Gladstone, an isolated town in Queensland, could well do with an aerodrome so as to bring it into closer contact with the aerodrome, new buildings for the staff, larger centres in that State, by saying that it is not possible to find a. site for being that the Government is doing somean aerodrome. WhatI said was that there is only one site. able gentleman said, that was the idea which he intended to convey. He is the greatest excuse-finder there has ever been in connection with the development of civil aviation. The outback services provided by Conellan and others that he has paid tribute to were founded before the advent of the Labour Government. The Minister and his kind are putting them out of business with the nationalistic, monopolistic scheme that is being put into operation. Last night, I quoted figures showing that Trans-Australia Airlines had had £4,500,000 advanced to it , not for the development of civil aviation, but so that it might endeavour to put out of business the other civil airlines that are operating on the main air routes. The existing private companies, with a few more aircraft, would have done the job much better than all the Coles, Taylors and other non-flying men who have been given political appointments and are being paid huge salaries by the Government to run the National Airlines Commission. The outback is being neglected by the Government. The Minister has endeavoured to show that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has become a monopoly because it has been able to resist the Government's efforts to sabotage it. That company, and the other private aviation companies in Australia, sprang from very small beginnings. They have done the pioneering work, and the Government is now "" cashing in "" on their success. I offer no criticism of the service which Trans-Australia Airlines is providing. Its aircraft are flown by young men who were members of the Royal Australian Air Porce and were well trained. But there is a definite waste of the taxpayers' money on top-heavy overhead expenditure, which is subject to no accounting, no balance-sheet, and no profit and loss account. The Minister has endeavoured to make a show by mentioning a few figures, and talking about radio appliances at this and that and aerodrome development, his pretence thing for the advancement of civil aviation. Nothing of the kind. The Government, as the honourable gentleman and the Prime 3Iinister( Mr Chifley) have admitted, are seeking from the Government of Queensland supplementary powers which will enable Trans-Australia Airlines to become common air carriers within that State. If that is done, it will be "" good-bye"" to the small companies which have struggled for so long-me n who served in World WarI . and have applied their war gratuity and pay to the purchase of aircraft, which they have operated successfully although they have been subjected to great hardship. This government monopoly line will operate over the same routes, and put them out of business. That was admitted this week in reply to a question which I asked as to whether the Government was taking over the charter of New Guinea Airways, a company which pioneered the development of New Guinea and made it possible for Australia to hold that territory, because the pilots who flew its machines were more or less the pathfinders for those who later took to the air during the war. The reply that I received was that the act gave the Government power to put that company out of business as soon as Trans-Australia Airlines found it possible to operate in that territory, even though it had never flown a single aircraft between Adelaide and Darwin. When it does so, it will "" cut the throat""",46,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

155,Mr White,"Whateve r the honorof this company, which developed the gold-fields of New Guinea and the North-South Australia route. What is going to happen to the small operators such as Adair, Conellan, Butler and many others, men whom I know, who started from small beginnings and needed a government subsidy at the outset? Of course, those who operate small services in the outback need subsidies! Australia Airlines needs. the people of Australia are taxed so severely is that millions of pounds are being provided for this concern, which -ultimately will liquidate private airline operators as effectively as the Government expects to liquidate the private banks. The Minister has tried to excuse what is being done by saying, "" I am a railway man. I know that, in the past, many railways have been built to distant areas, and eventually only derelict stations have been left"" . That shows how out of date the honourable gentleman is. He regards airlines through railway spectacles. We might as well get the last survivor of Cobb and Company to take over the administration of the railways. Airlines can be immediately switched from place to place, and can be developed. Aerodromes at all times, if near settlements, can be of use. We should not listen to such excuses. It is high time there was a royal commission to inquire into the whole of the administration of the Department of Civil Aviation. The Minister has admitted that something like £11,500,000 is to be expended. I do not know whether that relates to this financial into adopting this attitude. I held these year. Certainly, £4,500,000 is to go this year to one concern. Unless there is a royal commission, private airlines, from the smallest to the greatest, will not be allowed to continue to operate. The time has long since passed when this Government, and for that matter all governments, should begin to give some consideration to the people in country areas. I suppose that the committee should be thankful to the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford) for the long explanation that he gave in connection with the activities of the Department of Civil Aviation. But I , for one, cannot agree with him. He has said that one reason why aerodromes cannot be provided in country centres is that the Government has to be absolutely certain that it is not engaging in what will not be a profitable undertaking. The only way to justify the statement that country services would not pay would be to prove that there would not be enough passengers travelling from those places at which country members are asking that aerodromes he built. I do not know how it was decided that a town with a population of 15,000 people could not support an air service, when every day of every week the people of sucfi towns travel by train to the nearest point where they may board aeroplanes. I am not referring only to places in the Herbert electorate. I know many other places with populations ranging from 4,000 to 10,000 which are without air services of any kind, and I should like to know how long this state of affairs is to continue. A substantial part of the money which is to be appropriated is to be used to extend existing aerodromes. People living in the big centres of population have always had an advantage over those living in the country. For the city people, the expenditure of this money will mean that instead of getting a service three or four times a day they will be able to have one five or six times a day, and the runways will be so improved that larger and more modern aircraft can be used. That is all very well for people in the cities, but the situation has not improved at all for people in the country. I have not heen stampeded opinions long before it was my good fortune, or my misfortune, to become a member of this Parliament. I see no reason why air services should not be provided for places like Proserpine, with a population of nearly 6,000, and for centres in the Burdekin, Herbert Biver and Innisfail districts, with a total population of between 20,000 and 25,000 people. is on the wrong side of the House. right side, but the advisers of the Government have been on the wrong track.",47,Tokies Of The Commonwealth

I agree with him up to a point, and merely point out that as my wife and I live in the city some exceptions must be allowed. However, this is not a matter to be treated lightly. The Minister merely assumes that air services to some country by taking over a majority of the shares centres would not pay. No proof has been offered. I do not ask for the same sort of service as is given to the cities. That of £100,000 had been expended, the comwould be ridiculous, because the great centres of population need more extensive services, but if a service of only one or how much more money had been protwo trips a week were provided it would be of great; benefit to people in country centres. Failing that, some kind of feeder service should be provided from country towns to places where passengers may hoard the big aeroplanes. As things are, the country people are not in the race. I suppose the Minister has made up his mind, and as the Estimates are already prepared, it is probably somewhat late for me to go on arguing. I wish to make it clear, however, that the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr note that the Estimates provide for the Davidson) and the honorahle member for Moreton( Mr Francis) are not the only ones who have protested against the -neglect of country towns.

It seems that the proposed board will be only a snare and a delusion as far as> the primary producers, the people whose interests are at stake, are concerned. If the board recommends that a certain policy be applied and the Minister says, ""No; Government's policy, and I am not in favour of it"", and sets out the line that must be followed, the board automatically, under this legislation, is compelled to agree. I remind honourable members that we have had experience in the past of that sort of thing and are afr.aid that we may have similar experiences in the future. For instance, the wheat agreement with New Zealand was made by the then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, Mr Scully, without, I understand, the knowledge of the Australian ""Wheat Board. I acquit the present Minister of responsibility for that contract. It was left to him as a legacy by his predecessor. I am afraid, however, that this legislation may be another part of the legacy, and I view with grave concern the placing of such tremendous power in the hands of the Minister in dealing with produce of the greatest value to the country. There is no trouble in marketing problem is not the sale of dairy produce but increased production, and I believe that the Government cannot be held blameless for the way in which production has declined in the last few years. The figures are illuminating. Australia produced 217,000,000 lb. of butter compared with only 116,000,000 lb. in 1946-47. It may be urged that the decline in 1946-47 was caused partially by severe droughts, which I admit is correct, but, at the same the Government failed to take action to make for the butter producers as for other primary producers. Many people were able by closing their dairy operations to make more money by fattening stock and breeding store stock for sale. Is it any wonder they went out of dairying to the detriment of the industry and to the Regulabenefit of their own pockets? If the honourable member cannot connect his remarks with the appointment of an Australian Dairy Produce Board, he is wide of the provisions of the bill. it will be difficult to connect my remarks with the bill, because a few moments ago I said increased production was more that does not agree with the necessary than a board to control the sale of dairy produce. deal with a decrease or increase of production. It deals with the appointment of a board to carry out specific duties. I do not want to embarrass the honourable memher, because he has done very well so far. to embarrass you, Mr Speaker, and bow to your ruling by refraining from further reference to that subject. When the board was first established legislation was passed through the State parliaments and the Australian Parliament which allowed dairy produce to be marketed in perhaps the most orderly fashion of any primary produce in Australia. It operated to the entire satisfaction of the industry. I remind the House that the board was not subject to any of the severe restrictions that will be placed on it by this legislation. That board was allowed, dairy produce. Our in effect, a free hand. It was composed of men with long experience of not only production but also marketing of dairy produce, and they did a job that met with the approval of the majority of dairy farmers in Australia. My interpretaIn 193S-39 tion of the bill is that the board will be shorn of the powers reposed in the previous board. SoI do not wonder at the complaints against the severe restrictions placed on the dairy-farmers in this legislation. We have heard a great deal time, about the power of veto in recent years, but it appears fashionable to expect thai conditions as favorable Ministers of the Crown shall be clothed with that power. It will be detrimental to the industry that a single person at a moment's notice, will be able to upset the considered policy laid down by the board for the well-being and prosperity of the dairying industry.

169,Mr Mcdonald,"I have no desirecomplaint is against the minority representation of the dairy-farmers, working seven days a week and 365 days a year to make production possible. They are entitled to a great deal more consideration than they receive in the bill. A much fairer way of ensuring the dairy farmers of adequate representation on the board would be an election of their representatives by them as the people concerned. Commerce and Agriculture, in reply to a "" Dorothy Dix"" question, gave an assurance that he had made up his mind that the chairman whom he would appoint would be a primary producer. That is all very well, but the fact remains that he will be hand-picked by the Minister. I believe that the old system of electing a chairman is much more satisfactory and much more likely to inspire and retain the confidence of the dairy-farmers. I do not desire to talk at 'length on the bill, because I know that many other honourable members are interested in it and will place their views before the Minister, but I recommend to him that he re-consider the advisability of larger representation of the dairy-farmers on the board, reexamine the extensive powers that he is taking unto himself, agree that they are rather too sweeping and admit the right of the dairy-farmers to elect their own representatives instead of having them appointed by him. The amendment of the Dairy Produce Export Control Act 1924-1942 proposed by the Government in the measure now before us will, in my opinion, destroy the constructive work of those associated with the uplifting of the industry during the last 30 years. This bill seeks to eliminate control of the dairying industry hy the dairymen themselves and to substitute for that control complete ministerial and political domination. The existing act safeguards the right of individuals engaged in the industry to elect their own representatives to the Australian Dairy Produce Control Board. At present the producers directly elect four representatives to the board, and indirectly, through the butter factories, elect an additional nine representatives. Thus, out of a board consisting of seventeen members, the producers directly and indirectly elect thirteen members. Provision has also been made in the act for election of a representative by the Institute of Australian Dairy Factory Managers and Secretaries. For some extraordinary reason the representative of the institute has been completely dropped in the proposal now before us. From my experience of the operations of the board in the past I am Recently the Minister for well aware of the useful function performed by the institute's representative. Accordingly, I am amazed that no provision for the continuance of that representation has been made in the bill before us. The measure provides for the selection of two representatives of producers who are to be nominated by the Minister from a panel of names submitted to him by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. If the Minister does not indicate how many names shall be included on the panel he may have 100 persons to choose from, and gradually whittle the number clown until he reaches two that are most acceptable to him. The selection of producers' representatives is a matter upon which the producers themselves should have the final and sole decision. The unions, too, are no longer to have the privilege of electing their own representative. He, too, is to be nominated by the Minister after consultation with the unions. ""When the Dairy Produce Control Board was first established in 1924 the Bruce-Page Government insisted that the dairymen should determine who should be appointed to the board. That principle was adhered to in the subsequent amendment of the act -in 1935. Provision was also made for the board to control its own affairs, to appoint its own chairman ancl to decide its own policy, control by the Minister being limited to the normal supervisory control exercised by Ministers in charge of Commonwealth departments. Under the bill now before us, however, the chairman is to be a nominee of the Government. Should he dissent from the opinions of all other members of the board and register his dissent with the Minister within 24 hours, the Minister may veto or vary the decision of the board, and any variation so made is to be deemed to be a decision of the board",51,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading

Their tribulations, however, had the effect of awakening the dairy-farmers to the necessity for organizing their industry and they promptly set to work to bring about desirable reforms. Up to that time they had received for their product the price it brought overseas, less the cost of freight; those who bought it refusing to give them a higher price knowing that in the last resort the d airy-farmera would have to submit. Therefore they set to work to secure, first, a higher export price than they were able to obtain under ordinary conditions, and, secondly, a home-consumption price which would he in conformity with the conditions under which they had to live and work. the right honourable gentleman connect those statements with the appointment of the board ? that the board was able to achieve certain to frustrate my ruling.

Produce Board in 1924, the industry had always been dealt with in State compartments, as it were; that is to say, each State regarded the dairying industry within its boundaries as its own special problem, and paid no consideration to conditions in other States. The result was that if conditions in New South Wales were slightly better than in Victoria, dairy-farmers in Victoria sent their butter to New South Wales. That lead to the destruction of the good market in New South Wales, and immense confusion resulted. Dairyfarmers of Queensland, who exported SO per cent, of their butter, could do immeasurable damage to the dairying iudustry of the other States. As theresult of the establishment of the Australian Dairy Produce Board, we wereable, for the first time, to get an Australian outlook on these problems, and unified ideas regarding the manner in which the industry should be conducted. The activities of the board resulted in the adoption of certain definite reforms, which immediately increased the returns to dairy-farmers.

192,Sir Earle Page,"The powers ofcontrolling the export of primary products like meat and canned fruits, the board was also able to secure from overseas shipping companies a concession of £2,000,000 a year in freights. That saving really represented an increased return to the dairy farmers of Australia, ancl thereby enhanced the value not merely of their own product but also, to that degree, of export parity, because export parity was really the price received overseas less the cost of shipment. The board was also able to insist upon the adoption of the equalization and stabilization scheme. This permitted in Australia a home-consumption price which, during the financial and economic depression of the 'thirties, was no less than 56s. a cwt. higher than the external price. That was instrumental in enabling thousands of dairy farmers to remain on their farms. If honourable members will examine the figures relating to the industry, they will find that when the board came into existence, 60,000 dairy farmers were engaged in the industry. At the outbreak of World War II . in'1939, there were 125,000 dairy farmers. That increase was attributable to the individual benefits which this collective organization had been able to obtain for dairy farmers. The operations of the board were so successful because it had full authority to deal as it thought fit with the handling, marketing and storage of dairy produce. Consequently, the board was able to make substantial gains for dairy farmers and improve their whole position. One achievement of the board, which was of extraordinary value at the outbreak of World War II . , was to make a contract with the Government of the United Kingdom for the sale of Australian dairy produce, ancl thus was able to ensure an almost imperceptible transition of the dairying industry from peace-time to wartime conditions. That imperceptible transition contrasted with the difficulties which many other industries encountered, resulting in some instances, in a complete hiatus in their arrangements. As honourable members will recall many industries were seriously dislocated at the outbreak of World War II . as the result of the sudden change which occurred in their normal activities. However, dairymen were able to continue with the production of their commodities with the certainty that they had an assured market. That was of great importance in war-time, and will be important in any arrangements which Australia might make in future with the Government of the United Kingdom for a long-term contract for the sale of our dairy produce. Furthermore, it is of great importance in regard to any gain which might accrue to Australia as the result of an arrangement permitting us to sell our produce to the United States of America. It would be in the highest degree impolitic for us to have a series of competitive arrangements for sending produce to the American market and cutting one anothers' throats. Why, the first action of the board on taking office in 1924 was to license the exporters and sellers of butter ancl wipe out the f.o.b. sellers of butter who had been raking the market in Australia and interfering with the best prices in London. The board delicensed those men, and ensured that the whole of the Australian sales passed through one channel. When the Government decided to pay a subsidy, the board which was asked to distribute the money was the equalization organization that had been brought into existence through the influence of the Australian Dairy Produce Board. Consequently, I contend that the activities which the board has been undertaking for a number of years should, if possible, be left untrammelled. The authority to deal with the dairying industry should be an industry-authority, and not a political or governmental authority. That is the aim of Australian dairy farmers. In committee, I shall test the feeling of honourable members as to whether the Government's proposal to appoint two representatives of the producers to the board is reasonable. In my opinion, it is not. When I introduced amending legislation in 1935, I made provision for the appointment to the board of four representatives of producers. One was to be elected by the producers of New South Wales, one by the producers of Victoria, one by the producers of Queensland, and the fourth by the combined vote of the producers of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. It is a matter for argument whether the progress of the dairying industry in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania during the last twelve years does not entitle them togreater representation on the board. The proposed reduction of the number of board members to twelve is of much less importance than the assuring to producers and others concerned of equitable representation of all interests. It would It is proposed in this amending legislabe better to have sixteen or seventeen members on the board and to have all sections of the industry satisfied than to members of the board the Minister may reduce the board membership and have some section dissatisfied, I refer in passing to the provision for go so far as to say that it is utterly the payment of salaries. In the past a number of members of the board have heen members of the Commonwealth or 'State parliaments who have not been -entitled to fees. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) pointed out recently ""that the acceptance of fees by members of (Parliament would contravene the Constitution. I am quite satisfied that there of the board. In other words, the chairis not much reason for undue concern on this score. The men who have been chosen hitherto to serve on the board have done yeoman service and the cost of ensuring adequate representation to all Sections of the industry would not be very ter I have proved that it is wise to allow great. The producers, of course, should Have a full say in all matters to be dealt own difficulties. They get along much with by the hoard. Under the new provisions proposed to be incorporated in the legislation, thc chairman of the board will be able to over-ride the decisions of all his colleagues. Por many years I administered this legislation and I have been in close contact with other honourable gentlemen who, since that time, have administered it. I cannot remember a single instance when during the 23 years that the board has been in operation it was necessary for a Minister to intervene. The reason for this satisfactory state of affairs is that men of the right calibre have been appointed to the board. In these circumstances I can see no reason why the present Minister should seek to interfere with an arrangement that had proved so Satisfactory. gentleman is admitting that even under the legislation that he administered the Sir Earle Paige. Minister had power to intervene if he thought fit. said that conditions existed in regard to this board and otlier boards of the kind which gave to Ministers a power of control similar to that which they exercised over their own departments. That power, however, is different from the power that the Minister is now seeking to obtain. tion that if the chairman alone should dissent from a decision of all the other intervene. That, to my mind, is a very unsatisfactory proposal. In fact, I would stupid. Such a provision would seriously limit the value of the board. It would be silly to incorporate such a provision in the act. Under such an arrangement the Ministei would, in effect, be sub1 servient to the chairman, for apparently he would not be able to intervene unless the chairman dissented from a decision man would become a kind of glorified potentate with a halo on his head, and the Minister might be no more than a pawn in the game. In my experience of the administration of hoards of this characboard members to straighten out their better under that arrangement than under any other. Incidentally, I hope that provision will be made for a representative of factory managers and secretaries to be appointed to the board. I always welcome constructive reforms and when an amending bill was before the Parliament in 1935 the Government with which I was connected accepted certain amendments because it believed that they would improve the measure. Whatever may be the predelictions of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in regard to this bill, I urge him to give careful consideration to the suggestions that I have made. There should be more direct representation of producers and those elected should serve for a term of five years instead of three. The personnel of this board has changed very little for many years.

Finally, I urge that the men who are elected to tlie board should be trusted to do the work that they are elected to do. It has been suggested that the Government will have a considerable amount of money at stake in connection with the operations of the boaird, but it will have very little compared with the amount which the persons actually engaged in dairying will have, and those persons are entitled, I submit, to have the final ,-ay in the disposal of their products. am distinctly disappointed with this bill ; for if it is enacted in its present form it will destroy the good work that has been done during the last 23 years. The Australian Dairy Produce Board was first constituted in October, 1924. and I cannot understand what reasons could have inspired the present Minister for Commerce aud Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) to propose an altered constitution for a body which has given such complete satisfaction to the industry over the years. has had the confidence of the industry has been shown by the re-election of the representatives at the succeedactivities and his year-to-year financial ing triennial elections. Mr T. P. Plunkett, M.L.A., of Queensland, who has been chairman of the board since its inception, has been re-elected time after time, as have other gentlemen whom I could name. Obviouslyj therefore, the board has given satisfaction. The Government is not involved in any substantial monetary obligations in regard to the board, which hitherto has been fully responsible to the industry itself. I emphasize that throughout its existence the board has enjoyed the fullest co-operation nothing to do with this bill. of the departments of agriculture of the various States, and of the industry itself. Speaker, that it will have a very serious In these circumstances it is extraordinary effect upon this industry and the country. that the Government should seek to restrict the board's usefulness, yet that is member may not proceed along those what it is proposing to do. The original lines, because that subject has nothing to board consisted of thirteen members. do with the matters referred to in this This Government subsequently increased bill. the number to seventeen, and it is now proposed to reduce the membership to twelve. Although the bill purports to reconstitute the board as a statutory authority so that it may advise and assist those engaged in the overseas marketing of dairy products, that contention, in view of the provisions of the bill, is nothing more or less than a smoke screen, and a very poor one. The bill does not give the producers control over their operations. In fact, the measure will have the reverse effect. The original measure gave the producers control of the export of their products, but that will be taken away if this bill becomes law in its present form, for the measure, in effect, removes power from the producers and centralizes all authority in the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. The measure strips the board of every vestige of authority over the operations of the dairying and cheese industries, and places control in the hands of the Minister, who will undoubtedly become a dictator. The chairman of the board, who will be the government nominee, will have the right to veto any decision of the board and the Minister will be able to negative any proposed action of the board and issue to it any direction that he pleases. The honourable That the board gentleman, therefore, will have control not only of the ultimate destiny of every producer, but also of his day-to-day returns. Lest any detail should escape his supervision, the Treasurer will also throw his net over the whole industry. As we all know, that right honourable gentleman is to-day exercising arbitrary control over the sale of all farms and pastoral properties and over capital issues.

One of the most important provisions of the b ill appears in paragraph b of the proposed new section 4, which seeks to enactThat the Board shall consist of(6) One member from each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania, to represent thc co-operative butter and cheese factories in those States. passed by 'the Government which the honourable gentleman supported, Tasmania, was disfranchised. Minister on that point. I object to the proposal of the bill to which I have referred on the ground that the dairy producers of Queensland and Viotoria provide roughly 90 per cent, of the dairy products we have available for export. That being so, how does the Minister imagine that equitable representation w ill be provided under the terms of the paragraph that T hare jiu»t quoted? man overlooks that under the legislation passed by a government that he supported there was only one representative of the producers of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. the export of dairy produce from Australia. Although Victoria and Queensland are responsible for the production of 90 per cent, of the total exports, their representation on the board which is to market the production overseas, is to be reduced. That is what I want the Minister to explain to this House and to the dairy-farmers of those States. No dairy-farmer in either of those States is satisfied with the bill, and certainly not with that provision in it . Under the original legislation, passed in 1924, the dairy-farmers elected their representatives to the board. Under sub-clause 4 of clause 4 of this extraordinary measureEach member appointed to represent the dairy farmers of Australia shall be a person nominated by the Minister from a panel of names submitted to him by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. Excellent results have been achieved under the original legislation. I am not able to recite all the good work that was done by the Australian D a i r y Produce Board that was constituted under that act, or the enormous advantage which it conferred on the producers because of the limited time at my disposal. The MinisSouth Australia, ter no longer has f a it h in the producers, who have proved during the last 23 years that they were capable of electing to the board men who would help the industry and work harmoniously together. He intends to demand that they shall submit to him a panel of names from which he will nominate their representatives on the board. I hope that they w ill follow the example of the Government by submitting only one name, as was done in conni'xion with the appointment of the G o ve rn o r-Genera 1. I object that the Government has not seen fit to provide for the appointment of a representative of the Australian Institute of Dairy Factory Managers and Secretaries. The men associated with that body have most to do with the manufacture of butter, and with making certain that what is produced w ill be of such a standard that it w ill command the best market prices.

Listening to that statement, one might be pardoned for assuming that hitherto the export of butter and cheese from Australia had not been regulated and controlled, but, the fact is that it has been so regulated and controlled by a board which has been functioning for the last twenty-odd years. Therefore, if that is the only purpose of the bill, there was no need for it, to be introduced. No one can claim that the operations of the hoard havo been unsuccessful. it appears that one purpose of the bill of numbers in this instance results in destroying the proper representation of for the amazing be the principal effect.

206,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [5.20].,"production of most of the butter and cheese exported. That is correct, but I do not regard that as any justification for denying representation to other States, partly because, as the board will continue to operate for a number of years, provision should be made for dealing with increased exports from the other State?, and also because production methods vary greatly fro m State to State. There is a wide difference in methods between Queensland, on the one hand, and Tasmania, on the other. In the same way, I have no doubt that there is a wide difference between methods of production in Victoria and Western Australia. It would be advisable, therefore, that ththoard should have on it a reprerepresentatives. In all States there are sentative from each State. A comparison of this bill with the proland, for instance, there is the Queensvisions under which the existing board land Dairymen's Organization, whioh is is elected show that the representation of well qualified to recommend competent dairy-farmers has been reduced by 50 representatives for appointment to theper cent., ancl the representation of coboard. This organization is constituted operatively owned and controlled butter under a State act, and is recognized as and cheese factories by 33-?, per cent., the mouth-piece of the dairy-farmers.. while the representation of privately conI t has branches all over the State, and trolled factories has not been reduced at any man recommended by it for appointall. proper representation of factories, I the good opinion of the dairy-farmers.

I will not recognize cept from what he hears of them, can be as an answer to my contentions the argujustified in taking upon himself the task ment that, the representatives of the coof choosing representatives. operatively owned factories are, in fact, representatives of tlie farmers. Undoubtedly, the representatives on the member of the board may be removed board will be drawn from the directors of from office upon a recommendation by theco-operative factories, but I have had board, and this is another blow at effecmuch experience in this matter, and I tive producer representation. If a repreknow that the directors of co-operative sentative refuses to accept the direction factories cannot always be relied upon to of the Minister, or of those whom the put the interests of the dairy-farmers Minister has appointed, he may be refirst. Inevitably, some point of difference moved from office by a majority vote of will arise between the farmers and the the members of the board.

For that reason, I am It was referred' to by the honourable memnot impressed by the fact that there are ber for Moreton and the righ t honorableto be six representatives of co-operative member for Cowper( S ir Earle Page), factories on the board. I do not admit but I cannot allow it to pass withou t that these six representatives, with the two direct representatives of the farmers, constitute eight farmers' representatives. I also object to the proposed method of appointing representatives. It has for long been a recognized principle that the representatives of primary producers should be appointed by the producers themselves. Long before I entered thiis Parliament I recognized that principle, but tlie present bill cuts right across it . Previously, the representatives on tbe board were appointed directly by the farmers, and I cannot see the slightest justification for altering that system. It is now proposed that the Ministei"" shall control the appointment of producers'' dairy-fariiiers' organizations which could very well perform this office. In QueensWhileI recognize the need for ment to a responsible position must hold of the dairy-farmers personal qualifications of nominees, exClause4 of the bill provides that any further comment. Paragraph b of clause 8 reads as follows:(5) By inserting, after sub-section ( 5 . ) , the following sub-section:"" (OA.) If the Chairman or other person presiding at any meeting of tlie Board dissents from any decision of the Board at that meeting and signifies at that meeting to the otlier members present in person his intention to bring his dissent to the notice of the Minister and, within twenty-four hours after the close of the meeting, transmits to the Minister notice of his dissent together with full particulars of the decision, the decision sliall have no effect unless the Minister approved of the decision (whether with or without variation), and, if the Minister approved of the decision subject to a variation, the varied decision as so approved shall be deemed to be the decision of the Board."" That provision reduces the board to impotence. Under it, the chairman, who will be the nominee of the Minister, and therefore, it may be assumed, the mouthpiece of his opinions, may, if he finds himself in disagreement with other members of the board, report his dissent to the Minister, and thereby have the opinion of all the other niemibers of the board disregarded. the chairman is to be given a right of veto. have railed against the exercise of such a riglit in other spheres, but here it is to be introduced into the control of an important primary industry. I regard this bill as a retrograde step, in common with other socialistic and dictatorial legislation which has recently been introduced into this Parliament. honorahle memher for Capricornia ( Mr the board to obtain advances from the ComDavidson) said that this was another example of socialistic legislation. That, of course, is the usual cry of members of the Opposition when any piece of legislation is brought down by the Government. The charge is not true, however, because the legislation for which this Government has been responsible has been of benefit to the country's industries, and particularly to tlie primary industries. The present bill representsan effective effort at co-operation between the primary producers and the Government. We know, of course, that honorahle members opposite are always anxious to escape their obligations to the people. They are content to let matters slide, and to leave the conduct of the country's economic affairs to the middlemen. This bill does not disfranchise the dairy-farmers, as honourable members opposite have claimed. The honorahle member for Capricornia stated that the representation of the dairy-farmers had been reduced from four to two, but that is not so. The fact is that the bill provides for the appointment of six representatives of the co-operative butter and cheese factories to the board. These representatives will be chosen from among directors of the companies, and those directors have in their turn been elected to their positions by the dairy-farmers themselves. The Minister( Mr Pollard), in his second-reading speech, painted out that the new board would he entirely different from the old Australian Dairy Produce Control Board, and he addedThe Commonwealth Government has entered into a long-term purchase arrangement with the Government of the United Kingdom covering the export of Australian butter a.nd cheese up to the 30th June, 1048, and an extension of this, arrangement has been sought to the 30th June, 1950. That has caused a complete change in thc methods covering thc export of butter and cheese from Australia, and in view of tlie period of the arrangement, it is essential that control of the industry be transferred from the war-time authority to a statutory board. The terms of the purchase arrangement with the United Kingdom Government make it necessary for the Commonwealth Government to empower thc board to carry out certain of the functions of the war-time authority, and to enable it , on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, to buy and sell butter and cheese intended for export. For this purpose provision is made in the bill for monwealth Bank. In providing that the chairman of the hoard shall be appointed by the Minister, the Government has acted wisely. .Since £15,000,000 is involved, it is necessary that the Goveniment, as the representative of the people, shall have the final say in tlie expenditure of their money. I do not think any fair-minded man, even within the dairying industry, would object to that provision. I do not think that the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) would allow his Scotch instincts to be so far forgotten",61,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading
207,Mr Archie Cameron,In other words,63,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading

The private bankers, about whose interests he and his colleagues express great concern, will uot lend money without collateral security. The Government equally must assure itself that its interests, which are the interests of the people, are secured in the expenditure of its funds. So it is logical that the Ministry, through the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, should decide who shall preside over the deliberations of the board. When the parties opposite were in power, they took care to ensure that the appropriate Minister should have the last say in the expenditure of public money by boards set up by them. As a matter of curiosity 1. referred to the Apple and Pear Organization Act 193S, which provides that the Australian Apple and Pear Board"" may make recommendations to the Minister in relation to the making of regulations for the purpose of regulating the export of apples and pears from Australia "". That measure was passed during' the Lyons regime. I stress the provision that the board a recommendation to the Minister. In effect, that means a recommendation to the Parliament. If anything goes wrong the Minister is held responsible by the people. That fundamental principle was observed in legislation dealing with the marketing of primary products passed by the Lyons Government The Labour Government has given to the primary producers control of their own industries. The argument that we have disfranchized them is utterly incorrect, i in plication the honourable member for also he obtained from the Australian tlie present Australian Dairy Produce sists of chemists, scientists, engineers and Board as irresponsible and not to be technical officers from every department trusted to handle money on behalf of agriculture in Australia.

The chairman nominated by somebody outside problems that the new board -vvill face are -important. That body will be marketing our butter overseas and it must be well balanced, efficient, trustworthy and, above all, free to exercise its judgment. I concede that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) must have a certain amount of control over the board. ZSTatu.ra.lly, he will need to consult its members; but his control should not be completely restrictive, because it is essential that the members of the board should feel free to exercise their own judgment in matters that concern the dairying industry. It is equally essential that their judgment should be heeded. The Minister claims that on the board there will be eight representatives of the dairy farmers and six representing the cooperative butter and cheese factories. That is true, but the representatives of the dairy-farmers will be chosen from a panel of names submitted to the Minister, and that deprives the dairy-farmers of the right to elect their own representatives, whereas they should be elected by them. The bill proposes to reduce the membership of the Australian Dairy Produce was entitled to make only Board from seventeen to twelve. I do not know whether the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture had the "" twelve apostles"" in mind when he chose that number. I suggest to him that he might well consider the addition of a thirteenth member. We live in a technical age .and rely more and more on technical men in industry. The thirteenth member of the hoard could be well chosen from the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.

Yet this bill is introduced for the board's smooth functioning that to give further expression to the principle its members should have an idea of who expressed in all measures dealing with their chairman is supposed to be. But the primary products passed in the last Minister proposes to take complete power twelve or eighteen months.

212,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [5.47],"The of the farmers. In fact, they have nodeciding how the board should be constituted. appointment-to the board of a representative of one of the unions to represent certain employees. I have no objection to that in principle, but If a i l to see why provision is made in the bill for the appointment of thai representative, while representation of the Australian Institute of Dairy Factory Managers and Secretaries provided for in the existing -legislation has been omitted. I see no logical reason for that omission; presiuuably there must be some reason for it , as otherwise it would not have been made. Tf one is appointed to the board surely the other should also be included. I come now to one of the most important parts of the proposal, namely, that relating to the selection, powers and responsibilities of the chairman of the board. On every board constituted by primary producers there has been an in sistence on the appointment of a producer as chairman. There is not the slightest indication that that is likely to happen in this instance. The second matter upon which primary producers insist is that the chairman should be elected by the memhers of the board. In the proposal -uow before us the chairman wil l not only not necessarily he a producer but he is also to be appointed at the whim of the Minister. The board will have no real powers of control. A t the discretion of its chairman, its decisions may be referred to the Miniater for his approval or amendment. The chairman, who w ill be the alter ego of the Minister, w ill no doubt receive f u l l instructions from the Minister as to what he should or should not do. Of his own volition, he may hold up the decisions of the board for subsequent amendment or veto by the Minister. How, in these circumstances, the board -can possibly be described as a producers' board I cannot understand. like the Minister to explain why this principle has been adopted by the Government, not only in the hill now before us, but also in other legislation designed to control primary producing industries. As I mentioned rather briefly earlier, the. Minister regards himself as a somewhat modified version of a dictator, whether of the type of H it l e r or GoebbelsI do not ltnow. The other relates to the himself as a little Caesar. many honourable members opposite who like power and sees that he is given it . If tliere were in office a Minister like his predecessor, now Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully), who has more democratic views than the present occupant of tlie office, I would not, object so strenuously to such a proposal which constitutes an abuse of democratic power. The administrative set-up of the proposed new board is very much what one would expect to find in a totalitarian country, ho it Russia, Germany or It a l y . I trust that before the bill is disposed of an explanation as to why this principle has been introduced will be forthcoming from the honourable gentleman. In order to apply myself to the bill before the House, which is described as an act to amend the Dairy Produce Export Control Act of 1924-1942, I first scanned the second-reading speech made by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) in introducing it . I did more than that; I studied the speech very closely and I propose to quote some of the honourable gentleman's words and to reply to them item by item as I proceed. In his second-reading speech the Minister saidThe purpose of this bill is to amend the Dairy Produce Export Control Act 1924-1942 to provide for the reconstitution of the Australian Dairy Produce Board as established under that net for the purpose of regulating and controlling the export of butter and cheese from the Commonwealth of Australia. I have before me a copy of the report of the Australian Dairy Produce Board for 1945-46, together with a statement by the then Minister for Commerce and I should Agriculture. Mr Scully, regarding the operation of the D a i r y Produce Export Control Act of 1924-1942.

The original act was amended in 1.935, and now the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) bill is to reconstitute the Australian Dairy Produce Board. This organization was created in 1924 under legislation proposes to reconstitute the board in the light of new world conditions. When I I do not think it is use the words ""to reconstitute the board in the light of new world conditions,"" it appears to me that there is some significance in the nature of the proposed reconstruction, because it is so much in line with the policy of the government to have every organization and individual under its direct control. As I proceed, I shall such as the dairymen's organization is, will -be reduced to a mere shell of its old democratic self, and will become a plastic instrument of the Minister of the day. Certain comparisons must be made. First, I shall examine how the present board is constituted. The original act, as amended by the act of 1935, which was introduced by the Country party section of the government of the day, provided for representatives of the producers to be elected on the following basis:-on e from New South Wales, one from Victoria, one from Queensland, and one by the combined votes of Western The report is a printed Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania. The bill provides for the appointment to the board of two members to represent the dairy farmers of Australia. How will the two individuals, who are supposed to be the freely chosen instruments of the dairymen, be appointed? The bill providesEach member appointed to represent the dairy-farmers of Australia shall be a person nominated by the Minister from a panel of names submitted to him by the Australian Dairy-farmers Federation. The result of the provision will be that, in future, dairy-farmers will not be able to exercise a free choice in the selection of their representatives. The Minister will call for a list of names. If he is not able to see on the list the names of persons who will be pliant to his will he will continue to call for lists until he sees the names for which he is searching. No other construction can be placed on this provision. Why are the producers not given the same right to elect their representatives to the board as any member of the Labour party would expect an industrial organization to he given iu similar circumstances? If the Australian Dairy Produce Board is to be a free organization, the only really democratic principle is that of the exercise of a free vote by the persons who will be represented on the body.",66,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading

226,Mr Anthony,"The purpose of thisThe original act of 1924 provided that the chairman should be appointed in the following manner:At the first meeting of the Board, which shall be held at a time and place notified in the he w ill not choose w ill be the six repreGazette by the Minister, tlie Board shall appoint one of its members to be the Chairman of the Board. That is the 'usual procedure in any organization of free men. When they meet they choose one of their number to be their chairman, and, henceforth, he is their elected head. What alteration does the bill propose? Isi t a democratic arrangement or something which has been adopted directly from the Politburo of Moscow? I shall describe to honourable members how the chairman w ill be appointed under the provisions of this bill, which has been thrown before the House. I use the word "" t h r o w n "" deliberately, because it is a disgrace to place this bill before a democratic assembly. Sub-section 9 of proposed new section 4 providesThe member appointed to represent the Commonwealth Government shall be Chairman of the Board and shall hold oflice for such period as the Governor General directs: Provided that the Governor General may, on the recommendation of the Minister, remove the Chairman from his office for incapacity, incompetence or misbehaviour. So, in the first place, the chairman w ill not be elected by his fellow members. He w ill be selected by the Minister. If , at any time, the Minister desires to say that he considers the chairman to be incompetent, he may change the chairman. By those words, the chairman w ill become the creature of the Minister. As I proceed I shall show that the Minister, under this bill, which advance publicity declared would establish a producers' board, w ill have the chairman completely in his grasp. The representatives of the producers will not be the representatives of the producers in the sense of freely elected representatives. They w ill be the nominees of the Minister, and w ill be selected from a panel of names which he will demand from the dairy-farmers' organizations. The Minister himself w ill select the producers' representatives. He will also select the representative of the employees, because the bill providesThe member appointed to represent employees of butter and cheese factories shall be a person nominated by the Minister after consulting, wherever practicable, with representatives of the appropriate union or unions. Thus the Minister w ill select the chairman, the producers' representatives, and the employees' representative on the board. The only representatives whom sentatives of butter factories. Now, one might be tempted, at first glance;, to assume that six of the eight producers' representatives are the representatives of the co-operative butter factories, thai they at least ean be said to be elected by the directors of those factories, and that they can form a majority of members of the board. Therefore, from the point of view of the producers, everything should be well. Before we leap to that conclusion, let us further examine the bill for the purpose of ascertaining how effective will be the majority of producers in determining the policy of the board. Justi n case the chairman of the board goes astray and the Minister cannot command a majority, clause 8 has been inserted. I have never known a more deadly and socialist piece of legislation presented to this Parliament. Clause8 of the b ill providesSection ten of the Principal Act is amended. (6) by inserting, after sub-section (5.), the following sub-section:"" ( 5 A ) . If the chairman or other person presiding at any meeting of the board dissents from any decision of the board at that meeting and signifies at that meeting to the other members present in person his intention to bring his dissent to the notice of the Minister He will carry the story to the Ministerand, within twenty-four hours after the close of the meeting, transmit to the Minister The chairman w ill be the Minister's office boy throughoutnotice of his dissent together w i th f u l l particulars of the decision, the decision shall have no effect unless the Minister approves of the decision (whether w it h or without variation) and, if the Minister approves of the decision subject to a variation, the varied decision as so approved shall be deemed to be the decision of the board. What more totalitarian provision could be inserted in any bill? Here we have allegedly eight producers' representatives, an employees' representative, and the Government's nominee. Many of them w ill be appointed directly by the Minister, hut in case a majority of the members of the hoard make a decision with which the chairman disagrees, the bill provides that the Minister may vary it, and the decision, in its altered form, shall be the decision of the board. That is totalitarian control. ""Where is the freedom of these men? Where is their right to decide anything of any material value when such a provision is included in the bill? It would be more fitting if such a provision were included in legislation which the dictator, Peron, presents to the Parliament of Argentina. It might even suit Dimitrov in Bulgaria, or the Communists in Roumania, or some of the Soviet republics, but this is the first time that such a provision has been inserted in a bill presented to any parliament in Australia. It is therefore a foretaste of things to come. The Minister, having tied up everything in that clause, made the chairman his creature, and arranged to veto any decisions of the board, has included another provision in order to make assurance doubly sure. The honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan) laughs. I am sure that he would resent the inclusion of such a provision in legislation relating to a trade union, as being an unwarranted interference with the personal rights and liberty of the organization to conduct its own affairs. Do not let us pretend that the board will he a producers' organization. That would be a. sham. The principal act of 1924 conferred on the board certaiu powers an-! responsibilities. Section 20 providedThe board sliall, with respect to any dairy Any decision of the board may be overproduce placed under its control, have full authority to make such arrangements, and to give sucb directions as it thinks fit for the following matters:Those matters included the handling, marketing, storage, shipment, sale ancl disposal of dairy produce. For a producers' organization, those powers were fair and reasonable. The board had ample scope to carry out its functions. The bill, however, provides that the board shall be subject to the direction of the 'Minister. I had some trouble in making that discovery, and only when. I read the act in conjunction with the amending legislation did I realize the Minister's intentions. In future the board shall, subject to any direction of the Minister, Ur. Anthony. have full authority to make arrangements for the handling and marketing of dairy produce. The Minister has given himself three lines of approach. First, he will have an approach through the creature whom he chooses to be chairman of the board. I have no doubt that the chairman will be an individual who has been "" hanging round "" the Minister for a long time. He will be an alleged producer, probably an officer of one of theorganizations who has never lifted his voice on any vital matter in the interests of the members of his organization. This individual, having kept his mouth shut when the welfare of his associates was involved, will no doubt be rewarded by the Minister for having kept quiet. I could piobably nnmu the individual for the Minister. Mr PO.LI.ARO -D o it now. good time. When we reach the committee stage of the bill we shall doubtless have a few interesting observations to make. honourable member is that he has a filthy mind. then take steps to ensure that the alleged producers' representatives who are appointed will not be really representatives of the producers, bnt individuals selected by himself. That will be the position also with regard to the alleged representative of the employees. The third protection the Minister has provided for himself is the power of veto. ruled by the chairman, but a dissent by the chairman must be notified to the Minister within 24 hours. The Minister no doubt will take every care to ensure that the person behind whom he intends to shelter has ready access to the back door of his office. He will he one of the honourable gentleman's own proteges who have been helpful to him and who will aet as a. kind of commissar to the dairying industry. I do not believe that any self-respecting board would submit to such treatment. The board's members would undoubtedly resign if they were placed in that position. I do not think that bona, fide producer representative* will be likely to accept positions on the",67,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading

228,Mr Pollard,The trouble with the,69,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading
229,Mr Anthony,"The Minister willboard in these circumstances. In any case the Minister has had. to face the possibility that the chairman whom he appoints may be "" talked over"" by his fellow board members, so the honourable .gentleman has thoughtfully provided for a ministerial power of veto. That power is vital to an individual with such totalitarian ideas as the Minister seems to harbour. It is in order to protect himself against the possibility of the chairman of the board "" ratting"" that this power of veto has been included in the bill. Such action might have been expected when we recall the kind of political company that the Minister keeps. In order to provide that he shall not be "" double crossed "" by the chairman, he is including a power of veto which will prevent the board from doing its work freely in the way that this work has heen done hitherto. I cannot too strongly emphasize my objection to the whole proposal. Quite recently the Minister was asked by an honourable gentleman on the Government side of tlie House to indicate the class of person who would be appointed as chairman of the proposed Australian Dairy Produce Board. It was, of course, an inspired question, and it gave the Minister an opportunity to say, in his most sanctimonious manner, that the appointee would be a producer representative, and, in fact, a producer. But of what use would a producer be on a board, the main function of which would be ultimately exercised by the Minister himself? was so limited, in its power would not be .able to discharge its duties effectively and patriotically. One of the main purposes -of this body should be to take all steps necessary to increase our exports of dairy produce to the United Kingdom in particular. That will he its main responsibility. Our exports of dairy produce declined seriously during the war years. They are now only about one-third in -quantity of the exports in 1939-40. Obviously, therefore, the board should be constituted in such a way as to enable it to do its utmost to l if t our exports to the In any case, the commodities to be handled figures of former years. Probably more than 90 per cent, of the dairy products that we export goes to the United Kingdom. Before the last war the United Kingdom imported 480,000 tons of butter per annum, the greater proportion of which came from Australia, New Zealand and the Scandinavian countries. In 1946 the United Kingdom imported only 190,000 tons of butter, or little more than one-third of the pre-war total. It is not surprising, therefore, that the people of Great Britain are sorely in need of dairy products, fats and the like. Therefore, the board that we are proposing to re-establish should be so constituted as to enable it to act with the utmost freedom in increasing our exports. Insofar as price is concerned, it would have wonderful opportunities. -Order! The bill does not deal with the price of butter. his second-reading speech, referred to prices. The honourable gentleman saidThe board will, during such period as the long-term purchase arrangement for the sale of Australia's exportable butter and cheese continues, handle annually Commonwealth Government finance to the amount of more than £15,000,000, and in these circumstances it is tlie view of the Government that it should have the riglit to appoint the chairman of the board. not introduce any question of the price of butter; but deals only with the financial responsibility of the Government. am entitled to show that the price of butter will be such as to involve considerA board which ably more tlian £15,000,000 per annum. otherwise. am entitled to answer the argument of the Minister in this connection, but I will confine my attention to the amount of £15,000,000 mentioned by the Minister. An amount of considerably more than £15,000,000 will be involved. The Minister's statement does not justify the appointment of a creature of his own choosing to be chairman of this board. will belong to the producers and not to the board, or to the Government, and not, one penny of Government money will actually be involved.

235,Mr Anthony,"I consider that 1products overseas in the next year or two will be such as should yield a great deal more than £15,000,000 a year to the Australian dairying industry. It is well known that world parity price of butter is more than 4s. per lb. In the United States of America the price of butter is 5s. per lb. and even in Denmarki t is 4s. per lb. £15,000,000 bas been based, according to my calculation, on a price of less than 2s. per lb. for butter. That shows clearly chat the purpose of this bill is to prevent Australian dairy-farmers from reaping the advantage of the present high export price of butter. This is also indicated unmistakably by a new provision which is to be inserted. Under clause 12 of this measure section 20 of the principle act is being amended to provide that subject to any direction of the Minister the board shall be responsible for (/) Tlie purchase and sale for the purpose of contains provisions -which constitute a export, on behalf of the Commonwealth, of dairy produce and the management and control of all m.'ittcrs connected with the handling, storage, protection, treatment, transfer and shipment of the dairy produce so purchased or sold by the Commonwealth. tn other words, any individual w ill products for home consumption on the one be prevented from exporting even 1 lb. of hand and for export on the other, he butter or any quantity of dairy proshould do it by means of subsidies, a duce whatsoever except through the course which the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) board. The board w ill be able, through has approved in other connexions. This the Minister, to prevent anything of that bill totally abrogates every principle of kind being done, although under the prindemocracy. cipal aet as it now stands private operators could export dairy produce if they desired to do so. The intention of this I realize that many other honourable legislation is, in fact, to vest such powers members of tlie House are better equipped in the Minister as w ill prevent dairyto participate in a debate on matters farmers from receiving f u l l world parity affecting primary production than I am, price for the products they export. It but this bill involves important principles will be possible if this bill becomes law which should be brought to the notice for certain organizations to bring pressure of the House, and in respect of which the to hear upon the Government to compel Government should be required to j u s t if y it to do whatever such organizations may itself. I have taken the trouble to redemand, and, in particular, to keep the read the second-reading speech of the domestic price of dairy products in AusMinisterf or Commerce and Agriculture tralia at a figure favorable to members ( Mr Pollard) on this bill, and I make of certain organizations. able gentleman wished to assist the people revealed political immorality in that the of Great Britain? purpose of this legislation, however, is to Government is adopting a technique that vest such powers in the Minister as w ill is very well known in these days, namely, enable h i m to prevent exports to the United Kingdomi n certain circumstances. The board w ill not be free to do as it desires. Under the existing law, private operators could export dairy produce if they wished to do so; but under this measure the chairman of the board, who as I have said will be a nominee of the The Minister's estimate of Government and have access to the M in ister's back door, w ill be able to prevent the board from acting freely. The Minister himself will have the power of veto. I am astonished that a Government of which the Ministerf o r External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) is a member, should include such a power in any legislation for which it is responsible, for we a l l know the attitude of the Ministerf o r External Affairs to the veto power. If this bill is agreed to in its present for m the dairy farmers w ill be ground down and be compelled to submit to the w ill of individuals with a certain political outlook.

237,Mr Anthony,,71,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading
238,Mr Spender (Warringah) [8.29],"that of presenting the facade of democracy in order to cover up totalitarian tendencies. I make those observations because I believe that my propositions can be established. Dealing with my first point: It must be recognized that it is the prime duty of a government, no inatter who may be the Minister who presents a bill to the House, to indicate the real changes that are being made in the law. that even a cursory examination of the bill w ill reveal that everything i m portant has been concealed. The best approach to this problem can be determined by looking at the Dairy Produce Export Control Act of 1924, with a view to studying the constitution of the board that was established under it , the manner in which it was elected, its which it has been changed by the bill that is now before the House. The act of 1924 left to the hoard established under it the right to determine who should be its chairman. That seems to me to be a very democratic thing to do. If one were choosing a board to control an industry in reality, then its internal functions should be just as much its own affair as the internal functions of this House are its affair. So we must start off with this incontrovertible fact, that a board representing varying interests, under the act of 1924, was allowed to determine who should be its chairman. Normally, the chairman of the board would be the man who occupies a position similar to that occupied by Mr Speakeri n this House, the one who would preside over its deliberations. The important provision to be considered in connection with the authority of that board is that which is contained in section 20 of the principal act. It is well that I should read the whole of that section, because only then will the point that I am making become clear. It providesThe board shall words of obligationwith respect to any dairy produce placed undeT its control, bave full authority to make such arrangements and to give such' directions as it thinks fit for the following matters:I stop there for a moment, before proceeding to the particularity of the subject matter of the authority conferred upon the board. It w ill be observed that, in the opening words, the most complete authority was given to the board to deal with the subject-matters which I shall enumerate shortly, in any way the board thought fit, and, in addition, placed upon the board the obligation so to do. The section went on to provide that the following matters should come within the board's complete and unfettered I venture to affirm authority:(a) The handling, marketing and storage of the dairy produce; (Zi) The shipment of the dairy produce on such terms and in such quantities as it thinks Jit; (c) The sale and disposal of dairy produce on such terms as it thinks f it ; (<Z) The insurance against loss of any such dairy produce either in the Commonwealth or in transit from the ""Commonwealth and until disposed of; and authorities, and the extent to (e; All such matters ns are necessary for the due discharge of its functions in handling, distributing and disposing of the dairy produce. I believe that every member of the House will agree with me that no more plenary authority could be vested in any board than was conferred by that act upon the board then constituted, in respect of the large volume of subject-matter committed to its care. That is the law as it exists; it has not been repealed. During the war, certain war regulations were introduced, the merit or demerit of which I do not propose to debate. I now proceed to the first point that I have sought to make, namely, that in a political, ancl not in any personal, sensebecause I find that some members of the Government are very sensitive in that respect-the Government has been dishonest, because it has sought to convey, by the second-reading speech of one of its Ministers, that its purpose was to reconstitute, under a democratic means of government and of organization, the Australian D a i r y Produce Board as it existed under the act of 1924, whereas a most cursory examination of the bill w ill show that nothing of the sort has resulted. The opening words of the second-reading speech, which are important, when not only the members of this House but also the people of Australia are being spoken to, are thoseThe purpose of the bill is to amend the Dairy Produce Export Control Act to provide for the reconstitution of the Australian Dairy Produce Board as established under the act, for the purpose of regulating and controlling the export of butter and cheese from the Commonwealth of Australia. I omit the second paragraph.. The Minister will correct me, I am sure, if I omit anything that is relevant. I do not want to read words which do not bear upon my argument. honourable gentleman when I reply to the debate on the second-reading. honourable gentleman will speak against me, but I am equally sure that he will not correct me. The third paragraph readsThe Government now proposes to reinstate the Australian Dairy Produce Board so that a statutory authority shall be available to advise and assist in dealing with the impartant industry problems likely to arise within the industry with the gradual rehabilitation of overseas markets. I omit the fourth paragraph. The fifth paragraph readsI t is the view of the Government that more effective administration would be achieved by a smaller body. It goes on to give reasons why the body proposed under this bill should be fewer in number than the body constituted under the act of 1924. I read now from the eighth paragraph, which saysI t is essential that control nf the "" industry Note those words, "" control of the industry "" be transferred from the war-time authority to a statutory board. We shall see to what extent, if at all, there is to be any transfer of real control to the statutory board. The speech then saysThe board will, during sin li period as tbe long-term purchase .""rvar.'jeii-.pnt for the sale of Australia's pxpnv':ible butter and cheese continues, handle annually Commonwealth Government finance to the amount of more than £15,000,000, and in tliese circumstances it is the view nf the Government that it should have the right to appoint the chairman of the board. That may be an argument so f a r as the right to appoint the chairman is concerned. It w ill be noted that there is not one word in the second-reading speech, of the Minister about the fact that the appointment of a chairman in the terms of the bill, w ill give complete power to the Minister to control this industry. Not only was that a serious omission; it was also not a correct presentation, in a second-reading speech, of the purposes and results of this legislation, and again I say that it was politically dishonest. I do not seek to use extravagant language. But I say to any honourable member, that if a b i ll is I shall correct the brought before this chamber, which either we on this side of the House or memebers on the GovernI am sure that the ment side are to understand, the prime function of the Government must be to reveal clearly the purpose and intent of the bill, and the effect of its operation. None of those things has been done in this instance. I direct myself to the first proposition that I made, namely, that the intent of the bill has been concealed. I have drawn attention to what the act of 1924 provided. It is quite clear that under that act the control of this industry was vested in a hoard. The Minister had no power whatever to override it , and no one member of the board had any power to override it . T say that it is not incorrect. 13 of the act of 1924.

The act from which the honorahle gentleman is reading is completely out of date. The honourable gentleman is only here on two days a week while the House is sitting. try to refute my argument, not abuse me. As I have pointed out, the powers of the board are contained in section 20 of the act of 1924. That section is subsequent to section 13 and deals w it h a specific field. Therefore, according to the cardinal rules of legal interpretation, its provisions override those of any preceding section which are inconsistent with them.

These members are, I understand, to be elected in a manand section 10 provides for the holding ner to be prescribed. The same applies to members who are to represent the proprietary butter and cheese factories. They, also, are to be chosen in a manner to be prescribed. Of course, we are not told what that manner shall be. honourable member to know that, in this respect, the hill reproduces exactly the provision of the 1924 act which he -praised so loudly? Parliament in 1924, and I resist as -strongly as I can any attempt to drag me back to the 1932 depression, or to associcase of an equality of votes shall also have a ate me with something that was done in 1924. I am concerned with what this bill provides. To ask us to agree to a proposal that the members of the board sliall be appointed in the manner prescribed is too fantastic for words. However, a most significant part of the bill is that which provides for the appointment of a member to represent -employees of butter and cheese factories. It is provided that the member appointed for this purpose shall be nominated by the Minister"" after consulting, wherever practicable, with representatives of the appropriate union or unions "". It is now generally recognized that, so far as this -Government is concerned, it is a matter of spoils to the victor. Thus, the person to represent the employees of the butter and cheese factories will be nominated by the Minister, and I am sure that he is not likely to hold political views different from those of the present Government. We now come to the member that is to represent the Australian Government, and he will hold the key to the situation. He is to be chairman of the board, and he shall hold office for such period as the Governor General directs. Let us see what he is to do, because he will be, in effect, the whole ""box and dice"". Our representatives overseas have had much to say about the exercise of the veto as opposed to democratic processes; yet, in almost every measure which the Government introduces to this chamber it makes provision for the exercise of the very power which it opposes outside Australia. Clause8 provides for the amendment of section 10 of the principal act, of meetings of the board. This is a somewhat strange place for the insertion of a vital amendment, the purpose of which is to emasculate the entire bill. Section 10 is as follows:1. Subject to this Act, meetings of the Board shall be held at such times and places within the Commonwealth as the Board from time to time determines. 2. The Chairman of the Board, or any three members thereof, may at any time call a special meeting of the Board. 3. A t all meetings of the Board six members shall form a quorum. 4. A t any meeting of the Board the Chairman shall have a deliberative vote, and in the casting vote. 5. All questions before the Board shall be decided by a majority of votes. 0. The board shall keep a record of its proceedings. This means that the chairman shall have an ordinary deliberative vote and also a casting vote when there is an equal division of opinion among memhers. Clause8 of the bill provides that section 10 of the principal act shall be amended by inserting after sub-section 5, the following sub-section:"" ( 5 A . ) If the Chairman or other person presiding at any meeting of the Board dissents from any decision of the board at that meeting and signifies at that meeting to the other members present in person, his intention to bring his dissent to the notice of the Minister and, within 24 hours after the close of the meeting, transmits to the Minister notice of his dissent together with f u l l particulars of the decision, the decision shall have no effect unless the Minister approves of the decision (whether with or without",74,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading

No matter what the other memhers may say, no decision of the board can become effective unless the Minister agrees. This is very similar to the operation of the veto at meetings of the Dnited Nations. Policy is to be determined through the exercise by the Minister of his power of veto. The Minister is to take to himself complete and arbitrary control of the industry. The hoard w ill be merely a sham and a delusion. I rose in my place to speak on this bill, not because, as I have conceded, I pretend to know anything about the dairying industry, but primarily because in its presentation of this bill the Government has departed from a fundamental obligation f a i r l y and correctly to present the real effect and purposes of any legislation brought before us, and, secondly, because the bill represents a further contribution to the d r if t away from democracy towards totalitarian and socialistic controls which I prefer to express as collectivism in this country when the individual counts for naught and the State counts for everything, these very enligtened days it is not so their own representatives on the board much a matter for wonder that the Gothey cannot be represented in such a vernment should propose to eliminate an manner as would reflect the importance of institution which has rendered good and the part they play in the industry.

Dairy Produce Board is to accomplish panel to be submitted to the Minister anything to advantage the industry it by should be free and unfettered to create disturbing downward trend in the volume of the goods it has to export. In 1939-40, the board which is to be eliminated as a result of the bill now before us had the privilege of exporting over 100,000 tons production of 203,686 tons. In 1947, the board will he able to export only a percentage of our total production of 138,000 tons. If that downward trend continues we shall not need a board to control exports at all because there will be nothing to export. The protests being made against this bill are not directed towards the proposed new board as such, but rather to the method by which it is to bo constituted. In common with many other honourable members. I have received letters from people expressing indignation at the bill and stating that unless the producers are given freedom to select and elect their own representatives they w ill not in fact be represented at all. I agree with that. They say, too, that if the chairman is not the elect of the board they are again not represented. I also agree with that view. The Minister is to be vested with power to veto majority decisions of the board. That is an absolute farce, as I shall attempt to show.

The dairymen must have nothing to do with the matter; after all, they are only primary producers. I draw attention to the distinction between the proposed method of selecting the two representatives of the producers and that to be used in the selection of other repreto appoint a person to act as chairman, sentatives. Clause4 provides that each member appointed to represent the cooperative butter and cheese factories of Australia, and each member appointed to represent proprietary butter and cheese factories, and privately owned butter and cheese factories, shall be a person elected in such manner as is prescribed. Elected by whom? Obviously the directors of the factories concerned are to have the right to select their own representatives; but the primary producers have to submit a panel of names, through the back door as it -were, from, which the Minister will select two persons whom he thinks will be more amenable to the crack of the whip of the dictatorial chairman who will be appointed by the Minister to preside over the board. It is of vital interest to the producers to know what will be the function of a trade union representative on a primary producers' board, which is to be established for no other purpose than to control the export of a product of dairyfarms. I again draw attention to the distinction between the election of a representative of the people who produce the commodities to be exported and that of a person who has nothing to do with them, namely, the union representative. and the cheese? union representative. This is to be an export control board which is interested solely in the export of farm products. The important point is that the member clause I have ever seen in any bill preappointed to represent the employees of sented to this House. Because of the butter and cheese factories shall be a perlimitation of scope of this debate, it is son nominated by the Minister after cononly natural that there must be sulting, as it was so subtly put, wherever some repetition of the speeches of practicable, with representatives of the honourable members. We cannot escape appropriate union or unions. Does the that. If we speak to the bill at all, Minister have the audacity to say that we must inevitably repeat what the unions will not tell him who the repreother honourable members have already sentative will be? He will have no right said. The terms of proposed new subto select the representative of the emsection 5A embodied in clause 8 have been The selection of the ployees; he will accept the man that the representatives, therefore union tells him to accept; but the producers of the goods have no rights whatever in the matter. Even after accepting full responsibility for the selection of the members of the board, if the Minister likes to so call it, the honorable gentleman immediately shows his distrust of it by reserving to himself the right and taking to himself the right to veto the majority decisions of the board"". The Minister knows very well that the primary producers' representatives appointed to an authority of this description are men of the highest repute and integrity, and with a sense of responsibility, and that they would not be likely to do or say anything which would embarrass the Treasury or the Minister without first consulting the government of the day. Notwithstanding the fact that he has the right to select them he does not trust them. He proposes to appoint a "" Pooh-bah "" to preside over them. That is the most offensive proposal that the Minister has ever heen associated with, and the honourable gentleman has been associated with some offensive things during his lifetime. Not only may a majority decision of the board, be vetoed by the Minister, on the recommendation of the chairman cr his deputy, but also the board will have to accept full responsibility for the Minister's decision. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) said -that any self respeeting board would J resign if such conditions were imposed. 1 go further, and say that no self-respecting man would accept appointment to such a board.

They are so obnoxious, however, that they cannot be repeated too often. My only regret is that the people cannot listen to them. The proposed new sub-section reads like something lifted from a bill designed to control dairying in Soviet Bussia. This is a mere pretence to establish an independent, democratically constituted organization, because every atom of power has been taken away from it. I repeat the words of proposed new sub-section DA because repetition may make them more understandable. The proposed new sub-section readsI f tlie Chairman or other person presiding at any meeting of the Board dissents from any decision of tlie Board at that meeting and signifies at t h a t meeting to the other members present in person his intention to bring bis dissent to the notice of the Minister Because the chairman does not agree with a decision, made possible by eleven of the members of the board, like a child, he will run away saying, "" I shall tell Mum "", or, in other words, the Ministerand, within twenty-four hours after the close of the meeting, transmits to the Minister notice of his dissent together with f u l l particulars of the decision, the decision shall have no effect unless the Minister approves of the decision (whether with or without variation) and, if thc Minister approves of the decision subject to a variation, thc varied decision as so approved shall be deemed to bo the decision of the Board. What body of men would accept responsibility for something to which the majority of them were diametrically opposed? Yet we are asked, in a still democratic Australia, to accept such a proposition. Australia is still democratic, hut I am afraid that democracy in this couutry is shaking at the moment.

But the Minister says, in that provision, "" All votes will be invalid unless I choose to agree with them"". Dictators do make decisions themselves. They do not hide behind the camouflage of a democratically-appointed body. The Minister should be satisfied to allow the board that he proposes to appoint under this legislation to make recommendations to him. Should the Treasury be involved, it would be quite correct for the Minister to have the final say. At least the board would have the satisfaction of presenting its case to him. He could then, if need be, ask for modification of the recommendation in this or that direction.

It would then remain for the Minister, or the Government, to decide whether to act on the proposal or to remit it to the board for modification in whatever way was desired. That would he perfectly acceptable to the public generally and to the primary producers in particular. The provision in the proposed new sub-section would perpetrate a complete farce. It asks the members of the board to meet, well knowing before they go into the meeting that their determinations will have no effect unless the chairman appointed by the Minister approves. They would be like little boys wondering whether they were doing the right thing. Why not tell them what is wanted? They would then do what they are told to do. Even that would he more satisfactory than the present proposal. If the Minister places a little more trust were created by legislation to control a in the men whom he will take the responsibility for appointing to the board, he will satisfy the dairy-farmers and still give them the feeling that democracy has a bare chance of survival in Australia. --We have drifted a long way in this debate, but the fundamental issue is that with the passing of war-time controls we desire to reconstitute the Australian Dairy Produce Board to control the export of dairy produce. I think honourable members opposite agree that there should be a hoard to control that export. We have not heard any opposition to that. The opposition that we have heard is to the board's being under the control of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. We desire stabilization of the dairying industry. Yesterday, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) moved the adjournment of the House to discuss the furthering of the interests of that industry, which is the very objective of this bill. It is surprising to hear honourable gentlemen opposite so vehement in their opposition to the Minister's wanting a certain amount of authority in the decisions of the board, because my exThey fought the issue of the rights of the perience of Liberal governments in South AustraliaI have not experienced a Libera] government as a memher of the House of Representatives-is that whatever committee or board iwas constituted, even a parliamentary committee, the Premier demanded the right to choose from a panel of names submitted to him by the Labour party the representatives of that party. That inatter was the subject of a constant battle between the Government party and the Opposition. Honourable members opposite have claimed that ministerial control of the proposed board would belittle it, but decisions reached by committees or boards set up to administer various phases of governmental activities are nearly always subject to the approval of the appropriate Minister before they can be put into force. I think that is generally accepted. I concede that honourable members opposite are genuinely interested in the welfare of all primary producers, including dairy-farmers; but they have to remember that if a board certain industry, and have the last word on everything done in that industry, its will would be imposed on the primary producers engaged in that industry. In comparatively recent years in South Australia, a board determined that producers could not sell their butter as they desired, but a number of producers objected to that power being used, and demanded the right to sell their butter as they desired. When control of eggs came into operation the same objections were raised. Objection has always been taken to boards with absolute powers. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) referred to the Australian Dairy Produce Board as having the power to direct the sale of butter overseas, and said that any person or group of persons that wanted to sell butter overseas could not do so without the consent of the board, but honourable memhers opposite should take their minds back to the time when the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, one of the first boards with absolute power, was established. People who processed the fruit for export claimed tbe right to export their produce however they desired, despite any decision made hy the board. individual through the High Court and the Privy Council. export dried fruits; they wanted to sell in Australia.",78,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading

Is this Parliament, in appointing a board representative of the primary producers, to say to them that it w ill throw all the responsibility on the board and that neither the Parliament nor the Minister w ill have any responsibility? Much has been made to-night about the rights of the people in a democracy, hut any parliament that surrendered the rights of the people to a section of the people would sell democracy. My views may not coincide w i th those of honourable gentlemen opposite on that matter, but it is definite that in. any legislation that the Parliament enacts, particularly legislation dealing with the control of the product of any section of the community, it is the duty of the Parliament to ensure that it shall, through responsible Ministers, retain control in the interests of the people.

I assume that the primary producers w ill evolve a method for the selection of a panel of names for presentation to the Minister; and from my knowledge of Ministers, I believe that if the panel contained the names of persons with suitable qualifications for the position, he would not dare to reject it out of hand, and ask for the submission of another panel. panel of names, he could ask for the submission of another panel. could do so.

A Liberal Government in South Australia decided to appoint a board to control the price of food. Por that board, a representative of the consumers was required.

The bill is not specific on that point. However, six of the twelve members of the board will represent the co-operative societies. Honourable members opposite will claim that the members of the co-operative societies of Victoria are persons engaged in the dairying industry. As two other members of the board will represent the producers, eight members will be drawn from men engaged in the industry. As a balancing factor, the Minister decided that he would have to consider the claims of proprietary and privately-owned butter and cheese factories, and allow them to select two representatives. That accounts for ten members of the board. Government supporters do not say that members of the union shall have a vote in the selection of their representative. If honourable members opposite assert that the Minister will appoint the man whom the unions recommend, I invite them to attend some of the big gatherings of union officials, where they will learn what union representatives sometimes say about men whom Labour Ministers appoint. They consider that they are not given a sufficient voice in these appointments. Therefore, I cannot accept the contention that the Minister will appoint the nominee of the union. In any event, only one member of the board will be the representative of the employees. The remaining member of the board will be appointed by the Minister. In my opinion, it is right and proper that the Minister should appoint his representative on the board. Ultimately, the board must be subject to control by the Parliament. control, not parliamentary control. elects Ministers. The honourable member might say that that statement is not quite correct, and I agree with him, because it is really the people who decide. This position is similar to the appointment of the two representatives of the producers on the board.

Ultimately, control rests with this statement that this bill is a drift towards Hitlerism. I cannot see that. I do not agree that a board of twelve members, one of whom is nominated by the Minister, one of whom represents the employees of the butter and cheese factories and the remaining ten of whom are elected by the producers or the butter factories, is a Hitler-like body. -board. it is a Joe Stalin board. member call it a Pollard board? be a "" cocky chaff hoard "". In any event, the board will represent the interests of the dairy-farmers. The arguments which the Opposition has adduced regarding the composition of the board are not fair and reasonable. If necessary, I could cite other boards which the Minster has appointed. The members of those bodies were not elected even to the same degree as members of the Australian Dairy Produce Board will be elected, yet those boards have done a great deal of good work, and the Minister, generally speaking, approves their actions and decisions. I have no fear that suitably qualified men will not be appointed to the Australian Dairy Produce Board. I do not accept that view. Suitably qualified men in the dairying industry, whether they be producers or from the co-operative societies, will, if elected, be prepared to serve on the board. If the board acts detrimentally to the best interests of the dairying industry, or the Minister intervenes to veto a reasonable decision of the board which is not injurious to primary producers, I is ministerial shall be prepared to consider an alternative suggestion for the composition of this body. Honourable members opposite advocate stabilization. Every dairy farmer supports it. We can have stabilization only be exercising a definite control over the exportable portionof the produce of the industry. In order to have that control, we must appoint a board.

We must realize that the statement which the Minister made recently that our butter for export ( Mr Sheehy) -Order! The bill does not deal with the export of butter. the bill proposes to reconstitute the Australian Dairy Produce Board, which has power to sell butter overseas. For the next five years, our exports of butter will be shipped to the United Kingdom. Therefore, the board will be closely concerned with the agreement or understanding which Australia has reached with the United Kingdom regarding these exports. However, that is not the real bone of contention. Our difference of opinion is created by the question of whether the Minister shall have the final decision, as the bill provides. In my opinion, the Minisber for Maranoa elected to the board of ter will give honest service, and the which he is a member? board will act in the best interests of the primary produrers. -The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) has made certain statements, including the assertion that we are membei appointed by the Minister? selling democracy if we take control away from tlie Parliament.

Then every individual concerned shall have the riglit to exercise a vote for the election of the representatives. The honourable member obviously did not stop to think. Every individual elector in Australia does not have a votein the election of the officers of a particular trade union. Only the members of the organization exercise the vote. Similarly, every person who is interested in a particular business might vote for the appointment of the directors. So it applies to co-operative associations, and so it will apply to the Australian Dairy Produce Board, if our principle of election is applied that those who produce the commodities should have the right to make the decision.

295,Mr Adermann,"I was nothis appointment by that method evoked disgust and protest from the wheat growers. The members of the commodity hoards in Queensland must be elected by the persons engaged in the industry concerned, and thc boards must accept the responsibility of their decisions. They Institute of Dairy Factory Managers and must also, in effect, act as bankers, for they carry financial as well as moral responsibility. The Australian Dairy Produce Board has done very fine work. Its chairman, Mr Plunkett, has been chairman since the inception of the board 24 years ago. His activities have been approved by all political parties. Mr Howie, Mr Gibson, and Mr Sheehy and others have also done fine work. I believe that the members of commodity boards would yield their self-respect by consenting to the kind of control that is now being proposed under this bill. They would expect the Minister to honour their decisions. been much antagonism to the proposal that the chairman of the Australian Dairy Produce Board should be authorized to dissent from decisions of the board and seek their reversal by the Minister. It may be that, on occasions, apart from the chairman, every member of the board, including the union representative and the representative of the co-operative associations, may favour a certain course, yet because the chairman may not be favorable, he may go "" squealing "" to the Minister and have the board's decision altered. A disgruntled ' chairman should not be given that power. The decisions of the bona fide representatives of the dairying industry who doubtless will be appointed to this board should be respected and I protest in the strongest way possible against the proposal that the chairman may register dissent on any matter and take it to the Minister. The honourable member for Hindmarsh apparently has not read the bill, for the measure distinctly states that a panel of names is to be submitted to the Minister by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. A reputable body of that description may be relied upon to submit only worthy names. If the method of election to this board is to he through the dairymen's and co-operative organizations as hitherto I shall be satisfied. The present Mr Adermami. method is democratic. The producers are entitled to elect their own representatives. There is, however, one notable omission, from my point of view, from the interests to be represented. No provision is made for a representative of the Australian Secretaries, and I appeal to the Minister to rectify this omission. I do not consider that, as an advocate of producer control, I am being inconsistent in proposing that a representative of the factory managers and secretaries should be appointed to the board. I put these individuals in the same class as shire clerks stand in relation to local government affairs. I remember the Premier of Queensland saying on one occasion that whilst shire councillors were responsible for policy, shire clerks had to carry out the law. That was, in my opinion, a common-sense view. There has Shire councillors must be guided as to the law by the experts who have studied the law. The members of the organization mentioned stand in the same relation to the dairying industry as shire clerks stand in relation to local government bodies. These men have practical knowledge of the month-byrnonth and year-by-year problems of the industry, and they are often able, through their experience, to resolve difficulties that arise from time to time. I therefore ask the Minister to review his previous decision in this regard, with the object of providing for one representative of these interests to be appointed to the board. I have no doubt that if the honourable gentleman would speak his mind he would agree with me that the representative of these interests who sat on the present board did excellent work. As the Minister is nodding his assent to my statement, I hope that he will accede to the requestthat I am making. If the chairman of this organization, who is appointed year by year by his associates, were chosen as their representative on the Australian Dairy Produce Board, that would be acceptable to me, and I am sure that it would be acceptable also to the industry in general. Finally, I wish to say a. few words concerning ibe proposal to place final power in respect of this board in the hands of the Minister. In my opinion, this procedure illustrates the vital difference between State control, or nationalization, and true producer or co-operative control, whicli I regard as being really democratic. State control or nationalization means political domination. I am quite sure that the Minister must be well aware that if the members of these commodity boards f a i l in their duty they are quickly brought to book by the interests they represent, and it is not necessary to await another election. Those engaged in the industry concerned react very quickly to unsatisfactory administration by commodity boards, and they quickly become critical if goods are sold at unfavorable prices or are otherwise unsatisfactorily handled. The dairymen should be permitted to control their own affairs. The commodity boards of Queensland have acted in an eminently satisfactory way to producers, and they include in their number only one government representative in each case. The government representative does not override the will of the majority, even though he may be aware of the views of his Minister and may desire to give effect to them. When a vote is taken it may be four to one or three to two, with the government representative in the minority, but the majority view is always accepted. That is a democratic attitude. I hope that the Government w ill reconsider its proposals in. this regard, with the object of ensuring truly democratic operation by the Australian Dairy Produce Board. bill indicates that the post-war marketing structure in industry is now taking shape. The passage from war-time to peace-time controls should be accomplished without great difficulty. I am pleased that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) is preserving the measure of producer representation of the Australian Dairy Produce Board. I approve of the .reduction of the total membership of the hoard from seventeen to twelve members, because I believe that the smaller board w ill be less unwieldy and more mobile than the present board. The important thing, as I have stressed on previous occasions, is that through direct representation, plus the representation of co-operative butter and cheese factories, there will be eight producer representatives on the new board of twelve, which must be a matter of satisfaction to those engaged in the industry. In addition, the Minister has indicated that the Government intends that the chairman of the board, who w ill he the Government representative, shall be a producer. The dairying industry is undoubtedly unique among our primary producing industries in that, through successful co-operative effort among producers, many individuals have received valuable training in marketing and on the technical and commercial sides of the industry. This, no doubt, has enabled the Minister to see his way clear to give what is virtually an undertaking that the chairman of the board, who, no doubt, w ill be its chief executive officer and the representative of the Government, will be a producer. To me, it will be an ideal appointment. It should give satisfaction, and make for efficiency in the board's administration. In effect, the Minister is now providing that 75 per cent, of the board shall be producers or their representatives. Before the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) entered this Parliament, he protested vigorously against the discrimination that was practised by the Menzies Government against producers in appointments to marketing boards. I hope that he w ill now go among the dairy-farmers in his electorate and say that the Lahour Government has a more kindly attitude towards producers than his present colleagues had when they were in office. Members of the Australian Country party cannot deny that the producers have been given majority representation on all -the boards that have been appointed by the Labour Government, and that there have never been grounds for the complaint that such representation has not been given. In order to divert attention from that fact, members of that party claim that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture w ill have residual power to veto decisions of the board. If they study the provisions of the Dairy Produce Export Control Act they w ill find that under it the Minister for Commerce and A g r i culture had substantially the same powers as are being vested in h i m under this bill. That cannot be denied. The Minister has stated that the Government will be liable for the £15,000,000 that will be",82,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading
296,Mr Fuller (Hume) [9.58],"Thisrequired by the Australian Dairy Produce Board to finance purchases from tlie farmers. The Minister will be directly responsible to this Parliament for the administration of that fund. That, to me, is as it should he. Members ef the Australian Country party, doubtless, will be the first in the Parliament to attack the Minister and. the Government on the administration of the act, as they have attacked them to-night. As usual, they will launch attacks whether the Government deserves censure or not. They want to hamper the Minister and restrict his power, yet they will require him to accept responsibility. That is. merely a tactical move. Actually, the members of both the Australian Country party ancl the Liberal party know quite well that no government, not even an anti-Labour government, has ever vested in any body complete and unrestricted power to expend public money or to contract publio liabilities. Legislation has always been provided for power to reside with the Crown. The propaganda of honourable members opposite in regard to this measure is so weak as to be an insult to the intelligence of dairy-farmers and factory managers. They know that the Minister will not exercise his power against the best interests of the dairy farmers, and that that has never heen his practice. There has heen much loose talk by the Opposition on the subject of dairy production in recent years. They have presented a false picture of Australia's efforts to supply overseas countries, including Britain. They have been mighty close, at times, to accusing the Government of the unfortunate droughts which have visited so many dairying districts in Australia during recent years. It could have been expected that when Queensland and New South Wales, which in dairying are our largest producers, were experiencing drought, honourable members would have recognized that production would fall. Obviously, members of the Australian Country party have not realized that patent fact. No doubt they are consumed by jealousy because this Government has given the dairy-farmers a better deal than they gave to them. Figures do not lie, although liars sometimes try to make them do so. The dairy-farmers are now receiver. Fuller. ing 2s. per lb for commercial butter, compared with from 9d. to Is. l d . per lb. during the regime of the Australian Country party. ( Mr Sheehy) -Order! The honourable member may not discuss prices. Minister has not heen forgotten by the dairy-farmers. The price which they are receiving to-day is a strong incentive to production. The Government, by means of this measure, is attempting to establish the marketing of our exportable surplus on a sound and stable basis. Because it will do what is intended, I wholeheartedly support it. -The bill before the House is of the very greatest importance lo the dairying industry of Australia, because it alters machinery dealing with the export of dairy products from this country, which has been in existence for many years. I draw attention to the definition clause of the bill, which amends section 3 of the principal act. It provides"" dairy produce"" means butter and cheese and includes such otlmr products derived from milk or thc constituent parts of milk (whether or not any otlier substance is added thereto) as are prescribed; Therefore, not only butter aud cheese, but also dried milk, milk products, and condensed milk are to be included in the dairy products that will have to be handled by the board when they are to be sent overseas. It is of the greatest importance that this Parliament should examine with the most meticulous care the provisions of this bill, because on it will depend the future of the dairying industry in Australia, as well as, very largely, whether the people of Britain are or are not to obtain from Australia the food covered by the bill. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) say that it is the responsibility and duty of this country to send, to Britain every particle of primary produce it can spare. Every one will agree with that. But when one studies Australia's contributions to the food needs of Britain, and",84,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading

299,Mr Abbott (New England) [10.6].,"compares tliem witb those of other countries, the first thing that strikes one is might be very 9trongly inclined towards the very great paucity of our contributions. I point out that we have contributed 30 per cent, of Britain's requirements of butter, compared with a contribution of 45 per cent, by New Zealand. That does not do credit to the Government of this country. In respect of cheese, the Australian contribution is utterly deplorable. New Zealand has sent 38 per cent, of Great Britain's requirements of cheese, whereas Australia has sent only a miserable S per cent. Australia has not sent any condensed rnilk to Britain. It9 contribution of milk town clerk means to the development of powder has been a paltry 3 per cent., compared with 40 per cent, hy the United States of America and 5 per cent, by New Zealand. These figures were published by the London Economist on the 31st May last, and they are a damning indictment of the exports of dairy products from this country to Great Britain the proposal of the honourable member for We have heard a good deal to-night about this bill, and the sort of control that it will inflict on the dairying industry in Australia. I strongly support the suggestion of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) that a representative of butter factory managers should be appointed to the board. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) has a fairly good knowledge of butter factories in New South Wales, and in his home town of Tamworth has been intimately connected with one. He knows that the manager of the butter factory is the key person in the production of butter in the district. I was very interested in the of the Minister. He may be removed at illustration of the honourable member for Maranoa. for the representation of co-operative butter factories will cover factory managers. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) said, either in his secondment to that clause. Sub-clause 11 of reading speech or by way of interjection, that the representatives of the co-operaboard, other than the chairman, may he tive butter factories will be elected by the boards of directors of the factories. Consequently, there is no certainty that a butter factory manager will te appointed. A further consideration is that the views of butter factory managers an outstanding manager, and the directors of the different butter factories might be equally strongly inclined towards one of their number, with the result that the best man in the industry might not obtain the appointment. The honourable member for Maranoa likened the position of the butter factory manager to that of a shire or town clerk. The Vice-President of the Executive Council will agree that the late town clerk of Tamworth was the most notable example we have ever known in the north of what a really fine a town. A first-clas9 butter factory manager, if placed on the board, could bring to its deliberations a knowledge, drive, and capacity which might materially benefit not only his own factory, but also the whole of the export industry. If the Minister will agree to Maranoa he will render a great service to the industry. Sub-clause 9 of clause 4 states(!).) The member appointed to represent the Commonwealth Government shall bo Chairman of the Board and shall hold office for sueh period as the Governor General directs: Provided that the Governor General may, on the recommendation of the Minister, remove the Chairman from his office for incapacity, incompetence or misbehaviour. (10.) Members of the Board, other than the Chairman, shall, subject to this section, hold office for a period of three years, ami sliall be eligible for re-appointmcn't. The effect of that is that the chairman of the board will hold office at the pleasure any time for incapacity, incompetence or misbehaviour, and the Minister himself is to be sole judge of the matter. Consequently, the chairman, appointed by the Minister, ancl having the power of veto in order to enforce the wishes of the Minister, will not be in a position to exercise independent judgment. I trust that the Minister will also consider an amendclause 4 provides that a member of the removed from office by the Governor General, on the recommendation of the board.

301,Mr Abbott,"It might not. Thea decision of tlie board to remove a member could be negatived by the Minister. ""We come now to clause 8 of the bill, the purpose of which is to amend section 10 of the principal act, which reads( I . ) Subject to this Act, meetings of the Board shall be held at such times and places within the Commonwealth as the Board from time to time determines. (2.) The Chairman of the Board, or auy three members thereof, may at any time call a special meeting of the Board. (3.) At all meetings of the Board six members shall form a quorum. (4.) A t any meeting of the Board the Chairman shall have <i. deliberative vote, and in the case of an equality of votes shall also have a casting vote. (5.) All questions before the Board shall be decided by a majority of votes. (G.) The Board shall keep a record of its proceedings. Rut clause 5 declares that the board shall decide by majority vote, all questions brought before it. Proposed new sub-section 5A, which is the amending sub-section, is as follows:( 5 A . ) If the Chairman or other person presiding at any meeting of the Board dissents from any decision of the Board at that meeting and signifies at that meeting to the other members present in person his intention to bring his dissent to the notice of tbe Minister and within twenty-four hours after the close of the meeting transmits to the Minister notice of his dissent, together with full particulars of the decision, the decision shall have no effect unless the Minister approves of the decision (whether witb or without variation! and, if the Minister approves of thc decision subject to a variation, the varied decision as so approved shall be deemed to be the decision of the Board. That is a perfect concept of the 'bureaucratic mind, the purpose of which is to make absolutely certain that all power shall be centralized in the Minister, and that the Minister, through the board, shall exercise remote control over the industry. It means, in actual f act, that the bureaucrats working in the background, the men who have been appointed in such numbers by this Government, are to be in a position to destroy the liberties of the people. They will dictate the policy of the board. The wretched chairman, who may be "" sacked"" at the whim of the Minister, will not be able to exercise his opinion. Minister will instruct the chairman ber should be more industrious, and read regarding the general policy which the bill. Mr Abbott. he is to apply, and will inform him of those things which he must do, and of other things which he must not do. Thus, the Government is erecting the facade of a dairy export control board, but actually there will be no such thing as a control board, because the members of the board will be mere marionettes worked by the strings which the Minister will pull. Clause8 should be removed from the bill. It is a very bad provision, because it gives unrestrained power to the Minister. The provision is an example of bureaucracy at its worse, and provides a foretaste of the totalitarian state in actual operation. The democratically elected Parliament is being side-stepped. There is no delegation of power by the Parliament, but only a system of ministerial control of the closest and strictest kind over the industry. We should not forget that the dairy-farmers produce the butter and cheese, and are the owners of their own product. Yet the Government proposes to control the industry on socialistic lines, and it will be a bad thing for the dairying industry if it is to be controlled with the same measure of incompetency as has marked other government undertakings in Australia. Under bad management of tlie kind which is almost certain to be experienced, the farmers, no matter how willing they may be, will be unable to maintain a high level of production. We know that under the control of the bureaucrats in Canberra, the great Australian egg industry is tottering to ruin. The producers are asked to operate under conditions which make it utterly impossible for them to maintain production. The Canadian Government negotiated an agreement with the Government of Great Britain for a price of 3s. Id. sterling a dozen for eggs at Ottawa, but our Government has sold the Australian egg.surplus for 2s. l d . a dozen. Another variation from the 1924 act is that the members of the new board, instead of being paid fees, are to be paid salaries, but the Minister has given no indication of what those salaries are to be.",86,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading
302,I Have No Doubt That The Mr Pollabd,"The honourable membegotten and misshapen piece of legislation. I hope that when it is in committee, the Minister will accept amendments designed to improve the bill, and to encourage production in the dairying industry. [10.26] -Thos e honourable members who have so far addressed themselves to the motion for the second reading of this bill have criticized the Government for abandoning principles for the control of the dairying industry which have operated for years. The chairman of the Australian Dairy Produce Board, Mr market. To-day prices on the home "" Tom"" Plunkett, aud the other members of the board, have been very successful in organizing the export of dairy products to Great Britain and elsewhere. iSome government supporters have claimed that the purpose of the Government is to place the dairying industry in a sound financial position. As a matter of fact, this bill does nothing to achieve that purPlunkett, M.L.A., has been of great pose. In any case, it is not true that, beassistance to the dairying industry and cause the Government provides the money, it should be given power to control the industry. There can be no greater fallacy than that. As a matter of fact, the money which will be used to pay the dairy-farmers a higher price for their products is being provided by the British consumers. After many protests by dairy men, and after recommendations were made by a committee of practical producers, the Government has decided to increase the price paid to the dairy farmers but, as I have said, the extra money is being found by the British consumers. We know that, in the trade union movement, all of those associated with an industry are not admitted to the control of the appropriate union, but only the actual members of the union. There would be a terrible outcry if a non-Labour government were to appoint its own chairman to the executive of a trade union, and give him power to veto tbe decision of the union on such matters as claims for higher pay and better conditions. If the chairman disagreed with the decision of the union and so reported to a non-Labour Minister who had the right to veto it and proclaim his policy as the policy of the union, we would have a very different state of affairs. Because the primary producers are not so closely associated with the great city interests, because they cannot voice their desires except through their representatives in this Parliament, the export of their product is to be subjected to political control. The export price represents the remuneration which the dairy-farmers receives for his labour. Under present circumstances the Minister may be able to secure higher prices for dairy products by demanding that Great Britain shall pay them. Under the conditions existing before World War II . the British market was cheaper than the home market are controlled, not by ability of the. people to meet them, but by a control which keeps prices down to a low level for economic reasons. Export butter is subsidized by the imposition of a higher price on butter consumed locally. The expert guidance of the Australian Dairy Produce Board presided over by Mr the people generally, and no good reason has been advanced why it should be abolished. We should continue to avail ourselves of the expert knowledge of the members of the board as it is at present constituted. In this bill, however, the Government proposes to replace the existing board by another body differently constituted and presided over by a chairman who will be probably the "" stooge."" of the Minister. The new chairman will undoubtedly carry out the Minister's instructions. The honourable gentleman, however, is not even content with that; he goes further and seeks to reserve to himself the right to veto majority decisions of the board, notwithstanding that those decisions may be made by practical dairy-farmers and others closely associated with the industry. The representatives of the producers will be elected to the board merely to act in an advisory capacity, and if their advice does not suit the Minister it will not be accepted. Por that reason I support the sincere and strong protest against this measure voiced by the honourable members on this side of the chamber.

Responsibility for these exports does not rest upon the Australian Dairy Produce Board, but -on the governments of the day. I hope that this great industry, -which at -one time was the second most important Australian industry, and which, prior to -the war, employed more people than any other industry in this country, will not be made a shuttlecock in party politics. The producers are entitled to an adequate return for their labours, and until they receive it production will continue to decline to the detriment, not only of the Australian market, but also of our overseas markets. I trust that the Government in its wisdom will agree to amend the bill in such a way as to safeguard this great industry from the dangers which may come from political control, or, alternatively withdraw the measure owing to the objections taken by Opposition memhers. for Commerce and Agriculture [10.35]in reply-A t the outset I wish to say that I deeply regret that a measure of this character sliould have been responsible for a debate in which an intemperate element has been introduced. With the exception of the honourable member for Calare( Mr iu the dairying industry to control the Howse), the honorahle member for honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Throughout the length and breadth of Adermann), honourable members opposite have confined their criticism of the measure largely to the allegation that it is designed to establish the Minister for Commerce and.Agriculture as a Hitler or a Mussolini. The whole tenor of the speeches of honourable members opposite indicates that they regard the bill as the very antithesis of democracy. I reply to criticism of that type-and I address myself in some measure to the honourable by saying that the bill is in its very essence in conformity with the democratic way of life of the people of Australia. Let us examine the express purposes for which it has been introduced. It is designed solely to establish a desirment as the direct purchaser from the able form of control over the exports of butter and dairy products from the Commonwealth. Very few honorahle members in this chamber know better than does the honourable member for Warringah that the framers of the Constitution in their day and generation wisely determined that control over the exports of the Commonwealth should be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament, and that that control should be exercised by Ministers responsible to the executive government and in due course to the Parliament. not say that at all. ber comes into this chamber on about one out of every four sitting, days; for the rest of the time he is engaged for filthy lucre in the courts in Sydney. no relation to the bill. ber, who .is supposed to represent the people who elected him, comes into this?

T affirm that this measure is designed to ensure the gathering together of thc representatives of all sections interested export of dairy products. Dairying is indeed a great Australian industry. Australia every man, woman or child is, directly or indirectly, vitally interested in its welfare. I go further and say that scarcely a man, woman or child in the United Kingdom is not vitally interested in the welfare of this industry. The interest of the people of thc United Kingdom lies mostly in the export section of the Australian industry. Most people know that since the termination of World War II . a vast change has come about in the method of trading in dairy products. Trading has shifted from a system involving the private purchaser in Great Britain and private seller in Australia to a system involving the United Kingdom GovernAustralian Government as the direct seller.

The honourable memher for Warringah, with his one day a week attendance in this Parliament, has the effrontery to come into the House and say that the proposal to vest in the Government of this country power to determine that our kith and kin in the United Kingdom shall be given a fair deal is undemocratic. majority decision decided to send too much butter to countries other than the Dnited Kingdom the chairman in his wisdom would notify the Minister, who is to be given power to veto such an unwise decision. What is wrong with that? the dairying industry. reflect on the honourable member; he does not count in the scheme of things. personalities. vocative interjections have caused me to digress in this way. The Australian Dairy Products Board was first established by a non-Labour government in 1924, which saw fit to vest in the then Minister for Commerce substantial power or, in the legal jargon of the honourable member for Warringah, total and complete power-to nullify at any tick of the clock the decisions of the board. Let me confirm that by quoting from sections of the act passed by the Bruce Page Government in 1924. We find in section 13A, which the honourable member for Warringah adroitly dodged, this provisionTho Board may(n) make recommendations to the Minister in relation to the making of regulations for the purpose of conpaid for hy the butter factories. With trolling tlie export, and thc sale the conditions operating under which ancl distribution after export, of Australian dairy produce: Having a legal mind, the honourable member knows quite well that if the board, in its wisdom, or otherwise, had made a recommendation to the Minister and the Minister had seen fit not to accept it there could not have been any export of dairy produce from Australia in any circumstances, and that the complete operations of the then board would have been, by that very factor, completely nullified. When one hears the "" tripe "" talked about Mussolini and Hitler by honourable members who argue not on logic but on nonsense, one can only express disgust. If the honourable member for Warringah wants another illustration of the ministerial control exercised under the act If the board by a passed by the Bruce-Page Government in 1924, when, in his more junior years, he would have been an ardent admirer of it, let me draw his attention to section 15 (1)Wliere the Governor General issues a proclamation in pursuance of the last preceding section, the Minister or any person thereto authorized in writing by the Minister may grant to any person desiring to export dairy produce from the Commonwealth n licence to do so. What does that mean but that a Minister of the day was an autocrat who exercised residual power under the act? The honourable member for Warringah also criticized the method of election of the board. I found the greatest difficulty, when having this measure drafted, in providing for equitable distribution of representation among the people who, in a large measure, are concerned in the industry. owners of the product much representation. provided in this measure becomes operative the producers will have been paid by the butter factories. They are in a very different situation from the producers of wheat, barley, meat and other commodities, whose products go straight from the farm to thc marketing or export control authority.

In regard to representation of operation of the scheme. No honourable memthe trade unions, I point out that the ber opposite would administer his farm on the same principle. The honourable member's words hold good to-dav with even more force in relation Mr Pollard. It is true that I reI consider that the Australian Dairy particularly desires to have on the board. elected, but there is no reason in the world members can substitute why the Australian D a i r y Farmers members and submit to the Minister of industry has within its ambit thousands of manual workers whose callings are covered hy a multitude of trade unions. To provide for the election of a representative of the trade unions through the multitude of trade unions involved would be utterly impracticable. The alternative is for the Minister to appoint a representative of the employees of butter and cheese factories after consultation with the appropriate unions. That is the only way to deal with that problem and I challenge the legal mind of the honourable member for Warringah to supply me with a. practicable alternative. The honourable member awoke to the fact that representatives of the co-operative factories are to be elected "" in suoh manner as is prescribed "". That means in a manner prescribed in regulations. What the honourable member did not awaken to is the fact that that is the system of electing one of the first times in our history, this the representatives of the butter factories laid down by his political associate, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), in the 1924 act. I was staggered when I found that the prescribed method of election of representatives of the co-operative factories under that act was apparently undemocratic. I will carefully examine that provision to determine whether the method should be allowed to continue. I found to my astonishment that the directors of the factories nominated, say, Jones, Brown and Smith as candidates and asked the suppliers and shareholders to vote for them. There is no right of free nomination for the shareholders and the suppliers. There may be an alternative method, but that was the method laid down by the Government of which the honourable member for Warringah was an ardent admirer. That method may require re-examination. directors. restricted to two or three candidates nominated by those directors. I am not sure whether the method is democratic. It tickles me to hear honourable memhers opposite warbling about democracy when they go to Victoria every week-end in an attempt to justify the attitude of the Legislative Council which is elected by one-third of the people of Victoria. ber for Richmond( Mr Anthony) talked about immoral attitudes, totalitarianism, socialism and everything else but matters appertaining to the bill. Only a person with an infantile mind could see in this measure anything remotely associated with a totalitarian, communistic or socialistic State. The honourable member went so far as to say that this measure was designed to prevent higher prices than export parity being paid to the producers of butter in Australia. The honourable gentleman will admit, if he is honest, that export parity on every pound of butter exported from Australia since this Government took office has been paid to the dairy-farmers. Further, he knows that at the time when the internal price level was lower than export parity, for Government provided subsidies in order to raise it to a payable level. From the time that the Government introduced its economic controls policy, this subsidy has cost Australian taxpayers £22,000,000. It makes one disgusted to hear the side issues which have heen introduced into the debate. I appreciate, however, the fair and reasonable criticism that has been directed at the bill by some honourable members. Some difficulty arises in making this measure all that every one would like it to be, but foremost in the mind of the Government has been the realization of the necessity to draw into council, as it were, on the export and other problems of the dairying industry, a representative gathering of personnel from the industry who know its conditions. In this way, we shall have a more effective method of dealing with the export problem tlian that which is vested by the Constitution in the Parliament, the Government and the Minister. Until a few years ago, export control was exercised by the Minister. After consultation with his departmental officers, he decided whether butter, cheese and other produce should be exported, and in what quantities, without detrimental effect to the Australian people. Now, a change has come over the scene. This Government may not claim the entire credit for it. As a matter of fact, previous governments took similar action, and now, rather than a Minister acting without advice of experts, he will consult with",90,Daisy Produce Export Controlbill 1947 Second Reading

That the House do now adjourn. weeks ago, I sent to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Courtice) a petition' from the butchers of the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, asking that they be given authority to charge the same prices for lamb and beef in the area as those charged in the metropolitan, Ballarat and Geelong areas. I under.. .. . . 38 stand that the present ruling is based npon .. .. . . 24 the idea that the Mornington Peninsula should be regarded as a country area; 14 in other words, it is supposed to be predominantly a country district, where butchers are able to purchase their supplies from local sources without having Lang, J.

326,Mr Ryan,"In normal circumstancesthat he ask the Prices Commissioner to investigate them. received from the Minister the following reply :The application was referred to the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, who advises that au investigation of the position reveals that ample stock is produced on the Mornington Peninsula to meet the requirements of the area supplied by the local butchers. This being so, it is considered that tliese butchers should be able to purchase stock in the district does, and the fact remains that the vast at a price no greater than tbe price realized in Melbourne less freight and handling charges from the farm or local sale yard to Melbourne. In view of this, the Commissioner is of the opinion that the margins available to the butcher under the level of retail prices fixed for the country areas of Victoria is ample for butchers in the Mornington district. 1 now propose to offer some comments on this reply. The Minister stated that there is ample stock for the Mornington Peninsula actually raised in the district itself. The fact is that most of the graziers in the peninsula deal with the Melbourne agents, and send all their stock to he killed at Newmarket. The market in the Mornington Peninsula is small, and only thirteen butchers, of whom five come from Frankston, operate there. The point to be noted here is that. Frankston is adjacent to the Mornington Peninsula, where the market is held-it is only 6 miles away-and five of the butchers who come fro m Frankston arc able to compete with thc Mornington Peninsula butchers on more favorable terms, since they receive approximately I d . per lb. more' for their retail sales of meat. As I said, the market in the Mornington Peninsula is small. It is held only twice a month. I have here a list of stock sold at the market on the 29th September last, and this list is typical. It is as follows:Ten fat steers, S f a t cows, 12 choppers, :*0 fat wethers, 30 fa t ewes, 100 f a t lambs, SO spring lambs, 25 store lambs, 30 head mixed cattle, and one Border collie dog. Incidentally, I do not think the Border collie dog was sold for food. The population of the Mornington Peninsula is approximately 20,000 persons. An y one who has any idea, of the quantity of meat that 20,000 persons consume knows perfectly well that a market of that size is completely inadequate to meet their requirements. The result is that these butchers, who have to supply the needs of the residents of the Mornington PeninI n due course, I sula, must buy their meat at Newmarket. direct from farmers in that area. and Housing( Mr Lemmon), I know, visits the Mornington Peninsula from time to time, but I believe that I know the conditions there much better than he majorit y or graziers in that area send their stock to Newmarket, and not to the local butchers. We all know that the Prices Commissioner has to perform a very responsible public duty. He is required to fix prices for a very wide range of commodities throughout the Commonwealth. What he decides vitally affects the livelihood of tbe whole of the people of this country. Business people are specially affected. An investigation was carried out on the Mornington Peninsula, but my inquiries revealed that it was of a most perfunctory nature. An inspector visited Mornington, where there are three butchers, but no inquiries were made elsewhere and no local grazier was questioned as to what happened to his stock. I ask the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) to direct that an additional investigation ibe made at a very early date. I am sure that inquiries will indicate that the situation is as I have described it . This matter affects not only the 20,000 permanent residents of the peninsula, but also many people who visit that area. able member that his representations will be considered. delay honourable members any further, but I hope that what is to be done will be done quickly, and that a proper and reasonable answer will be given.

I promised to ascertain and advise him what goods of United Kingdom origin are still subject to import licensing on importations into Australia and I now supply him with the desired information -September, 1931 to 1947, inclusive, has Since the 23rd January, 1947, the only goods of United Kingdom origin which have been subject to import licensing are relatively few in number and mainly of the less essential type. Tbey are as follows-ale , beer and spirits, manufactured tobacco, cigars and cigarettes, horses except for stud purposes only, dressed f u r skins and f u r apparel, t i nplate, electroplated ware, perfumed spirits and perfumery, fancy goods, diamonds and precious stones, jewellery and imitation jewellery, pearls ladies' handbags, work baskets, toilet cases, fancy boxes and the like, fireworks, smokers' requisites, antiques. Tinplate is included in the list because it is in world short supply and import licensing control ensures a projier distribution to Australian users of the limited quantities available for importation. control over imports of the goods enumerated is maintained in such a way as to permit a reasonable flow of trade in them in relation to the pre-war trade. RENT CONTROL. honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) asked if I was aware that the Prices Commissioner had heen approached in order to have room rentals affecting about 2S0 persons living in premises at Surry Hills, New South Wales, raised by 3s. and 2s. 6d. per week. I wish to inform the honourable member as follows:Over a month ago approval was given for an increase in the rates for lodging at the Salvation Army Men's Hostel, Albion-street, Sydney, by 3s. per week with respect to 52 window rooms and 2s. Cd. per week for 230 other rooms, the new rates being 15s. per week and 13s. (ld. per week respectively. This hostel is conducted by the Salvation Army as u home for working men and the majority of the residents are men in regular employment. The following is an extract from a letter received by me from the Territorial Commander of the Salvation Army in relation to this matter:"" In the first place 1 should like you to know that the hostel, although forming part of tbe Army's social service programme, is not a charitable institution in the sense that its object is to provide for tbe destitute or needy. It was, in fact, established some years ago for the purpose of providing accommodation for AID TOR BRITAIN . working men. The poor and needy are not encouraged to become inmates of tlie hostel, there being other institutions in the city and their needs. "" The home is not run for the purpose ot making a profit; all that is expected of it is that it should meet its own expenses and carry its own financial burden, and by way of illustration I would say that the total loss for the financial years ended on the 30th days of amounted to £1,129. 'It is considered that the cost of maintaining the home in the coming years will be greater than in the past, and, accordingly, application was made to the Prices Commissioner in Sydney for a review of the taritf rates which have been charged to inmates.

This policy was designed, not only to cut down overhead costs, but to ensure that the fullest nse would be made of war surpluses in the speedy rehabilitation of the national economy during the transition to normal production. In the case of motor vehicles this method of disposal has certain very definite advantages. In the first place it ensures that vehicles reach the ultimate purchaser in a road-worthy condition. Secondly, by making use of the specialized facilities already existing in the trade, the commission avoided the necessity of setting up a large and expensive organization for the handling, repair, distribution and sale of vehicles. Thirdly, this procedure has been u factor of considerable importance in the rehabilitation of the motor trade, and incidentally in providing permanent employment for a large number of ex-servicemen returning to it upon discharge from the forces. Finally, as the major companies have tlieir branches and dealers scattered throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, a wide distribution of vehicles has been effected by this method. With regard to the price aspect, the prices fixed in the processing of vehicles are approved hy the Prices Commissioner. A normal trade discount is allowed to the major companies eto cover handling and distribution, and an allowance is also made to cover repair and reconditioning costs. If repairs are not carried out to the full extent provided for, the benefit of the corresponding portion of the repair allowanco is passed on to the ultimate purchaser. A special section of the commission's COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY. finance organization carries out inspections to see. that this provision is faithfully carried out.

R. Sammy, of 15 York-street, Sydney. Subsequently, Mr Sammy, of whose nationality the Department of Trade and Customs has no evidence, left for Malaya and he appointed the Far Eastern Exchange Proprietary Limited his agents with authority to attend to the importation of the goods covered by the licence. Some of the goods had been shipped from the United States by about the middle of August and as Mr Sammy was absent from Australia he was unable to sign an application for a letter of credit. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth Bank suggested that the licence in favour of Mr Sammy be cancelled and a fresh licence issued in the name of the Far Eastern Exchange Proprietary Limited. This was done on the ISth August and exchange was made available for the goods in transit. A similar licence would have been issued at the time to any applicant who could have produced evidence of the availability of the goods in the United States for reasonably early shipment. covered by thc licence had already been included by the Rationing Commission iu its supply estimates of goods which could reasonably be expected to arrive in Australia by the 1st April, 1948, and which were necessary to maintain the current level of rationing. The licence has been returned to the Department of Trade and Customs for review in respect of the goods not yet shipped thereunder, in accordance with the Government's announcement of the 21st August that further restrictions were to be applied to the importation of goods from the dollar area because of the dollar exchange position. No further exchange will be made available under the licence unless and until it has been re-validated in respect of thc goods outstanding. (6) See answer to No. 1.

The Australian representative supported this and further stated that the question of an international convention, a draft of which was prepared by the Secretary-General on thc direction of the Economic and Social Council', on the crime of genocide should also he considered by the International Law Commission, if established.
