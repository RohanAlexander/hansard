I refer to certain reports alleging that several indigenes of West New Guinea who are now being trained at the medical school at Port Moresby, and who have been critical of Indonesian policies, are now apprehensive that they may be sent back to their homeland and may suffer ill treatment at the hands of the Indonesians. Can the honourable gentleman clarify the position of these young men and give some assurance that the dictates of humanity, should the issue arise, will not be ignored by the Australian Government? seven West New Guinea students at the medical school in Port Moresby. The courses of three are due to finish in 1965 and the courses of four are due to finish in 1966. Apparently, an Indonesian authority has asked that these students return to West New Guinea. I gather that a similar request has been made with respect to students who are in Holland. These West New Guinea students in Port Moresby have not been singled out in this respect. I believe that the important thing is that they be allowed to continue their studies, which were commenced originally on scholarships for which the Dutch administration was responsible and for which the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority in West New Guinea-commonl y known as Untea-ha s since been responsible. Accordingly, I thought that the right course was to see whether the Indonesian authorities would allow these students to complete their training, and I am at present engaged on inquiries for that purpose. Any other question can wait until the result of my endeavours with the Indonesian authorities is known. directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation. In view of the proposals by Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett-A.N.A. to introduce Boeing jet airliners on our internal air routes in the near future, will the Minister arrange to have the wartime igloos now serving as passenger terminal installations at Eagle Farm airport, Brisbane, demolished, and to have erected in their place modern air terminal buildings comparable with those in Sydney and Melbourne, and in keeping with the modem jet age and with the advancement and development of a city as beautiful as Brisbane and with such potential? Further, Sir, I ask whether the Minister is aware of the great assistance a modern air terminal installation at Eagle Farm would give to the tourist trade of Queensland generally. Finally, will the Minister have Eagle Farm airport gazetted as a principal entry or exit port for all overseas airliners entering or leaving AustraUa, thus simplifying air travel arrangements for overseas tourists visiting this country honourable member is making his question far too long and is now expressing opinions.

My question to the Minister is: Would this present him with the opportunity that he sought for the attainment of a complete industry voice, which is something that he urged in his second-reading speech on the Wool Industry Bill?

I cannot answer the question regarding the savings involved, because I have not seen member will keep his question within the any tenders and I cannot, therefore, make a comparison with present costs. for Primary Industry a question. By way of explanation I may state that the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization have, I believe, materially assisted potato-growers throughout Australia, and certainly on the northern tablelands of New South Wales, where great quantities of potatoes are produced. As considerable difficulties have been presented in the past by the undue importation of New Zealand potatoes, and their sale on Australian markets, can the Minister assure the House that he will urge upon the Minister for Trade the necessity to ensure that potato-growers, particularly in New South Wales, but also in other States, will be reasonably safeguarded, and that protection will be given to an industry which the scientific bodies I have referred to have helped to build up? able member that the Tariff Board determines the degree of protection of our industries. Any imports of potatoes in recent years would really not have been detrimental to the Australian producersI say this advisedly-because , after paying the protective duty, the price of imported potatoes would not be very low. However, I will have a look at the honourable member's question and refer it to the Department of Trade. I do not expect that imports of potatoes will cause any real trouble, because of the price at which New Zealand potatoes can be sold here in competition with locally produced potatoes.

Primary Industry whether it is a fact that as long as section 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution remains unaltered no State goverament and no Commonwealth government can prevent the manufacture of margarine within a State provided that, when manufactured, the margarine is transported to another State for sale.

The honourable member asks what I propose to do about the problem of margarine production.

The Labour Government of Queensland, which originally supported the referendum proposals, reversed its course half-wav throueh the campaign and voted against them. If Queensland had remained on side on that occas-on, the referendum would have been carried. tion to the Treasurer, I refer to the influence of the 30/20 rule which was written into the income tax law relating to the investment portfolios of life insurance offices and superannuation funds. I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that the new legislation has influenced a rise in interest rates of housing loans and company debentures. Because of the spectacular success of the recent Commonwealth loan raisings, is any relaxation of this 30/20 rule contemplated by the Government? the second part of the honourable gentleman's question first, let me say that the reasons which influenced the Government and the Parliament to support the legislation which is now in force have not altered since its introduction. Looking a long way into the future of Australian development, it was felt proper, having regard to the incentives given under the taxation legislation, by way of deductions in respect of premiums paid to people who invest their savings in this way for their future security, that a reasonable proportion of those savings should be channelled into the development of important public works of the Commonwealth and State governments. I think, Sir, that the legislation is admirably serving the purpose for which it was intended. I have no proposals to submit to the Government for amendment of the legislation. Whether this requirement has had the effect of increasing the rates of interest charged by the life offices in respect of other loans is, I gather, a matter that is debatable even within the ranks of life office managements. I have seen a statement to the effect that it did have this result. On the other hand, it has been pointed out by another spokesman for a life office that the present level of interest rates was determined prior to the legislation being introduced and that, in any event, a requirement for balanced investment would not necessarily be related strictly to the revenue returned by a particular type of investment. I feel that we have brought greater stability to the loan raising operations of the Commonwealth and in that way have contributed to a more stable financial order, from which the life offices will benefit.

65,Mr Barnard (Bass) [3.19],"The purPerhaps it might be said in fairness to this Government, and I suppose to all previous governments, that thc legislation under which ex-servicemen who served Australia in two great world wars and in other minor conflicts can apply to have disabilities which they believe to be due to war service accepted under the Repatriation Act has been so improved that it compares very favourably with corresponding legislation in most other countries. But, regardless of how adaptable the legislation may be and of the extent to which an ex-serviceman's disability is investigated by Repatriation Department doctors and other medical practitioners, there always will be cases in which the medical profession is unable to say with any degree of certainty that an ex-serviceman's disability is due to his war service. But neither can the medical practitioners or the departmental officials and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia claim that the ex-serviceman's condition is not due to his war service. For that reason, section 47 of the Repatriation Act was amended to provide that when a doubt exists, the benefit of the doubt must be given to the applicant. Whether the provisions of section 47 are always applied is a matter of debate. That aspect cannot be dealt with at this stage. However, Opposition members hold the view that the onusof-proof provisions of the section are not always applied. If they were, no application by an ex-serviceman for a cancerous condition to be accepted as a war-caused disability would be rejected. But such applications are rejected. I have no doubt that many honourable members on both sides of the House know that the benefit of the doubt is not given to ex-servicemen who claim that their cancer is a war-caused disability. Section 37 of the Repatriation Act was matter of circumstantial evidence based on amended to provide for the automatic known incidents and sequences that lead to acceptance of tuberculosis as a war-caused a disease the causes of which are provable. disability. No application for a pension In these circumstances, then, we believe that based on that ground is questioned by the the Repatriation Act should be amended to Repatriation Department. The departensure that the benefit of the doubt, in cases mental doctors are not concerned whether such as those to which I now refer, will an ex-serviceman's tuberculosis has been always be given to the ex-serviceman. caused by war service. They are conEvery member of this House, including the cerned merely that he is suffering from Minister, must be aware that there have tuberculosis. receives is determined on the basis of respect. For example, I may ask the Miniswhether the ex-serviceman can continue in ter whether he considers that the incidence employment or whether his condition is of mustard gas during World WarI . may such as to warrant full-time medical treatment. Why did this Parliament decide that an ex-serviceman suffering from tuberculosis should become entitled automatically to a pension? The Parliament so decided because of the peculiar nature of the disease and the difficulty experienced by medical practitioners in deciding accurately when the condition originated. Whether an application for a pension is lodged two years, twenty years or even longer after an ex-serviceman's discharge, if he is suffering from tuberculosis his condition is accepted as being due to his war service. Now let me deal with the disease which the Opposition asserts should be given similar recognition. Recently the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers submitted to the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Swartz) a request that an ex-serviceman suffering from cancer should be entitled automatically to benefits under the Repatriation Act. I do not suggest that this organization can be any more positive about these matters than the Opposition can be, but it can be said on the other hand that the organization does not normally make requests that have not been carefully considered and are not regarded as necessary to give common justice to the not inconsiderable numbers of ex-servicemen whom it represents. I am sure that it is not necessary for me to point out to this House that the cause of cancer still remains undiscovered. Many theories have been advanced, but, in the final analysis, the growth and development of a cancer to a stage at which a definite diagnosis is possible obviously cannot be a The pension which he been grave miscarriages of justice in this be a factor contributing to the development of lung cancer. Representations to this effect have been made to the Repatriation Commission in cases of lung cancer and the applications of the ex-servicemen concerned have finally been dismissed after the normal investigations have been made. I do not suggest that there has been a lack of proper investigation in that respect, because I know I am sure that most honourable members acknowledge this-that the repatriation authorities are noted for their persistence in these matters and, I hope, too, for their sympathetic investigation of all the evidence submitted to them by applicants. The real dimculty lies in the nature of the disease of cancer and the inability of repatriation officials to make, in these cases, a decision that is beyond all possible doubt correct. Therefore, this is a special situation relating to the onus-of-proof provisions in the act. This situation requires, in effect, spent in efforts to find the cause of cancer that the benefit of the doubt, if there is a doubt, always be given to the ex-serviceman. It requires, in effect, that special responsibility be accepted by the Repatriation Department to ensure that the onus-ofproof provisions are always applied. This situation that I have described means that if the facts available suggest a number of reasonable inferences, even though those inferences may not be as attractive to the authorities as are the inferences arrived at by the repatriation officials determining a case, the benefit of the doubt must be given in favour of the inferences suggested by the applicant in support of his claim. I submit, therefore, that, if it is not possible to say what are the causes of cancer, it is surely not Minister for Repatriation should be able proper to argue that war service, with all its strains and stresses and its unusual experiences and circumstances, may not have contributed to the onset of the disease. One of the great problems associated acceptance of cancer in an ex-serviceman with the investigation of cases in which as due to war service has been given the cancer is involved is the lack of departconsideration that it deserves, he must be mental statistics. No real attempt has been satisfied that in no instance has an applicamade by any Minister for Repatriation to tion to have cancer accepted as a war-caused provide the kind of information that would disability been rejected by the repatriation enable this Parliament to determine whether authorities except on the ground that there it is discharging in accordance with the has been absolute proof that the condition original intentions of the act its obligations was not either due to or aggravated by war to ex-servicemen who suffer from cancer. service. I do not believe that the Minister The Repatriation Department must readily can be as positive as that about this disease. accept that the number of cases submitted to Therefore, I suggest that the Government it since some statistics first became available is not inconsiderable and that more than 50 per cent, of the claims in this respect have been rejected. For example, up to 31st March, 1961, 4,135 applications to have cancer accepted as a war-caused disability had been lodged by ex-servicemen of the 1939-45 war, and only 2,030 of these applications, or fewer than 50 per cent., were successful. Furthermore, 1,577 applications to have the deaths from cancer of men who had served in the 1939-45 war accepted as due to war service had been made up to 31st March, 1961, but only 386. or fewer than 25 per cent., succeeded. On many occasions, Sir, I have listened in this Parliament to dogmatic assertions about the cause of cancer. They may or may not have been correct. But, overriding all these assertions is the known fact that many millions of pounds are now being and to perfect a cure. On previous occasions, it has been said also that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that the kind of conditions experienced on war service would be any more predisposing to cancer than are the conditions experienced by people who have never seen war service. I do not believe that to be a fair statement, and I am sure that it is not accepted by the great majority of people who appreciate and understand the significance of the appalling conditions experienced in the field by many former members of the armed forces. I say finally, Sir, that I believe that the to say quite emphatically whether he is satisfied that cases of the kind that I have described have been treated in the way in which they should have been treated.

On several occasions, the organization has made a submission to that effect. Indeed, I replied would be in full conflict with the general in detail to representations by the league on this subject last year. We should note, however, that the returned servicemen's league did not include the proposal in its pensions plan this year for special priority. In the past, the proposal has been submitted as a supplement to the pensions plan, and I assume that if the matter is re-submitted this year, that is how it will be raised. I think that that point should be clarified. the same page as the pensions plan. terms stated. this proposal is submitted as part of the vice.

The automatic acceptance of cancer as be far beyond the capacity of the present due to war service, for repatriation benefits, repatriation system to handle. However, has been the subject of debate in this House as I will indicate to honourable members, the on a number of occasions in recent years. present system covers cases of cancer which It is interesting to note that the members of are due to war service, and many thousands the Opposition, who are now so vocal on of cases have been accepted in the past. this subject, had the opportunity, when they were in office, to do something about it.

For example, there are 155 different A government must accept the responsibility varieties of malignant neoplasm that can for the administration of various acts, such occur in the human body, according to the as the Repatriation Act which, of course, international classification of diseases.

On the other hand the Opposition, generalize by the use of such an all-embracwithout such responsibility, can submit proing term. posals to the Parliament with the knowledge that it will not have to implement those proposals. It is a fact that the general policy of successive governments, since the inception of the Repatriation Act, has been to accept liability for pension and medical treatment for disabilities due to war service. There has been only one major exception to this principle throughout the years, 1936 did not conflict with this general policy. The automatic acceptance of cancer as due to war service, for repatriation benefits, policy and principles accepted by all governments in the past. In addition, an important repercussion would be pressure for the automatic acceptance of other disabilities as due to war service, some of which would have at least as strong a claim as that which could be urged in favour of cancer. Already representations have been made for the automatic acceptance of other disabilities, such as cardio-vascular diseases, mental illness, nervous conditions and several other disabilities would mean a complete change in the repatriation policy and system and of all disabilities on the same basis as those that this would mean a tremendous increase in Commonwealth liability coupled with, it would create a situation which it would The term "" cancer"", which has been malignant tumours.

71,Mr Swartz,"It is not included as part perhaps, a reduction in other services, andThe argument has also been advanced that because pulmonary tuberculosis has been accepted as a major exception to the general rule cancer should be classified in the same way. I will reply to this point in detail shortly, showing that the special circumstances which brought about the acceptance of pulmonary tuberculosis do not exist in the case of other disabilities. However, Mr Speaker, as cancer may be accepted as due to war service under certain conditions, I think it desirable to define, for the benefit of the House, the general conditions which apply for the acceptance of a disability as due to war service in World WarI . and World War II . , as well as later operations. In the case of World WarI ., an incapacity which may be accepted as due to war service is one which(1) in the case of a member of the forces who was enlisted for service outside Australia or was employed on a ship of war or was a member of the Army Medical Corps Nursing Service(a) results or has resulted from any occurrence that happened during his war service; (b) does not arise from intentionally self-inflicted injuries; and (c) does not arise from any occurrence that happened during the commission of any serious breach of discipline by that person. (2) in the case of a member of the forces enlisted for service in connection with naval or military preparations where the disability results or has resulted from his employment in connection with naval or military preparations of operations. In the case of a member who served in camp in Australia for six months, or who embarked for active service overseas, incapacity from a disability existing prior to enlistment is accepted as due to war service if contributed to in a material degree or aggravated by the conditions of war service, unless due to his serious default or covered by certain other conditions. Honourable members can see that these are far-reaching provisions, which apply to cancer .as to other disabilities. In the case of World War II . there are some variations of those provisions. An incapacity which may be accepted as due to war service in World War II . is one which(1) in the case of a member of the forces who served on active service has resulted from an occurrence that happened during the period from the date of his enlistment to the date of the termination of his service in respect of that enlistment; (2) in the case of any other member of the forces arose out of or is attributable to his war service; provided that the incapacity is not due to his serious default. (3) which is the result of an accident which happened to a member while travelling directly to or from his place of employment on war service or was in the opinion of the commission due to an accident that occurred, or to a disease or infection that was contracted, and that would not have occurred or been contracted but for his being on war service or but for changes in his environment consequent upon his being on war service. In the case of a member who served in a camp in Australia for at least six months, or was employed on active service, incapacity from a disability existing prior to service is accepted if contributed to in any or operations material degree or aggravated by his war service, unless due to his serious default. Again these are far-reaching and broad provisions for the acceptance of disabilities as due to war service. In the case of the Korea and Malaya operations, an incapacity which may be accepted rs one which(1) has resulted from an occurrence that happened during his war service; (2) is the result of action by the enemy The accepted treatments for this complaint or in combating the enemy; and is not due to his serious default. An incapacity which existed prior to enlistment may be accepted if contributed to in any material degree or aggravated by his war service. War service in respect of these operations in Korea and Malaya does not include service in Australia or service outside Australia except in those allotted areas for service in Korea and Malaya. Again it can be seen that there is a broad approach to the classification of disabilities for an entitled ex-serviceman who has sufas being due to war service. There is one exception, as I said at the outset, to the general rule covering repatriathere is no parallel between the present tion policy. This was mentioned by the honourable member for Bass. Under section 37 (3), where an ex-serviceman has served in a theatre of war and at any time after his discharge becomes incapacitated from pulmonary tuberculosis, or dies from pulmonary tuberculosis, war pension and medical treatment, as the case may be, are provided for him and his dependants as though the tuberculosis was due to war service. Tuberculosis is also included as one of the grounds of eligibility for a service pension. The original acceptance of pulmonary cancers and as to factors which have no tuberculosis goes right back into the early apparent effect in relation either to the history of the Australian repatriation cause or development of a cancer. It can system. There are special reasons why often be said in a particular case beyond tuberculosis was accepted as due to war reasonable doubt that the cancer arose service. At the time when the decision was from causes associated with post-war conmade to accept it much less was known ditions or was not aggravated or contributed than is known now concerning the course to by the conditions of war service.

In those types ment or after his death from tuberculosis. of cancer where a good deal is known of included rest, food and freedom from worry, and these could only be provided for the ex-serviceman by means of adequate pension and good facilities for treatment. At the time there was no civilian scheme of tuberculosis allowances or treatment comparable to that now available. However, in the light of modern medical knowledge and th. success of the Commonwealth antituberculosis campaign, it seems unlikely that either an automatic acceptance of tuberculosis or an automatic permanent pension fered from tuberculosis would have been justified if the question had arisen at this stage. It will be seen from these facts that repatriation policy covering pulmonary tuberculosis and the case for cancer. I have referred to the first two grounds that the honourable member for Bass raised to-day and has raised in the past. I now wish to deal with the third and main basis of the Opposition's case, and that is the argument relating to the unknown causes of cancer and the relationship to the benefit of the doubt and the onus-of-proof provisions. Whilst generally it may be said that the cause of cancer is not known, a good deal is known both as to the cause of some The argument for the automatic accepthigher than in similar age groups in the community generally. Among ex-servicethe course of development of the cancer, there is no evidence that the life history of the cancer is any different in the case of ex-servicemen than in the case of civilians. Automatic acceptance would cover all ex-servicemen, some of whom had service living at home or at base camps under conditions which were little or no different from those of their civilian life, and which often were more conducive to general good health. Minister entitled to read a carefully prepared speech in reply to the case already made? Surely he has a responsibility to answer the points that have been made. -Order! There is no substance in the point of order. tion does not like the points I am making. I prepared my speech before lunch, and I will let the honourable member have a copy of it afterwards so that he may read it careLiberal member of the last Parliament fully. It contains some interesting information. It is possible for a determining authority in a particular case to say beyond reasonable doubt whether a cancer can have any relation to the ex-serviceman's war service. That is a case where the medical and other evidence establishes the known factors which could have caused it, when the cancer first caused disablement and how long it may have been present before causing disablement. When the determining authority is left in any doubt, the claim or appeal must be, and in fact is, resolved in favour of the ex-serviceman or his dependants. In fact, many claims are allowed solely because the onus thrown on the commission to resist the claim has not been discharged or because there is some possibility that a wound or war injury has been a contributing factor to the subsequent development of a cancer. Statistics which are now available-som e of the figures have already been givenshow that of approximately 4,500 claims submitted by persons who served in the 1939-45 war, 2,106 have been accepted. Minister's time has expired. dreary recital by the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Swartz), who read from a prepared statement, will not create much enthusiasm amongst Opposition members, and more significantly, it will not give much solace to the widows and children of deceased ex-servicemen. These people have been hoping for a change of heart by the Government, following the plea so ably made by my colleague, the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard). I admire the honourable member's persistence. He has raised this issue on a number of occasions and, with others, has been able to impress the Australian Labour Party with the justice of the claim. The Minister, dogmatically and without any evidence, said that the incidence of cancer amongst ex-servicemen is no greater than the incidence of cancer amongst civilians of a comparable age. The Minister did not give any statistics, let alone an analysis of statistics, in support of his claim. However, a former Queensland quoted statistics from an authoritative American journal to show that the incidence of cancer amongst American ex-servicemen was twice as great as the incidence amongst a comparable age group of civilians. This matter has been raised because of our sympathy for the unfortunate ex-servicemen who contract this wretched disease and for their wives and dependants. We believe that the Parliament, as a longoverdue act of humanity, should provide that cancer will be automatically accepted as a war-caused condition. Nearly every ex-servicemen's organization has asked that the condition be accepted in this way. As a matter of fact, the organizations go further and ask the Government not only to accept cancer but also to accept heart disease, mental illness and other chronic illnesses. I believe that the organizations have a strong case. However, at the moment, We have not sufficient confidence in the Government to ask it to accept all these disabilities as war caused. We hope that we may, at this time, be able to extend the area of automatic acceptance beyond pulmonary tuberculosis to include cancer. As I say, the humanitarian aspect of the case demands that we accept cancer as",22,Repatriation

We are convinced that the unfortunate sufferers from this disease are not given the protection that section 47 of the Repatriation Act intended that they should have. We believe that the present interpretation of the section does not give justice to the ex-servicemen and does not extend to them the full benefits of the onus-of-proof provision. The benefit of the doubt is not given to the ex-servicemen. We are not prepared to accept that any authority can say with reasonable certainty-quit e apart from absolute certainty -wha t caused a cancer in any one individual. Who can say with any certainty that the conditions of service during the First World War-thos e who sit in judgment may not have experienced these conditions-di d not cause or aggravate a cancer? But our tribunals pretend that they can say with absolute confidence, or at least with reasonable certainty, that 50 per cent, or more of cancer cases did not result from war service or were not aggravated by war service. This attitude cannot be accepted by the have good and valid criticisms to make community. The community wants at least about the way this part of the act is being the normal repatriation benefits to be exadministered. For instance, there is no tended automatically to ex-servicemen who possibility of cross-examining the medical suffer from cancer. The cost of doing so witnesses appearing for the Crown. More would not be great. The community has often than not they are unsighted. They given no evidence that it would begrudge give their testimony to the repatriation this being done. If ex-servicemen sufferboard, commission or tribunals and they ing from cancer are not given repatriation are never confronted by medical authorities benefits, they will still receive care, perhaps giving the opposite point of view on behalf to a lesser extent, from the Department of of the applicant. Social Services, the Department of Health and even the Repatriation Department. I am affected, as I am sure other honourable the Australian Labour Party has advocated members would be affected, by the specso constantly and which exists in England. tacle of a woman looking after her husThis benefit means so much to these men band for eighteen months or two years, and later, unfortunately, more often than knowing that his death is certain. not to their widows and dependent children.

I felt sure that reasons are not given in repatriation cases. it would arouse the sympathy of members of the Government, but it has done no such thing. It is often said that the onus-of-proof that they received no encouragement and provision, section 47 of the Repatriation very little assistance in elucidating their Act, will look after people in this condition. The New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia told me as recently as yesterday that it carried out a survey in 1962 and found that 99 per cent, of World WarI . applicants for acceptance of cancer as a war-caused disability claimed that they had been exposed to gas and that their respiratory systems had been affected. Yet, as we have noted, half of them, and sometimes more, have had their applications rejected. They have served in gas areas; yet the authorities are able to say with absolute confidence that those people are not entitled to a pension and that the cancer was not in fact caused by their war service. The onus-of-proof provision says that if there is any reasonable doubt whatsoever that war service could not have caused the cancer, or for that matter any other disability, the benefit of the doubt must be given to the applicant. We believe that it is not being given to the applicant. We There is no judicial right of appeal, which I have received numerous complaints from people who have gone before repatriation tribunals. Their complaint often is cases fully and giving all the facts as they know them. The tribunals are so overcrowded with work that more often than not there is a delay of six months or more in getting cases heard by them. Because of ordinary human reactions to pressure, the tribunals have to get the cases through as quickly as they can. I am sure, very sure, that justice does not always come the way of those who are most in need of it. Sometimes we are not even sure that the detailed submissions that have been put forward by members of the Parliament have received all the inquiry and consideration that they ought to receive. Members give up their time to examine cases as thoroughly as they can, to ascertain as much of the history as they can and then to submit tbe material; but I am afraid that sometimes those submissions are not carefully studied. I believe that the time is long overdue when we should make at least one further step towards giving justice to people who were prepared to give their all for the welfare and survival of this country. Those people ought to be the first ones to receive the next instalment of benefits. my remarks by saying that I believe I am qualified to speak on this subject and any other subject concerning ex-servicemen because for 35 years I have held office in the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia and worked actively for ex-servicemen. During that time. I had the privilege and the honour of meeting the one-time Minister for Repatriation, the father of the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard), for whom we had a very great respect. I am certain that he would have been the last to approve of the welfare of ex-servicemen being made a political football. That has been done before. This is not the first time that it has been done. We might expect it from the honourable member for Barton( Mr could be war-caused and submits evidence Reynolds), but from the honourable member for Bass, who has a tradition to live up to, we expect something better. The two honourable members attempted to show that cancer should be accepted automatically as a war-caused disability; that section 47 of the Repatriation Act is not being carried out; and that the onus-ofproof and benefit-of-the-doubt provisions are not operating as they are intended to operate. I shall tell the House what used to happen when I was secretary of a subbranch of the RSL. before section 47 was introduced into the act. At that time it was necessary for an ex-serviceman to prove that his disability was war-caused. as secretary of an RSL. sub-branch, I had the task of writing all over the world and chasing up officers and other leaders of units in order to obtain from them sworn affidavits that a soldier who had applied for a pension was at a particular place at a particular time and therefore could have sustained an injury which could be accepted as war-caused. That is the proof that they had to give. that the applicant had war service was not the only thing he had to prove. I come now to the benefit-of-the-doubt provision. I suppose honourable members know what happens in an ordinary court of law. Evidence is given for and against a person and two lawyers fight out the case. The way British justice is supposed to operate is that where conflicting evidence is submitted and there is a doubt in the mind of the judge, he must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused person. The same principle applies in connection with repatriation. This point needs to be emphasized because repeated statements by our Labour friends are misleading many ex-service people: The act does not say that where there is a conflict of opinion the repatriation benefit shall be given automatically to the ex-serviceman. The act says that where conflicting evidence is given-for instance, if one medical man says that the cancer of that, and another medical man gives evidence to support his opinion that the cancer need not necessarily be war-caused -and after hearing the evidence there is a doubt in tbe mind of the tribunal, the applicant must be given the benefit of that doubt. Let me correct the honourable member for Barton. An ex-serviceman is entitled to be represented at the hearing.",25,Repatriation

But whenever the tribunal is satisfied that the disability is not war caused or could not be war caused, it is bound to exercise its judgment in accordance with its firm conviction. it has a firm conviction? able member appear before an appeal tribunal as a representative of ex-servicemen. bers of the tribunals will not talk to you. ask the honourable member for Moore to resume his seat for a moment.

I suggest that if the honourable member could boast of as good a period of service as I can, he would be proud. That is the position with regard to the onus of proof and benefit of the doubt. If is unfortunate that this question of the benefit of the doubt is being hammered politically because it is creating in the minds of a tremendous number of ex-servicemen the false impression that they have only to get two doctors to differ in their opinions and the Repatriation Commission must automatically give them the benefit of the doubt. That is not provided in the act and it was never intended that this should be so. The benefit of the doubt must be given to the appellant only in-those cases where there is a doubt in the mind of the tribunal, not in cases where there is a conflict of opinion between two medical men. I deplore this constant reiteration of the suggestion that the benefit of the doubt provision is not being administered correctly. False arguments that are put forward in this matter are doing serious hurt to many ex-servicemen and to their dependants. They are creating a state of mental anxiety amongst a great number of these people. are on the tribunal?

94,Mr Leslie,"There are no medical menmatter of great concern to ex-servicemen. They want to make certain that adequate facilities will always be available, not to everybody, but to those who have a genuine war-caused disability. Let me say in conclusion that the World Veterans Federation, a federation of 157 ex-servicemen's organizations spread throughout 46 nations in the world, which is fighting at all times to improve the benefits available to ex-servicemen from the governments of various countries, has not yet suggested in any country that cancer should be accepted as a war-caused disability or that it should be automatically accepted as resulting from war service. long while since an important debate such as this on a matter that affects the hearts, homes and health of hundreds of thousands of Australian people has been reduced to the low level to which it has just been reduced by the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie). It is nonsense to suggest that we are making a political football of repatriation policy. I remind the honourable member that the various sub-branches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia discuss it at times. For instance, in its annual report for 1961, the RSL. had this to sayThe League has been pressing for a number of years now for the automatic acceptance of cancer Repatriation repeatedly saying in answers as a war caused or contributed illness. While this has not been included in the Pensions Plan for 1962, it has been made the subject of a special approach to the Minister. The honourable member for Moore can claim as lengthy a service to the ex-servicemen as he likes. He claimed 35 years of such service. Then he used all the arguments in the book in an effort to prevent ex-servicemen sufferers from tuberculosis from obtaining the benefit of the extension of the principle of ordinary justice that was established here twenty years ago. That action reflects very little credit on the service he has given. I take a dim view of his remark concerning the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard). It was a low remark of the type that one does not ordinarily expect from people with the background of the honourable member for Moore. So far as I am concerned, the intrusion of the honourable member into this debate has done nothing at all for the ex-servicemen, nor has it done anything to improve the status of parliamentary debate. The Opposition's case in this instance rests upon four points. The first is the spirit in which the onus-of-proof provision should be interpreted, the principle of which was laid down by a committee of this Parliament some twenty years ago which sat under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). The second point is the unknown factors relating to cancer. The third is the world-wide campaign against cancer, and I should say the fourth is that the social service system of this country in particular, which is situated in a position where it is fairly free from most of the troubles of the world, should be continually extended. Especially do we say that the repatriation benefits available to the ex-servicemen of this country should be extended in accordance with the spirit which the people of Australia have come to expect to be exhibited in matters of this kind. I do not know for how long this Government proposes to inflict upon our ex-servicemen Ministers who are simply apologists for tradition. I do not say they are apologists for bureaucracy or anything like that, because, after all, they can administer the laws only in accordance with the spirit determined by Parliament. Here we have seen the last three or four Ministers for to questions that the department supports the Repatriation Commission and general administration of the department. We say that the provisions of the repatriation legislation should be administered by the Minister in charge of the department, not a public relations officer of the department. We want to see the present Minister administer the repatriation law in accordance with the sentiments that he expressed when he was sitting on the back benches behind the Government. Let us consider for a moment the onusof-proof provision and how it ought to be interpreted. There is no doubt whatever about what the act says. It providesIt shall not be necessary for the claimant, applicant or appellant to furnish proof to support his claim, application or appeal but the Commission, Board, Appeal Tribunal or Assessment Appeal Tribunal determining or deciding the claim, application or appeal, shall be entitled to draw, and shall draw from all tbe circumstances of the case, ' i . i . . i . . J . < . »*-",28,Repatriation
95,Mr Bryant (Wills) [4.10],"It is afrom the evidence furnished and from medical opinions, all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant, applicant or appellant. In other words, the principle laid down twenty years ago was that unless the commission or tribunal or board could say definitely that the ex-serviceman had no case at all, the ex-serviceman should be granted the full benefit of the doubt. That is what we say and that is in accordance with what I suggest is the true spirit of the act. That this was the intention of the act was pointed out quite clearly in 19S9 by a very highly placed legal man in this Parliament. I refer to Dr. Evatt who, as Leader of the Opposition, is reported on page 1418 of."" Hansard"" of 24th September, 1959, as having said-h e was supported in this by Mr Percy Joske, now a Justice of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital TerritoryMo doubt the honourable member's contention is quite reasonable from his point of view, but my absolute conviction is that the benefit of this appellant in a position to present his claim provision should be given to the ex-serviceman. I am not speaking in generalities. I know of cases in which the benefit has not been given to the ex-servicema-x In a short debate of this nature one cannot take up a lot of time by quoting, but if honourable members will look at page 1418 and the following pages of "" Hansard "", of September, 1959, they will see the burden of that debate. Mr Joske, the honourable member for Balaclava at that time, gave his support to the then Leader of the Opposition. He saidIt seems to me that tbe weakness is rather in the way in which evidence is presented before the tribunals, particularly medical evidence. He went on to refute the kind of thing that the honourable member for Moore( Mr cause of cancer. All the relevant documents Leslie) was saying by pointing out that the medical people making submissions are not present before the tribunals to be questioned. Honourable members who have been before tribunals will know that that is the position. Some time ago-in February, 1959-the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr which places upon the Repatriation DepartClyde Cameron) asked the Minister for Repatriation at that timeWill the Minister prepare a summary of the reasons for refusing war pensions to applicants suffering from lung cancer? This is what the Minister representing the then Minister for Repatriation said. . . I am advised by the Minister that a repatriation board of the Repatriation Commission only rejects a claim for pension in respect of incapacity resulting from lung cancer when the tribunal or commission is satisfied that the incapacity is not due to war service. The honourable member for Hindmarsh asked on what evidence these decisions were based, and the reply wasI am advised by the Minister that members of the tribunal . . . are laymen. When we look at other answers, we find the same thing is said time and time again. A board of laymen receives medical opinions from somewhere or other and makes its decisions in an atmosphere which causes appellants-a t least the appellants whom I have accompanied-to become slightly awestruck. These are friendly enough gatherings, and much more informal than courts of law, but the atmosphere is not such as to put an applicant or an thoroughly. We say it is not his job to prove the claim. It is nonsense for honourable members to say that an ex-serviceman has only to produce evidence of his war service. If that is the case, why is it that appeals from one section of the system to another section are continually allowed? For instance, 18.7 per cent, of appeals from decisions of the commission were allowed last year, according to the report. There is plenty of evidence that the tribunals, boards and other authorities do not make absolutely infallible decisions. We say that cancer in ex-servicemen is something to which this Government ought to turn its attention. There is plenty of evidence to the effect that nobody knows the show that this is the case. Cancer is the subject of a world-wide campaign, a campaign in which this Government ought to take part. It could do so by throwing the resources of the Repatriation Commission into the fight. It could do so also by acting in accordance with the spirit of the act, ment the responsibility of caring for ex-servicemen in sickness, particularly when it can be shown that their illnesses have been aggravated or contributed to in any way by war service. We believe there is a demand for an expansion of the spirit of the act, so to speak. Twenty years ago, certain principles were established in relation to tuberculosis. It is obvious, if one reads the reports, that a stronger case can be made out for the automatic acceptance of tuberculosis, having regard to conditions of service in the two world wars, than can be made out for cancer, but we do not think this is a case for cold hard logic. It is obvious that knowledge of the causes of cancer is extremely meagre. There is some evidence that this, that or something else does seem to predispose a victim to cancer, but we say that this is a case for Government action. There is no answer to the charge that the onus-of-proof provision is not being applied in the spirit in which it was intended to be applied. There is a strong case for the Government to step in and give the benefit of common humanity to the servicemen who have been affected by cancer. As far as the returned servicemen's league is concerned, it could do more in this field than it has done in some of the other fields in which it has campaigned recently. quite appreciate the significance of the last remark of the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant). Mr Clyde Cameron -Why does not the returned servicemen's league do something about this, instead of sitting back and writing a few letters? on either side of the House can say that the RSL. is not trying to do something about it. honourable member for Moore seemed to imply minutes. Give me ten minutes, instead of nine. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard), in the speech that opened up this debate, stated that the congress of the returned servicemen's league had passed a resolution to this effect and had submitted it to the Government. I notice that that congress mentioned many other things which it said the Government should further consider. Some of them are stated in this wayThat the Age Allowance provided under the Income Tax legislation be based on taxable income only and not on net income, and that in the section relating to Dependants' Allowance separate net income shall be deemed not to include a war pensioner's dependant's allowance. That the Repatriation Department be requested to appoint a Resident Officer of the Repatriation Department in country centres and territories of Australia. That the Repatriation Department be asked to speed up communications, the payment of pensions, and action on application for medical reviews. That War Widows be granted concessional T.V. and Wireless Licences. That all children over the age of 16 years who are receiving a Repatriation education allowance be entitled to free medical and dental treatment. That Heart complaints be automaticaUy accepted as war caused disabilities. That Mental Illness be automatically accepted as a war caused disabiity. So you can see the picture. If you accept one, you must accept the next one. Then you accept the next one and in the end you have something that is contrary to the original Repatriation Act. Any illness suffered at any stage after a man's serviceeven a broken leg 40 years after his service ended-woul d be accepted for the purposes of the Repatriation Act. that. that would be the natural follow-up. I think it is wrong to give the impression that representations to the Government on this issue have come from only one side of the House. I know of honourable members on this side of the House who have advocated automatic acceptance of cancer as due to war service. I think the former honourable member for Lilley was misquoted. I can remember working with him on this point. Our original investigation proved, strangely enough, from the figures that were obtainable, that cancer was less prevalent amongst ex-servicemen than amongst the community generally. Mr Clyde Cameron -Thos e figures were cooked. they were not cooked. It is very difficult to get the proper picture. The honourable member for Barton was quoting American figures.",29,Repatriation

The honourable member for Barton said that widows and orphans would get no comfort from the attitude of this Government to repatriation. I can assure him that widows and orphans have had a great deal of comfort from this Government's attitude to repatriation. Three members of the Opposition have spoken in this debate so far. If the day comes when the present Opposition forms the government and it happens that those members hold portfolios, there will be some very suitable material to be quoted back at them, as seems to be the habit here. No one who examines what has happened in thefieldof repatriation over the last the world has any country such a system as fourteen years can say that this Government has been unsympathetic to ex-servicemen or their dependants. A marriage gratuity was introduced, equal to nearly one year's pension; expenses incurred in travelling to and from hospitals are reimbursed; and the domestic allowance has been increased from 7s. 6d. to £3 2s. 6d. I am sure that no honourable member on the other side of the House would quarrel with those things being done. It is generally accepted fhat ex-servicemen and their dependants are entitled to those benefits. However, the greatest step forward in this field was the provision made by this Government for the treatment of service pensioners in repatriation hospitals. The main reason behind the move to get cancer accepted as a warcaused disability is that people have such a dreadful fear of the disease. Anybody over middle-age who contracts some sort of illness immediately suspects that he has cancer. Unfortunately, if a person finds that he has cancer it is tantamount to receiving a death sentence. But heart diseases kill just as many people in Australia as cancer does. I suppose there could be put forward just as good an argument, if not even a better argument to enable an ex-serviceman with a heart weakness to claim that it is directly attributable to war service as could be put forward to claim that cancer was directly attributable to war service. So it is a matter of priorities. quoting the The honourable member for Barton mentioned section 47 of the act and the onus of proof. He went on and, I believe, emulated his predecessor in this seat, who used to advocate an appeal from the tribunal to a justice of the High Court of Australia. I can remember some of the debates when the then member for Balaclava, who is now Mr Justice Joske, joined the former member for Barton in agreeing that there should be an appeal to a High Court judge. As an ex-serviceman I think it would be a retrograde step to adopt the principle of appeals to judges in repatriation matters. Regardless of any shortcomings in the act I know, as well as anybody here does, that every honourable member has had cases where he tried to understand the mind of a repatriation tribunal in rejecting an application. But that does not prove to me that the system is wrong, because nowhere else in this. Onee you have a purely legal interpretation of the act, based on purely legal grounds, fewer ex-servicemen in Australia will get pensions. It is no use Opposition members quoting the fact that 25 per cent, of all appeals fail, because this is an extremely wrong figure. What they are quoting is the percentage of those cases which go to an appeal. If you take the original applications to the Repatriation Commission for the acceptance of a disability, you will find that the percentage of refusals of applications which go to appeal is very small indeed. Aunt Sallys to knock down. I cannot quote the figures now, but in a speech three years ago I showed how many applicants never had to appeal. The commission had automatically granted acceptance because of evidence tendered and examination by doctors. The honourable member cannot try to destroy the system because of the number of rejections, which he quoted as 25 per cent, of the cases that went to appeal. I believe that ex-servicemen in Australia are extremely fortunate in having the Repatriation Act they have. I believe, too, that if we adopted a system of legal appeals fewer people would get entitlements than get them to-day. It is",31,Repatriation

Osborne the League had ample evidence of his enthusiasm for his responsibilities and his desire to continue the close and friendly association with the League, that was necessary in the overall interests of all ex-service men and women and Swartz is continuing this same policy in administering the Repatriation portfolio. I read that passage because the Minister was accused by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) of reading a statement. I tbink that as Minister for Repatriation it is vitally important for him, in a matter such as this, to put the policy of the Government in this respect down in writing. No member of the Opposition could expect anything less and if the position were reversed and the Opposition became the Government its own Minister would do exactly the same thing. our case would be. point raised by the honourable member for Macquarie I say that a review of the act and of repatriation benefits is constantly under the notice of the Government and of the appropriate Minister.

In order that this amount would be available, and to avoid a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund, provision was made for £98,300,000 of expenditure on defence services to be charged to the Loan Fund. It is now clear that little or no assistance will be needed from revenue for State works and housing programmes. This, in turn, means that the charging of defence expenditure to the Loan Fund may be reduced. Accordingly, expenditure on defence services will be charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund after the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) has been additional essential accommodation in existenacted. It is estimated that the amount involved may be as high as £30,000,000 and it is proposed to seek an appropriation of this amount from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This, of course, does not affect the total expenditure on defence services during the current financial year. It provides, however, for this expenditure to be met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund instead of the Loan Fund. I commend the bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned.

120,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"met by a general debate covering the two Appropriation Bills and the two Supply Rills. I propose, therefore, Sir, that you permit the subject-matter of the four bills to be discussed in the debate on this bill. -There being no objection, that course will supply along for a month or two no paybe adopted. Mr Speaker, we have not had long to conof the Supply Bill, therefore, is to sanction template the measures that we are now disexpenditures for the first five months of cussing, as the first of them was presented by the financial year. the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) only a few minutes ago. They involve in aggregate the expenditure of almost £427,000,000. More tude of this Government towards the Parthan £47,000,000 is to be appropriated for liament with respect to these financial what are called the Additional Estimates of measures. We all know that in August of expenditure on ordinary account and more last year the Government brought down its than £7,000,000 for Additional Estimates Budget, which was supposed to be a forefor Works and Services. In addition, we cast of its receipts and expenditures for the are contemplating supply for the first five period ending 30th June next. For reasons months of the financial year to begin on which he gave in one of the speeches that 1st July, 1963, under which there will be he made here to-day the Treasurer estivoted more than £301,000,000 on ordinary mated that on all accounts-that is, account and more than £70,000,000 for ordinary revenue and capital works and capital works and services. Although we are discussing these measures in revenue, as against expenditure, of about together for the convenience of the House, £120,000,000. I think £118,000,000 was I think nevertheless that, to begin with, I something like the exact figure. That should point out the reasons for the two sets deficiency was to be made good by what of measures. As I have stated already, the is known as a budget deficit. In other Additional Estimates provide for expendiwords, the Government, through the ture on ordinary account as well as on medium of the Reserve Bank, and by the capital works and services. These Addiuse of treasury-bills, would pump into the tional Estimates arise from the fact that, community during the course of the year at the beginning of a financial year, one some £120,000,000. cannot always see definitely what total commitments may be by the end of the financial year. Sometimes, we cannot come up to now by this Government of the need, in full performance for some commitments. some circumstances, to resort to what is Sometimes, inevitably, because of the scale called deficit financing. It is not very long of government activity, we find that some since it was popular on the other side of commitments not budgeted for at the beginthe House to suggest that if you resorted ning of the financial year have become to deficitfinancingyou would find yourself necessary. The purpose of the Additional on the toboggan that runs down the preEstimates is to provide for those contincipitous slope of inflation. It was really a gencies. The expenditure must receive parvery silly attitude to be adopted by any liamentary sanction. The theory at least of government knowing much about the expenditure under parliamentary control is realities of public finance in a modern that no expenditure can take place legitisystem. Nevertheless, at election times and mately until it has received the approval other suitable times the Government proof Parliament. I want to say a little more duced its stalking-horse and suggested to shortly about the growing difference between the people that if deficit financing were theory and practice with respect to that indulged in it would be ruinous for the assumption. The other matter, the necessity for five months' supply, arises, of course, from the fact that the Parliament will adjourn, probably, towards the end of May. This financial year will end on 30th June, the Parliament will not come back until some ment of government accounts would be legally possible froia 1st July.

122,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [5.2],"House have always held-to the contrary -is that as long as there are resources in the community that are not being fully utilized, as long as there is man-power idle and seeking to be employed, then something must be done to stimulate the economy and to see that men, materials and machines are brought together for the betterment of the economy as a whole. We have said that the quickest way to bring this about is for the Government itself to take the initiative and to spend more than it is currently raising in revenue, either from taxation or from loans. That, it seems to me, is a sensible enough assumption in the period in which we are living. In the eight or nine months of the financial year that have already elapsed there has been a radical change on the receipts side of government accounts, as the Additional Estimates show. There has not been a great deal of change in actual departmental expenditure. The missing link, so far as the documents before us to-day are concerned, lies in the fact that we have not got the full picture of the revenue side of government activity up to the end of March or April. All that we know is that in some respects some revenues have exceeded expectations and, most importantly, the Government has been much more successful in the loan market than it expected to be when it framed the Budget in August last. The Treasurer at that time believed that he would actually have to put money into the loan market, when account was taken of loan conversions and other commitments that were falling due in the course of the financial year. But to his great surprise, if to nobody else's, there has been much more money forthcoming in the loan market than he had expected. private investment! question that has to be asked and, perhaps, we should attempt to answer it. Does the Government's success in the loan market show the financial confidence of the community in the Government or is it, perhaps, a reflection of the lack of confidence of investors in the future of the Australian economy? Is it that they are not sure which way things are going and, therefore, prefer at the present time to put their money into the safe custody of government bonds rather than into what honourable gentlemen opposite call the fields of private enterprise, which, when it suits them, they suggest constitute the mainspring of the economy? The question that they should ask themselves occasionally is whether the present circumstances of the economy reflect confidence in private enterprise. I suggest that when that question is asked systematically by honourable members opposite, and related to what they call their political philosophy, they will find that there is a lot to be unhappy about from their point of view. It is true that the Government has got more in revenue-and I use the term "" revenue "" to include money from loans as well as from taxation-tha n it expected to get. Because of this, of course, the Government does not have to face as great a deficit as it thought it would have to face. Again, however, we should ask ourselves, "" What was the assumption about the deficit in August or September last? "" The assumption was that the Australian economy needed that much more spending injected into it in order to get it working at its maximum level. It is not working at its maximum level at the moment. We still have 90,000 or 100,000 people wanting jobs and unable to get them. At the end of December, 1962, the end of the last quarter that is measurable, economic activity was certainly higher than it was at the end of December, 1961, but in aggregate it was at no higher level in December, 1962, than it was Ln December, 1960. We had the rundown throughout 1962 which we called the slump. Since then, economic activity has improved to some extent, but at the end of December, 1962, it had only reached the point at which it was two years earlier. In speaking of the Australian economy, the Government claims that it believes in full employment, in price stability and in economic growth. If the Government claims that it believes in economic growth, surely it means that the standards per head at the end of, say, 1962 should be a little better than they were at the end of 1961. Australia's population increases by about 2 per cent, per annum. If prices are stable and the population has grown, total economic activity at the end of one year should be some 3 per cent, to 4 per cent.",38,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63
123,Mr Reynolds,Becaus e he crucified,39,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63
124,Mr Crean,"There, of course, is agreater than it was twelve months previously, if growth has been achieved. With2 per cent, more people to feed, clothe and look after each year, we must have an annual increase of about 4 per cent, in our economic activity if the standards of the people are to improve at the suggested rate of 1 per cent, or 2 per cent, per annum. That is not the pattern in Australia at the moment. By forgetting certain unpleasant aspects and by camouflaging others, the Government can say that conditions were better in December, 1962, than they were in December, 1961. But conditions had only come back to the point at which they were two years previously. Instead of being 8 per cent, better than two years previously, in essence they are no better than they were. That certainly is not economic growth. As far as we can read the financial accounts of the Government for this financial year, the Government still needs to impart a stimulus of somewhere near the expected budget deficit. As I said on a previous occasion, according to the philosophy of the Government, it would have been all right if the deficit had not been required because private spending had increased by so much more. But that is not the circumstance in Australia. What has happened is that the budget deficit is less than it should have been. Private spending is not as great as it was and Government spending is no more than had been provided in the Budget, so the total activity is at a lower level than was anticipated. We have a mixed economy. We have a large amount of public activity of one sort or another. The Post Office, education and health systems, and electricity, power and irrigation undertakings are all conducted by public authorities, but the main part of industrial activity and a fair amount of what is called tertiary activity are still conducted But the most deplorable shortcoming in the by what is sometimes euphemistically described as private enterprise. I suppose that an overall picture of Australia at the moment would show that of total activity roughly 30 per cent, is public and the remainder private of one kind or another. We have a mixed economy with private activity greater than public activity. The encouragement that can be given to private enterprise, at least by this Government, tends to be indirect rather than direct. If for one reason or another private enterprise is not being as enterprising as it should be, the only way to provide a stimulus is by greater public activity. I want to direct the attention of the House to the rather clouded picture we have of the amount of public activity and the future planning of public activity in Australia. Every honourable member knows that there is great discontent in the community at the moment about the provision being made for education. There has not been enough planning for education, from the kindergarten to the university, either in the provision of buildings or in the training of staff. There are similar deficiencies in the field of health, particularly in such specialized matters as mental health and the care of aged people. About 10 per cent, of our people are men over 65 and women over 60 years of age. Grossly inadequate provision is made for them. They are at the ages where their demands for hospitalization and specialized medical care are greater than ever before. The aged population is growing nearly as fast as the young population is, but aged persons are not being provided with the health services and specialized housing that they need. Every honourable member has had the depressing experience of meeting pensioners who, with no income but the pension, have to pay rates on a house, if they are fortunate enough to own one, at the same level as they paid when they were working. We all know of the more distressing cases in which pensioners who do not own homes often are living miserably in rooms or in things that are called flats, for which they pay more than half of their pensions. Their needs are not being met. We have the same situation with electricity undertakings and other requirements. public sphere in what are called great modern cities such as Sydney and Melbourne is found in the fact that one-third to one-quarter of the cities are without sewerage. We are actually falling further and further behind in meeting this requirement. New houses are being built much more quickly than sewerage, roads and other such services can be provided. Can this be said to be a healthy and sensible situation? Does this not point to the need for a more systematic planning of public works in Australia? The attitude of the Government on this matter is revealed in a book to which I shall refer. I think all honourable members have received a copy of it. If they have not they can receive one from the Department of National Development. It is called "" Major Development Projects-Australi a -June, 1962"". It claims to be the fifth in a series of publications that come out every two years. Apparently the previous one was dated June, 1960. I defy anybody to regard this document as a very intelligible or even intelligent setproblems in his electorate as those that face ting out of the major development projects. All it is is a conglomeration of everything that is going on in Australia, whether it is the building of a bridge over Gin Gin Creek or anything else. That bridge may be significant in somebody's electorate, but I doubt whether it is very significant to the nation as a whole. Yet in this volume it looms almost as large as the construction of the dams in the Snowy Mountains scheme. AllI am saying is that here is some documentation but it is documentation which in the ultimate is unintelligible. I suggest that too much unintelligible documentation is published by this Government and that there is not enough sifting to find out what the real issues are. What does it mean if we are told that £200,000,000 of the £400,000,000 which the great Snowy Mountains scheme is to cost in aggregate has already been expended? All that we know is that there is another £200,000,000 to be spent on that project. Does anybody know what is the significance of that project when completed in relation to all the things that need to be done throughout Australia? For instance, people who come from some of the farflung States of this Commonwealth should have a look and see how intelligible is this map which shows roads and bridges being constructed in Australia at 30th June, 1962. It can be found as an inset between pages 96 and 99 of this document. What does that map mean in terms of a population of 10,000,000 people, an area of 3,000,000 square miles and the talk that can be heard at the moment about developing the north? I raised this question with the Treasurer lar purpose of government. Ever since we ( Mr Harold Holt), by implication, on have had this Federal Parliament there has another occasion when he was introducing a measure to provide £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 for the construction of roads. What is the significance of £1,000,000 in relation to the total demand for roads in this community? Does anybody know offhand what it costs to build a mile of road? If you are a metropolitan man, you might know what it costs to build a mile of concrete road down one of the main highways; but do you know what it costs to build a mile of road across the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull)? And he may not have the same the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) or my colleague, the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan). It is time we began to talk in this House about the number of miles of road that need to be built and the dozens, hundreds, thousands or millions of people who have to be served, according to the nature of the particular service. About half an hour ago the Treasurer brought in bills to appropriate about £450,000,000 in aggregate. AgainI ask the House: How real is it? What is it relative to? For instance, we know that half the annual expenditure by the Government scarcely comes before this Parliament at all because it is committed in advance just to keep the Government rolling, as it were. Yet we continue to debate these matters in this chamber as though the expenditure of every £1 authorized by this Parliament was understood and something sacred that we are all striving to preserve. That is not the reality of the matter at all. EarlierI started to speak about the Budget deficit. The fact that we are talking about budget deficits shows that we are no longer thinking in terms of revenue and expenditure having to match each other. I understand that to-morrow this House will contemplate amendments to its Standing Orders which will take away some of the rigmarole that has been practised in this chamber in regard to what is known as the Committee of Ways and Means, which historically goes back to the time when, if the Parliament imposed a tax, that tax was supposed to relate to a particubeen only one Consolidated Revenue Fund. All moneys that the Government is able to collect are paid into that fund. Very rarely does a particular tax attach to a particular purpose. Some people still try to suggest that the petrol tax attaches to a particular purpose. There may be a case for saying that. I am not arguing that. By and large the collection of taxes and the expenditure by the Government are scarcely related to one another at all. Yet that is still the way in which we conduct nnanciai debates in this Parliament. I suggest that the time has come for us to think in terms of the physical, human and social problems that face this Parliament. Do we properly encompass them? Do we get them in proper perspective merely by talking about them in terms of pounds, shillings and pence? In fact, this rather ironical phrase appears in the document issued by the Department of National DevelopmentThe projects described are principally works of the Commonwealth and State Governments and their Instrumentalities in fields conducive to economic (as contrasted with social) development. that calls the tune. I think he is calling the I doubt whether, in a modern community, we can contrast economic development and social development. It is true that each has different aspects; but from the point of view of the Parliament as a whole they have to be contemplated together. How far we can go in economic development is limited by how far we want to go in social development. To put the two forward as though they are almost an antithesis or a dichotomy is absurd in a modern context. I think this document highlights the point that I am trying to make. It tries to set out in a fairly old-fashioned form how much is being spent on hundreds and perhaps thousands of projects in Australia. I believe that the Government is still obsessed with the idea that it looks good if you can produce a document of 130 pages and say, "" This document is full of public works that are being carried out in Australia "". If it mixes up the bridge over the Gin Gin creek with the am not saying that it is unimportant. I represenlation of the people and a system hope nobody will take that sort of carping under which, as near as it is possible, the point. If you take that point you have voice of one should be just as able to be missed the whole lesson that I have tried to delineate this afternoon. All that I am suggesting is that I doubt whether honourable members, other than those who happen to represent the State in which Gin Gin Creek is, would know where it is. However, we have some conception of a project like the Snowy Mountains scheme. Wa all know that every town, every hamlet, every village and every county has to have roads and bridges. Those things are essential for the people in those districts. But do honourable members think that they are getting all the bridges and all the roads that they want in their electorates at present by the current methods of allocating our financial resources? Would not you prefer to have emphasis placed upon the physical problems that need solution in your electorate rather than have the Treasurer simply say that he has allocated £200,000,000 or £250,000,000 from loan funds? In fact, the allocation u made by agreement between the States and the Commonwealth and nobody knows better than does the Treasurer that he is the one tune in a most unsatisfactory way. It is certainly a most inadequate way of encompassing the great problems of national development in Australia in 1963. thing to the States and local governments to explain. This is only the Commonwealth's. document includes local government, semi-government and other works. Anything that takes up a line or so is included to make the volume look more impressive. That is not the way in which I suggest the problems of this nation should be encompassed. The honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) is more concerned that he should have representation according to area rather than the number of people. I think that democracy is meaningful if we talk about it in terms of people and quite meaningless if we talk about it in terms of cows and geography. I admit that we",39,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63

128,Mr Crean,"I know that, but thisheard as the voice of anybody else. I do not say that all voices are necessarily signincant, but all voices should be given the opportunity to be significant if they can be. That has been the pattern of our development, and I hope that, in the years fx come, this Parliament will begin to talk in terms of economic and social planning rather than in terms of just a barren provision of large sums of money. I suppose it will be a long time before we can estimate requirements in any better way than -by using the measuring rod of money, although, over the last few years, money has been a fairly crazy measuring rod, as most of us know. In fact, I doubt whether the problem will be any more easily understood if we shift to decimal currency in .preference to pounds, shillings and pence. We ought to be measuring these things in terms of the social, cultural, economic and other internal and external needs of Australif as we face up to them from time to time. I do not think we are doing that at the moment in the way we are treating these measures in this place. honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has paid the Government a grudging compliment the Government had come round to appreciating that there was nothing shameful in budgeting for a deficit, whereas once upon a time this Government would not entertain a deficit under any oircumstances. As I understand the position, the Government has never been afraid to introduce a deficit Budget. To that extent, it does not differ very greatly from the Labour Party. The great difference between the Government and the Labour Party is that the Government believes it has a responsibility to relate the size of its deficit, and the decinot fully understand these things. My sion as to whether there shall be a deficit at reference to this subject is occasioned by all, to the economic conditions prevailing at the time. The Labour Party, on the other -hand, if we are to believe what its members say, would have a large deficit on every occasion irrespective of the economic F.2954/63 -R -[31 ] climate in the community. Ever since 1 have been in this House, whatever the conditions were, whether they were conditions of boom or slight recession, the Labour Party has advocated a deficit Budget on every occasion. Whenever we advocate a deficit Budget, the Labour Party wants us to budget for a bigger deficit. When we advocate a balanced Budget, or budgeting for a surplus, the Labour Party still wants a deficit. In other words, Labour's policy is irresponsible, stupid and unintelligent and is in no way related to the grave responsibility a government has to frame the economic environment in which the community will operate for the next twelve months. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports went on to say that because the Government envisaged a deficit in the Budget this year, and its estimate had been thrown out of balance by unexpected loan raisings, the Government had not been sincere in its desire to achieve the economic effect of a deficit. What in fact has happened is only what should have happened. When you find that you have made a miscalculation, that you have not been able to estimate accurately what your loan raisings will be, you have another look at what has happened to the economic situation before deciding whether at that point-nin e months laterit is necessary to retain your deficit at the original estimated level. The Government looked at the economic indicators and the situation and found that, because of the way in which things had developed, it was not then necessary to inject into the economy the stimulus which, nine months earlier, it had thought to be necessary. I want to take this opportunity to say a word or two about the question of subsidies and assistance to primary industries. In recent months there has been a good deal of critical comment about this in quite responsible journals, such as the "" Australian Financial Review"", in business circles in Australia and, indeed, by some of my colleagues in this Parliament who do the fact that we are proposing to find substantial sums in this year's Budget to support the wheat stabilization scheme which we are about to negotiate for a five-year term. Looking at the trends, it seems fairly",42,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63

133,Mr Forbes,"He did say that at lastevident that we will probably have to support that scheme with subsidies for some time to come. The critics suggest that there is something slightly immoral and not consistent with the principles of self-reliance hand, in the post-war years the Australian in this sort of subsidy and the other subsidies which some of the primary industries of Australia enjoy. There is an implication of an overtone of favouritism and coddling at the expense of other sections of the community. I emphasize that I am not making that point; I am merely pointing out that that suggestion has been made. The criticism to which I have referred generally ends up with a demand that the industries being subsidized stand on their own feet and that the burden involved in subsidizing them be removed from the shoulders of the taxpayer. I believe that this sort of fallacy, which is more widespread than some people imagine, should be nailed once and for all, not only to protect the existing subsidy arrangements in our primary industries, but also to provide a basis for the inevitable expansion of those industries which will and should come as the country grows and develops. Why have we been led to the point where Nevertheless, taking the period as a whole, it is both just and in our economic interest there has been persistent pressure on the to subsidize and otherwise assist our general price level in Australia. primary industries? It is easy enough to demonstrate why our primary industries need assistance if they are to stay in business and if our primary producers are to ment which have occurred in this country enjoy standards of living comparable with and, I might add, by the protection necesthose enjoyed by other sections of the comsary to keep alive many of our secondary munity. You have only to compare the industries. Faced with this rise in the prices paid by farmers with the prices they general price level, most sections of the have received in recent years to realize the Australian community have protected their necessity for this. If you use this argument, own positions more than adequately. Wage the critics ask: ""Is not this the price of and salary earners have had access to the progress? Is this not a stimulus to adjust arbitration system. Industry and comto circumstances?

If the primary prothat in deciding whether the point is valid ducer is fortunate enough and organized you must ask yourself: What is the cause enough, he can jack up the price of his of the present position of primary industry? products on the home market. I might Is the farmer responsible, or is the comadd fhat not all of them are in this position; munity responsible? The question has only indeed, very few of them are. But what to be posed to be answered. The Australian farmer is among the most efficient farmers in the world. Indeed, in the last twenty years he has become progressively more efficient. On the other community, almost without a dissentient, has chosen to pursue particular objectivesobjectives which have been stated so clearly many times by the Treasurer. The emphasis is on national development, on full employment and on a rapidly expanding population. These have been nationally desired and nationally demanded objectives. They have transformed Australia in a relatively short time into a modern industrial nation. I believe that this has been a wonderful achievement, and I fully support it. But it has not been done without cost, in particular to the primary producing section of the community. Over almost the whole of the period since the end of the last war there has been a persistent pressure on the general price level. This pressure has been removedI hope permanently but I suspect temporarily-for the last two years by timely action by this Government. This process has been generated by the force of the expansion and the developBut what of primary industry and the of the proportion of primary products which is exported? The producer cannot adjust the price of his exported goods at will. In those circumstances, there is only one way in which he can protect his position in the same degree as all other sections of the community protect their positions. That is by government subsidy. Is this just? I mentioned earlier that many people do not 'believe that it is just. I believe that it is just. The reason why the primary producer's position has declined is that the Government has pursued national policies demanded by the community. No government would survive which did not pursue these policies. In these circumstances, surely tariff protection and, indeed, demand tariff he is entitled to compensation for the effects protection, their argument has no validity of those national policies. Surely he is entitled to payments to compensate him for the effects of nationally approved, nationally demanded policies. On the criterion adopted by the Tariff Board-o r the criterion that should be adopted by the board-of an economic and efficient industry, most primary industries in Australia would qualify for assistance. Why is the primary producer not entitled to compensation for the disability he suffers, in the same way as the manufacturers, but in a manner appropriate to his needs and circumstances? I have never been able to understand the people-and there are many of them-wh o see a stigma in a subsidy but see nothing wrong in tariff protection. These people talk as if there were no stigma in tariff protection, but when a subsidy is involved they refer to self-reliance and other factors. prosper, in circumstances in which nationJust what is the difference? They both involve a price-to the Australian consumer, where tariff protection is involved, and in the case of a subsidy, to the taxpayer. the export market for their prices. In these I believe that if you put the two cases alongside each other, the subsidy has a lot to recommend it over tariff protection, from every point of view. At least the subsidy is in the open. Its cost is known, defined and debated in this Parliament. How many members of this House know the cost of any particular tariff proposal? I suggest the only one here would be the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly), and not even he has been able to estimate the cost of all of them. At least a subsidy, because it is paid by the taxpayers, is paid in proportion to the capacity of a person to pay. A tariff is not. It rests on every consumer, whatever his income; it rests equally on rich and poor. This is a principle which my honourable friends opposite are always talking about, and yet I have never heard from them any suggestion that our system of tariff protection should be replaced by one of subsidy. I am not advocating that, Sir. I am simply making the point that when people attach a stigma to a subsidy-somethin g that should be removed, something that is not in accordance with the principles which we on this side of the House are supposed to supportand at the same time make no bones about at all, either on moral or on economic grounds. I have been talking, Sir, about the justice of subsidies to primary industries. Looking at the problem from the point of view of this country as a whole, I believe that the economic considerations are even more overwhelming, if that is possible, because the continued prosperity of these industries is vital to our future as a country. This is an argument I am not going to emphasize again. It has been put time and time again from this side of the House, ad nauseum. As we continue to grow as a nation, our demand for imports will become greater and for a long time ahead we will depend on primary industries to finance them. We will not earn enough export income unless our primary industries continue to grow and ally demanded policies inevitably put pressure on the price level and disadvantage those industries, which have to depend on circumstances, I believe a compensation payment in the way of a subsidy is the right and proper answer. The economics of the situation seem to me to be as clear as the justice of it. policy. very different indeed, because honourable gentlemen opposite appear to believe that tariff protection can be as high as you want : ' without creating any difficulties in this country.

135,Mr Forbes,"What I am advocating isI would not go as far as this-believ e that it does not mattei and that there is no objection to an unlimited rise in the price level, because you can compensate all sections of the community in this way. I would never say that. I believe that we must not get into a situation in which everybody is living off everybody else and every one is chasing his own tail. I would put a limitation on the effects of the argument I am bringing forward. Therefore, I in no way decry policies designed to achieve price and cost stability in this country and keep prices at reasonable levels, because, after all, we cannot live in isolation in the world. Honourable members opposite would put no limitation whatever on this. At least I do place a limitation on it. I end as I began. My purpose was to make out a case for subsidies-particularl y for the primary industries-by pointing out that these are little more than compensation payments designed to compensate those sections of the community which suffer as the result of nationally demanded policies. In that sense they are just as necessary and are as much an economic requirement as is any form of assistance that we in this Parliament grant. Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. Mr O'BRIEN (Petrie) [8.0] Mr by its support for the principle of Speaker, the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) this afternoon directed the attention of the House to the injustices being suffered by primary industry. To-night, I should like to devote my time to a recital of the injustices inflicted by this Government on Commonwealth public servants. I am gravely concerned that in the past three or four years there have been numerous attacks on the Government by public service organizations in pursuit of their just claims for salary and wage parity with industry and the public services of the States. It was with concern that I learned that 1,450 Commonwealth public servants met at 1 p.m. to-day in the Festival Hall in Brisbane to consider the attitude of the Government to their claims for wage justice. Those public servants represented every Commonwealth department in Brisbane. They comprised engineers, architects, accountants and clerical officers. They are responsible citizens of our community. I am sure that the Minister for Labour and claim that those people are being led by the nose by the Communist fraternity in Australia. The action decided upon by those Commonwealth public servants cannot be termed irresponsible. On the contrary, the course of action upon which the Commonwealth public servants in Brisbane have decided to embark is the direct result of injustices they have suffered at the hands of this Government over the last few years. The meeting in Brisbane carried a resolution which has caused me grave concern. The resolution is as follows:This meeting of Commonwealth public servants condemns the CommonweaUh Government for its continued refusal to conciliate with public servants' unions on salaries and wages in the Commonwealth Service, for its continued neglect to increase salaries and wages in keeping with general wage and community living standards and for its deliberate denial of wage justice to its employees as evidenced by(1) persistent and direct Government opposition to arbitration claims which should be disputed between unions on the one hand and the Public Service Board on the other, without Government interference; (2) deliberate and vicious destruction of the independence of the Public Service Arbitrator; (3) discrimination against its own employees tapering off marginal increases; (4) failure to increase Public Service wage standards to the same respective levels as apply to the State Public Services; and (5-) refusal to apply the principles of professional work value rises to other trades, professions and groups in the Commonwealth Public Service; and in supporting the policy of the High Council affirms that if the Government continues its suppression of the salaries of its own servants and continues to deny justice by directly opposing unions' just arbitration claims, then the unions have no alternative but to campaign actively against the Government and its supporters. That resolution was carried unanimously by 1,450 responsible public servants in Brisbane at 1 p.m. to-day. I am concerned, as I am sure every honourable member is, that a group of people in the Commonwealth Public Service should find it necessary to hold a mass meeting and aline itself with one particular political party. Certainly the resolution does not in so many",45,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63
136,National Service ( Mr Mcmahon) Would Not,"Words affiliate the unions with a particular political party but the resolution does state that the Public Service unions will work for the defeat at the polls of members of the political parties that form this coalition Government. I would not like to see Commonwealth public servants associate themselves with a political party and become a pressure group. The present action of the unions has been brought about by this Government's continued intervention before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Surely the commission should be able to arbitrate between employer and employee without intervention by the Government. The wages of Commonwealth employees have been frozen since 1959, when margins were adjusted retrospective to 3rd December, 1959. Everybody knows that the cost of living has increased since that time. Other employers are paying much more for the services of skilled men than is the Commonwealth Public Service. This Parliament should be responsible for seeing that Commonwealth public servants receive fair and honest consideration from any government. The Government denies public servants the right to strike. It refuses to permit public servants to hold stop work meetings. Public servants cannot take direct action. Their only recourse is an application to the Public Service Board or to the Arbitration Commission. For many years public servants have waited in vain for wage justice. In 1955 the Arbitration Commission determined that margins should be two and a half times the 1937 margins. But the Public Service Board devised its own formula for public servants and decreed that they should get less than had been awarded by the Arbitration Commission. In 1960 the commission decided that margins should be increased by 28 per cent., but the Public Service Board decided that not all public servants should receive margins increases of 28 per cent. Some public servants had theii margins increased by 28 per cent, but in a great many cases margins were increased by from 17 per cent, to 23 per cent. Public servants object very strongly to Government intervention before the Arbitration Commission. They see no reason why the Commonwealth, which is tbeir employer, should, through the instrumentality of the Public Service Board, oppose them in the court and, in addition, as represented by the Commonwealth Government, intervene in the court proceedings. Other employees in Australia may go in to bat against their employers but the Commonwealth public servants must fight two opponents. It is of no use to say that when the Commonwealth intervenes in a case it does so merely for the purpose of supplying the court with information. When the Commonwealth intervenes it does so in order to block any attempt by public servants to improve their conditions. This process of intervening has undermined the rights of the Public Service Arbitrator. Quite rightly the resolution adopted in Brisbane to-day refers to the deliberate and vicious destruction of the independence of the Public Service Arbitrator. He should determine matters involving public servants, but the Government is not satisfied with that course. It continues to intervene. Some brilliant men are employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. Those men are charged with the responsibility of putting into effect, for the well-being of the people of Austraia, the policies handed down by the Government. Those men are highly skilled. We are losing many of them to private industry. The old idea of a public servant happy in the service is passing. Tlie public servant is still devoted to his work and that devotion can be a wonderful thing if it is backed by wage justice. I am alarmed that Commonwealth public servants have taken this action but the decision to do so was not made overnight. This trouble has been brewing ever since this Government took office. In 1947 the then Labour Government recommended to the Public Service Board that public servants be given a 25 per cent, increase in margins. When the Public Service Board objected to this, the Chifley Government said, ""They are entitled to it and they will be paid "". One does not have to go far to learn the feelings to-day of Commonwealth public servants. This morning's "" Sydney Morning Herald"" carried the following article:Canberra, Monday. One of the strongest CommonweaUh Public Service associations has threatened to take direct political action against the Federal Government unless it receives "" salary justice "". The organization referred to is the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, which covers most public servants in the second and third divisions.

Political influence was being brought to bear on the "" supposedly impartial automation and mechanization, and this arbitration system,"" the president of the A.C.T. branch of the Commonwealth Public Service Administrative and Clerical Officers' Association, Mr W. A. McKinnon, said yesterday. This state of affairs has not arisen overnight. For many years Commonwealth public servants have been falling behind other workers in industry in the matter of salary, working hours and so on. They now demand that their salary rate be on a par with that of outside industry. Recently the Australian Bank Officers' Association published a pamphlet which indicated that a block of land which was worth £75 to £100 in 1939 is to-day worth between £1,000 and £1,500. The price has increased over ten times. In the same period the cost of a four or five roomed house has increased eight times, the cost of house furnishings has increased five times, transportation costs have increased ten times, but salaries have increased only four times. The Government must realize that Commonwealth public servants are underpaid and that it is pushing this organization which thc people of Australia always have looked upon as an impartial body into a political body. The Sydney ""Sun"" of 23rd November, from the Public Service. 1961, carried an article relating to a protest by Commonwealth public servants that a claim made by the Prime Minister was two who have retired, but there are plenty unfair. Mr D. Thompson, the State secremore who had not retired from the Comtary of the Commonwealth Public Service monwealth service when they joined private Administrative and Clerical Officers' Association, is reported in this waySenior public servants in this union say that Mr Calwell's proposals are practical and can be carried out. Public servants resent Mr Menzies* implication that they are providing figures to support the Government's case against Mr Calwell. What will be the result if public servants become so frustrated at the injustices which they are suffering that theyI would be the last person to want this to happen-tr y to use departmental estimates and figures for political gain? Our public servants could become frustrated if they do not receive reasonable remuneration for what they are required to do. Engineers, doctors, chemists, surveyors and accountants employed by the Commonwealth are not at present receiving remuneration that is equitable by comparison with salaries paid in private enterprise. We must pay these people adequately. We are now entering the age of science, Government, as the biggest employer of labour in Australia, should be leading the field and offering salaries that will attract the brains of this country to its service. For a long time now, private industry has been poaching from the Commonwealth the brilliant young people that we have. They are easily poached because salaries paid by the Commonwealth are so low. Some of our engineers receive only £1,400 or £1,500 a year as Commonwealth employees, whereas they could get £2,000 or £3,000 outside the Commonwealth service. One has only to look at an article published in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" on 30th October, 1961-no t so long ago-to see a list of some of the former Commonwealth public servants who have gone to employment in private industry. Looking across a group of photographs, I see the names of Sir Patrick McGovern, Sir John Jensen, Mr A. D. J. Forster, Mr R. J. Webster, Sir Giles Chippindall and Sir Jack Stevens, all of whom have become management consultants or directors in private industry. Mr O'BRIEN -We can pick out one or",48,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63
138,Mr Fox,"Some of those had retiredindustry. Recently, four assistant secretaries from the Department of Trade went to private industry. Most of the young technicians helping to establish television stations throughout Australia have come from the service of the Postmaster-General's Department. Let us look a little further at this poaching by private industry from the Commonwealth Public Service, which is so easily done. Under the heading, "" Heavy Fees Costs for Department"", the "" Canberra Times"", on 22nd August, 1961, reported a hearing before the Public Accounts Committee in these terms!The use of private architects and consultants by of wheat in the Commonwealth, I am the Works Department was incurring "" mammoth "" expenditure, the Public Accounts Committee was told yesterday. Mr H. F. Yoxon, Assistant Director-General (Administration) of the Department, said the private architects and consultants were employed because of staff losses and scarcities in the Works to speak this evening by numerous press Department. He was replying to Senator Benn. Mr Yoxon was commenting on an expenditure of £334,252 for fees for the year 1960-61. The department had paid £334,252 in one financial year to private architects and consultants, but the Commonwealth could not pay qualified architects and surveyors in its service adequate salaries! That is another illustration of the effects of the Commonwealth's refusal to adopt equitable salary ranges that will attract the brilliant young people of Australia. I venture to say that unless the demands made by the Commonwealth public servants are recognized as just, we shall lose to private industry and the State services a great number of our brilliant officers. Mr Speaker, I am sure that every honourable member on this side of the House, like me, is concerned about the situation and supports the claims of Commonwealth public servants for just salary scales. We sincerely hope that the Government will cease intervening between the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Public Service Board. The public servants of Australia are looking forward to receiving not only the full percentage marginal increase recently granted by the commission to workers in the metal trades, but also some adjustment to remove the disparity in the adjustments made by the Public Service Board in 1955 and again on 3rd December, 1959. Our public servants in Australia must be kept a non-political bodya non-pressure group. This Government has a responsibility for ensuring that their salaries are increased in due proportion and that their just demands are met. I can only hope, Mr Speaker, that this Government will recognize the justice of the demands of the public servants when they approach the Public Service Arbitrator in consequence of the recent decision in the metal trades case. Speaker, as the representative of an electorate that is one of the largest producers prompted this evening to discuss the proposed legislation for the renewal of the wheat stabilization plan, the wheat industry in general and, if time permits, a matter relating to income tax. I have been prompted statements that have been floating about this country in recent times. The first one that I want to quote appeared in the Melbourne ""Herald"" on l l t h February last. The article to which I refer was written by Mr Ronald Anderson, "" Herald"" writer on agriculture. I have not time to read the whole report. I shall read only the headline, which statedAxe may fall on wheat crops soon. Another article by the same writer appeared in the "" Herald"" of 25th April of this year under the headingCheaper wheat is tipped: Bread and eggs, too? That article statedAustralia may get cheaper wheat-and as a result cheaper bread, cakes and eggs-late r this year. comment from the Opposition side of the House. Opposition members are more interested in cheaper bread than in the welfare of the wheat industry, just about the most important industry in Australia to-day. Mr Ronald Anderson's article continuedI believe the Federal Government will announce within the next month or two a new wheat industry stabilisation plan which will substantially cut the home price of Australian wheat.",49,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63

141,Mr King,"It is interesting to hear theThe new formula will have the effect of making the actual figures. They will find that wheat growing less profitable and therefore less before the war the average area under popular. The formula incorporates a figure termed a acres. In 1961-62 the figure was exactly yield divisora figure taken as the average yield the same, 14,500,000 acres. Admittedly of wheat per acre. The divisor in the presentfive-yearstabilisation in the last six years, but I remind honourable plan, due to expire this year, is only 151 bushels members that those who have been levelling to the acre. So much for the statement by Mr Ronald as a base year the one on which we had Anderson on cheaper wheat. On 16th the lowest acreage on record under wheat. March of this year, an article by John Eddy was published in the Melbourne "" Herald"" under the headlineBig issues are looming in wheat. Under the sub-heading "" Cost-plus"", the period immediately following the time of article statedThe taxpayer has been guaranteeing the farmer very important bearing on the reduction of on a cost-plus basis. This is most misleading, Mr Speaker, because only in the last two wheat years has the Government been called on, and only to the extent of £20,000,000 or less. There is no mention in these reports of the huge cost to growers after the last war, when the home-consumption price was many shillings a bushel below the price on the open world market. In many wheat circles, it has been pointed out that this situation cost the wheat-growers something like £200,000,000. I should just like to remind the House of the original wheat stabilization plan and the subsequent plans, under which the growers contributed up to 2s. 6d. a bushel by placing in a fund 50 per cent, of the difference between the home-consumption price and the export price. This answers some of these economists and agricultural writers of the Melbourne "" Herald "". Surely no one can dispute the claim that the growers have held this fund together for twelve or thirteen years. In February last, an official of the Australian Wheat Board was reported as having said that if Australia lost the China market it might have to curb production by making it less profitable. The Melbourne press, on or about l l t h February last, reported also that Australia had doubled its acreage of wheat in the past six years. statement is very misleading. I suggest that honourable members should have a look at the Commonwealth Year Book and study wheat in Australia was about 14,500,000 there has been an increase in the acreage criticism have found it convenient to select Of course, those people who are interested in the wheat industry know why the acreage in the years before this last six-year period was so small. A t that time one of the States was experiencing exceptionally wet seasons. We must remember also that this was the high wool prices. I believe that this had a wheat acreage. I suggest that the trend is all one way. It is towards less money for the wheat grower which, of course, would make certain people in this chamber very happy. It would also have the result that no taxpayers' money would go into the wheat industry and that also is what some people would like to see. These results can be brought about in several ways. One would be by reducing acreage. Another would be by reducing the home-consumption price, as was mentioned in one of the newspaper reports. By reducing the home-consumption price, or the guaranteed price for the 100,000,000 bushels of export wheat, you would discourage the growers who would naturally turn, if they possibly could, to other kinds of produce. I said earlier that the wheat industry is the biggest industry in Australia to-day. While we hear, on the one hand, about huge quantities of surplus wheat being held throughout the world, on the other hand we see a vigorous campaign being conducted, known as the Freedom From Hunger campaign. There is no need for me to remind honourable members, or any one else in this country, that millions of people are starving in numerous countries throughout the world. In 1943-44 Australia produced This 110,000,000 bushels of wheat. In the following year this figure was reduced to 53,000,000 bushels, and that was the year in which we had to import wheat. in that year? but if you look through the records you will find that droughts frequently occur in this country, as is well known to any one acquainted with rural problems. Not only did we import wheat in that year, we also imported some sorghum for stock feed. As the honourable member for Watson said, there was a drought in that year, but I remind him that as late as 1957-58 we also had to import wheat into New South Wales. This was not entirely as a result of drought; the previous year. it was also because of the fact that milling machinery in New South Wales was geared to take a certain proportion of hard wheat, and there just was not enough hard wheat in New South Wales or Queensland to go around. I have heard many people say at various times that there is a huge surplus of wheat in the world, but if honourable members analyse the position they may be amazed to find that these huge surpluses are confined to the United States of America and Canada, in which countries I think about 1,500,000,000 bushels of wheat is now held as surplus stock. I now want to turn to the demand for grain in general. In the last two and a half years we have exported about 190,000,000 bushels of wheat to mainland China. I believe that the Asian countries in general are improving their standard of living, and this will naturally mean a big increase in the consumption of wheat. When we are discussing wheat we must not overlook the significance of the position with respect to the coarse grains, such as oats, barley and sorghum. All these products go hand in hand. The consumption of various grains as stock feed is very important in a consideration of the problems of this section of primary industry. The production of coarse grains iu Australia has been reduced year by year. In 1960-61 Australia's production was 3,195,000 tons. The following year it dropped to 2,345,000 tons, and in the last season it has dropped by a further 100,000 tons. I have before me a publication by the Division of Agricultural Economics titled "" The Coarse Grain Situation "", and dated February, 1963. This shows that the problem is not confined to Australia. On page 19 we find the following comment:North American Stocks Reduced Sharply. End-of-season stocks of coarse grains in North America fell from 77.9 m. tons in 1960-61 to 64.0 m. tons in 1961-62. On page 1 of the same publication we findWorld production of the three major coarse grains (maize, barley and oats) is estimated to have increased to 310.6 million tons in 1962 from 307.0 million tons in 1961 . . . World exports of coarse grains in 1961-62 increased by 27 per cent, to a record total of 27.57 million tons compared with 21.56 million tons in The publication also says that in France there was quite a large proportionate increase. I believe that all this evidence, in respect of both wheat and coarse grains, points one way. It shows that the demand is definitely on the increase. Since 1940 world production of wheat alone-excludin g coarse grains entirely-ha s increased from 6,000,000,000 to 8,000,000,000 bushels a year. Production has actually increased by about 2,000,000,000 bushels. When one considers the carry-over of wheat in the United States and Canada one can appreciate that it is not in such huge quantities as some people would have us believe. But let us consider the figures for Australia. The last harvest, which was a record one, amounted to 300,000,000 bushels. If we doubled our production of wheat-and I am not suggesting that we should-wha t would be our proportion of world production? Similarly, if we reduced our acreage or our production, what percentage of world production would be represented by our production? says 5 per cent., but I think he is being pretty optimistic when he gives that figure. However, I submit all this noise about the over-production of wheat is not justified. I would like to mention a matter that I have raised on several occasions. I know it is very easy for honourable members to suggest that the Government should do this or that, but frequently suggestions involve the expenditure of millions of pounds. My suggestion, however, would not involve much expenditure. It relates to a matter",50,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63

145,Mr King,"My colleague from Indiof policy. I refer to income tax. There is no need for me to mention that in recent years the values of incomes have altered. A few years ago, an income of £4,000 was large, but that is not so to-day. The incomes of primary producers vary greatly with seasonal conditions and price fluctuations. Governments over the years have met this situation by using what is called an averaging system. Incomes not exceeding £4,000 are averaged over a period of five years. Incomes over £4,000 are subject to the normal taxation rates. This system has worked quite satisfactorily, because the incomes of primary producers fluctuate from perhaps a loss in one year to huge profits in another year. The limit of £4,000 for averaging incomes to-day they regret having withdrawn. is relatively much smaller than it was a few years ago. I suggest it should be increased to £6,000, £7,000 or even £8,000. Thousands of primary producers would earn to the averaging system, even if a penalty more than £4,000 in one year but have an is imposed upon them. I do not mean a average income over five years of much financial penalty but a penalty that would less than £4,000. The system was modified prevent a primary producer from returning in 1951. I will read from the report of to the averaging system for a number of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, any conclusion as to the period that should which was submitted in June, 1961. Paraelapse; it may be two, three, four or five graph 532 reads as follows:Until 1951, a primary producer's income was returning to the system until a period of taxed at a rate arrived at by reference to the years after his withdrawal had elapsed, he average of his income over five years.

It was rather difficult to determine £4,000 but the average income did, the what the honourable member was driving at. taxable income was to be assessed at the rate applicable to £4,000; (4) If the taxable income and the average Inter-Parliamentary Union of a year ago as income each exceeded £4,000, the taxable income was to be assessed at the having said that prices should be fixed at rate applicable to its own level. Paragraph 533 reads as follows:A taxpayer was also granted the right to elect to withdraw from the "" averaging system"" but, once made, the election was irrevocable. I wish to direct attention to the very important point that a taxpayer could elect to withdraw from the system. Quite a number of primary producers elected to withdraw but now find that they cannot return to the averaging system. This has been unfortunate for some of them. I do not suggest that all those who elected to withdraw now wish to return to the system, but I know of some people who do wish to use the averaging system once again. Some primary producers were encouraged to leave the averaging system because of the high wool prices being paid at the time, and I ask the Government to consider allowing people who have withdrawn to return years after withdrawing. I have not reached years. If a person were prevented from I suggest that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) consider correcting this small anomaly in the next Budget. Some primary producers who withdrew from the averaging listened with some interest to the speech of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Ian Allan) is reported in the bulletin of the levels satisfactory to the producers, even if",52,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63

Allocation 1962-63, £224,600 Total-Allocatio n 1962-63, £424,600; expenditure, 1961-62, £382,445. Now let us look at the Victorian figures. In that State the five to one ratio, as expounded by the honourable member for Richmond, applies. At 30th June, 1961, there were nineteen river improvement or drainage trusts operating with the assistance of government grants of about £175,000 per annum, apparently now on a five-sixths basis. That is where the ratio that was quoted quite frequently came from. There were also grants to councils for minor works from the Rivers and Streams Fund, which comprises mainly licence and permit fees for water diversion, of £40,000 per annum. It seems that since 1959-60, and to some extent before then, the trusts have operated with advances from loan funds, and that they expended a total amount of £198,662 in 1960-61. However, the State at 30th June, 1961, had assumed liability for all but £87,095 of the £1,208,576 advanced by the State to that date. It is interesting to note that during the whole period of operation Victoria spent £1,208,576. It seems that the State may also have assumed some of the trusts' own share of the liability. The State meets interest costs in excess of 3 per cent, on the trusts' own debenture raisings. That information is taken from the Victorian Year Book for 1962, the Auditor-General's Report for 1960-61, the Budget Speech for 1959-60 and the ""River Improvement Handbook"" issued in 1949. That is not the whole story. I gave those figures in order to debunk the misleading statements that have been made in protest against the move that I made in this House to have something done about this matter on a national basis. The point is that this problem is not restricted to the north coast of New South Wales. There are floods on the western plains of that State. There are also floods in the Burdekin River basin, in Queensland, and other river basins in Australia. The situation at present is that a few Expenditure 1961-62. people meet on occasions when disaster hits £ them and many people lose their lives. Then the matter is debated rather hotly in this .. 177,000 chamber and a certain amount of money 45,568 is given to the States on a £1 for £1 basis to help the distressed people. But in no 222,568 way does that help recompense them for what has been lost. The situation is rather ludicrous. We have to face up to this national responsibility. I believe that an organization similar to the Snowy Mountains Authority should be brought into existence. Wc have the brains now. Rather than let them be lost to this country, this important work should be undertaken by the people that we have here, who have the brains and the know-how to do the job. Something should be done to prevent the great damage that can be caused not only to individuals but also to the national economy. We should look at what flood control means. In many instances it means a complicated pattern of construction works such as diversions. In brief, we should reduce and delay run-off by soil conservation and by afforestation; hold the flood water-o r part of the flood-in dams; use levee banks, bank protection, dredging, the straightening of streams and flood by-pass channels; and shift towns and industries to flood-free ground, where possible. That in itself is something that we in Australia should look upon as important. I remember that some years ago Dr. Bradfield submitted to the then Prime Minister, the late Mr Chifley, a scheme for diverting the coastal streams back into the dry areas of the interior. When the question of cost was raised Dr. Bradfield said that it would cost no more than one year of war could cost the country. If we look at this problem from the logical point of view, if we consider it not from the point of view of the immediate future but rather from the viewpoint of long-term development, we must give serious thought to Dr. Bradfield's suggestion. Bradfield's scheme? Bradfield's scheme is far beyond the understanding of the honourable member who has",53,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63

That was the scheme suggested by Dr. Bradfield, and this Government and governments of the future must give earnest consideration to suggestions such as that. We of this side believe that this country must explore every possible avenue of controlling floods which cause so much devastation to the people living in the affected areas. It is all very well to argue that flood control and mitigation are the responsibilities of the States or of the local stooge of the employers and an enemy of authorities. As we all know, this problem is far too big and too complex for any one State or any one body to handle it. Its solucertainly no stooge of the employer.

My rising to-night was prompted by a statement made not so long ago by an honourable member opposite that I was a the trade union movement. I give the lie direct to both those accusations. I am am a stooge at all, then I am a stooge of the one has a greater appreciation of, and no one gives greater support to, the trade union movement than I do, always provided the As honourable members are aware, trade have their genesis in their registration ciliation and Arbitration Act. I repeat that I am speaking now only on the federal level.",55,Department Of Public Works
149,Mr Cockle (Warringah) [9.4],"I take Under the aot to which I have referred weand Arbitration Commission to dispense wage justice and to prescribe just conditions of employment. It is interesting to note the composition of this commission and the functions it is required to perform in giving whatever assistance is necessary in administering our industrial laws. The commission is comprised of a president and five deputy presidents. These gentlemen all have the status of judges. Then there are a senior commissioner and nine commissioners. By the amending legislation of 1956, three conciliators were added to the organization. These are all men of great integrity, who have been selected from the Australian community for their skill in adducing and analysing evidence and in arriving at just decisions based on that evidence. They are tolerant men who have the interests of the community and of the work force of the nation in general very much at heart. The importance of this great system lies in the fact that, as a result of the just and adequate wages and conditions of employment prescribed in the judgments of these skilled and impartial gendemen, price stability in the community is assured, and price stability is of vital importance to Australia as a trading nation. Labour costs must be regulated. We cannot afford an inflationary spiral in labour costs. This must be avoided at all costs if we are to prevent Australians and the Australian nation from being priced out of overseas competition. Therefore, the commission must be capable-and in fact experience has proved it to be so-of making a proper analysis of the national economic factors involved in ensuring a continuance of stability within the ambit of our national development. There is one fundamental feature which always takes my mind back to sport. That is what the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is, in effect-a n umpire. When I look across the chamber-unfortunatel y the Opposition benches are very empty at the momentI see usually a lot of gentlemen who are very closely associated with sport, either in an administrative capacity or as spectators. These honourable gentlemen accept the situation that an umpire is a man of great importance who controls a game. Our system of arbitral control is not much different, surely, from a game of sport. Honourable gentlemen opposite believe there should be an umpire for a game of sport. Why then do they believe there should not be an umpireI say this quite objectively-to determine disputes between employees and employers? We are very fortunate in this country to have such an umpire in the form of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, with all its protective machinery available to trade unions to ensure industrial justice for their members. Why should the community generally be oppressed, badgered and held at ransom by strike action? It has been said by trade unionists that the right to strike is the life blood of unionism. I condemn such a statement as rubbish and humbug, unless it is made in circumstances where men are required to work in dangerous conditions. I would not require any man to work if his physical being were endangered. I ask honourable gentlemen opposite whether there would be strikes under a socialistic government. If the people of Australia were to vote them onto the treasury bench and they introduced their policy of socialization, there would not be strikes then. A socialistic government could not afford to have strikes. After all, honourable gentlemen opposite believe in the regimentation of labour. They believe that labour should be directed to where it is required by the State and that employees should not be free to choose what type of job they will do, where they will do it and at what times they will do it. makers? man opposite who has so rudely interrupted me will find that there are no strikes in Russia. As a matter of fact, he will find that there are no strikes behind the iron curtain. Why is that so? It is because the labour forces there are regimented and are ruled by fear. The system of conciliation and arbitration is the law of this land. I say, without fear of contradiction by people who really think, that strikes are barbaric. The strike is a weapon of intimidation against industrial tribunals, against law and order, against employers, and against the community generally. It is an economic bludgeon used to enforce a demand in circumstances where those who make the demand know that it is not justified.",56,Department Of Public Works
150,Mr Curtin,Did you refer to the boiler,57,Department Of Public Works
151,Mr Cockle,"The honourable gentleIt is very significant, Mr Deputy Speaker, that unions which are militant come before the industrial tribunals, but at a point of time after they have indulged in their little acts of intimidation, using the strike weapon. That is most significant. I am going to quote a well-known authority, the late Mr justice Higgins. Some years ago he saidThe logic of compulsory arbitration is to disreported. Most noticeable and perhaps place the rude and barbarous process of the strike very significant is the fact that the number by the orderly and just procedure of the lawthere is no room for bolh.

Each party being and, in an emergency, in our defence concerned must be prepared to accept the decialso. sion and loyally abide by it whether it is wholly in its favour or not. Any organization of employers or employees which fails in this duty to strikes and their effect on the community, commits a most serious industrial offence and one which it is impossible for this tribunal lo I now ask where the Opposition stands in overlook. Those pronouncements by two eminent in strikes. The honourable members for judges condemn strikes in unequivocal Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), East language. What those two eminent gentleSydney( Mr Ward), Kingsford-Smith( Mr men of the law had to say years ago holds Curtin) and Parkes( Mr Haylen) have made good to-day. I am concerned, as all reasonable people action. If they make it clear by their facial must be concerned, at the continuance of expressions that my assertion that they bestrikes in Australia when we have available lieve in strike action is not correct, they all the machinery necessary to adjudicate are being completely hypocritical. Not one on men's claims and to effect proper judghonorable member on the Opposition ments on those claims. When one looks benches-whe n we have heard of a very at the monthly bulletin of employment damaging strike-ha s at any time said anystatistics, No. 254 of January, 1963, one thing except in support of that action and sees on page 24 a statement which sets out to the effect that the employer is doing the for a period of years the number of stopwrong thing-sweatin g labour and doing pages in each year, the workers directly or all the other things that the employers have indirectly involved, the working days lost been accused of doing over the years. and the estimated loss in wages.

In do was to exhort the striking union to take 1962 the number of stoppages had the proper process of law and go before increased to 1,183, involving a total of the court-competen t advocates are avail330,823 men. It is also interesting to note able-and put forward a case and have its that in the period between 1961 and 1962 grievances properly adjudicated upon. Noi manufacturing stoppages increased from Tteir attitude is: "" Go on strike. Harass 270 to 598 and that such stoppages accounted for 42 per cent, of the number of strikes which took place in 1962. It is of further interest to note that the coal-mining industry accounted for 25 per cent, of the strikes and the stevedoring industry for 15 per cent. Unfortunately, in both the coal-mining and the stevedoring industries increased strike activity was of unions involved in strike action is relatively small, but in looking at the character of approximately 4,000,000 men in 1962, Having traversed a certain area relating respect of strike action. I know honourable members opposite will say they believe it abundantly clear that they support strike the community. Make sure you harass the employer and do everything you can to damage the economy."" When you look at the Opposition benches and think that by some mischance members opposite could come over to this side of the House, you realize that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) is a Queen's Counsel and that some of his colleagues are members of the legal fraternity yet they do not support the conciliaTreasury and the Department of Trade, tion and arbitration system. They support strikes, as against that system. What a remarkable state of affairs we would have if the people suddenly felt that the Labour Party should become the government! We would then have in the Ministry men who would not be prepared to take action, in accordance with their own legislation, to ensure that militant trade unions were kept in step, as they should be required to be, in conformity with that legislation. I ask the honourable gentlemen opposite: Do they not believe in conciliation and arbitration? I know that I have walked in circlesI am not saying I was walking around in circles; I refer to trade union circleswhere I have been told to my face, ""We do not believe in the arbitration system "". That belief is expressed by a certain type of gentleman-perhap s I should not call him a gentleman, but a certain type of man -wh o does not believe in law and order in any case. Yet honourable members opposite support this kind of man, who does not believe in law and order or in our system of achieving a proper way of life. 1 ask honourable members opposite: Are you too frightened to stand up in your places and say, in effect, that strikes and the militancy of trade unions are the right objectives of a sound, wise and properly ccnducted government? Surely they cannot agree to such a proposition, but must agree that the settlement of industrial grievances by the proper processes of conciliation and arbitration, which this side of the House stands for, is in the interests of our community, our high standard of living and the integrity and welfare of our nation as a whole. The honourable member for Kingsford Smith, in an interjection, said to me, "" Put a bit of ginger into it"". How can one do that when honourable members opposite sit dumb in their places and say nothing because the 36 men have not directed them what to say? We on this side of the House are not puppets like the 60 honourable members opposite, who sit dumb when the question of industrial anarchy is mentioned. And strikes are just that! measures now before us, Sir, provide for £500,000 for the Department of the between them. Those departments are pursuing policies detrimental to the best interests of this country. They are carrying out policies which, if indulged in for any length of time, will bring about national disaster. Therefore I cannot possibly'favour providing those departments with any further supply at all, much less half a million pounds. I have here a directory issued by the Australian Department of Trade in 1962, showing United States of America investment in Australia. It sets out over 1,000 firms in whioh such investment has taken place. It is obviously a directory for circulation in America to attract further capital to this country. The directory includes, among the firms controlled by Americans, those engaged in making men's and women's clothing, shoes, sausage casings, greeting cards, vodka, processed foods, toothpastes and light machinery. Much of the American capital in Australia at present has been used to purchase industries already established and operating successfully. Some of the capital created firms to compete with Australian firms that were already expanding and adequate to meet local requirements. In addition, a bigger and bigger proportion of Australian mineral, oil, pastoral, chemical, transportation, constructional and other basic industries is passing into the control of overseas investors. The introduction to the directory readsThe Australian Government welcomes oversea investment particularly where it is of a kind likely to help in the balanced development of Australia's resources and where it brings with it the skills and techniques needed for the successful fulfilment of the project for which the investment is made. There are no restrictions on the remittance of capital funds to Australia except that residents must obtain exchange approval before borrowing overseas currency or incurring a liability to a nonsterling area resident.",57,Department Of Public Works

We of the Labour Party are opposed, however, to something which probably no other country in the civilized world permits-the unrestricted inflow of capital. We are opposed to statements that dividends will be freely remitted, no matter how great they may be, and that capital may be repatriated no matter how sudden the demand for its repatriation may be. We suggest that Australia should learn from what has happened to other countr.es. I propose to quote some remarks by Mr heeded our words. In fact, Government Robin M. Corrie, a member of the Brisbane Stock Exchange. He is not a Labour supporter. He has adverted to the dangers created by this inflow of foreign capital. He has referred to the necessity to pay overseas increasing amounts by way of dividends. He has referred to the danger that at any time that capital source overseas may be reduced or may dry up altogether. If that happened we would be plunged immediately into the disasters which have been kept away from us only by the selling of our heritage bit by bit to overseas interests. Mr Corrie statesThe example of Canada should be heeded as a warning. How was it that thc prosperous Canada of the 1940's and early 1950's with its dollar standing at a premium to the United States dollar for the first time in history and subsequently blessed with a fully integrated oil industry encountered unemployment levels of 14 per cent, in 1961, is still faced with 8 per cent, unemployment and now has its dollar at a discount? He points out that this was due to the fact that American capital flowing into Canada took control of Canadian industry, particularly oil refining and distribution and the industries dependent upon oil. Canada then became subject to the economic decisions of the organizations in the United States which controlled industries in Canada. The economic depression in Canada is a result of the inactivity of the Canadian Government and the Canadian people when all kinds of United States capital was pouring into Canada. In the same way, Australia could be faced with immediate considerable unemployment if there were a reduction by £100,000,000 or £200,000,000 annually of the capital which is flowing into Australia from nations overseas. There was an immediate danger of that occurring when Great Britain contemplated joining the European Common Market. Had she joined then, not only her trade but also her financial investments would have been directed towards European industrial activities rather than towards members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Within a short time we would have been confronted with overwhelming economic disabilities. The present difficulties which face us are being created by the Government. We of the Labour Party have been pointing this out for years but the Government has not supporters, including the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), have ridiculed the idea that any type of overseas investment could be prejudicial to Australia's best economic interests. This was the attitude adopted by is evidenced by the introduction to the ""Directory of United States Investment"" which was written by officers of his department in 1962. The introduction states clearly that Australia welcomes any kind of capital from other countries. This year, however, the Minister changed his attitude. When addressing the Country Party conference he saidThere has been an increasing tendency for capital to flow into Australia, not to establish some new and highly complicated technical activity but to come in to buy out an existing Australian flour mill or an Australian dairy factory. That, of course, is not for Australia's benefit. The Minister went onIf we earn enough annual income we can live comfortably. If we don't we could still live comfortably by selling a bit of the farm every year, and that is very much the Australian situation-w e are not earning enough and we are selling a bit of our heritage every year. I am not satisfied, and we in the Country Party will not be satisfied until this is no longer a necessity. Those are not my words. They are the words of the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. It would not have become necessary for us to sell a bit of our heritage every year had the Government directed its policies in the right way. Overseas investors never should have been allowed to buy Australian industries which were being managed successfully by Australians. However, that has been allowed, and the profits of those companies are now going",59,Department Of Public Works

The propositions which I am putting before the House are not of a socialistic nature and they are not propositions which should have any particular party emphasis or which should be violently supported only by the workers of this country. Of course, the workers should support them. They should say: ""We do not want our resources and labour to be exploited unnecessarily by overseas capitalists. We desire them to be used in this country by our own people, in the interests of our own nation."" Not only the workers, but also the industrialists, whether they are engaged in secondary or primary industry, have a stake in defending our industries against foreign investors. industrialists have an interest to see that our lands are not sold bit by bit to overseas interests so that eventually those overas being of the greatest possible interest. I seas interests will dominate us. I have pointed out that the vast majority of other countries-populou s nations like India, small nations like Haiti, developed nations like Japan and Belgium-hav e laws and treaties designed to protect themselves from being peacefully absorbed by the process of purchase by overseas exploiters. But this Government has taken no such action, although it is presumed to act in the nation's interests. I have mentioned the vast amount of investment which is flowing into Australia. At present there is over £2,000,000,000 of overseas investment here without taking overseas loans into account. It is no exaggeration to say that there will be another £1,000,000,000 of overseas capital invested here within the next three years. That is well within the bounds of reason. This will mean a total of £3,000,000,000 of overseas capital invested in £300,000,000 worth of our commodities will have to go overseas each year to pay dividends alone, and nearly another £100,000,000 worth will have to go abroad to meet interest and to repay capital on more than £800,000,000 of loans that we have borrowed overseas. Furthermore, we have to pay more than £100,000,000 a year in freight, insurance and other charges on the goods that leave our shores. These costs total gigantic sums, and they have to be met out of the proceeds of about £900,000,000 a year from our entire exports, with little chance in the foreseeable future of increasing our export income by any considerable amount. Does not this situation spell disaster? Of course it doss! As I see the smile on the face of the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), who is now at the table, and the lackadaisical attitudes of members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Country Party, I feel acutely the truth of the words of Henry Lawson, who wrote that the warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse. I wish to direct attention, as vigorously and as keenly as I can, to a matter that in my opinion is of supreme national importance. It was of supreme national importance in Canada and was the Both workers and issue that led to the destruction of the Diefenbaker Government there. This matter has been regarded in other countries believe that the sentiments that I have expressed this evening should appeal to the self-interest not merely of a section of the Australian people but of all Australians who wish to promote development in this country in time of peace and who wish to make Australia secure in time of war. Thc first essential of adequate defence and satisfactory development is to ensure that control over the industrial resources and manpower of this country shall be in the hands of the Australian people, who ought to exercise effective control through the government of the day. Deputy Speaker, in the bills that we are now discussing provision is made for expenditure by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, and I take this opportunity to direct attention to the demand for the extension Australia. As a consequence, of television facilities in country areas. In so doing, I am not unaware of the nature of the recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Television which was appointed in 1953 and which suggested that this medium be adopted in stages, determined largely on the basis of population. I am aware, too, that the Government has",61,Department Of Public Works
154,Mr Mcnfjll (Canning) [9.54],"Mrdeveloped the television service in line with these recommendations. Stage1 embraced Sydney and Melbourne by providing for a national and a commercial station in each of those cities. These stations began telecasting in 1956 and 1957. The service developed progressively into stage 2, which extended television to the other State capital cities. However, the medium did not become available to viewers in country districts until stage 3, under which television was extended to thirteen country centres. As a Western Australian, [ notedI may say with some disappointment-that the selected centres did not include any in my State. So, in general terms, country viewers in that State will have to wait until phase 4 of the programme has been virtually completed, and this will not be for some time yet. Only then will they be able to take advantage of a form of entertainment that has been generally available to the greater part of the Australian population for some time. What does stage 4 of the television development programme envisage? It is expected to be completed, 1 understand, in 1966 or 1967. What does it provide for in Western Australia? Initially, it provides for one additional metropolitan commercial station. It provides also for a national and a commercial station in each of three selected country areas-first , the Lower South-West, to be served by a station located near Bunbury; secondly, the Southern Agricultural Area, to be served possiblyI emphasize the word "" possibly""-by a station situated near Mount Barker, some miles north of Albany; and thirdly, the Central Agricultural Area, to be served oy a station possibly to be located near York at a point known as Needling Hill. There were, however, some complications. One of these was the fact that, when applications were called for the allocation of commercial licences in these three country areas, the Bunbury area was the only one of the three for which an application was received. The Postmaster-General( Mr of the selection of certain centres but rather Davidson) has made it clear that this fact will in no way prejudice the establishment of the national stations in these three areas. He intimated, in reply to a question that I asked on 3rd April last year, that further investigations were being undertaken by departmental officers in an effort to find sites for these national stations that would give the most effective coverage. Needless to say, people in these country districts have been very much concerned about the selection of sites, because it appeared that in at least two instances transmissions from the stations proposed at Bunbury, Mount Barker and Needling Hill would overlap existing services in the Perth metropolitan area. Against this situation, I believe, one cannot argue with very much force, possibly for several reasons and certainly for one reason at least: It is the intention of the Postmaster-General, the department and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to provide a good service in which the standard of reception shall be at least the equal of that obtained in more densely settled districts and large communities. In addition, it seems apparent that in two of the possible situations, if we accept the viewing area for good reception to be one with a radius of about 60 miles, subject to the influence of topographical features, that a large part of the good viewing area will extend seawards and much of the viewing potential will be wasted. What may appear to be a rather more serious consequence of the use of the three sites that will possibly be chosen is that in all probability an area between them and an area extending eastwards and northwards would not be given an adequate service. As a consequence, also, it would be doubtful whether the capital work involved in the provision of another station would be justified to provide for the area which would be thus left out. It is realized that the total area of the districts involved is far greater than can be covered adequately by two, or possibly even three, stations, as it comprises something like 300 miles square-and this does not include such towns as Kalgoorlie and Geraldton. It is for these reasons that the people of the farming areas feel that development of the service should take place not on the basis on the basis of a progressive covering of the country. I am very pleased to note that other sites have been explored by the department. These include selected peaks in the Stirling Ranges which, if they had been found satisfactory, would have extended the viewing area a considerable distance eastwards and northwards into the sparser farming areas, particularly on the eastern side. However, I am given to understand that access and road construction costs alone to these peaks could exceed £400,000, and they were therefore ruled out-o r presumably this was the reason why they were ruled out. This, naturally, is a matter of some regret to all the people in the vicinity, because the areas that would have been so served are those which, in my opinion, because of the lack of communications and general public amenities, are really most in need. The Postmaster-General has also said that for the central areas a point further east than Needling Hill, perhaps as far as Kellerberrin, would have been more satisfactory, because coverage could then have been provided for north-eastern districts, including such towns as Merredin, and parts of the Yilgarn. Unfortunately, however, it seems that no suitable topographical feature can be found to satisfy the requirements in that territory. Out of the many discussions that have taken place throughout the districts it does appear that there may not be sufficient knowledge of the topography-perhap s because of the inadequacy of detailed mapping of that part of Western Australia-withou t which the most suitable location of possible stations cannot be determined. Considerations of the kind I have mentioned led the council of the town of Narrogin, which is a major town of the Great Southern district, and which would have been outside the 60-miIes viewing area of one of these stations, to convene a meeting of all interested shires to discuss the quesstaff of the Postmaster-General's Departtion. This meeting was held last Saturday at Narrogin, and it is indicative of the interest taken in the matter that sixteen shires, with a total population of 46,000, were directly represented. In addition, the Great Southern Shires Association, with a membership of 27 shires, was represented by delegates and, finally, authorized representais no great opportunity for their adoption tives of the Great Eastern ward of fifteen shires, were also present and taking part in the discussions. Considerable appreciation was expressed of the fact that the Director of Technical Services of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Mr MacDonald, was present at the request of the Postmaster-General and was able to fill in a few gaps in the knowledge and information of those present. I believe Mr MacDonald was most impressed with the arguments put forward by the delegates, and I think it is not inappropriate to state that a resolution was passed unanimously in the following terms:Taking into consideration the projected T.V. policy outlined by the Postmaster-General for WA., this meeting of delegates from the Central Great Southern strongly recommends the authorities to give urgent consideration to the establishment of a T.V. station in the Central Great Southern somewhat on the lines of that put forward by the Wagin Shire Council, particularly in view of the statistics supplied by that authority, and the fact that under the present proposals the Central Great Southern and Eastern Districts will not have a satisfactory service. I may add that the Wagin shire has undertaken considerable work in the preparation of plans and proposals for an alternate site for the location of these stations, and I may add that these plans and proposals have been receiving consideration by the Postmaster-General's Department and by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. This resolution was supported by the meeting. It is not claimed that this is the answer to the question of the determination of the television site, but it is surely something that merits a good deal of investigation. I do not wish to go on at great length on this subject, and I close by saying that I hope that the resolution passed at the meeting to which I have referred will be accepted in all seriousness as a true representative opinion of the districts concerned, and that no stone will remain unturned by the Broadcasting Control Board and the ment to locate sites which will adequately provide for the needs of the areas involved, particularly those at present so poorly served with alternative amenities. I have made no mention of the use of translators, and I feel that perhaps there in general terms over such wide areas. I accept the advice of the department and its technical staff that these translator stations at this stage may best be used for filling in certain pockets which are not adequately served by existing services. In submitting people. On the contrary, we are told that this -esolution and in giving some enlargethis is a land of great prosperity, that we ment of the views of the councils and people have the shortest working week and the concerned I believe that this question of highest living standards.

What can side in relation to the spending of many we do about their situation? millions of pounds and to the picture created bere of an abiding prosperity in the country, which is only half the picture, although it Menzies Government is that it is too smug, is maliciously and persistently canvassed as too self-satisfied, too senile, and too softened a condition of prosperity created by this by its long term of office to care about Government in the years it has been in what happens to the workless, the homeless office. To-night I would like to talk in a truthful not speak about these people. The subject way about the economy of this country and is not refined enough, and nothing can be to show honourable members the two sides said or done about them. The Government of the picture, not only the glamorous wants to forget them, for the poor are televised and built-up picture of an aboundalways with us. Let us examine the attitude ing prosperity but also the picture repreof Ministers when they are pressed to deal sented by the invisible people who are with questions about the unemployed, the suffering-the unemployed who number homeless and the pensioners. I have 90,000 or so, the homeless to the tune of gathered a few examples. They are not 100,000, and the pensioners who live on verbatim, but in the main they give the nothing but their pensions, whose numbers views of the Ministers. The idea is not are uncounted but whose tragedy is very to answer a question but to pat it down the great indeed. In no picture presented by wicket as their leader does. If they are in the Government or any of its protagonists, the first eleven, they think they are playing from the Prime Minister( Sir Robert the gentle game of cricket on a soft wicket Menzies) to the ordinary back-bencher, do and they pat the questions back. They never you see this portrayed, although all the answer the demands made by honourable economists have noted this trend all over members on this side of the House to tell us tbe world, a trend which is only too what is happening on these vital and urgent apparent in Australia.

The trouble is that although he Government cannot get them homes, and will let you look at the financial machine, among the pensioners who are living on a he will never show you how it is supposed pittance.

The Government working and why it is unable to provide has never given any indication that it feels for the needs of the workless, the homeless any twinge of conscience about these and the pensioners. go? Is there another side of the picture? The first charge we make against the or the pensioners. The Government does What does the Treasurer ( Mr Harold",62,Department Of Public Works
155,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [10.8],"Some What of all the good Australians who doWe find the same trouble with unemployment. When the Minister for Labour and barded with questions from this side of the House, what happens? The Minister is fascinated with his political yo-yo. He sees the figures going up and down daily, but he can never tell us whether they are going up or down until some statistician provides him with the answer. This does not help the unemployed, 90,000 of whom are waiting for a chance. The Minister looks at his political yo-yo, but he does not know where it is going. That may sound humorous, but the way the Minister deals with questions is tragic. Let us look at pensions. I am glad the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) is here. I know him to be a humane and very kindly man, but he stands like a black dog in front of the Treasurer's millions. He says that there can be no pension increases until the next Budget is fixed, and he cannot be shifted one way or the other. That should not happen. Consideration should be given to increasing pension rates as the need arises. Increases should be given in supplementary budgets or in the Supply Bill. Pensioners are the most vulnerable group in the community but they receive scant attention from the Governsioners have been brought to this state by ment.

They are forgotten. We have or, better still, let us build a nuclear base, the culture of poverty, and this is the other This will keep our minds off the people who side of our prosperity. That is the live across the tracks-the people who, in charge we make against the Government in this stage of prosperity, are the forgotten this debate. men and women of Australia, the invisible poor.""

The problems of the poor do not show up on the screens of prosperity. They are not seen on television programmes. They do not appear in the statistics. We do not see the poor in the streets of our cities, because they do not have the fare to get into town. We do not see the homeless wearing sandwich boards bearing notices to quit, eviction orders or their priorities with the Housing Commission. They keep their troubles to themselves. We do not see the pensioners in numbers because they are old and sick. But they exist, and the statistics prove that they exist. They are living on short commons. They do not parade their misery and hopelessness, but we can see them cn seats in the parks-homeless , aged and finished-and we can see them on transport benches waiting for the bus that never comes. They wait for the good times that they are entitled to expect as citizens of Australia. But this does not matter to the Government. The Government creates a false image of prosperity. It subsists on this false image, hoping to gull the public. However, there will be an election soon and I hope that the people then will listen and understand that there is another picture besides the picture of abounding prosperity falsely portrayed by the Government.

I have mentioned these honourable members because they come from industrial areas. frieud, the honourable member for Hunter so rightly says, I should mention the coal-fields. Here we have the complete decay of a whole industry because of the stupid attitude of a Government which has built up coal-mining but has ignored the workers. Men have been turned out from their homes after almost a lifetime of work in the coal industry simply because this was economically better for the big boss. Automation, mechanization and a ruthless playing with the souls, hearts and bodies of men have created a shambles in our northern coal-fields, though the potential of these fields is as great as that of any coal field in the world. strengthens the picture I have painted.

After twelve or fourteen badgered and beggared into this statistical years-it seems an interminable time to me nightmare. The answer is in making more -the Menzies Government does not have money available along the simple lines prothe answer. Let us take the question of unemployat the last federal election.

His plan was pooh-poohed by the economists of the right wing. It was laughed at by the Prime Minister. It was prated about by his little stooges all over the country, and he convinced some people. But immediately his Government crept into office again by one solitary seat, he stole the policy of the Leader of the Opposition to assist the unemployed by creating jobs and services, by paying extra pensions and by examining the whole slackness of the economy at the grass roots. The Menzies Government stole this policy holus bolus and services by paying extra pensions and by it has thrived. That is the sort of thing one expects from the Menzies Government. We feel that we have the answer to unemployment, although the solving of the problem has been botched by incompetent operators on the other side of the House. With the proper wit and the will to do these things, whicli lie with the Labour Party, unemployment could be well on the way to This certainly solution. We hear horrible slogans. It used to be pounded by Labour's leader in our policy",66,Department Of Public Works
157,Mr James,What about the coal-fields?,67,Department Of Public Works
158,Mr Haylen,"Of course, as mypaying doles that only keep body and soul together, regardless of the need to develop our economy -mother s with kiddies in prams, worried, The Labour Party is quite certain, because it has been proved by those inexpert people opposite, that by applying the formula given out at the last election we can defeat unemployment. This is not an overburdening, intolerable problem. Once we start to break the soft edges we can get to the so-called hard core and break it down. To those persons who have been collecting outside employment offices but should have been on pensions, we can apply our social services provisions. We must do that. Any government that does not know that the first essential is to keep its people employed and its pioneer aged and sick in comfortable circumstances is not doing its job for Australia. The Calwell policy had a powerful thrust to it. Can anybody say that in the many years we have been in opposition anything that the Menzies Government has done has had thrust to it? The Government has been running down hill, following old-fashioned formulas on foreign affairs, development, employment and everything else. It has followed the worn-out formula of laisserfaire, the old-fashioned, worn out, scabby capitalism, that ought to be done away with if we are to do the right thing by the Australian people who are asking us to do it. We must break through for them, because they cannot break through for themselves-the invisible poor, the invisible homeless, who have been crushed out of the news; nobody wants to hear about them. I am reminded of the remarks of the lamented Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. At the time of the revolution, when someone came to her and said, "" Madame, the poor have no bread "", she replied, "" Well, let them eat cake "". That is what the Menzies Government is attempting to say. It is buttering up the boys who have plenty of butter, doing nothing about the basic problems on which we are challenging it to-night. Housing is a problem that is a heartbreak. Every Federal member and every State member is bent every day upon doing something about this. The primary reason for its existence, of course, is that money in sufficient quantities does not go to the housing authorities of the various States. Otherwise, why would the people queue up neurotic, almost psychopathic-hauntin g us into doing something for them in relation to housing? If something was not wrong with the financial arrangements, we could get on with the job. All over the world, people are considering this problem. The Labour answer to it is lower interest rates, loans to young people to allow them to build and, above all, homes for rental. It is of no use to say, "" Let them all buy houses "", because a very wide section of the community just cannot afford the necessary deposit. Let us face it. We must provide good homes for rental at a reasonable price, which we are not able to do, because of the pressure for loan money, high interest rates, and the indifference of Ministers of this Government. The honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor), who was away overseas on a mission, brought back to me from West Germany details of a housing plan for young married people, which is in accordance with Labour policy. Houses for rental are a matter of urgency there, as well as here. The amount of loan provided is 2,000 marks, repayable at 2 per cent. In West Germany the payment of a bonus to get into a rented house appears to be acceptable. One may accept this money as a rental bonus or use it as a deposit when buying a home on terms. This arrangement is supplementary to an extremely wide housing plan that is part of the policy of the West German Government. I do not believe in high density housing as passionately as some people do. I have watched the trek of the poor from one place to another. We clear a slum, build a beautiful block of flats, charge £6 a week for the flats, and the slum dweller, who has lost the place where he used to live, has not enough money to live in the flats the Government has provided, so he goes somewhere else. He is part of the invisible poor. We are only pushing the problem back into the darkness. We must come out with it. High density housing has a usefulness, but we must find money at the very lowest rate of interest, sufficient only to meet the administrative cost of handling the moneyl i per cent, to 2 per cent -and do something about the problem. Otherwise, we are botching the job. The people are sick and tired of this and want the Government to do something about it. There is a whole series of agonizing people have had the brush-off from that dramas about what happens to people who gentleman long since. are homeless. Every member who meets his constituents, that is, every one on this side, knows how tragic the story is. From all in favour of the means test. I , like all the other side, we get the mechanical honourable members on both sides of the answer from the mechanical Treasurer House, am very disturbed because the with his mechanical poker machine, value has gone out of money and the and it all adds up to nothing if pensioners are in deep trouble. The means we have not enough money to build test, as operated by the Government to-day, houses and provide for the honest is lopsided. Let us be frank about these needs of the Australian people. I believe matters.

I know that the Government's answer on agree with that idea. I say, "" Good luck housing is the answer of the developer, to them "". I help them, and so do other who takes a cheap block of land and turns honourable members. it into an expensive block. It is the answer of the insurance companies and the banks, which are building sky-scrapers all over another man: ""Be careful, Jack.

Mr Ward asked the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice1. To what extent must an ex-serviceman be Incapacitated from accepted war-caused disabilities to be deemed eligible for a 100 per cent, war pension? 2. Why is an ex-serviceman in receipt of a 100 per cent, war pension, who is deemed to be unfit for any class of employment, not granted the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen's pension? able member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. An ex-serviceman whose accepted 7. Widowed Incapacity is total and permanent, i.e., who is incapacitated for life to such an extent as to be precluded from earning more than a negligible percentage of a living wage, is granted the special (T.P.I.) rate war pension, as is a war-blinded ex-serviceman. Where he is incapacitated to the same degree, but not for life, he may be paid the equivalent amount for an appropriate period as temporarily totally incapacitated. In the case of incapacity from certain specified disabiUties the act provides (vide section 37 and the Fourth Schedule) for pension to be paid at a specified percentage of the full general (100 per cent.) rate, and additional amounts are paid under the Fifth Schedule in respect of amputations of the limbs and partial loss of vision. In other cases, tbe rate of pension is assessed according to the nature and extent of the incapacity at an appropriate percentage ranging from 10 per cent, to 100 per cent, of the general rate. Within the above statutory principles, pensions are paid at amounts determined by the independent determining authorities established under the act for that purpose. Mr Beaton asked the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice1.

The Commonwealth and most State public services do fix maximum ages for many appointments to their permanent staffs. Semi-government authorities often follow the broad principles of Ihe Public Service Act of the particular government under whose authority they have been consti*uted, but this is not true of all semi-govcrnmem authorities in Australia, nor do those which follow the broad principles adopt all the provisions of the various acts.

Australia was a party to the Disarmament Statement made by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers at tl.eir meeting in London on 17th March, 1961, which included the following paragraph:Every effort should be made to secure rapid agreement to the permanent banning of nuclear weapons tests by all nations and to arrangements for verifying the observance of the agreement. Such an agreement is urgent, since otherwise further countries may soon become nuclear powers, which would increase the danger of war and further complicate the problem of disarmament.

In spite of the efforts of the Western powers, the Soviet Union has continued to frustrate the securing of such an agreement, and therefore retains the right to make such tests itself. 4. I was informed by the French Government, during my recent visit to Paris, that a decision would be taken before the end of the year on the choice of a site to be reserved for French nuclear tests in the Pacific region. I was informed that even when a decision is taken a considerable period will elapse before a test can actually be conducted at tl.e site. 5. The French Government has undertaken to inform us at the appropriate time of the safeguards which will be taken against any fallout hazards and if necessary to discuss these precautions with us. 6. Having the impression that the French Government's decision might well be taken in the fairly near future, I expressed deep regret at any such decision and our strong preference for a test ban treaty, and repeated the views expressed by the Prime Ministers in tbe passage quoted above. 1960-« State of Shipment Volume *000 tons New South Wales. .

166,Mr Adermann,"The answer to the honorable member's questions are as follows:1. Of a growers' estimate of approximately 600 tons of tobacco leaf produced this year for sale at Brandon, only 68 tons have been offered. Thirty-one and a half tons have been sold at an average price of 107d. per lb. Sales have been suspended at Brandon and the remaining leaf from that centre will be offered at Mareeba. 2.

The Government's policy is to provide a market related to Australian demand and a satisfactory price to growers for Australian leaf of a quality acceptable to Australian smokers. To tbe extent that Australian leaf of this quality is not available, it is not unreasonable that imported leaf should be used to meet overall requirements of manufacturers. 7. The Government has indicated through my colleague, the Minister for Customs and Excise, in his recent announcement on percentage usage rates, thai' it wiU closely watch the result of leaf sales and if the objectives of the percentage usage arrangements are not being achieved, then the situation will be reviewed. Primary Production. Mr Ward asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice1.

What embargo on the operation of charter or local joy flights does the Department of Civil honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. There are presently 51 cities and towns in Australia served by 61 aero clubs and flying schools licensed by the Department of Civil Aviation to train people through to private pilot / licence and/or commercial pilot licence standard.",75,Exports Of Wheat To Mainland China
169,Mr Fairbairn,"The answers to theThese 51 cities and towns are spread over the Australian mainland, Tasmania and Papua-New Guinea, and range in size from cities, such as Sydney with its 2,250,000 people, to the smaller towns such as Keith, in South Australia (population 1,100) and Walgett, in New South Wales (population 1,700). In addition, many clubs and schools train at away from home base centres. For example, in New South Wales 27 organizations offer training at a total of 62 centres. In Queensland one club, Darling Downs, centred on Toowoomba, trains at fifteen other country centres. 3. In mid-1961 the Government extended for a further four-year period, to 30th June, 1965, the subsidies paid to the flying training organizations. Over this four-year period £637,000 has been allocated for these purposes. Full details are set out at page 52 of the 1961 report to Parliament by the Minister for Civil Aviation. 4. Subsidy is payable to aero clubs and flying schools on the basis of the number of hours flown on specified classes of flying training operations and also on the number of licences-private , commercial and instructor rating (some within appropriate age groups) gained. In general terms, and within the limits which the Government has placed on this type of assistance, clubs and schools are now receiving from the Government an average of some 9s. to 10s. for each "" subsidized "" hour flown, and some £30, £45 and £15 for each "" subsidized"" private pilot licence, commercial pilot licence and initial instructor rating, respectively. 5. Before being entitled to a subsidy a club must obtain a flying school licence from the Department of Civil Aviation. It must also have been registered under the appropriate State legislation as a non-profit organization, and it must bave entered into an agreement with the CommonweaUh covering the terms and conditions under which subsidy is payable. In certain cases a club may be required to operate without subsidy for a period up to twelve months to demonstrate, firstly, that the club is suitably controlled and managed and, secondly, that there is an established need for a flying training organization in the particular area. As mentioned above in answer to question 3, the present arrangements will continue to 30th June, 1965, at which time the Government will review the whole question of assistance to flying training organizations. 6. The conditions are those laid down in Part VI. of Air Navigation Regulations, ih force under the Air Navigation Act 1920-1962. 7. Only the holder of a commercial pilot licence flying an aircraft on behalf of the holder of a charter licence is permitted to engage in charter operations or receive profit or a reward for local joy flights. The holder of a private pilot licence is not permitted to engage in charter operations, nor can he engage in joyflightsfor hire or reward. Disposal of Ships. . Mr Reynolds asked the Minister for Supply, upon noticeWho was the successful tenderer and what was ' the tendered price for each of the recently disposed of vessels ""Warramunga"", ""Quadrant"", ""Fitzroy"", ""Derwent"" and ""Loddon""? able member's question is as follows:The two ships first mentioned were surplus naval vessels. They were sold by my department after the invitation of competitive public tenders in Australia and overseas and both vessels were sold to the highest tenderer, Kinoshita and Company Limited, Sydney. Most buyers of surplus Commonwealth property require that the prices offered shall be kept confidential and this is also in the interests of the Commonwealth in securing under public tenders the most favourable prices obtainable. For these reasons I am unable to disclose the prices accepted for ""Warramunga"" and ""Quadrant "". A large number of satisfactorily competitive tenders was received for each of these vessels however and the prices accepted were favourable on world price levels. The three ""River"" class vessels were formerly owned by the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission and I have ascertained from my colleague the Minister for Shipping and Transport that these vessels were sold on a normal commercial basis by brokers appointed by the commission. There was no occasion for any restriction upon the disclosure of information in the esse of thess vessels and details of their sale were as follows:"" River Derwent"" -This vessel was sold in January, 1959, to Interstate Steamships Proprietary Limited, 19 Bridge-street, Sydney, for the sum of £375,000 (Aust.). "" River Fitzroy"" and "" River Loddon"" These vessels together with a third ship ""River Murrumbidgee"", were sold in November, 1962, to Mitsubishi (Australia) Proprietary Limited, 543 Little Collins-street, Melbourne. The three vessels were offered for sale collectively and separate prices were not obtained for each. The total price accepted for the three vessels was £132,000 sterling. Taxation. Mr Ward asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. What percentage of the total receipts from taxation in the year 1948-49 was obtained by (a) direct and (b) indirect taxation? 2. What is the percentage in each instance for the latest year for whichfiguresare available? Mr Harold HoM -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1.

Among those which remain taxable the most important are cakes, pastry, scones, buns, biscuits (other than milk arrowroot biscuits and baby rice biscuits), ice cream, imported canned fish, jelly crystals, custard powders, junket tablets, spices, curry powder, pepper and salt. The rate of tax applicable to these taxable goods is 12i per cent. Mr Webb asked the Treasurer, upon notice1.

If money has already been expended, in Indirect what manner was it spent, and how will any Percentage Percentage future contributions be spent? of Total Taxation. Sir Robert Menzies -The answer to the honourable member's questions is as Per cent. follows: 64.5 35.5 1 to 3. The Commonwealth Government has agreed to provide certain assistance to Mr Donald Campbell in connection with his attempt at the world land speed record on Lake Eyre. This assistance will be mainly in the form of the loan of Commonwealth facilities and the provision of some services. The Commonwealth has agreed to install certain communications facilities, to provide ambulance, fire-fighting and certain other (largely services') equipment, and to carry free or at concessional rates the test car and associated equipment and spares over the Central Australian Railway. Service personnel will also be available to provide search and rescue services, if needed. The Commonwealth is not making any direct cash contribution towards the cost of this venture. Japanese Prisoners of War in Australia. Mr Webb asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice1.

172,Mr Hasluck,"The answers to theearn the minimum wage before he could employ the worker at wages less favorable than the award rates. Where an employer is not bound by an award to provide certain wages or conditions (for example, if he is not a respondent to the award, or if the award binds him only in respect of certain of his employees) no permission is required to employ any person, aboriginal or not, under conditions less favorable than those provided in the award. Any person who commences to employ wards must notify the Director of Welfare within 28 days after the commencement of the employment. While no positive permission is required to employ a ward, the director has the power to forbid a person to employ any ward where that person is not a fit and proper person to employ a ward, having regard to previous conduct of that person in relation to a ward. An employer of an aboriginal ward may, under section 38 of the Wards' Employment Ordinance, employ a slow, aged or infirm ward at a wage less than the wage prescribed under that ordinance only if the wage is agreed upon between the employer and a welfare officer. 3 and 4. Whether aborigines are considered the equal in skill and responsibility of others when employed as cattle station hands or drovers is a matter of opinion. Where welfare officers hold this opinion in respect of individual wards who are paid less than the wage prescribed in the relevant award, the welfare officers undertake, in accordance with section 39 of the Wards' Employment Ordinance, negotiations witb the employer to procure for the ward wages and conditions in conformity with those contained in the award.

Immigration. Mr Ward asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice1. Is Maltese migration to Australia limited to an annual quota? 2. If so, what is the quota, and upon what basis is it determined? 3. Is it a fact that applications from Maltese families desiring to migrate to Australia are subjected to a much more rigid screening than that applied in respect of applications for the nationals unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the of other countries? 4. Is there strong resentment among Maltese now resident in Australia at what they regard as discrimination against their countrymen? able member's questions are as follows:1 and 2.

Witb what countries has Australia existing migration agreements? 2. What does it cost (a) Australia, (b) the country of the emigrant and (c) the migrant, to bring an adult migrant to this country under each of these agreements? 3. What is the estimated average cost, subsequent to arrival, of absorbing a migrant into the Australian community? 4. Of this amount what proportion is met by (a) the States and (b) the Commonwealth? able member's questions are as follows:1. Australia has bilateral migration agreements with the United Kingdom, Malta, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. 2. The cost of bringing an adult migrant to this country under each of these agreements is set out as follows:* Under the Australia-United Kingdom Migration Agreement the cost is (a) £133 6s., (b) annual lump sum payment of £stg.l50,000, (c) £12 10s. * Under tbe Australia-Malta Migration Agreement, the cost is (a) £44 13s., (b) £74 2s., (c) £12 10s. * Under the Australia-Netherlands Migration Agreement the cost is (a) £72 15s., (b) £72 15s., (c) £15 4s. * The Australia-Germany Migration Agreement provides for the amount of financial assistance by each government to be determined each year.

This includes movements to Australia on which the average payment, as stated by I.C.E.M., is £61 Is., (c) £22 6s. * New financial arrangements concerning the Australia-Italy Migration Agreement are presently being negotiated. 3 and 4. The Department of Immigration is average cost, subsequent to arrival, of absorbing a migrant into the Australian community. Moreover, the costs must be viewed against the economic gains resulting from immigration. The actual economic costs, particularly capital requirements, vary substantially. The Commonwealth makes considerable amounts available to the States by way of financial assistance and other grants. Under the arrangements agreed to in 1959 by all States for the payment of the financial assistance grants, the amount payable to each State in each of the six years of the currency of the present agreement is determined by reference to a formula which provides, inter alia, for calculation of the grant for each year on a per capita basis.

179,Mr Downer,"The answers to the honoramount received by a State is the same for a migrant resident''in its territory as for a native-born Australian. Mr Ward asked the Immigration, upon notice1. What is the scale of charges imposed upon occupants of immigration reception centres and hostels? Z. Are these charges based upon a calculation of what accommodation is worth or on the ability of the occupant to pay? 3. What is the extent and quality of the accommodation provided? able member's questions are as follows:1. Standard weekly charges for board and lodging in migrant centres are(a) WorkersAdult male-£ 3 16s. 6d. Adult female-£ 3 14s. 6d. », Juniors (under 21 years)(i) where the weekly nominal wage does not exceed £2-15s . less than the nominal wage. (ii) where the weekly nominal wage exceeds £2-£ 1 5s., plus Is. per week for every 2s. by which the nominal wage exceeds £2 until the adult worker's tariff is reached.

Family maximum where applicable£5 4s. For this purpose the family unit will include wife and children up to non-working age; mother, mother-in-law, father and father-in-law. Migrant hostel standard tariff charges are(i) WorkersAdult male-£ 4 17s. 6d. Adult female-£ 4 6s. Junior (under 21) similar to the charges raised in immigration centres.

(iii) These rates may be reduced for families to provide a maximum charge for dependants of £3 15s. per week plus 2s. for every 59. by which the nominal wage of the breadwinner exceeds £9. (c) The tariff charges in immigration reception centres and migrant hostels may be further reduced to ensure that families retain the following amounts eao'i week from the breadwinner's nominal wage:Breadwinner with dependantWife and one dependent child-£3 . Minister for Wife and two dependent children£3 10s. Wife and three dependent children £4. Wife and four dependent children -£ 4 10s. Wife and five or more dependent children-£5 . (d) The nominal wage referred to is the breadwinner's regular wage. Ia addition, he may receive overtime, bonus or incentive payments, special allowance or penalty rates, which are not counted as pa?t of the regular wage. Child endowment payments are also excluded for tariff calculation purpeses. 2. (a) The charges made fail substantially below the actual cost of providing board and lodging. The scales of accommodation rates ha-ve been framed v/ith an appreciation that immigration centres and migrant hostels provide for an interim period of adjustment in a new country, and so ensure that residents are given a reasonable opportunity to save some money towards early movement to private accommodation, (b) Migration agreements with other countries call for reception and after care of new arrivals, and it is therefore appropriate that part of the running costs of immigration centres and migrant hostels should be borne by the Commonwealth, (c) The operational costs of migrant hostels are subsidized by the Commonweallh Government, the amount of the subsidy for 1961.62 being £1,522,000. (d) Charges made are related to the ability of the occupant to pay, in ihe sense that they are reduced whenever the application of the full tariff would leave the breadwinner with an amount less than that shown in the final part of the answer to question 1. 3. (a) Accommodation provided for migrants is reasonable and adequate, bearing in mind the purposes for which reception centres and hostels are operated, (b) Sleeping accommodation consists of individual bedrooms allocated on the basis, generally, of two persons per room, but frequently on the basis of one person per room. Each family is provided with a group of connected furnished bedrooms, according to the number, age, and sex of the children, (c) Services such as communal washing facilities, lavatories and dining halls are situated in a central position for each group of accommodation buildings, (d) Food, furniture and equipment issued are all of good quality, and regular inspections and maintenance ensures that general living conditions remain at a high standard.
