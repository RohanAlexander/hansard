Petition received and read. morning's Age appears an article headed "" Other Officers."" It beginsThere is reason to believe that Colonel Robertson very strongly objects to tbe unauthorized ancl unwarranted use made of his name by Mr Page in Parliament yesterday. Not only is Colonel Robertson a personal friend of Co!onel Hoad's, but.he is above all things desirous that his last few years of service shall be free from any exploitation of his name by anti-Australian politicians-o r by any one else. Were these unreasonable questions to ask the Minister?Is Colonel Robertson shortly retiring from the command of the Second Infantry Brigade; and, if so, when? What reason does he give for retiring? Is he retiring because he objects to a proposed new appointment? It seems to me that those questions were absolutely reasonable. A t all events, there is nothing unwarrantable in them-.

The Minister then promised that a Bill would be introduced during the next session in such a form as to enable both Houses to. deal specifically with the question of maintaining a residence for the Governor General in Sydney, and in order to permit of the fullest and freest discussion, the Bill takes its present form.

It provides that the Governor General may enter into an arrangement with the Government of the State of Victoria for the use and occupation by the Commonwealth for a period not exceeding five years of Government House, Melbourne, as a residence for the Governor General, and that he may also make a similar arrangement with respect to Government House, Sydney.

Accordingly a return was prepared in which it was shown that ,£5,500 was absolutely the bed-rock exestimate had been made in the absence of any experience other than that provided by the short period during which the Commonwealth had been in occupation of the two Government Houses, but it was believed that their maintenance could be provided for upon that basis. Ever since then the expenditure has been kept down absolutely to bed-rock, and it has been found, with the exercise of care and economy, that the amount indicated will very nearly cover all certain amounts for non-recurring expenditure-expenditur e due to the fact that we are required to keep the buildings and their contents in good order and condition.

We are simply continuing the existing arrangement, and there will be.no expense incurred under it other than that of which we have had experience during the past five years. We ask the House to agree to the Bill, because we think that it is a just thing that we should provide for the upkeep of two Government Houses, one in Sydney, and the other in Melbourne. has this arrangement been made? requested the Commonwealth Government to consider the question of whether it should not pay rent for the accommodation provided in Melbourne for the GovernorGeneralj but since then, he has practically concluded an agreement with us under which no rent shall be charged, and we shall continue in possession of the Melbourne establishment just as we have done hitherto.

Meantime, it strikes me that the proposal made in this Bill is a fair arrangement upon both sides. The New South Wales authorities have to provide a residence for Sir Harry Rawson, the State Governor, and I understand that they are desirous of entering into a five years' tenure of a house with that end in view. It is only reasonable, therefore, that they should ask the Commonwealth Government to occupy the vice-regal establishment in Sydney, which the State Governor is vacating, for a similar term. I suppose that the Government are following sortie precedent in the matter of the phraseology which is employed in this Bill. In it, I notice that they take power-it strikes me as sounding, rather strange-to permit the Governor General to make an arrangement with the State Governor.. lowing; the official means of communication. everybody understands that the Governor General means his responsible Ministers, but I did. not know that this form of phraseology entered into the question of securing of a place wherein the Governor General might live. tain executive authority. to which one is not accustomed in our Acts of Parliament, and it shows the way in which constitutional law operates from the top to the bottom of our industrial and social order. I take it from what the Minister has said that the Government propose to enter into an indefinite agreement with the Government of Victoria, so far as the occupation of the Melbourne Government House is concerned, subject to twelve months' notice upon either side. With respect to the vice-regal establishment in New South Wales, the Government propose, at I am glad to hear the statement the request of the Premier of that State, to enter into an agreement' for a definite term. ment may ask for the same agreement as we contemplate making with New South Wales.

There has been some criticism levelled against the recent action of the Victorian Premier in making a claim for rent for the occupation of Melbourne Government House. claim for rent that was objectionable, but the remarks which accompanied it. that a mistake was made in this matter at ""the very outset of Federation, and this fact shows the inadvisability of allowing sentimental considerations to enter into affairs of plain business.

I do not wish to traduce in any I am not prepared to say whether or not New South Wales desires to save money, but judging from a communication received ago, I should imagine that the State is pretty short of funds. of funds, because her Government makes this offer. The amount appropriated was to which I refer, it was suggested by the New South Wales Government that the Federal members should start to look for a new Federal Capital Site, and in a postscript it was courteously intimated that they were invited to bring their own sandwiches. It was like an invitation to attend a Lord Mayor's banquet, with an intimation that the guests were to take their own food and wine. It appeared to me, from that invitation, that New South Wales desires to save money. Here is an opportunity for her to do so. I am also strongly of opinion that we have arrived at a stage in our national history when no special privileges should be accorded to any particular State. We ought not to perpetuate a system whereby the Governor General is expected to live in different States at different portions of the year. a perambulator.

The people of Australia, who have neither the opportunity nor the desire to attend Government House functions, but who have to pay the bill for the up-keep of various official establishments, ought to be considered. They thought that on the consummation of Federation the expenses of the States upon Governors would be greatly diminished.

In addition to that we now have the Governor General provided with two residences, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. tainly have no desire to see Sydney brought down to the level of a fishing village.

It is rather annoying to pick up one of the daily newsThe present cost papers and find a cavilling between the In some of the States the State Premiers and the Commonwealth Prime Minister as to whether we should pay rent for Government House. I take the view that as a matter of justice the Commonwealth Government should pay its I cerway, and it should certainly reimburse the State Governments for out-of-podket expenditure. But at the same time, the occupation by the Commonwealth of the Government Houses at Melbourne and Sydney does not involve the two States in Government House, Sydney, ocadditional expenditure. The Commonwealth provides for the up-keep of these I can quite understand Adelaide, establishments, which amounts in itself to a very large rent. Indeed, the Governments of Victoria and New South Wales But it is not have made an economical arrangement by allowing the Governor General to occupy the official residences in Melbourne and Sydney whilst they pay rent for cheaper establishments for their own Governors. The general public are not concerned as to the residences of the State Governors and the Governor General. Thev are not part of the social world of which the Governor General is the pivot. The masses of the people do not care what is done in this matter, so long as they are not involved in The Governor General's private unnecessary expense A t the same time they do not desire to see a State placed in an unfair position.

It was very generally understood that as soon as a Governor General of the Commonwealth was in existence in Australia, the States Governcis should be represented by some permanent offici' of each State rather than by ar .mported gentleman who would be expected to keep up a petty vice-regal establishment, such as seems to have been the rule in all the States up to the present Federal Parliament be accused of extravagance in any direction, I think we may fairly retort on the States Parliaments that in this respect they are not only extravagant, but are continuing a totally useless and unnecessary formality in respect of these little vice-regal courts. It seems to me to be the height of absurdity that in the city of Melbourne we should have two vice-regal establishments. quite sure that the vast majority of the people, if they had an opportunity to express an opinion in a direct fashion on this particular issue, would speak without hesitation as to the advisability and, indeed, the necessity, of abolishing these States vice-regal courts. It it were absolutely necessary for the welfare and happiness of a certain section of the people of Australia that they should occasionally tread a vice-regal carpet, or that a still more select few should put their feet under vice-regal mahogany, that might be accomplished by arranging that the Governor General should visit the various States for . a short period in each year, and in that way afford those people an opportunity to gratifv their social ambition. I feel that the Federal Parliament should' enter a strong protest against the continuance of these States vice-regal courts. It was dis.tinctly understood that they should be abolished as the result of federation. We now have had federation in existence for five years, and, beyond a reduction in the salaries of some of the States Governors, nothing more effectual has been accomplished. I am informed by the honourable member for Kennedy that there was a request from a late Secretary of State for the Colonies that the status of these States Governors should not be altered or reduced. made in the case of Queensland at any rate. I think that in a matter of this kind the voice of the people of Australia should be supreme. Whilst we are always ready to listen to suggestions from the Colonial Office, they should be very well grounded indeed, and I am not aware that very cogent reasons have been adduced by any one for the continuance of the States viceregal courts. But in any case, I think it is the duty of this Parliament to remind the States Parliaments that there is a very useful reform possible of achievement in this direction, and that, apart altogether time. If the from the saving of expense, the present position is one which makes us almost a laughing stock of people elsewhere. We can very well dispense with many of these little vice-regal courts throughout Australia.

I know something of the cost of upkeep of these houses, and can support the Minister in what he has said. It is quite true that the lowest estimate, cutting everything to the bone, was given by a previous Government as to the ordinary outlay in maintaining these Government Houses. in 1902, before we had much experience, and £5.500 was named as the amount. That, of course, did not include exceptional expenditure, such as the painting of the houses all over, which must be done at intervals. The regular expense of upkeep was estimated at £5,500 a year. course, honourable members are aware that that amount has teen considerably exceeded. When I occupied the position of Minister of Home Affairs, I recognised that .the expenditure should, if possible, be kept down to the estimate of probable outlay that had been supplied. With the assistance of the ofiicers of the Department, I endeavoured to keep down the expenditure on these Government Houses, with the result that it was reduced to, I think, about ^5,8oo. was £5,800. This year we hone that we will have succeeded in cutting it down to £5,5°°brought down to something very near the estimate, with the object of submitting a vote of £5,500 for the following year, and I think the Estimates were so prepared. The Minister says that he is following that course, and hopes, apart from exceptional outlay, to bring down the expenditure to £5,500. How, then, can the Federal Parliament be charged with extravagance if it maintains the two Government Houses with that expenditure? What do we find is the cost of maintaining the States Government Houses? In New South Wales there are two Government Houses provided for the State Governor, one in the country ancl the other in the citv of Svdney, at a cost of £12,368. honourable member for Cowper, they pay only £500 a year for rent. does not include the expenses of upkeep.

The agreement of the Premiers is not binding upon us. that anv honourable undertaking of the kind into which they ehtered is binding on us. They were then acting for Australia, and the arrangement into which they entered was recognised by the British Government. I think that the honourable member would, in his private capacity, consider himself bound by a similar arrangement.

My desire is to enter into an arrangement with the States Governments for as short a period as possible consistent with the provision of residences for the Governor General in Melbourne and Sydney. It is now suggested that we should have alternate agreements with eacli of the States, one being for a period of five vears. and the other extending until the Federal city is established. As I have already pointed out, it will be necessary for the New South Wales Government to make. arrangements for the accommodation of the State Governor, ar.d» they reasonably ask that we shall enter into occupation of Government House, Sydney, for a fixed term so that they may arrange to lease a residence for the State Governor for a similar period. that provision will have to be made for the accommodation of the Governor General elsewhere than at the Federal Capital for a period of at least five years. for the amendment. We know that even if we were able forthwith to secure the site for bhe Federal Capital, a considerable time would be occupied in laying out the Federal City, and in working out the whole scheme.

We all know that if the Federal Capital Site were finally selected, and the work of establishing the Federal City were pushed on with all possible speed, it would not be possible to provide accommodation for the Governor General at the permanent Seat of Government before five years had elapsed. I think that the more consideration that is given to the various matters connected with the laying out of the Federal City during the next few years, the better it will be for us in the future. far. able member for Bland does not expect that the Governor General would be able to reside at the Federal Capital before five years has elapsed? case, the amendment may very well be inserted with the object of safeguarding us against the impression that it was passed with tlie deliberate intention of providing permanent residences in Sydney and Melbourne. tion to five years would prevent that. because considerable differences of opinion exist as to the agreements already entered into with New South Wales and Victoria.",28,Thomson Whils T More Valuable Than Those Rendered To The

If they had been reasonable in their attitude, we should not have been under the necessity of dealing with a measure of this kind.

When that stage has been We were promised that with the advent of Federation the offices of the States Governors would be abolished. The very persons who are to-day denouncing us for the expenditure incurred in the maintenance of these vice-regal establishments are themselves extravagant.

Its object is not to authorize the construction of the Transcontinental .Railway, but simply to provide for an appropriation of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 to enable proper surveys to be made, which will put the House in possession, of information that is absolutely essential to enable it to express a sound judgment upon that very important undertaking. provides that the Minister may cause a survey to be made of a route to connect by rail Kalgoorlie in Western Australia with Port Augusta in South Australia. It then goes on to authorize the expenditure of the necessary sum of money. Bill passed this House by a considerable majority. It has received the sanction of every party in this Chamber, so far as it is possible for a party to be represented by executive authority. Originally introduced by the first Deakin Government, it was. afterwards taken up by the Watson Ministry,-and when the Reid-McLean Government were in office they advanced it through its remaining stages, and it was transmitted to the Senate. The measure was discussed in that Chamber in 1904, and again last year. Upon the last occasion the Senate resolved to the effectthat the Bill should not be proceeded with ""until South Australia had given parliamentary sanction to the construction of the line through its territory. Since then we have communicated with the South Australian Government upon the matter, and have received the following reply from Mr Price, the Premier of that State:Sir, In reply to your letter of the 7th instant, respecting the. proposed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, I have the honor to refer vou to my telegram of rst March last, and to say that this Government has no objection to the survey as therein notified, but cannot undertake to consider a B ill for .submission t j Parliament in the absence of information as to the route and terminal points of the railway. That is to say that, so far as South Australia is concerned, she is not hostile to this Bill. people of that State favour the construction of the Transcontinental Railway. The only point with them is that they do not care to commit themselves to any scheme until they know the route that is to be followed, and possibly the cost of the construction of the proposed line. That under this Bill, we are asking the House to give us authority to obtain. We hold that the building of the Transcontinental Railway is a great national work, which is worthy of the attention of this House, and which ought to be regarded from a Federal stand-point. It is an undertaking which ought not to be rejected until honourable members have been afforded an opportunity of arriving at a sound judgment upon it . It has often The Bill been asserted that the line is intended merely to benefit Western Australia. That is not the way in which we ought to regard a great national undertaking. We should approach it from a Federal stand-point. We should also regard it from an historiI n 1904 the cal stand-point, with a view to ascertain the reasons why this Bill now becomes before the House for consideration. I am free to admit that, when I first considered this project, I was inclined to take up a critical attitude in respect to it. But I felt that inherently it appealed to one's Federal instinct as being the right thing to do. Since the proposal was brought before the House, I have had the advantage of visiting Western Australia, going throughthe country to be traversed by the line as far as it was possible to go by rail, and consulting with the people of the State on the proiect.. I , as a representative of Queensland, desired to look at the question from the Western Australian stand-point, in order to be able to give a judgment fairly and honestly according to the facts. I feel absolutely confident that the people of Western Australia are only claiming that which from a Federal standpoint is a fair and reasonable thing to accord to them. In Western Australia. I made some inquiries, and I found that when the State was asked to consider the important question of whether she would enter the .great Australian union, certain aspects were submitted for her consideration. Separated as she virtually was from the eastern States by a sea journey, and developing her own territory, she almost seemed to be complete within herself as a centre of government. On the face of In fact, I believe that the things, as far as economic conditions were concerned, there did not appear to be any special reason for inducing Western Australia to join the Union from any material advantage she was likelv to gain. But of course, from the national and defence points of view, there were many reasons to actuate her intaking that step. As far is the very information which, as I can see, after looking closely into the question, there was no State which gave a more patriotic decision than Western AusWhat we have to consider are the tralia did when she decided to throw in her facts placed before, the people of lot with the others, and form a great AusWestern Australia when they contemtralian nation under the Crown.

The State also obtained a further report from Mr Muir, who went over the route of the line as far as it was possible to do. read the Treasurer's report of his ride over the route of the line ? Read what he says about fhe country. honourable member would read it. right honourable member searched the country for water, and thanked God when he got a bucketful. report. Western Australia, therefore, has treated the Federation fairly. sent her own officers to thoroughly investigate the country, as far as they could, and placed the House in possession of extremely valuable information in the shape of their reports. In addition to that, her Parliament passed an Act giving the consent of the. State to the. survey of the line. The preamble to the Act ought to be borne in mind by this Parliament, because it voices honestly and fairly the hopes and aspirations of the people of the State. It reads as follows :Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia, being desirous of securing closer union and the benefits of mutual protection and defence, and being desirous also of enjoying the advantages of freedom of trade, commerce, and reciprocal intercourse, have, by th* Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, foimed one Federal and indissoluble Commonwealth -. And whereas, in furtherance of these objects, power has been conferred upon the Parliament of the Commonwealth to make laws for the construction and extension of railways in anv State with the consent of such State : And whereas, on the faith of the early construction of a railwav to connect the western and eastern portions of the Commonwealth, by means whereof they could enjoy the f u l l benefits of such union, the people of Western Australia did agree to the said Constitution, and to form part of the Commonwealth : And whereas, to enable the Parliament of the Commonwealtli to execute nnd maintain those essential provisions of the Constitution which were intended to confirm the people of this portion of the Commonwealth in that assurance of protection and defence, and the advantages of postal and commercial intercourse, and of freedom of trade by land and by sea, which are enjoyed by members of the Commonwealth elsewhere, it is desirable to authorize such Parliament to construct a railway as aforesaid : Now, therefore, be it enacted, &c. Sitting suspended from i to 2 p.m. mention that the whole distance from Fremantle to Adelaide is 1,746 miles. Already there has been constructed a railway fromi Fremantle to Kalgoorlie 387 miles, and another line from Adelaide to Port Augusta 259 miles, leaving a distance of 1,100 miles to complete the transcontinental scheme. The engineers hare reported in favour of a gauge of 4 f t . b\\ in., and the State of Western Australia has undertaken, if the Commonwealth builds the connecting line, to extend the gauge on the railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie. has undertaken to make the gauge on that line conform to whatever gauge is adopted She by. the Commonwealth. is prepared to incur that extra expense to 1 meet the requirements of. the Australian Parliament. When this question was under consideration by this Parliament on a former occasion, the House desired to have the lands reserved for twenty-five' miles on each side of the line, in order that it might not be alienated.. To meet us in that respect, Western Australia, on the 26th October, 1904, passed resolutions reserving the land in question. In addition to that, Western Australia has shown faith in the line by an undertaking she has given, dated 18th May, 1904, to the effect that, for ten years, if the line is not paying, she will bear a share of the loss. The Western Australian Premier announced that decision in the following telegram:On condition that Commonwealth is allowed a free hand as to route and gauge of railway, this State will be prepared for ten years after line constructed to bear a share of any loss in excess of our contribution on a population basis. It would be premature. to fix exact proportion we areprepared to pay at this stage, but I am confident that it will be liberal, and satisfy the Federal Parliament of our sincerity in this connection, nnd our belief that the work will soon be a directly paying one. Western Australia even went so far as to hold out inducements to South Australia in the way of indemnifying that State against loss. I may further announce that, through the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, the State Premier has been asked whether, in case the survey was authorized, the State Parliament would do anything in the way of fitting out a prospecting party to accompany the",34,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill Second Reading

That telegram shows that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who has ever kept in view the interests of his own State, but who, at the same time, has always taken a Federal view of other matters, has secured from the Western Australian Government .an assurance that full advantage will be taken of the survey from the prospecting point of view. acting in this manner from any purely selfish stand-point. She is, I am' satisfied, looking at the matter from a Federal point of view, and desires to afford us every opportunity of ascertaining whether we are justified in doing what it is proposed to do. I have now shown the steps that have ljeen taken in this matter, and I think it is hardly necessary for -me to elaborate the points at issue to any great extent. may, however, remark that, in my opinion, the Western Australian people are entitled to this railway for several good reasons. The first is on account of the Federal aspect of the question. From an Australian stand-point-leavin g the special Western Australian interests out of consideration altogetherI think the survey ought to be made. Secondly, from the point of view of defence, the line ought to be constructed. If honourable members take the trouble to look at the report obtained from the military authorities in 1903, they will find that Major-General Hutton put this aspect of the case very strongly. states in his minute on the subjectThe contemplated extension of railway communication between Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and Port Augusta in South Australia, is, from a strategical and military point of view, of unquestionable value. The isolation of Western Australia, without direct land communication with the other five States of Australia, w ill , in time of war, cause a general feeling of insecurity. Western Australia, for purposes of co-operative military assistance from the other States, is as far distant from direct means of reinforcement as New Zealand is from the Eastern States of Australia. In order, however, to correctly view the present construction of the railway in question as an important factor in the defence of the CpmThe following telegram has monwealth, it will be well to consider the special importance of Western Australia in the eyas of foreign powers, and the description of attack to which Australia is subject, and to meet which intercommunication between the States by land must be regarded as of paramount value. Tben he goes onThe potential wealth of the gold-fields and the vast extent of valuable and unoccupied land in the territories of Western Australia render the acquisition of that portion of the Australian continent a most valuable prize to foreign nations. The strategical situation, moreover, of Western Australia, dominating, as it does, the southern side of the Indian Ocean, and the converging trade routes from the West, must be considered as of the greatest importance to British and Australian interests. In addition to that, the right honourable member for Swan has placed a memorandum on the papers embodying an extract Western Australia is not from a report from Major-General Edwards, then commanding the British troops in Hong Kong. This report was furnished to Governor Sir W. C. F. Robinson. Major-General Edwards statesNo general defence of Australia can be undertaken unless its distant parts are connected with thc more populous colonies in the south and east of the continent. If an enemy was established in either Western Australia or at Port Darwin, you would be powerless to act against him. I Their isolation is, therefore, a menace to the rest of Australia The interests of the whole continent, therefore, demand that the raihvays to connect Port Darwin and Western Australia with the other colonies should be made as soon as possible. The military authorities whom I have quoted, considering the question absolutely Irom a national stand-point, give, in my opinion, excellent reasons why we ought, at all events, to survey the route of the proposed railway. At this stage I am not asking that the construction of any line shall be proceeded with.

Another reason that can be advanced is that the line will open up new country. A misapprehension prevails as to the character If honourable members would of the country that would be traversed by the line. Mr Muir, who has to some extent investigated the route, reports emphatically on this point. I will quote what he says about part of itI was led to believe, prior to starting this trip, that the country to be traversed consisted almost entirely of a desert, composed of sandhills and spinifex flats.

A report was obtained from Mr Castilla upon the possibilities of the water supply. I will quote the last paragraph from it . It was published in Western Australia on the 19th July, 1904. Mr Castilla saysIn the course of my duties, I examined over 10,000,000 acres of country, well fitted, given water for pastoral settlement. demonstrated that water exists, and I think that there is a very much greater area available. These are reports from men who are competent to judge, and they show that the country is not such a desert as it is stated to be. asking that a proper investigation of the route of the proposed railway should be made, not only for reasons of defence, but also because there is a possibility of the opening up of valuable country. When the country is examined it is quite possible that will be revealed. structed, we shall secure better postal communication between the Stajtes at each end of it ; the cost of maintaining telegraphic communication between the Eastern States and Western Australia will be reduced, seeing that a telegraph line erected along the railway could be looked after with less expense; better means of communication will be provided between the States for the travelling public, and trade and commerce will be promoted andi extended. turns we have of the progress and development of Western Australia show that when the engineers hold out a prospect of increased trade, as the result of the construction of the proposed line, we may have every confidence that their reports are justified.

MrM c LEAN (Gippsland) [2.22] I have never been very hopeful regarding the prospects of this line. On the contrary, I have always been very doubtful whether a thorough investigation of the proposed route, and the country on either side, would result in justifying the very large expenditure which must be involved in the construction of the line. At the same time, I do feel that Western Australia has strong claims upon our sympathy. In the first place, that State is a part of Federated Australia, and is labouring under very serious disadvantage in being cut off from the rest of the Commonwealth by a very large stretch of uninhabited country. We must remember that Western Australia has more than the amount provided for in the been largely peopled from the EasternB ill. States. the products of those States, and the trade if the.

Australia but a very small modicum of tlie profit we derive from our trade with that State. I am therefore quite prepared to vote for the trial survey in order that the resources of the country may be thoroughly tested. But I impress upon the Minister that the Government must be careful that the expense incurred under this Bill, if it be passed, shall not exceed the amount we vote. It is possible to incur almost anv expense on the survev of a railway route. What is known as a flying survey can be carried out at a very small cost. We could have a reasonable trial survev at a cost which would be moderate, though greater than that of a flying survey. There might also be a permanent survey, but that is not to be thought of at this stage.

287,Sir John Forrest,"I quite agree withing, it is certainly my intention to vote for the Bill. I hope to see it pass. While I have very little hope of ultimate success, no one will be more pleased than I if the exploration of the country and the survey prove that the construction of the line can be justified on its merits. When we have all the information before us will be the proper time to consider the further question of whether the Commonwealth should undertake its construction, and, if so, on what terms and conditions. Those are matters which must be left to a -future date, and, in the meantime, I intend to support this Bill. to protest most emphatically against the waste of money which will be involved in the proposed survey of this line. Ever since the Federal Parliament has beenin existence, the construction of this railway has been a pet project of the present Treasurer, and I presume, also, of other honourable members representing Western Australian constituencies. I well remember that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in the first Parliament, who was one of the ablest men. who ever came from Western Australia, and who had a thorough knowledge of this project, was emphatically against it until, first of all, the existing ""State railways were connected with Esperance Bay. 1 goorlie recognised that gentleman's merit. the people of Kalgoorlie made a very bad exchange. lie should be the best judges of that I have been challenged with not possesindependent' testimony on the point. It must not be forgotten that each State in the Federation must bear on a -per capita basis its share of the cost of every new scheme agreed to by this Parliament, and involving the expenditure of money. It appears to me that until the per capita arrangement is applied in other directions as well as to new expenditure, it is hardly fair to saddle the smaller States with additional expense. The history of all such surveys will, no doubt, be repeated in this case, and once we have passed this Bill we shall have presented to us such a glowing report that we shall be forthwith asked to vote money or float a loan, for the construction of the railway. the wedge. that it is. We find that representatives of the larger States are only too happy at all times.to permit the smaller States to come in and share on the per capita basis the cost of works from which they will derive no benefit. We do not find the same reckless prodigality exhibited when suggestions are made that in the near future the distribution of Federal revenue should be carried out on the same basis. Last session I was particularly struck with a speech delivered by the honourable member for Mernda, in which the honourable member was good enough to propose that the Braddon"" blot "" should be done away with, and that a per capita distribution of revenue should take place-that the revenues of the four principal States should be pooled per capita on the one side and the revenues of the smaller States should be pooled in the same way on the other. In making that suggestion, the honourable member entirely overlooked the provisions of the Constitution for which he is such a stickler. gestion. ber must excuse me, he did. I read his statement. The Constitution prevents any such fer capita arrangement as that suggested by the honourable member last session. So long as the larger States show themselves unwilling, to deal liberally with the smaller States, I shall conceive it to be my duty, in the interests of the latter, to resist expenditure froni which they will derive no benefit. sing a sense of justice, and, therefore, I wish to say a few words on this proposal to put myself in the right j because I be-' lieve in absolute justice, so far as that is possible, in the management of human affairs. We have been told that we should authorize the survey of the proposed line because the people of Western Australia -were promised that, if they agreed to Federation, a railway would be built to connect Western Australia with the Eastern States. I know that one of the objections raised in New South Wales to the Constitution Bill was that, if it were passed, pressure would be brought to bear on the Commonwealth Government to build such a line, and, if provision had been made in the Constitution for the construction of more opposition than it did.",39,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill Second Reading

It has been said that the people of Western Australia stand in the same position in regard to the construction of the proposed railway as that in which the people of New South Wales stand in regard to the location of the Federal Capital; but, whereas it is expressly provided in the Constitution that the Federal Capital shall be located in the mother State, there is no similar provision regarding the Western Australian railway. the Constitution requiring the maintenance of a residence in Sydney for the Governor General. ter. I did not take part in the discussion of the Governor General's Residences Bill, and, personally, would not care much if he were not provided with a residence in Sydney. There is, however, no parallel between the position of fhe Western Australians in reference to the proposed railway and that of the people of New South Wales in reference to the Capital Site question. If Western Australia was brought into Federation upon the promise that this railway would be made, that promise was given behind the backs of the people of the other States, and their votes were obtained for the Constitution by means of a deception.

I shall certainly vote against the second reading of the B ill , unless we are absolutely assured that the land through which the line would pass will be reserved. The Minister asked us to consider this question from an' Australian stand-point, and it is from that point of view that I desire to discuss it . On this occasion it suited the Minister to quote the opinion of Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, but in other instances that officer's views have not been received with much favour by hon01 able members on the Government benches.

Therefore, I shall vote against the B ill. ing the next century it may prove desirable to make the survey, and that, probably, during the succeeding century the construction of the line will be justified. A t present, however, we should not be warranted in taking any action in that direction. The Minister told us that there was every prospect of valuable minerals being found. We are all very glad that such valuable mineral discoveries have been made in Western Australia, and we acknowledge that they have proved of inestimable advantage to the whole of the Commonwealth. In view of the magnificent work that has been done by the pioneers of the Western Australian goldfields, I am quite certain that if there had been any minerals of value in the territory lving between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta they would have been brought to light long before this. Government intend to equip a prospecting information which satisfies, me that we party that will travel with the survey party should not rush into this expenditure at and search the country for minerals. lian Government might very well equip which he endeavoured to make provision in their prospecting party, and send it out be the Constitution for the construction of the forehand, so that information might be obrailway, estimated that it would cost tained which would assist us very materi£2,500.000. ally in coming to a conclusion.

Here is Mr Muir's report upon the subjectI am quite satisfied that the country we have been exploring is almost, if not quite, waterless. The natives evidently obtain their water supply Their estimate was £4,500.000. from the mallee and other roots, numerous heaps of which are to be seen lying about, and a blackfellow will not, I believe, have recourse to these rcots if he can obtain water within anything like a reasonable distance.

I know that in Victoria we have, as a matter of fact, spent something like half-a-million sterling on surveys of railways that there is no hope whatever of constructing for generations to come. What is more, when the permanent surveys are made, it is almost invariably found that the estimates mad'e on flying surveys are misleading. I feel sure that if the Government embarks upon this proposal the same result will follow. It is a peculiar thing that every Government which has held office in the Commonwealth has felt it to be incumbent upon it to include this survey in its pla'tform as a national work. no prejudice against it on the part of Governments. it is a matter of prejudice; it is rather a matter of policy. One honourable member who was formerly in favour of the survey has seen fit to alter his mind, and I think that, on reflection, it is possible that others will realize that they have been under a misapprehension. Before the House comes to a determination on the second reading, I trust that the Minister will, furnish us with the authority on which he has come to the conclusion that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 will complete the survey. mate based upon the adivice of the engineers of the States. port? tained in any report, but it was arrived at upon tlieir advice. pression of what' has occurred, particularly in Viatoria, as the result of flying, surveys.

He asked me to refer to ""his description of the country between 126 deg. and 129 deg., and I find that is the very part of the country which I have been reading about. Without being unfair in any particular to the right honourable gentleman, I think we can safely say that his opinion about this country as a whole is about as uncertain as are his opinions upon the land tax question. motor car. like a shot from behind a hedge. is no reason why there should be any ill feeling about a matter of this kind. are all here to represent the views of our constituents.

It is better that we should put this matter on a sound basis. I suggest to the Government that, having heard these extracts from the descriptions given by the Treasurer, they might consider whether the debate might not now be reasonably adjourned, with a view to the further consideration of the measure-on Tuesday. What are we committed to if we pass this Bill? It is true that it is only to provide for a survey, but I feel that the Treasurer would have been quite right in saying that we shall be taking a wrong course of action in passing a B ill to provide for the survey if we are not prepared, subsequently, to endorse the verdict of the experts invited to conduct it. reasonable contention. ber looks at a motor car, is that any guarantee that he will buy it? pert to examine a motor car if I .were determined not to buy one. and the people's representatives in this House should not act more foolishly in the transaction of public affairs than they would in JOHN FORREST -The honourable private life. We must consider now the ultimate as well as the immediate results The right honourable genof passing this measure. If the proposed survey is made, Parliament will probably be committed to an expenditure of from £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the construction of a railway. We shall thus be forced to initiate an era of borrowing, ancl to compete with the States in the London money market. All the members of the Labour Party, including the representatives of Western Australia, and many other members of the House, have announced themselves as opposed to Commonwealth He did not see it from a borrowing, and I understand that it is a plank in the platform of that party that I think I heard a sound there shall be no borrowing by the ComThere monwealth. We for reproductive purposes. Party is no Commonwealth borrowing, without any qualifications.
