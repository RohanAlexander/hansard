There were wool processors in this that placement right. I do not believe that the country at that time who said, 'Don't do it. If old concept we had of holding a stock of you are going to walk away from the scheme, wool in a permanent sense has any merit you have to walk right away from the whatsoever.

There are two main aspects of these bills which I would like to speak about. There are I believe that Wool International will have some very positive aspects of the Garnaut its time.

The fact scheme, has been that as the reserve price is that the Wool Corporation did carry out smoothed out the fluctuations in price, as it some aspects of this plan and placed wool did for many years, then there is no reason around the world.

I have been quite concerned Stephen Bennett and Rod Price for doing a about the level of sales-four years down the mighty job in a short period. It was a very track and we still have almost half the stockwide ranging inquiry which, under difficult pile. I have also been concerned about what circumstances, came up with a pretty fair the precise activities of Wool International recommendation. I think the only regrettable will be, and I confess that I have not had the part is that, since the wool legislation was time to study it so as to make up my mind. brought into the parliament late last week, we have had virtually no time to study such an Some critics have rejected most of the important piece of legislation because I hear Garnaut report, although I find, from talking that the Minister for Primary Industries and to most of these people, that they usually fall Energy( Mr Crean) wants to get it through into vested interest categories. They usually before he goes overseas.

When pecting to produce next year and what we we consider these factors, we realise that the sold last year is about 130kilotonnes of wool, magnitude of the problem is so great that, and that gives us somewhere to move.

While I accept the argument that has been put very eloquently by many of my there is no straightforward answer when colleagues that we have to get wool moving trying to decide who owes the debt and who out of the stockpile, I do raise the concern owns the stockpile. Having made that observation, the Garnaut report goes on to decide that, if the price were to collapse or tgo to a very high level, there would be, m my that it is entirely the responsibility of the opinion, very strong pressure on the governwoolgrowers.
