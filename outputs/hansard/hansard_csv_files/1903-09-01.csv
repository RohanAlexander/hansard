Petition received. BILL the Prime Ministeri f there is any truth in the report that the Government intend lo abandon the FapuaB ill because of certain amendments made in Committee. Sir EDMUNDBARTON under consideration the course to be pursued in regard to that Bill, and before, proceeding further with it. 1 may have certain 'inquiries made in New Guinea. SUG ARBOUNTIE S. graph appears in this morning's Argus The attempt that is being made to compel Queensland sugar planters to employ white labour is likely to prove a costly comedy. There appears to be little doubt tliat the Comptroller-General of where black labour is still used. There is no Customs was right in ruling that bonuses cannot be ' paid on sugar produced from cone grown with the aid of coloured labour. A man wishing to embark in the industry must, therefore, irarchnso ' white "" uano, or the sugar obtained 1 from the cane will be denied the subsidy of £2 a ton. This is the legal interpretation of the Bonus Act passed last month. All holdings worked witb coloured labour after the 1st February lost cannot be registered or the bonus claimed unless the cune growing in them is uprooted, and new white-grown cane is planted. Couscquontly any plunter who continued to employ Kanakas after February must sacrifice all his cane, and begin de novo if he wishes to become entitled to the Federal bounty. The Prime Minister said lasUevening that he purposed reading the Act anew, in order to see whether Sir William Lyne and Dr. Wollaston have correctly interpreted it. not say. statements contained in that paragraph, 1 wish to know from the Minister for Trade and Customs whether, if a planter who has given notice of his intention to employ from the 28th February lost none other than white labour, purchases young plants from one employing coloured labour, he will be unable to obtain a bounty upon the sugar manufactured from tbe cane. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I presume that the paragraph which the honourable member has read refers to a decision which I gave a few days ago, after a consultation with the officers of my Department. The position is this : For the propagation of sugar cane the old cane is cut up, and the cuttings are placed in the ground, and from them, the young plants are produced. planting. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have seen it I wish to know from done, and, therefore, I know that it is so. In the case to wbich my decision refers, the question was not whether the bounty should be given when the original cane from which the young plants were derived had been I 'havo now grown with -the aid of black labour, but whether a bounty should be given upon sugar produced from cane grown from young plants purchased from nurseries and other plantations and cultivated by black labour. , ' nurseries. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am informed that there are. I am told that there is a nursery on one of the large plantations objection to the payment of bounty upon sugar produced from cuttings from cane which two or three years ago may have been planted or cultivated by black labour, but the bounty will not be allowed upon sugar produced from cane grown from young plants propagated with the aid of black labour since the 28th February last.' matter to those who are not thoroughly acquainted with the subject if the Minister will answer me these questions: If the cane is planted from cuttings from cane grown by block labour, will the sugar produced earn the bounty \ If the planting is from stools produced with black labour, and having a growth of their own, will the sugar earn the bounty 1",12,Setup

And much the same thing is happening in New South Wales. Therefore I venture to think that the result will be entirely satisfactory. It must not be for one moment supposed that the quota will be very seriously altered, because the increase in the numbers of electors in the AVestern division will involve a decrease in the number in the Eastern division. 9 P2 any evidence of that?

48,Sir William Mcmillan,"TheI should Jike to know whether. we are not absolutely forced to the conclusion that it is because the new divisions do not suit the majority of honourable members that an Aot of Parliament is to be absolutely scouted. AVhat other reason can there be for the action of the Government? There can be no other reason. reasons. honourable members mean to say that had the new divisions leant more carefully to the interests of those who form the majority in this House, there would have been any interference with the Electoral Act? If the new divisions are now to be set aside, if the solemn decision of this Parliament is to be departed from, there should be reasons for the adoption of such a course. I shall examine, iu the first place, the reasons given for the proposed departure from the Act, and tlie reasons against it . Let us turn .to the report presented by the Commissioner for Victoria, and see whether he was not absolutely alive to as great an extent as the Government could be to the present peculiar position of affairs. Let us see whether he did not make provision for the contingencies to which reference has been made, and whether the margin of one-fifth above or below the quota which we agreed upon was not sufficient to do away with the anomalies. I shall bring before the House the evidence given by the Commissioner for Victoria, who saysAs, however, section 10 of the Act referred to grants a discretionary power to depart to the extent of one-fifth more or one-fifth less than the scheme. No honourable member, after readquota, and having in view the recognised, interests as between country and city, and that many electors in drought-stricken areas were temporarily residing in fche city, I deemed it prudent to exercise that power to a very large extent. Thus we have the Commissioner for A^ictoria setting forth in his own report that he was just as much alive as was the Government to the fact that during the time of drought people migrated from the country to the city, and that to enable him to deal witli the special conditions which thus arose, he availed himself of the utmost latitude allowed him by the law in fixing the different boundaries. I shall deal still further with his report. According to the provisions of the Act, the Commissioner was called upon to exhibit a map showing the proposed divisions and to allow a certain time within which objections might belodged against his scheme. Was that condition complied with ? In the case of Victoria, it was most thoroughly observed. And what was the result? I sliould like honourable members to listen to the Commissioner's statement as to the way in which he carried out his work. Dealing with the objections lodged against his scheme hesaysDoI have duly considered the above objections,, and desirefcoreporb as follows, viz. :(a) That the suggested change is desirable,, and has been made by ine. That shows that the Commissioner was not. incapable of accepting suggestions, and of correctly interpreting the spirit of his instructions. He goes on to say(6) Thafc it is desirable to add the Glenmona,. Talbot, and Wareek State Divisions to. Laanecoorie, which has been done. Again he exercised his discretion, and wasopen to reasonI cannot, however, see any good reason fortaking Woodstock awiy from the proposed Bendigo Division. (c) The electors in the locality mentionedThis was in reply to another objectionhave always been associated with Wedderburn, and, in my opinion, no reasonshave been advanced to justify me in makingfchedesired change. Then he goes on to say that he has taken, every objection into consideration; that it is practically impossible to deal with all theboundaries in accordance with every principle laid down, and that certain latitude has to be allowed in dealing with theing the report, could fail to come to auy conclusion other than that the Commissioner for Victoria has made an hoiaestattempt to carry out the principles and the spirit of the Electoral Act. I shall deal, now with the proposed distribution of New South Wales, submitted by the Commissioner. Is there any reason for setting asidethose divisions ? Save for the quotation on one or two occasions of certain figures, which it is impossible for us to check, the Government have not given one reason for their action. It is lamentable that in the matter of statistical information the members of the Commonwealth Parliamentshould be in a worse position than aremembers of. the States Parliaments. In many cases, when debates are hurried on, ; it is almost impossible for us to obtain that.",17,Smith Th E Quota Under Be Dealt With By The Commission Which

This House has practically decided the matter. There is a majority acting without reason, and unprepared to deliberate on this question. I .had hoped that after the protest made by the -leader of the Opposition there might have been an opportunity to induce honoi'able members to reconsider the position by putting before them a fair statement of the -case. But the minds of the majority are made up, because they think that the Government proposal suits them. So far -AS they are concerned, it is not a matter of deliberation or of adhering honorably to the Act which we have passed.

In other words, we have a Minister of the -Crown defeated in Committee of this House who plainly declares that he does not conisider that the margin which both Houses of Parliament in their wisdom decided upon is sufficient, and, that therefore, he will in the face of this A ct of this Legislature create the very condition of things which we have said should not exist. Mr Houston, the Commissioner of New ^South Wales, declares that fifteen out of the twenty-six divisions under the present -system absolutely exceed the legal extreme as to the number of electors in each -division. Then, again, as far as New South Wales is concerned-and this relates to one »of the most important provisions in the Act-ther e was practically little dissent from the work of the Commissioner. Every objection that was lodged against the scheme was carefully and thoroughly sifted, as the report will show, with the result that the Commissioner declares that the whole of his work has been carried out in a reasonable way. I turn now from the position which might otherwise have been suggested in regard to the migration of a large number of people from the country to the town. I have proved that, according to the evidence before us and the speeches of the honourable gentleman who has introduced this Bill, there is nothing to show that there is such an evil arising out of the schemes proposed by the Commissioners as to compel us to revert to the old States divisions. I hold-and I should like the honourable gentleman in charge of The the Bill to listen to this one simple fact that there ought to be overwhelming proof of the superiority of the existing divisions before we reject the new schemes prepared under an Act which we solemnly passed. Eveni f there are anomalies under the new distributions-eve n if the old divisions are a little better than are the new onesthat, in the circumstances, would not justify the absolute reconsideration of the whole scheme agreed upon by both Houses of the Parliament. Buti t is clear from figures that have been quoted by the leader of the Opposition-and one or two of which I shall repeat-that the anomalies arising under the old divisions are ten times greater than are the anomalies associated with the new ones. Let us take the figures as they have already been put before us. We find that there are 12,139 electors in the present electorate of Darling, and 32,476 electors in the existing. division of Lang. Those are the two electorates which exhibit the greatest disparity, so far as the number of electors is concerned. We find that the Commissioner points out that as between these two extremes there are a number of anomalies, having regard to the spirit of the Act, fifteen out of the existing twenty-six divisions being in an absolutely abnormal condition. I shall now quote figures-which, I presume, are correct-submitted by the leader of the Opposition, showing that two Melbourne electorates aggregate 72,364 electors, while four country electorates in Victoria aggregate 72,271. In other words, we have in two Victorian electorates practically the same number of electors as is to be found in four others. What1 desire to point out is that if a case had been made out against the proposals of the Commissioners, showing that the anomalies involved in them were equal to those which exist under the present system, there might have been some reason for setting them aside. But we find that having regard to all the difficulties that must arise in fixing these boundaries, the anomalies which the newdivisionspresent are but one-tenth of those existing, under the present system. I should like, therefore, to ask the Government upon what principle they have acted in throwing aside the provisions of a solemnly conceived Act of Parliament, as well as the work of men whom they admit to be above any personal suspicion ? The whole question is simply this-and it requires no rhetoric to impress it upon the minds of sensible men-that under any circumstances, having regard to our enormous territory and sparse population, it would be impossible to create any division which would comply with all the principles of the Act. It is impossible to have electorates in which fchere may not be peculiar boundary lines, and in which there may not be instances of dissimilarity of conditions and interests. No Commissioner could avoid that in a country like this. But allowing for that, it is no reason for rejecting the divisions of the Commissioners. These are facts which every one who was interested saw were inevitable. Allowing that such anomalies must exist, what isfcherefcobe said against the proposed divisions? It is said first of all that there has been a tremendous migration from the country to the towns, and that this has absolutely upset our calculations. I have here some figures which have emanated from the leader of the Opposition. I take ifc for granted that he obtained his information from reliable sources. He says that the Darling electorate in 1901 contained 9,000 odd people. very good indication. male and female together. get the best figures obtainable. difficult in this Commonwealth Parliament Does fche honourable gentleman take me for to get reliable figures on any subject. such a fool as to image that there has been Without reading out these figures in detail, no gerrymandering with honourable members? Mr Reid shows that in fche electorates of Ifc has been kept very close indeed. Darling, Barrier, Riverina, Canobolas, Robertson, Bland, Macquarie, Gwydir, and gerrymandered also then. Hume, in 1901, there were 89,000 males; in 1902-3, 90,000; and in August, 1903, 0 94,000. In other words,fcherehas been in some places an almost inappreciable migration. Bufc let ifc be admitted thafc ifc is very difficult: to understand the question as a. whole, owing to imperfect statistics. We will allow that thousands of people have l e f t fche country districts to go into the towns. Nevertheless, I want to know-and this is the whole question before the House-ar e there likely to be more anomalies as the result of the arrangements of the Commissionei's during this period of drought, than there are under the old system that, was prepared three years ago? I say further, repeating myself, that even if there are anomalies, they would have to be absolutely overwhelming to justify us in setting aside a carefully prepared scheme under an Act of Parliament, and in taking into our political hands what was solemnly intended by that Act of Parliament to be taken away from us. That is. my position, and the closer it is kept in sight by honourable members and by the country the better what has been done will be realized. Of course, this arrangement, suits the Minister for Trade and Customs. He does not care. I do nofc want to betoo personal towards the honourable gentleman, but I take it for granted that this. Bill bears the imprint of his hand. matter had not been in the honourable gentleman's hands, I have no doubt whatever that the subject would have been mentioned in the House long ago. Where was the need for secrecy? Here we have Commissioners going on with their work month after month under conditions which the Government now tell us made it impossible for them to create fair boundaries. Yet there was not a word said in the House; not a preliminary report; not an echo of any differences between the Government and the Commissioners. The work was T h a t is a all done in the peculiar manner in which We generally get the honourable gentleman very often indulges.

They are allowed to complete their reports, and, without a single word being known, the Minister, with lightning rapidity, comes down to this House and says, "" We intend to brush the reports aside."" There has not been within my experience such a course taken with regard to an Act of Parliament as has been taken with regard to the Act affecting this matter. If the argument used by the Governiuent is of any value at all it applied when this work was going on. In -all parts of Australia considerable expense was being incurred while the Commissioners were working at their schemes. The very"" conditions that are prevalent now were prevalent then. But the Government now advance as an argument for setting aside the schemes of the Commissioners, conditions that were well known and recognised at -the time those schemes were being prepared. The Government stand condemned by their -own action. It seems to me that the whole subject is in a very small nutshell. We have one question before us-whethe r the political influence which the Electoral Act was supposed to kill has been allowed -to be exercised by a Government which pretends to represent tlie democratic sentiments -of the people. The Government knows that we are practically in a moribund Parliament. ' Has this Government a right, without any real cause except reasons which ought not to have any weight in the matter -reason s which they know are of a political -character, affecting the seats of their own -supporters at the next elections-to reject -the work of the Commissioners? Afte r having allowed the Commissioners to do their work day after day, and ultimately to ""bring up reports, when the Government found were not equally as good for their prospects as the boundaries of three years .ago, were the Government justified in 'flouting an Act of Parliament ?

I feel that the absence of honourable members who are interested in it the absolute conspiracy of silence which we have witnessed very largely in this decbate not say that.

It is not my business to know the reasons which have affected various lionorable members in coming to a vote; but I do think that those who are in favour of this measure must feel that it is not altogether a question of the rights of the people that is being considered. It is a selfish thing that-Parliament, having posed before the country in a democratic spirit, should now, at the instigation of the Ministry, set at nought the principles which the very Constitution itself created, and which our own Act confirms. Personally, if I were standing for Parliament again, I should certainly have to speak before the electors of this country in no unmeasured terms. I do not wish to prolong the debate unnecessarily; but I do say that men who do a thing like this under the guise of democracy are not to be trusted by the democracy of Australia. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I think that the proposed boundaries that the object of the present action of the Government is well known. It is to prevent the country districts in New South Wales and Victoria being deprived of a member, the effect of which would be to give an additional seat to the cities. The opponents of this proposal take up the ground that the very, foundation of the Constitution is equality of representation, or equality of numbers in each electorate; or, to put it in other words, ""one vote one value.""

I consider that the value of a vote is to be gauged by the extent to which that vote influences legislation, and influences the government of the country. Those who say that equal numbers in each electorate produce that result say what they know perfectly well to be incorrect. The city electors have enormous advantages which are denied to the country electors. They have, in the first place, density of population ; they have community of interest ; they have every possible facility for combination and organization. They live in close proximity to the polling booths and to the scat of government. The country districts have the exactconverse of these conditions. They have population scattered over an enormous area. They have diversity of interest. They have no facilities whatever for organization and combination. That is impossible in the sparsely-populated country districts. They live considerable distances from the polling booths, and they are remote from the seat of government. What is the test of whether the statement. I make is true or not ?. It is to be found in the present Eederal Parliament. The Government contend that the next elections should be conducted on basis of the present electorates.

What is "" stone-walling"" ? Isi t not an attempt on the part of the minority to override and rule the majority? While honourable members are contending so strongly in favour of majority rule, and the adoption of equal electorates, they ought not, in their own persons,fcoset the bad example of acting in direct opposition to their own principles.

The honourable member referred to the Constitution as introducing a disparity of representation on the basis of numbers, but be forgetsfchatfchafconly applies to the Senate. MrA . McLEAN -Which has co-equal powers with the House of Representatives. the House of Representatives is, as far as possible, representation in proportion to numbers. Each State, under section 24 of the Constitution, is to be divided for the purpose of electing members to the House of Representatives in proportion to the respective numbers of the people. That is expressly provided, and it is emphatic, because the election is by "" the people of the Commonwealth""-word s which are not found even in the American Constitution. Numerical representation is the basis of the House of Representatives, and this Bill is one which deals with the House of Representatives and not with fche Senate. The Senate is not touched by this B ill or by fche for instance, in the report offcheCommispart of the Electoral Act with which we are dealing in this Bill. The honourable member for Gippsland must, therefore, as far as possible, follow the principle of the repreadopted by this Bill, that is the old State sentation of the House of Representatives, and that, under the Constitution, is numerical. It is also under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act properly numerical. I , therefore, cannot for the life of me undernow. stand how the honourable member proposes fco follow thafc principle by saying that there should be representation given to the country districts which is not based upon numbers. Theframers of the Constitution did not draw these distinctions. Victoria hasfchelargest city population of any of the States, but the framers of the Constitution did nofc on that account say that Victoria was entitled to a smaller reputation than any of the other States. The argument of the honourable member for Gippsland would apply with equal force to the whole of the representation of Victoria, and on his argument Victoria has received a greater share of representation than she is entitled to on the basis of her country population. I am afraid that the honourable member in going back upon the principles of democracy is treading upon rather dangerous ground. MrA . McLEAN -Ifc is of no use to. speak about the principle of representation being numerical when we knowfchatthe States are not given representation according to numbers in the Senate. to do with this. I have endeavoured to point out to the honourable member that this Bill appliesfcothe House of Representatives only. It deals only with the representation here, and no analogy, therefore, can be drawn from any disproportion of representation given to the States in the Senate. I am sorry that the honourable member and some other honourable members should have violated the principles which we adopted in the face of a good deal of opposition-adul t representation, and, as far as geographical delimitation will admit, representation in proportion to numbers. The Ministry are violating this principle by introducing this Bill. . 1 did not deal with a single figure when I last spoke on this question, but certainly there is no getting over the lesson taught by some of the returns. Figures showing a gross violation of the principle of numerical representation are to be found, ( sioner for New South Wales.

Bland should be ashamed to speak on this matter. quite capable of defending myself. member will be able to say more than he is saying by his interjections. According to the figures of the Commissioner, North Sydney has 31,862 electors, whilst the figures for Darling are 12,139. words, on the official returns, which we ought to follow, because they have been collected under the Electoral Act, there were 19,723 surplus electors in North Sydney as compared with Darling, and we might have carved one and a-half electorates as large as that of Darling out of the surplus in North Sydney. Surely that is not a principle of representation consistent with democracy, with the principle of adult representation, or according to numbers? Yeti t is one which the Minister for Trade and Customs is, by this Bill, asking the House to perpetuate. Let honourable members look at the electorate of Parkes, for instance. The Commissioner gives the number of voters there as 31,475, whilst the number given for Riverina is 14,920. There is therefore a surplus of 16,555 in Parkes as compared with Riverina, or more than would I question the accuracy permit of the carving out of another district equal in numbers to Riverina. Such a distribution as tliis means practically in the case of North Sydney, as compared with Darling, the disfranchisement of 20,000 electors. Is that representation in proportion to numbers? Is that a democratic principle ? The honourable member for Bland says that the number of electors in the country districts are increasing, and on that point I refer the honourable member to the report of the Commissioner to show that that officer took into account the possibilities of population returning to some of the districts when the drought began to abate. This is what I desire the honourable member for Bland to bear in mind when he proposes able member has said that in some of the country districts the numbers Ijave recently been very largely increased. I find that I heard of that. Let us Riverina, under tlie division proposed by the Commissioner for New iSouth Wales, would have had 18,i562 voters, which would give between 4,000 and 5,000 more than will be given to that district if the principle represented in this Bill is followed.

He saysAn examination of the number of electors allocated to the proposed divisions, as set out in the table given in paragraph 1, will show that while high numbers have been adopted with thicklypopulated areas, such as the divisions of the city of S3'dney and suburbs and Newcastle, moderate or low numbers have been assigned to the divisions in the central or western districts, and to some offchecoastal divisions. The principle of this distribution of numbers rests largely on the assumption thafc, given a return to more favorable seasons,fchecountry population will naturally expand. I cannot say howfchehonorable member for Bland can discard the recommendation of the Commissioner, in the expectation that there will be an immense migration of voters within about twelve months, when the Commissioner says that he has already taken that into account in the division which he has suggested.",26,Smith Th E Quota Under Be Dealt With By The Commission Which

Perhaps, in his reply, or in Committee, the Minister will say for what period the measure is to have force. In my opinion, the Ministry are very much to blame, not only for having violated the principle of the Electoral Act, but for having put those who support them in a difficulty by nofc introducing the motions relating to fche proposed distributions at a time when the provisions of the Electoral Act could be complied with, and new distributions asked for in those cases where the original distributions did not meet with approval.

Hacl a complete roll been supplied to him a very different set of divisions would have heen arranged. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN W as the roll sufficiently defective to justify the setting aside of the proposed distribution ? fectiveness of the roll justified us in retaining the existing divisions. The le'-ider of the Opposition, in speaking in Sydney the other evening, seemed to be unaccountably mixed, because he quoted the recent increase in the number of male electors as some justification for the attitude which he has taken. matter to justify his contention that the proposed distribution should have been returned to the Commissioner. not correctly reported.

The Electoral Acfc requires that the first proposed distribution shall be made public for a period of thirty days, and that the Commissioner must furnish the report to the Minister within a certain time after the end of that period. If the same procedure must be adopted in regard to a second distribution, 1 am afraid that there is not now timefor one to be made. repeal the provision in the Electoral Act requiring the thirty days publication than to pass the Bill1 a new publication. The crux of the whole position is bhis: That in July, 1902, when the roll furnished tofche New South Wales Commissioner was compiled, the drought was at ifcs worse, and there had been a steady diminution of population in the greater part of the western district. . The commissioner emphasizes the fact in paragraph 26 of his report, when hesaysExamination disclosed isolated centres or knots-, of voting power, more or less remote from each other, and scattered over immense tracts of country, at the best of times never more than sparsely populated, but, at the present, practically depopulated. Similar evidence is given by every person acquainted with the condition of thewestern country. The figures obtained from official sources by the Right Honourable the G. H . Reid, and reproduced in the Sydney DaUy Telegraph of Saturday last, showed' that there were 96,500 voters in nine country electorates in 1901 ; that that numberhad been reduced to 89,915 in 1902; and that in August, 1903, the number had again risen to 94,104. Therefore, it wasclear that since the general rains had fallen population had been flowing back to the western districts. The figures related to male electors only; and, of course, the increase would have been larger if female voters had also been taken into account. The fact that the increase has been much largeris demonstrated by the figures quoted by the has Minister wifch respect to the Barrier, Darling, and Riverina electorates. It is shown that within the last thirteen months thereI am inclined to take has been an increase of 5,734 voters in these electorates, as compared with the number on the roll at the time Mr Houston made his distribution. Still, the returns are incomplete, because more names have yet to come in. So far, over 9,000 names have-",29,William Lyne I Do Not Know To Correct The Figures I Quote The Honor

I blame the Government for not having taken earlier steps to give effect to the law. A number of honourable members have repeatedly asked whether steps were being taken to have the distributions made at the -earliest possible opportunity, and I regret that the Minister did not see fit to take steps in New South Wales, as in other -States, to have a special roll collected for Federal purposes. Sir WILLIAM LYNE -course there as elsewhere. but not in bhe first instance. Mr Houston had to work on rolls collected long before the time at which he began his distribution. Furthermore, they were collected on the basis of the State franchise, with the result that a number of electors who would be qualified to vote under the Federal franchise were omitted. That, was a mistake, and if other steps had been taken I am sure thab much of bhe trouble now being experienced would have been avoided. this stage I shall content myself with making a further protest against what I regard as one of the most unfortunate steps taken in connection with this Parliament. We cannot be too delicate with regard to our actions in respect to the distribution of the States into electorates, and after we had deliberately passed the Electoral Act it was the business of the Minister to see that ib was brought into f u l l operation. In any event, the divisions, however arrived at, should be based upon greater equality than is now secured. The Minister seemed to quite overlook the necessity for giving effect to the Federal legislation. He mentioned the fact that the discrepancies between the Sbates electorates were greater than in the existing Federal divisions, and he argued from that that there was no necessity for a change. He seemed to think that if the Sbates were content to put up with discrepancies, we should not complain. I wonder whether the Minister would be prepared to urge a similar excuse for not carrying into effect other laws passed by this Parliament. Take, for I instance, the Pacific Island Labourers Act. Would the Minister come down, and say"" I have not taken the necessary steps to carry that A ct into effect, because, after all, bhe laws of the State are very objectionable, and the people will be no worse off under my neglect than they would have been under the State laws ?"" When we pass laws, are we to be told that we should nofc bother about effecting improvements because' the States have previously taken no action to bring about bebber conditions 1 The Minisber stated thafc the margin provided for in the Act was not so large as that first proposed. But I would point out o that he did not fight for the larger margin. cumstances quite distinctly. The Minister did not brouble bo divide bhe Committee. When I asked him why he did not call for a division, he said it was of no use. I told him that he would have received the support of a number of members offcheOpposition. He did nofc test the feeling of the Committee, and therefore cannot say what attitude a majority of honourable members would have taken.

The honourable member for Gippsland objected to the proposed distributions on the ground that in both New South Wales and Victoria the country electorates have been deprived of one member. I would point out, however, that irrespective of drought conditions in the country, the larger proportion of women settled in the cities and towns would, upon the extension of the franchise to females, necessarily add to the voting strength of those The honourable member for Gippsland referred to the principle of one vote one value. margin is allowed in favour of the country districts-a ject-but the honourable member treated the matter as if no allowance had been made. I can show the honourable member that in that regard he has proceeded upon a wrong assumption. Australia, Victoria, New South and Queensland, under the new division the average number of electors in the city and suburban is ,4,297 in excess of the average in the country electorates. compared with fche country 103,12S voters in the metropolitan and suburban electorates are unrepresented. the face of these figures, how can the Minister say that he does not desire to disfranchise a large body of voters. Upon the metropolitan and suburban basis the country electorates are given representation for 1.76,177 electors more than they possess. Surely thafc advantage gives much greater value to the country vote. In the metropolitan of New South Wales under the new divisions the average number of electors is 9,558 in excess of fche average in fche country districts. Consequently, as compared with the countiy districts, 35,779 metropolitan and suburban electors are unrepresented. both these cases I credit the country electorates with the full number of electors resident in certain towns and cities, such as Ballarat, Newcastle, ito, although-even the line of argument pursued by the honourable member for Gippsland-they entitled to consideration on account of a sparsely settled population. tonishing feature is that the honourable member for Gippsland has nofc observed that Mr Thomson. as between one country electorate and another, under the old divisions, there exist3an enormous difference. In New South Wales, for example, fche country division of"" Richmond, which has nofc suffered from, drought, contains only 16,000 electors; and that of Werriwa, which has not suffered seriously, only 18,000 electors ; whereas the divisions of New England and Hunter contain 23,000 and 24,000 voters respectively. Thus we find that in certain country districts which have not been seriously affected by drought a difference of 50 per divisions. cent, exists in their representation. How does the honourable member for Gippsland, or tbe Minister, justify his support of this Bill Under the Act a cousiderable when such alarming discrepancies are disclosed, not as between city and country margin to which I do not obconstituencies, but as between country and countiy electorates ? The honourable member for Gippsland declared that consideration should be extended to the country, and I am not averse to that being done. HeIn four of the Stafces, South based his argument upon the fact that in Wales, sparsely-populated country districts ifc is more difficult for electors to exercise their franchise, and that, consequently, a lesser constituencies number of votes, should be required fcoreturn a member than would be needed if"" That means that, as we insisted upon an actual equality in fchedivisions, votes recorded. If fche honourable memberis not satisfied with the large margin In which has already been granted to the country electorates, his argument should' carry him further. On that principle Victoria having a more closely populated country than New South Wales or Queensland-woul d be entitled to smallerrepresentation than would those States. W ill the honourable inember for Gippsland endorse his argument to that extent?. Doe* and suburban electorates he maintain that the more densely populated portions of Victoria should receivelesser representation than the sparsely peopled districts of New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia ? I anv sure thafc he does not, although-that is the In logical outcome .of his argument. The honorable member also affirmed that a number of honourable members are really representatives of the city, because they resideon in Sydney and Melbourne. He stated that the residence of a member shows where his are not interests lay, and what district he ismost likely to represent effectively. I doBufc the asnot share that view at all. I fchink that a member may live in tbe city, and f a it h f u l l y represent a country constituency. The' honourable member for Gippsland himself does that. Similarly, a man may live in the country, and faithfully represent a city constituency. The larger number of honourable members of this Chamber reside in Melbourne, although some represent other States. But will the honourable member for Gippsland argue that that fact makes them representatives of Melbourne ? it. honourable member they ought to show it . The honourable member for Gippsland declares that Sydney really has eighteen representatives and Melbourne fifteen. honourable members to whom he referred are permanent residents of Sydney. they are permanent residents of Sydney any more than arc some members who reside in Melbourne. all chosen by the electors. to the honourable member for Gippsland, Melbourne is the best represented portion of -the Federal territory. MrA . McLEAN -S o it is, I believe. able member whether those representatives have not been deliberately selected by their constituencies as the individuals who, of all the candidates who solicited their suffrages, would best represent their interests? Would the alterations of the divisions have the slightest effect upon that? Those honourable members were elected upon the existing divisions MrA . McLEAN -Which the honourable membei declares are unjust to the city. that. MrA . McLEAN -The party with which the honourable member is associated has said so. There is not only a difference as between the city and country electorates, but as between country and country constituencies. The numbers of voters in the country electorates themselves vary by as much as 50 per cent. That is evidenced in the case of the Richmond division, which contains only 16,000 electors, as against the adjoining electorate of New England, which contains between 23,000 and 24,000 voters. Neither of these districts has suffered materially from the drought, and yet the same differences and inequalities exist. There is the same over-representation in the one case, and the same under-representation in the other, that exists between city and country electorates. The fifteen honourable members who reside ih Melbourne, and the eighteen who are resident in Sydney, were elected under the very divisions to which we are now asked to revert. MrA . McLEAN I mentioned that as a proof that tlie city did not suffer under the existing divisions. country think that they will be better rethey prove it by casting a majority of votes in his favour. MrA . McLEAN In the country districts it is due to local jealousy as between one township and another. will always exist under any division that may be effected. The honourable member for Bland based his objection to the scheme recommended by the New South Wales Commissioner upon the ground that sufficientallowance had not been made for the effects of the drought. I cannot understand how any one can sustain that objection in view of the statement of the Commissioner himself. He says distinctlyThe principle ot distribution of numbers rests largely on the assumption that given a return to more favorable seasons the country population, will naturally expand, the rapidity of the expansion being regulated hy the character of the settlers, climatic conditions, quality of the soil,. He also says, that because of climatic conditions he has given a much larger representation to the drought-stricken districts than that to which they would otherwise be entitled, and he justifies his action by stating that if the. seasons improve the extra representation which he has allowed them will be justified. Yet some honourable members persist in declaring that no such allowancehas been made. I repeat that an allowancehas been made. I have proved my statement by the figures I have quoted, which show that in four States, the country as compared with the metropolis hassecured representation for 177,000 electors more than it contains. I am not opposed to consideration being extended to the country districts, and I do not say that this consideration has been improperly extended.",31,William Lyne I Do Not Know To Correct The Figures I Quote The Honor

I object to dealing with the matter as if no allowance in that direction had been made, when, as a matter -of fact, an enormous allowance has been made. honourable member for Bland have never in their whole history contained a population which would justify a larger representation than the Commissioner has accorded them. The honourable member declared that the roll was taken when the drought was at its height-a fact whioh has been allowed for, as i have demonstrated-and -an imperfect roll, because it was collected upon the basis of the State roll. I quite admit that it was collected upon the State basis, and I think it was very wrong that it should have been so collected. I cannot understand why we should incur all the expense of doing a thing that will afterwards prove to be useless. However, for some extraordinary reason, it was collected upon the State basis. But that fact affected the city and suburban electorates as well as the countiy. -which ban electorate, because it embraces a large -country area-according to the latest figures from the Electoral Office, contained about 2,000 more electors than are comprised in the lists on which the old division was made. -all districts should be affected by the -collection upon the State basis because the Federal franchise than is that of the State. An elector has to be resident in a State for only six months -instead the States laws-in order to be entitled to have his name placed on a Federal roll; and he has to be resident for only one month in. -an electorate, instead of three months, to secure the right to vote for that division. We have also to remember that people in receipt of charitable relief are admitted to our franchise, although they are excluded from the States franchise. There is a very large number of these people, but their names did not appear on the States rolls on which the divisions were made. In this respect alone the number of electors will be largely increased, for there are some thousands of people in our charitable institutions,and, for the most part, their names will be placed on the rolls for city and suburban electorates. The divisions were made without any consideration tlie honourable member for Bland has shown Mr Thomson. by the figures which he quoted that there is really very little in the demand for the rejection of the new schemes on the ground submitted by tbe Minister. The honourable The districts alluded to by the member said that in nine electorates, representing a very large portion of New South Wales, and comprising that part of fche State which was effected to any extent by the recent drought, there were, in 1901, 96,500 electors, and in 1902 only 90,000. A similar reduction also uook place in the city and suburban divisions, and I fchink it that it was was due largely to the failure to add the new arrivals in the electorates. But, in 1902, there were 94,000 electors, or within 2,500 of the number which was to be found there before the drought had had any serious effect in removing population in the country. According fco the honourable member's figures, that is the whole difference between the number of electors who resided in these constituencies afc a time when the drought was most severely felt, and those who are to be found fchere Por example, North Sydney at the present day. What, then, becomes is not altogether a city and suburof the objection? It falls absolutely to the ground, and, as I have already said, we must search for other reasons for the rejection of the new divisions. The honourable member for Bland also quoted certain figures submitted by the Minister, and It is very natural that stated fchat a roll which had recently been collected showed that, as compared with the rolls on which the Commissioner made his is more liberal distributian, there was an increase of 5,734 electors in three divisions. But even that increase does not bring the number of twelve months, as required by of electors in these electorates anywhere near the quota. The Minister states that when the Revision Court is held more names will be added to the roll. The Court will sit in October or November next; but even if we adopted the distribution placed before us by the Commissioners the Court would still be held, and all who desired to do so could then have their names placed on the rolls. The whole argument falls to the ground. There is no substance in the reasons given, and not one of them will bear examination. The only reason that would bear a moment's consideration would be a statement on the part of honourable members thafc-""We have changed our minds since the passing of the Electoral Act. We think that ifc is wrong. We are not going to recognise it ; and at some of thafc fact. Then future date we shall endeavour to secure the passing of an amending B ill . "" But are honourable members prepared to say anything of the kind ? I was pleased to hear the honourable inember for Bland say that he considered that if proper arrangements .were made, and a shortening of the process which relation to the making of the distributions of the States, were attempted, a redistribution might yet be made. I trust he will give his support to such a proposal. now to make a redistribution ? scribed by the Act were shortened a redistribution could be made in time for the next elections. the Electoral Act. ing it. If the honourable member does not desire a redistribution he will of course refuse to accept my view of this matter. If he does not desire to see the principles of the Electoral Act carried into effect-if he does not wish fco overcome any difficulty which has arisen, or to secure representation in accordance with the new list, with which the Minister declares himself to be thoroughly satisfied-h e will oppose any redistribution of the States. I noticed a .statement published in the press to-day to the effect that the Minister considers it remarkable that the Electoral Ofiice should have succeeded in compiling rolls which so closely approximate the census returns. If that be so why should we nofc take the necessary steps to enable us to avail ourselves of the perfected rolls, and to go to the country somewhat on the lines which we declared in passing the Electoral Bill to be the proper ones t I have no doubt that there are honourable members in this House who could readily draft proposals which would overcome any technical difficulty. We should recognise thafc we afc last have rolls as nearly perfect as they are ever likely to be, and thafc, by reducing the time within which objectionsfcoa proposed scheme musfc be lodged, we could have the States divided entirely in conformity with the A ct we have passed. I am not urging that in fche redistribution there should be an equal quota for town and country divisions, bufc that there should be a reasonable allowance in favour of the country districts to cover all the contingencies .which the honourable member for Gippsland has pointed out. If that course were adopted there would be no> stain upon our actions such as must mark them if we deliberately declare in favour of electing a new Federal.

My surprise is that the acquiescence of the Labour Party has been given in such a docile manner to this attempt on the part of the Minister to stultify the whole of the work of the Commissionerswho were appointed on non-political principles to redistribute the States of the Commonwealth into Federal electorates. We have heard to-day an admissiona very fair, candid, and honourable admission-that the leader of the Labour Party feels that he and his followers occupy an extraordinary position. He said, I think, that he felt there was an incongruity in their position in standing here to-day, and practicallyassenting to this measure. Buti t was very satisfactory to hear the same honorable member admit that there would be some reason in an alternative proposal to send back these divisions to the Commissioners, and, with that view, to reduce thetime within which, under the Electoral Act,.",33,Chapman Th E Eighteen Presented By A City Resident Or Vice Versd

One has to ask himself really what is the question before the House. I confess that if I, as a visitor, had been told that a Government of the-Commonwealth practically to neglect this matter for two years, and then at the end of 1902-two years after the inauguration of the Commonwealth-for have the States divided into electorates, I should have been utterly surprised to think that a Parliament would consent to such delay. But that is the fact; because, whatever difficulty is now arising, and whatever anomaly or contradiction may now arise out of the extraordinary this House, being within a few months of the next election, is placed, by reason the Government question, cannot be accounted for in any other way than by the utter indifference of the Ministry to the necessity of placing the divisions upon a perfectly equitable basis for the second election of the Commonwealth. The Minister, as a member of the Government, succeeded in carrying the Electoral Bill which is now upon our statute book, and which provides very properly, as was pointed out duriug the debate which took place some days ago, that ifc is an essential feature of any equitable division of the States that the work shall be carried out by an absolutely impartial and non-political tribunal. aware the Commissioners were selected wibh great care, their selection being due to the fact that they were absolutely unconnected wifch the political life of the Sfcabes or of the Commonwealth So far as the personnel of the Commissioners is concerned, no one could offer any objection to the results of their labours. They were appointed, however, at a time when the great objection which is now being offered to their schemes either existed or might have been anticipated. The drought was then afc ifcs heighfc, and all fche difficulties as to the movements Mr Bruce Smith. in population, which are now brought I hope that before this Bill forward as an excuse for the rejection of these schemes could 'then have been foreseen. No misgivings were then exwish, to have the rejected pressed by the Ministry as to the probable value of the results of the Commissioners' investigations ; but as soon as the schemes of distribution were returned to the Government it was discovered fchat they did not suit ten honourable members-certainly from New South Wales-wh o happen to vote with the Ministry. I know that the Minister is prepared to repudiate any such sughad been able gestion, but I submit to the House that in the absence of any other reason which will stand a moment's investigation, the only logical conclusion to which the public can the first time to take steps to come in regard to the opposition to the Commissioner's scheme for the distribution of New South Wales is that ten out of twenty-six representatives of that State find that ifc will be highly inconvenient to go to the country at the next elections upon the divisions recommended by him. ment is absolute! v untrue. of the utter negligence of for New England must withdraw that in reference to this remark.

""Are we, with our democratic Constitution, to perpetuate that anomaly, while the reports can be returned to the Commissioners on the ground that the population has returned to the districts it had left ?

I desire to show that the statements which were made by the Minister to the effect that the conditions with regard to population in New South Wales have so completely changed that it would be an injustice to allow the electoral divisions to be made, even on the present figures, are a mistake and a misrepresentation, whether intentional or not. In the Barrier constituency, which is represented' by a gentleman who supported the Government in the rejection of the Commissioner's report, the male population ""in 1901 was 10,290, and in 1902-3 was 9,596, showing a shortage of 700.

In the Riverina in 1901 the male constituents numbered 9,944, and they had decreased in 1902-3 to 9,349, but last month they had increased to 9,362, or only 600 short of 10,000. In Canobolas in 1901 the male constituents numbered 10,641, and had been reduced in 1902-3 to 10,066, but at the present time the number is 10,305, or a difference of only 300 as compared with 1901.

215,Mr Brucesmith,"If those state11,356. In Gwydir, in 1901, the male electors numbered 11,633, and in 1902-3 they had dropped to 10,910, but last month they were 11,387, or only 240 below the figures of 1901. In Hume, the constituency represented by the Ministeri n charge of the Bill, the. number of male electors in 1901 -was 1.0,872, and in 1902-3 it was 10,180, but last month the figure had increased to 10,763, or only 100 below the figures of 1901. with ten constituencies, six of which are represented by honourable members who assisted the Governmeut to reject the division made by non-political and impartial Commissioners. I have shown that, in August of this year, the male electors were within a trifle of their number in 1901. What becomes of the authoritative statements, made to this House-in order to induce honourable members to follow the advice of the Minister -that the country has been so denuded of its population by the drought that it would be an absurdity to make the division of New South Wales ou the basis of the population as shown immediately before the present time? The-figures I have given completely stultify the statements of the Minister, and ought to show honourable members that the statements made by the honourable gentleman are not based on the facts as supplied by the head of the Department over which he presides. before 1901. drought in the time of Noah, but I am dealing with the century in which we live. WhatI contend is that, if the population has returned to those parts of the country to which I have referred, the proper course for the House is not to reject the reports, but to send them back to the Commissioners, so that we may have them revised in time for the next election. How can any member of the House, who professes to believe in equal representation, possibly justify voting for a Bill which has the effect of pepetuating the state of things which prevails in the electorates of Parkes and Darling? What objection can any honourable member have to sending the report back to the Commissioner in order that he may reexamine the whole question, and again report in time for the elections ? The Electoral Act provides that, after the division has been made, the electors shall have an opportunity of objecting within thirty days. I hope somebody will propose that, instead of perpetuating the unequal, inequitable, unfair, and undemocratic divisions on which this House was elected, we shall take some steps to have the matter again referred to impartial Commissioners, in order that they may divide the electorates, in view of the fact that the population has returned to the parts of the country which accofding to the Minister, were denuded in I have given bhe figures connected drought time. The honourable member for Wentworth has very properly pointed out, that when these Commissioners were appointed the drought was in existence, and, as we all know, there are passages in the report of the Commissioner for New South Wales which show that the state of things which existed prior to his entering on the re-adjustment was of the worse possible character. The Commissioner tells us that no less than fifteen out of the twenty-six electorates absolutely transgressed the legal extremes. The honourable members for Victoria and other States ought to remember that the effect of this Bill is to perpetuate that state of things. If the Bill be passed it will become a description not only of a past state of things, but of a state of things which this House is asked to perpetuate. The honourable member for Wentworth pointed out that the Commissioner' for Victoria showed in the body of his report that he had taken the drought into consideration and provided for it. If we look at this, question from the simplest logical standpoint, we are in the position that the Minister, having the burden of proof on him, first, to show why the proposed division should be rejected, gave as his one and only -reason the drought. That statement, however, as I have said, is completely stultified 'by the figures I have placed before honourable members. In the second place, the Minister is now endeavoring to induce the House to perpetuate the unequal state of things of which we are all aware. It is a perpetuation which is not necessary, because if the period of thirty days in which electors may object, were reduced to, say, fourteen days or seven days, there is no reason why these reports should not be returned to the Commissioners. 'This might give us something like an equitable and, if honourable members please, a democratic division of the electors.

I cannot understand why inore interest is not taken in this measure. It may be because it is not understood. But when I tell honourable members that the -extraordinary anomaly of having 32,000 voters in one electorate as against 12,000 in another, is only typical of half-a-dozen -or a dozen constituencies in New South Wales, they will understand why honourable members representing that State are a little indignant at an attempt to continue such a state of things. but Langin which so great a disparity exists? North Sydne} . I may tell the honourable 7 .member, also, that Darling is not the only constituency iu which there is a comparatively small number of voters. There are .five other constituencies in which the electors come within 1,000 of the number in the electorate of Darling. There is one constituency with 12,000, another with 13,000, -and another with 14,000. member quotes an extreme instance and says that it is typical of the others. typical within a few hundreds. I may tell the honourable member that I did not select the extreme case when I selected Parkes, because in Lang there is a still higher number of electors. honourable and learned member was referring to Lang. ferring to Parkes, my own constituency. There are 32,000 in Dalley, 30,000 in Parkes, 31,475 in North Sydney, and -31,800 in Lang. The honourable member will see that there are four constituencies which have 30,000 voters and over that -number; there are two others in which there are 28,000 voters, and one in which there are 29,000 voters. division of Lang there are 35,000. division of Lang there -are 35,000. If the honourable inember for Coolgardie is in any doubt about the constituencies having .lower numbers, he will find a number, of such constituencies with which to compare those which have a larger number qf voters. Melbourne with 37,000 voters each. say that there are at least eight constituencies in New South Wales in which the representation would be only as two to five as compared with eight other constituencies in the same State. That is a state of things which one maj' read of in connection with the Reform Bill of 1832. It is a sort of thing which, when we read of it in history, we wonder why it should have been allowed to continue. member need go back only a few years into the history of New South Wales to find a worse condition of things. worse, but ought it to be worse? And ought this House, in a country like Australia, to tolerate that kind of thing? I point out to honourable members that there is a means of avoiding the difficulty. A l though the divisions which were submitted by the Commissioners, and subsequently rejected by the House, may have been far from equitable, no honourable member can contend that they provided for a state of things nearly so inequitable as that which we are now being asked to make I say that it is permanent. Unless our boasted love of equality in parliamentary representation and our boasted democracy are mere shams for electioneering purposes, we should stand together, and insist upon something being done, if it can .be done, which I understood that the will, at least, remove the anomalies it is now proposed to continue. However much iny impartiality may be doubted in this matter, it is a fact which cannot be got over that ten honourable members coming from New South Wales have voted with the Government for the rejection of the proposed division of tlieir own State. It is not for me to attribute motives, and I have no disposition to say that honourable members have been actuated in this matter with a desire to convenience themselves. But I do say that that is a construction which suspicious in the new people might very well put upon their action. It behoves every honourable member, in view And in the new of the coming elections, to be able to go before his constituents and say that he did his utmost to prevent the continuation of the wicked state of things which I have brought before tlie House, and that he did so, nob merely in connection with his own State, but in order to help the representatives",40,Smith H E Is The Only The Number Of Male Electors Was 11 356

229,Mr Bruce Smith,"It might beof other States to put the divisions of those States upon a more equitable basis. It is to be done and done easily. The Minister has not shown the House tliat these divisions cannot be sent back to the Commissioners to be modified so as to suit the altered state of things resulting from the return of people to different Seeing that the step which the House is asked to take here is to choose between insisting upon the Commissioners being asked to modify their first reports in view of the return of people to the constituencies, and the continuation of the wickedly unfair and inequitable state of things I have put before honourable members, some such action as I have suggested ought to be taken. The burden of proof in this matter is upon the Minister. that. appointed to give a decision upon a certain thing, whetlier it be a judge or an arbitrator, and some one who may be interested desires to upset that decision, we all recognise that the burden of proof rests on the man who desires to alter the de terminal ion.

The honourable gentleman should show why, with three or four months before us, we should deliberately tolerate a state of things which we actually passed a Bill to correct. is our position. The chief object of the Commonwealth Electoral Act was to enable us to provide for the holding of the next elections upon an equitable basis, and to appoint impartial men to make the divisions.

253,Mr Joseph Cook,"If we had knownadults of the States. The most trumpery arguments have been used to justify a radical departure from fundamental principles. Some honourable, members have gone out of their way to besmirch the character of the Commissioners; others have belittled the Commissioners, whilst others have resorted to the most trumpery pretexts for voting against the proposed distributions. Objection was taken to the report of the Commissioner for Western Australia because a few people in Subiaco were cut off from Perth and attached to Eremantle. On this ground, and others equally trivial, we were asked to reject the scheme of the Commissioner, who was declared by the Miuister for Home Affairs to be the most competent man in that State to undertake the task, in the case of Queensland, the Commissioner's proposal was rejected although several representatives of that State declared themselves favourably disposed towards it . The facfc that a trial draft of the distribution was made forty-eight hours before' that which was finally sent in by the Commissioner formed the sole basis for the assumption that he had been interfered with, and that he had allowed himself to be subjected to influences which rendered him unfit to discharge a high public duty. Strange to say, the only two schemes which have found acceptance relate to States in which the most rigid lines as bo the quote have been adopted, and in which no disbincbion has been made bebween electors residing in the country and those in the city. With regard to New Soubh Wales, ib has been argued that if the report of the Commissioner had been adopted, community of interest would not have been preserved. One is led to inquire what community of interest exists at present. Eor instance, whab communiby'of interest is therebetween the Wyalong miners and the farmers and pastoralists in the Bland division ? Then, again, what community of interest is there between bhe miners of bhe Barrier and the rest of the population in that division, who are mainly engaged in pastoral pursuits ? The honourable member for Illawarra represents aboub 1,500 miners, and all the rest of the electors in his division are farmers, or are engaged in kindred pursuits. In the case of my own electorate, bhe Commissioner proposed to make changes in the direction of securing greater communiby of inberesb; bub his proposal was rejected, and bhe present diversity of interest is to be perpebuated. 9Q honourable member for Macquarie represenbsa large number of miners at Biayney, Capertee, and other places, and he has a petition to present from the miners resid-r ing in one portion of his electorate, who have no community of interest with the farmers and producers who constitute the main body of the voters. It is almost impossible to secure complete community of interest in every division, and under present conditions the most glaring anomalies occur. The Commissioner endeavoured to bring about community of interest as far as possible. He says that he did his best in that direction, but that there were necessarily some flaws in his scheme. These have been seized upon as a pretext for pitchforking the report out of the House. I should like to know whether the Minisber expects the Commissioners whose reports have been rejected to undertake any more work for him. I do nofc hesitate to say that he would not get any more work out of me if I were one of bhe Commissioners. I should not undertake anything more for a Minister who criticised my work in the way that he has criticised theirs. Whereas honourable members picked all sorts of holes in the work of the Commissioners, no one attempted to berate the Commissioners themselves. When fault was found with the work of the Commissioner for 'Victoria, one honourable member afber another said that .the distribution made by him was not a-bad one for a first attempt. . I venture to say that nofc one honourable member knows a. half or a quarter so much about the State which he represents as does the Commissioneiwho was appointed to distribute that State. Do honourable members suppose that theCommissioners have not read the Act, and tliat they have not made an honest attempt to give effect to ifc 1 Dofcheysuppose that community of interest has been ignored 1 All the Commissioners emphasize the difficulties with which they had to contend and the peculiar problems they were called upon to solve. There is no doubt that they have very closely studied the Acfc, and that they have done their best to carry oufcfche'instructions given to fchem. They say bhat owing to special geographical features, the trouble arising from sparseness of population in eerbain localities, and the peculiar way in which boundaries were arranged, they had a very difficult task to perform, and that they have done their best under the The circumstances. Honourable members have mot said one word regarding the good recommendations of the Commissioners. It features of the work accomplished by the is that the fuller the information the more Commissioners. that they should be given full credit for the has in view. The division list will show that admirable results achieved under the most those in regard to which the vote of the difficult conditions. have gone about with a Federal microscope in which the information was most complete. ia order to find flaws in the work of the Reports have been submitted which, by Commissioners. very fond of referring to the Federal honourable member for Dalley as "" pockefctelescope, and fco tlie State but in this particular members microscope in the Federal laboratory, and had been taken. have magnified every little flaw.

259,Mr Joseph Cook,"When will it be Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth.out in the middle of December. cally no objections were lodged against the schemes recommended by the Commissioners. Honourable members talk a.bout watching the interests of the country electors. are the objections of the country people to those schemes ? Are the country residents utter simpletons who do not know what is being doneby their Parliamentary representatives? used by some honourable members. have been told that the people do not take sufficient interest in these matters. My experience is that they are just as familiar with what is going on in Parliament as are the Members of Parliament themselves, and we shall probably verify the truth of that assertion when we have to go before them. During the whole course of mypolitical life I have never found the people whom I represent wanting in appreciation or in criticism of my political actions. They know exactly what is going on in Parliament, and therefore this assumed parental control which members have affected over the poor benighted electors in the country is entirely gratuitous. It is indeed insulting to them as electors, and is not in any way in accordance with the facts urge that the reason why more objections have not been lodged against the several schemes is that people in the country do not take as much interest in tl iese matters as they ought to do. 1 assert that the people in the country are prepared and willing to take the responsibility of their failure to look into these matters, and of any want of care of which they may have been guilty. have never seen any want of keenness in their attention to political matters, and I contend that this objection cannot hold good. If , then, the residents of country are familiar with what is taking place, why have there not been more objections than have been lodged with the Commissioners ? I believe that some seven or eight objections were lodged against the scheme prepared by the Commissioner for Victoria, while in one of the reports which were dealt with by us last week it was stated that two-and only two-objections it. Those objections were lodged by honourable members. I am not quite clear whether an honourable member of this House, apart from the substantial body of electors outside, ought to object to any of these schemes. Mr Joseph Cool;. Practisetting up the position fchat an honourable member is not equally entitled with an elector outside the House to criticise the work of the Commissioners, but I contend Where fchafc he is entitledfcocriticise them only as an elector, and certainly not as a Member of Parliament. I repeat thafc we have no right to be fixing up little nests for ourselves. We have no right to set up a little That argument, I am aware, is electoral building for ourselves, and to warn We off all the Commissioners of the States and all the legislative machinery of the country from the little snug buildings that we have completed for ourselves. This is not, after all, a member's question;' it is a people's question, and therefore an honourable member has no right, other than that possessed by every other elector in the community, to criticise the work of fche Commissioners, or the drafting of fche schemes. Ifc is an ugly fact for the Minister, and the majority behind him to overcome, that the schemes which have been rejected are those to which there has been very little objection urged by the people, who are primarily responsible. They are quite content with the new divisions, and it is only honourable members who find these many and varied objections to the Commissioners' proposals. That being so, we Honourable members have to look for reasons for the opposition other than the suggestion that in these schemes there is no regard to community of interest. We have to go below fche surface of the question and to try and find the reason within this House-nof c outside of it -for the extraordinary action of Parliament at the present moment. This matter furnishes a fine commentary on the adminisI tration of the Government. I remember that months ago, in the very first speech which I made upon the floor of this House after the opening of fche present session, I districts warned the Minister that it was time that the reports of the Commissioners were on the table. I . told him that he was delaying these matters for consideration at a time too perilously near the end of the session to enable them to be effectually treated. I told him also that it seemed to me that his object was to postpone this question to the latest had been lodged against moment at which it would be possible for the House to deal with it . We find that the same strangely fatuous, belated policy marks the Government's treatment of the Federal capital question. The action taken by the Government in regard to the distriI am not for an instant bution of the Commonwealth is typical of its action in relation to nearly all other important questions. The same spirit runs tlirough the whole of their administrative acts, and the most important questions are being left over for consideration at the very latest point of time at which the Parliament can deal with them. In the expiring moments of a Parliament which, one might almost suggest, judging by the state of the House, has already become moribund, one would think that the Ministry would make a final effort to get some of these important questions out of the way; but a fatal hesitation seems to have settled on -the Government, and they appear to come to the House with various proposals only when they can no longer delay them. The way in which this question has been dealt with by the Government is in accordance with the treatment of another big question which I am not at present permitted to discuss, and it is indeed typical of all their administrative acts at the present time. No one can say that they have not been warned. If one makes a suggestion the fact that it has some point is the surest reason for ifcs being immediately frowned upon and ridiculed by the Minister who happens to be in charge of the matter under consideration. I am not disappointed at the developments which have taken place in connection with this question, because I have foreseen them. Honourable members may talk as much as they like about the settlement of other important matters, bufc the time has almost gone by when there can be any effectual and adequate treatment of them by fchis Chamber. Por the first time in the history of Australia we have given the women of the Commonwealth a vote in relation to Pederal affairs, but we are, at the same time, enacting that they shall be so classified, as far as the next elections are concerned, thafc two women, within one geographical area, shall exercise no more influence uponfcheFederal Parliament than does one woman residing within another geographical area. Two or three women in the city of Melbourne are to have no more power in the election of the next Federal Parliament than one woman will have, for instance, in the electorate of Gippsland. The position will be the same in New South Wales. honourable gentleman responsible for this act of electoral repudiation-or , as I said the other night,fchisact of betrayal of the great democracy of Australia-is the one honourable member who has taken to himself more credit than has any other man in the Commonwealth Parliament for what he has done 'for the women of Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE And he will keep it , too. against fchat, I propose to put this act of betrayal of the women of Australia to his debit account. He hastened to extend the franchise to women when he found thatifccould be no longerdelayed. He got uponfcherisingtide and it carried him along to power and position. But now, on the very first occasion fchat the women are to to be lined up, so to speak, at the Federal ballot-box-a t a time when they are being told, practically, by fche Constitution, as well as by the Electoral Act, that for fche future they shall have an equal and fairly-apportioned vote so far as Federal matters are concerned-the y are also being told by this simple act of his that a restrictive classification .is to be made, and thatone woman in one part of Australia shall nofc have a voting power equal to thafc possessed by a woman residing in another part of ifc. Therefore all this talk about one vote one value-the theme of so. much eloquent declamation last night at Geelong and other parts of the Commonwealth-is neither more nor less than misleading. There is no such thing, and could be no such thing, as one vote one value under the existing grouping of fche electoral districts. What are the matters with which the next Parliament, will have to deal t The bookkeeping period will soon expire, and some of the most momentous financial considerations that this or any other Parliament has ever had to face will very shortly come before this Legislature. They cannot any longer be postponed. Are the women of Australia not to have an equal voice in the determination of these great financial questions 1 They will be subject to a States veto in the other Chamber which will to some extent modify, shall I say, or attenuate, the vote whioh is given here. The very fact that that States veto exists, and that enormous States interests will shortly come up for treatment in this House, ought fco be a reason why the vote in this Chamber should be as fairly and as The equally representative of the voice of Australia as is possible. I venture, therefore, to think that the existence of the . States veto, which is maintained in another place wherethefinancial interests of fcheStates",47,Smith H E Is The Only The Number Of Male Electors Was 11 356
260,Mr Joseph Cook,"As a set-offare supposed to be specially safeguarded as against the general interests of this Chamber, is a reason why we should have the voice of Australia, as expressed in this' House, as unfettered as possible. The question of States debts has also to be dealt with. We speak about taking over the debts of Australia; but under this scheme of distribution the next House will not be competent to deal with that question, because it will not represent the true opinion of tlie people of Australia on the subject. Let me refer, for example, to the position in New South Wales. It is well known that that State is againstall the Tariff restrictions which have been imposed, and yet under the grouping of the electoral districts we have in this House ten representatives of New South Wales who misrepresent the opinion of the majority of the people of that State. They no more represent the opinion of New South Wales than dees the man in the moon. present their own constituencies t what I am pointing out. be asked to do. out that owing to the present electoral grouping we find that ten representatives of New South Walesi n this House misrepresent the opinion held by the State on the fiscal question. from New South Wales will attempt to controvert that statement. in itself is a sufficient handicap without an attempt being made to place otheirestrictive forces within the four corners of our Electoral law. It is another reason why the electoral divisions should be as fairly and equally apportioned as possible. There are quite enough inherent anomalies in the system of grouping the electorates without placing this further imposition on the backs of the people. Then there is the question of the Tariff. I apprehend that the women of the Commonwealth will be keenly interested in the next fight over the Tariff. They will and ought to have some opportunity of saying whether tliey approve of what this Parliament has done in taxing their homes and their lives in every waya work of which I think we have no reason to be proud. It is agreed upon all hands that that work must be submitted to the electors for their judgment and approval, and the women of the Commonwealth should have an equal voice in pronouncing judgment upon a work which closely affects their lives at every point. I venture to say that if this proposal is carried into effect, and the old unequal divisions are adhered to-division s which can be justified by no appeal to intelligence or to reason; by no appeal whatever except to the most sordid, base, and ignoble considerations-the voice of Australia at the ensuing elections will not be recorded. I presume, however, that it is of no use to argue .the question if the House has made up its mind. Rut a great wrong is being done to the Commonwealth. However much I may be disposed sometimes to have a joke with honourable members at their expense and to take one in return, this question strikes me as being the most serious that the House has ever had to face during its existence. No more important question than that of the apportionment of the votes and the creation of electoral districts, so that the voice of the people may be pronounced equally, could occupy the attention of a deliberative assembly. It is of no use for the Minister to tell us airily that rigidly equal votingdoes not prevail anywhere in the Empire. AVe know tliat.

268,Mr Joseph Cook,"Instead of standmay be geographically located, we have given thein votes nominally, and the Minister is taking care that they shall be muzzled at tbe ballot-box. I make a final protest ngainst the inequity which is being perpetrated by this Bill. It is a betrayal of the people of Australia in the most important matter which they have had brought under their attention. This question will also have to be fought out in another place. We shall all have to submit ourselves to the arbitrament of the people at the polls. They will not be able to express their opinions in regard to us ns freely as they could do if we had dealt fairly with them under our electoral arrangements. But I trust there will still be power enough inherent in them to express their judgment upon this, the most important subject they will have to deal with. question of all. The question of the Tariff or of the States' debts is nothing alongside this one of the peoples' right to exercise their votes in the choice of their Parliament. All other questions are incidental to the one great issue in favour of which the people of Australia have already pronounced, and that is that every man, when face to face with his electoral responsithat you never for one moment anticipated bilities, and in determining the lines on which this Commonwealth shallproceedinthefuture, shall have an equal voice at the polls. The questions with which we have to deal have an importance reaching far into the future, and affecting the building up of the Commonwealth. But there is no question which ranks in importance beside that of seeing that the people's voice is freely expressed. That result cannot be obtained under this arrangement, because the voice of the people will be stifled. It is for that reason that I protest so strongly against this Bill. I understand that during my absence from Parliament last w eek the members of the T Opposition were engaged in a noble fight to preserve for the people of the Commonwealth the liberty which is sought to be denied to them by the Government. I am glad, indeed, that that fight succeeded, so far at all events as to enable members who happened to be absent to attend in their places, in order to urge upon Parliament the proper consideration of the question. The Minister in charge of this Bill has pointed out that he has been the advocate for the liberty of voting both for men and for women. Oh many occasions the honourable gentleman has endeavoured to show-no t with success, I admit that he alone was responsible for the women being allowed the right to record their votes. But he forgot to point out that to you, sir, during the Convention, is the credit due for the introduction of a section in the Constitution which made it imperative on the part of this Parliament to give to every woman in the Commonwealth equal rights of voting with men. It is true, Mr Speaker, that woman's suffrage was not made general under the Constitution; but inasmuch asintwo of the States, South Australia and Western Australia, the franchise had been given to women, and inasmuch as the Constitution provided that no matter what might be the opinion of the members of this Parliament they should not take away votThis is the fundamental ing power from those who had the franchise in the States, it was practically imperative that the franchise should be conferred upon women. Therefore it is not to the Minister nor to the Government nor to myself-wh o have always advocated women's suffragethat the credit is due, but to the foresight of yourself and those members of theConvention who supported your view. I a m sure, however, that the honourable gentleman wbo is now in charge of this measure would be guilty of an act whicli would prevent the possibility of women exercising the franchise in the fair and equitable manner that was intended. The Constitution provides that in the allotment of members to the various States population shall be considered ; that is to say that every man, woman, and child in the various States should be counted, and according to the quota each State should be entitled to a certain number of members. I remember that when this question was first raised i u this Parliament there was a difference of opinion in the minds of honourable members as to whether the correct statistics had been obtained. I believe that the honourable member for Kennedy qnestioned tbe accuracy of tlie figures for the State of Queensland. He moved the adjournment of the House in order to secure consideration for the question. He claimed that every adult should have the right to vote, and that the number of members for the State of Queensland should be fixed not according to the number of electors, but according to the number of all the men, women, and children living in that State.",50,Smith H E Is The Only The Number Of Male Electors Was 11 356

The Constitution does it. sion the honourable member was strongly in favour of fche terms of the Constitution being carried out, but now he and nearly every other member from Queensland seems to be taking the opposite view.

I pointed out that there was a difference of, I think, 65,000 between the male ancl female adults-no t 150,000 as stated. The 150,000 refers to fche whole of the States of the Commonwealth, and the records will show that I am correct in stating' that I pointed out that at all events there was a difference that ought to be inquired into by the Government. But did the Government take any steps to inquire? Isi t not well known that the Minister and his staff designedly delayed dealing with the Eederal rolls in order that he might have some excuse for rejecting those divisions if the Commissioner's divisions were not satisfactory to the Government;. That was the Minister's clear intention, as the whole of the proceedings go to .show. No Electoral Officer was appointed in New South Wales until about six weeks ago, although the Franchise Act, which gave a vote-to every adult mau.and woman, was passed in June of last year, and the Electoral Act, which provided the machinery to carry out that law, received the Royal Assent in October. The Ministeri n charge of the Department did not attempt to appoint a Commissioner until April of this year, and took no steps to have the electoral roll compiled under the Electoral Act. I could see whafc the Minister's attitude would be. We in New South Wales know what he is and what his engineering capabilities are; and I anticipated that he would indulge in some of his "" little games."" member for Macquarie himself ? I am glad that pared to defend myself when the time comes. Two months ago, when I moved the adjournment of the House in order to call attention fco the advisableness, of having the electoral rolls revised, I anticipated that the Minister would, though unsupported by any statistics, turn round and say that the drought had caused changes in the various constituencies ; and that is exactly what has occurred. I then pointed out-and supported my statement with figures-fchat the I am only prolarge deficiency between the census returns and the electoral rolls was mostly observable in Sydney and suburbs and in the County of Cumberland. ber's figures were all wrong. bald statement; in support of which the Minister hassubmitted noreliablefigures. In order to justify his course of action the Minister has submitted a statement, prepared by we do not know whom, in order to show that there has been a great change in the Darling, Riverina,. and Barrier electorates. I asked to be permitted to see the return, bufc I found thafc in fche case of the Barrier and the Darling the figures were described as incomplete. In fact the return produced is totally incomplete and inaccurate. We do not know what the return means, but we do know that the intention of the Minister is to prevent thousands of electors from recording their votes in a fair and legitimate way.

305,Mr Sydn Ey Smith,"I think it w ill ,and I am prepared to do the same again, if needs be, for a principle in which I believe. The Minister has received a present of a snuff-box from the women of some State or other; but really, in my opinion, he ought not to have the credit of extending the franchise to women. The Minister was supposed to have given the franchise to women, but he has taken that franchise away again; and I wonder what a prominent ladywhose name I shall not mention, but who deserves great credit for her share in that reform-woul d now say in view of the fact that under the B ill some 17,000 women in one electorate will have only the same power as 4,000 women in another electorate. Does the Minister believe that that is a proper principle ? honourable member ? honourable member for New England a little about the miners of Hillgrove before I have done. The New South Wales representatives on the Eederal Convention were elected by every male adult, and the same method was adopted when the Constitution was placed before the country for approval or disapproval. Every man's vote had an equal value in the election of senators, and the next election will be on the principle of one man one vote, and one vote one value. Queensland has a population of only 500,000, and New South Wales has a population of 1,400,000? out that every adult male and every adult female will have an equal voice in choosing the senators to represent New South Wales. Each vote will have equal value. equal. to that presently. I am dealing now with that. the election of senators, and I say that the principle adopted is that of one vote one this Bill, honourable members are supportingvalue. the Constitution, I admit that the smaller while he agreed with that honourable States are entitled to the same representamember he realized that Parliament tion in the Senate as the larger. ber has got on to the horns of a dilemma. had better leave that, and pass on. custom to treat matters in that way. According to the Constitution, each State is entitled to return six senators, though somehave less population than others. But when the candidates go upfor election in the variousStates, the vote of every elector is of equal value in returning the six senators. In some of the electorates proposed for the House of Representatives, 35,000 electors will return but one member, whilst in others 14,000 electors will be able to return one member. When the present Minister for Trade and Customs submitted the Commonwealth Electoral Bill to the House last session, he pointed out that he did not believe in the principle of one vote one value; but. that he recognised that the people of the Commonwealtli required that that principle should be given effect to. In saying that, he meant to refer to honourable I shall tell the members. He agreed thathonnrable members desired that that principle should be adopted, and he said that the Government had endeavoured to carry it out as far as possible. While the honourable gentleman was speaking, if I remember rightly, the honourable member for Gippsland interjected in a way which indicated that he did not agree with the principle of one vote one value, and the Minister replied at once that he agreed with the honourable member, but he recognised the will of Parliament in the matter. MrA . McLEAN I agree with the principle of one vote one value, but I do not think that can be secured by equal numbers, in every electorate under all conditions. but I do not think that even my honourable friend will admit that it is a fair distribution to have 35,000 voters in one electorate and only 13,000 in another to return onenot member.

That was not the opinion of the Minister, but it is what the honourable gentleman said Was the will of Parliament upon the question. The honourable member for Bland was even more emphatic in what he had to say. honourable member expressed himself in favour of the principle of one vote one value, and he went on to say that whilst there might be some slight departure from that principle in consequence of the difficulty which people in the country districts might have in getting to the polling booths, as compared with people in the large centres of population, he did not at all approve of the margin proposed by the Minister. The honourable member held the view that in many country districts people take even a keener interest in election matters than did those who resided in large centres of population. The lionorable member went on to say that it was absurd to propose to give votes to acres instead of to people. All through his speech the honourable member for Bland was against the contention of some honourable members, and notably of the honourable member for Gippsland, that there should be so large a margin allowed. The Bill was carried with the provision giving the Commissioner certain latitude in making the division. When the Minister for Trade and Customs was speaking on this question recently, I asked the honourable gentleman why he did not send the report of the Commissioner back for further consideration, if he was not satisfied with it . The honourable gentleman admitted that people had returned and were returning in large numbers, to the country districts, and though he would not adopt the course suggested, he said that if we adopted that course we should still have at least a month to spare. is again referring to a previous debate. to transgress the rules of debate, but I believe that a statement of that kind was made on the 14th August last, which was only about a fortnight ago. believe that 1 it could have been done, and I believe that it can be better done under an amendment which honourable members will have an opportunity of recording a vote upon before this Bill goes through, when we shall test whether they believe all the statements submitted by the Minister as to the differences in the various districts. I have here a statement prepared in the The Chief Electoral Office for the State of New South Wales, and I take, for purposes of illustration, three Federal electorates to whicli reference has been made during this debateBarrier, Darling, and Riverina. I find in this statement the number of voters in the State electorates of Barwon, Bourke, BrokenH ill , Cobar, Coonamble,. Deniliquin, Hay, Lachlan, Murray, Sturt, Wentworth, and Wilcannia, and I remind honourable senators that these State electorates comprise practically the Commonwealth electorates of Darling, Riverina, and Barrier. a big mining development outside of Cobar, which those districts do not include. Nymagee and Shu ttie ton are both outside. enough. difference of over 1,000 electors in those two cases. to which I have referred fairly represent the principal districts' affected by the drought. I think honourable members will admit that. I take the figures relating to male voters, because we cannot estimate female voters in making a comparison for some years back, since women were only admitted to the franchise last year. Speaking then only of male adult voters, I find that in 1902-3 the proportion of male adult voters in the State electorates, to which I have referred, was 9-27 of the total number of electors in the State of New South Wales, whilst according to the roll for 1894-5, the proportion of adult voters in those districts was only S-98 of the total number of voters in the State. The honourable member for New EngI do not desire land made an interjection just now with regard to the fairness of the proposal submitted by the Government.

328,Mr Sydney Smith,"The districtshonorable member for New England, and I would ask the honourable member what the miners of New England, of Hillgrove,' Armidale, and those districts, will say to the comparison which I now propose to give, not between a Sydney constituency and a country constituency, but between country constituency and country constituency. I propose now to deal with Riverina and with Darling, which comprise a large number of miners, as honourable members are aware. In these two electorates, according to the figures supplied by the Minister, and compiled after the people, are said to have gone back to the country districts, .there are 48,198 electors in the New England and Hunter districts, represented by the lionorable meniber to whom I have referred and by the Prime Minister. They are both country electorates, in which the people are interested in mining, pastoral, and dairy pursuits. 'They contain large numbers of producers, who, the honourable member for New England will admit, are as much entitled to consideration as those in the Darling and Riverina districts. While 30,562 electors in the Darling and Riverina divisions are entitled to return two representatives, 48,198 electors, or 17,636 more, are required to return the Prime Minister and the honourable member for NeW England Is that a fair distribution 1 able friend is prepared to vote for that arI was quite satisfied to ' accept it . rangement, although he admits that it is unfair. He will presently have to explain to his constituents why he voted for an arrangement under which two miners at Hillgrove will have only the same representation as one miner at BrokenH ill or Darling. To make sure that I should not mislead the House, I obtained this afternoon by telegram a verification of the figures which I am using. I am sorry that Ministers, have not been equally straightforward. Whenever we have asked for information we have been told that ""the rolls are not ready,"" or that ""consideration is being given to the subject."" To written circular sent round the country to make another comparison between country electorates, I would point out that, whereas 43,650 electors in the divisions of Cowper and Robertson have only two representatives, 30,562 electors, or 13,088 fewer, in the divisions of Darling and Riverina have the same representation. member propose to remedy this state of affairs 1 the honourable member's question presently. Let me"" now compare four free-trade with four protectionist divisions. Honourable members opposite tell us that they desire a straight out expression of opinion from the people upon the subject of free-trade and pro-. tection ; but while 67,610 electors in protectionist divisions have four representatives, only the same representation is given -to 125,778 electors in free-trade divisions. In other words, each of the free-trade members represents nearly twice as many electors as. each of the protectionist members. But, notwithstanding this dastardly attempt on the part of the Ministry to cripple the free-trade representation honourable member should use language like that. for doing so. I was carried away by my indignation at the injustice of the action which is contemplated by the Government. honourable member afraid to face the electors of the present Macquarie division ? to do so. Although the honourable member and the Minister for Trade and Customs thought that the distribution of the Commissioner would lead to my defeat, I knew that the work of dividing the State had been left to au honourable, straightforward man, and I troubled no more about it , because I think that 'honourable members should not try to gerrymander their electors. Comparing eight divisions with eight others, I find that 216,114 electors have only the same representation as 115,998 other electors, so that more than 100,000 electors are in the first case practically unrepresented. Yet the Government tell'us that they desire to observe the principle of one vote one value. The Minister for Trade and Customs has had a typeshow that the whole of the senators representing New South Wales belong to Sydney, while the whole of the Victorian senators are Melbourne men.

Only three representatives from New South Wales-and I happen to be one of themlive in the country. asked the honourable member not to refer to that matter. ruling, Mr Speaker. I have said all I wish to say on that point. I find that in the five electorates of New England, Cowper, Hlawarra, Hunter, and Bobertson there are 115,000 electors. In five other country electorates, namely, Bichmond, Hume, Barrier, Darling, and Biverina-repre sented by members who are dissatisfied with the boundaries fixed by the Commissionerthere are only 79,000 electors. country divisions are not equally distributed ? exactly what I am endeavouring to show. There is almost, if not quite, as great a difference between the number of voters in one group of country electorates, compared with another, as between the countiy electorates and the city constituencies. According to the Minister, two farmers are only equal to one farmer in another district, and one miner . at Cobar is to have the same voting power as two miners in the New England district. member for New England does not believe in the principle of one vote one value, and he has not hesitated to say so, even though nine-tenths of the members of the I do not think that House presumably hold the opposite view.

I gave him credit for having All I desire to the courage to express his opinion on that question. We have heard a great deal fibout the concession which was made to the women of the Commonwealth when the franchise was extended to them ; but under I do not think that the present distribution of the electorates the privilege is not so valuable as it has I am referring been made to appear. I find that in one group of three electorates there are 53,000 women voters, whereas in another group there are only 15,300 voters. Therefore one woman in the Darling or Biverina electorate exercises nearly as much voting power as four women in one of the other electorates referred to. The Minister and other honourable members who hold similar views regarding the Tariff, claimed that their position would be I bow to your strengthened by the extension of the franchise to women, but apparently they are not content ""that the women should have an opportunity to exercise their power of voting to the fullest possible extent.

I am afraid that the Minister and those who are supporting him will meet with very severe condemnation, and I am opposing the Bill because I wish to safeguard Parliament against serious reflections. If the women voters are so strongly in favour of protection as the Minister claims, why should they not be afforded every chance to assert their political power?

350,Mr Sydn Ey Smith,"I have nolaws and to the same taxation as men, they should enjoy equal political privileges. I quite agreed with that view, and that is one of my reasons for protesting against a proposal which will have the effect of preventing women from exercising that equal political power which the Electoral A ct provides. In the case to which I have referred no discrimination would be made in favour of the larger number of women with the smaller political power, in the event of taxation being imposed. The 53,000 women would pay nearly four times as much in the form of taxation as would the 15,000 women. I find that in eight free-trade constituencies there are 130,000 women; whereas in eight other divisions represented, almost without exeeption, by protectionists, there are only 52,000 women. In other words, in one case, 52,000 women are enabled to return as many representatives as are 130,000 women in another instance. I ask honourable members if that is fair treatment? The women thought that they were to have equal political rights with the men, and provision to that effect was made in the Constitution. But now we are called upon to adopt a course that will have the effect of practically defeating the purpose of the Constitution. Electoral Bill dealing with the divisions was under discussion the Attorney-General distinctly stated, in opposition to the opinion expressed by the honourable and learned member for Indi, that if the House rejected the distribution proposed by the Commissioner it would be imperative upon them to send it back to the Commissioner for revision. The Attorney-General ought to be a very good authority upon a question of that kind. General said that. The honourable member is thinking of some phrase used by the Vice President of the Executive Council. taken, and I shall be able to refer the honourable and learned member to a passage in Hansard, which will bear out what I state. When the same clause was before the Senate, the question was raised whether, after the House had rejected the distribution proposed by the Commissioner, it would be open to the Minister to pigeonhole his report, and there let the matter rest. O'Connor saidIf we could amend it (the clause), and in such a them back to the Commissioners. The way that, finally, both Houses could come to an agreement, there might be some reason for doing so. Senator Charleston -Surely we can object to the report ? Senator O'CONKOK -We can either accept it or reject it.

The whole principle offcheBill, so far as this port of ifc is concerned, isfchafcfcheCommissioners have the responsibility of making a distribution.

He said that if either House rejected it , it must be referred back to the Commissioners for amendment. the honourable member see the point t When the clause of the nexion I also desire to quote the opinion of Senator Downer. He said :The Houses will say that fchey accept the report or that they do not. If we are going to send the report'back afc the direction of one House orfcheother there will be no endfcofchebusiness.

They have not submitted any official document in support of their contention as to the number of people who abandoned the country districts. Upon several occasions I have pointed out the importance of having a new roll prepared. The Minister, however, appears to have given no attention whatever to that important matter. Mr V. reading the newspapers. travelling over the different States, endeavouring to influence the electors, instead of attending to the administrative work of his office. Although the Electoral Act was passed last session, the Minister did practically nothing to carry out the will of Parliament until Apri l of the present year. The honourable member for Bland and the honourable member for New England both blame the Government for their neglect in this connection, but nevertheless they intend to vote with them. So far, I have dealt with tbe position only as regards New South Wales. merely touched upon it . sire to deal with this matter at greater length than its importance demands. compliment the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, upon having the courage of his opinions, and upon fighting for a principle which he has always advocated. Notwithstanding that he is an old colleague and a strong friend of Ministers, he deemed it his duty not only to vote against them, but to protest against this unfair attempt to disfranchise nearly two hundred thousand electors in the"" Commonwealth. That is really the effect of the Government proposal, inasmuch as it will give two miners in the New England district only the same political power that is possessed by one miner in the Darling .division. The right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, deserves the greatest credit for liaving told the Government that they are adopting a principle which is quite contrary to the provisions of the Electoral Act. Knowing the strong feeling which he entertains upon the question of one vote one I agree that value, the Government dared not attempt anything in the nature of jerrymandering in the case of South Australia. They were compelled to give practically equal rights to all electors in that State. The Minister for Trade and Customs has sought to raise the question of city versus country, but I have shown that almost as great differences exist between country and country electorates as exist between city and country constituencies.

I feel that I have done my part in endeavouring to impress upon the House-if it is possible at present to impress any point in regard to this question upon it , in view of the fact that a large majority of honourable members have pledged themselves to go back upon principles which they were returned to support-the importance of opposing this measure. I have felt it my duty in the interests of the Commonwealth to place before honourable members and the country generally my reason for fighting as strongly as I am able to do against the iniquitous proposal of the Government. I cannot understand the attitude taken up by honourable members who represent this State, many of whom have from time to time advocated the principle of one vote one value. If they look at the existing Victorian divisions they will find that there is a great difference between the number of electors in certain country divisions as compared with some of the metropolitan constituencies. I was surprised to find'that representatives of Victoria were prepared to accord us so little support when we were dealing with the various States divisions. In order to show our sincerity in dealing with this matter, I would point out that, when the South Australian scheme was before the House, honourable members of the Opposition unanimously voted for it , and when it was proposed that a return should be made to the existing electoral divisions for Victoria, which present . many of the anomalies that relate to the New South Wales divisions, we felt it our duty to fighb as strongly as possible against the I arn sure that Government proposal. We took that action, although for the most part we were representatives of New South Wales, and had.no interest, save that which every member of Parliament must have, in the Victorian distribution. The majority of the House, however, decided against us. Then we felt it our duty when the Minister submitted the motion for the rejection of the New South Wales scheme of distribution to enter I refer to you, our protest against the proposal. Our protest, however, was again unsuccessful. I would point out that the Government have not carried out the law as interpreted by Vice-President of the Executive. Council, who, if report be true, is likely to be honoured witli a seat on the High Court Bench, and of whose legal ability, therefore, his colleagues must have a very high opinion. Both these members of the Government, as well as Senator Downer, have expressed the opinion that, immediately this House refuses to pass a scheme for the division of any State into electorates, it is the imperative duty of the Government to return that scheme for reconsideration by the Commissioner. The Government cannot claim that time will not permit of this being done, because the Minister for Trade and Customs has admitted that these schemes could be reconsidered and dealt with by us, and that there would still be a month to spare. He refuses to return the divisions to the Commissioners, not because he does not believe that time will permit of the adoption of that course, but because it would not suit the Government to have the Commissioners' divisions adopted. Why is that so? ber would give the House the reason for the action of the Government. honourable friend, on Thursday last, put it before the House in a very capable way, and gave some honourable members.a few homethrusts when he explained why the Government were endeavouring to fasten this iniquitous proposal on the country. We know that they are actuated by party motives. I have no desire to disregard the Standing Orders, but I think that the Government, and those who support them, are laying themselves open to the charge that they are actuated by a desire to promote their own interests in seeking to prevent hundreds of thousands of electors",59,William Lyne Th E Majority Of Siv William Lyne Th E Honovable Mem

The people will see that under thfv existing system four women in one offchefree-trade constituencies of New South Wales have a voting power equal only to fchat possessed by one woman in a protectionist constituency. same anomaly exists in relation fco other divisions.

Is that a fair distribution 1 We have also fche electorate of Parkes, comprising over 30,000 electors, who can return only one member, whilst, according to the Minister's figures, 14,920 voters in the electorate power.

I have spoken at considerable length on this question because I feel that a great wrong is being done to the people of the Commonwealth. I hope that even at this late hour honourable members will hesitate to give their approval to the proposals of the Government. I cannot say what may happen fco the Bill when it goes to another place. The Standing Orders will not permit me to do so : but we know that honourable members of another place are elected upon the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value as far as each State is concerned We know also, that under the wise provisions of the Constitution, a general .election is shortly to take place for the House of Bepresentatives, and afc the same time nineteen senators are also to be returned. Honourable members called upon to vote for a Bill which will have the effect of disfranchising thousands and thousands of electors, and when those who support it submit themselves for re-election, they will have to justify their action. I am satisfied that when the electors are called upon to give their decision those who now seekfcoraise the question of town against country will find it impossible to do so so far as the people are concerned. We can show that some country The districts are now misrepresented in regard fcofchisquestion-fchaf c five country divisions as compared with five other country constituencies show a disparity of over 35,000 votes. Under this proposal two miners at Hillgrove, supposed to have equal rights under the Constitution, will have no greater voting power than is possessed by one elector in another part of a State. Those who support this Bill are saying in effect, "" We are going, at the dictation of the Government, to legalize an illegal Act. We are of Biverina have the same going to say to the miners afc Hillgrove, to the miners and agriculturists represented by the Prime Minister, and to the miners and farmers represented by the honourable member for Cowper, and others, 'Notwithstanding that the Constitution and tlie Electoral Act gives you certain rights, and provides that every vote shall be of equal value, we have agreed fco a measure under which one elector in the Darling division will have a voting power equal almost to that possessed by two miners or farmers in the electorates of New England, Cowper, and the Hunter.'"" The Minister will have to justify his action in supporting this measure when he goes before his constituents. he will attempt to do so, but I clo not think that honourable members who support this Bill will be as successful in their efforts to humbug the people in regard to this question as they were on a previous occasion in regard to other questions.

375,Mr Sydney Smith,"I daresay that of the Government, headed by the Minister in charge, to suit party interests. The speech which has just been delivered by the honourable member for Macquarie is a' very exhaustive review of this subject, and one that must, I think, have made the Minister feel very uneasy. We could not hear a speech from an honourable member better acquainted with the history of Australia, and especially of New South Wales, as to. the redistribution of seats. He has had twenty odd years' experience in the Parliament of New South Wales with the Minister for Trade and Customs. Consequently, he is well acquainted with all that that gentleman has done, and knows all his shortcomings. But I find the Minister using those very shortcomings as a reason for the stand that is being taken by the Government in bringing forward a redistribution of seats that is not satisfactory to the people. He tells us of the injustices that have occurred in the past in New South Wales, and uses them as a pretext for the Bill before us. A great deal has been said that must have been exceedingly disagreeable to the Minister. Sir regardfcofchesource from which it comes. take a great deal of what has been said with a grain of salt, but I am inclined to think that there must be something in it , because not one honourable member only but quite a number were able to bring forward instances showing that what the Minister is trying to establish in the Commonwealth is an old practice in New South Wales. However, I have no grievance against the honor-"" able gentleman, and have no reason to say disagreeable things of him. Sir happy now ! time, sitting _here as an independent listener-as a man wifch an open mindI am convinced by the speeches which have been delivered, especially that of the Minister himself, that a grave injustice has been done to Australia in not approving of divisions which have been faithfully made by the Commissioners appointed by the Government. papers of the honourable member's electorate say that I am right. dozen or more newspapers from my electorate every week. To-day I looked over a number of them. I found that there were some references to the action of the leader of the Opposition in resigning his seat, and supporting what he had done, bufc there is only one newspaper that has supported the Minister. honourable member not willing to face hiselectors on the old boundaries 1 daries would suit me very much better than the new ones. The division which I support would give me an area of 5,000 square miles I do nofc think I know a single individual in the added area. It would give me an additional State electorate to the four which I already have within my division. Therefore I cannot say that that is favorable to my interests. I know the people in my old electorate, and I know that they are well satisfied with me. I might very well leave well alone. But I believe that I owe a duty to the Commonwealth as well as to New South Wales, and am bound to vote in the direction that will be in the interests of Australia. I have always understood in reading parliamentary history that when We might there was a redistribution of seats there should be a general election, so that the people might be represented in their true proportions. We are now on the eve of a general election, and to make preparation for it we passed an Act, which is the most democratic measure ever enacted having for its object the perfection of electoral machinery. Parliament passed that A ct so as to do justice to the whole of the people of Australia. We affirmed the principle of one citizen one vote, and that every vote kept well in . mind that there should be A t the same single electorates, and that all the elections should take place on the same day. To attain this state of perfection we have had to work for twenty-five years. One after another allfcheinequalities have been struck out. A t last we have a measure as perfect as we' could make it . There is to be no taxation without representation. We might, therefore, have expected that, when the general election took place, and themen and women of Australia cast their votes for representatives in this Parliament, every vote would have the same value.",61,William Lyne Th E Majority Of Siv William Lyne Th E Honovable Mem

382,Mr Henry Willis,"The old bounBut, although the Minister has been a supporter of women's suffrage for many years in his own State, and might have been expected to agree to a redistribution of seats that would have given the women fair representation, he has gone back upon himself, by rejecting the new scheme of distribution that is proposed. He favours the old divisions that were based upon manhood suffrage, and paid no consideration to the votes of the women. We know that women gravitate to the cities. cities of Australia the women predominate. In two of the electorates of Melbourne 20,000 women will only have equal voting power with 10,000 men in the country. Therefore women are not receiving proper consideration at the hands of the Government. On the other hand we find that 10,000 men in certain electorates have more voting power than 20,000 men in some large centres. Tliese inequalities arise in consequence of the Government adhering to the old electoral divisions, which were arranged under manhood suffrage when women had no voting power. The inconvenience of adapting the old systeni to the new conditions must be patent. Therefore I urge that the Minister would do well to return the maps and the divisions to the Commissioners for reconsideration. In many instances the people are returning to the country after the drought. I have before me a return to which prominence was recently given during the election campaign of Mr Reid in Sydney. As these figures are up to date, I should like the Minister to pay attention to them. Mr Reid saidHe had obtained from the Chief Electoral Officer additional returns for the drought-stricken areas which Sir William Lyne talked so much about, and, so far from the exodus of people being shown in the nine electorates most affected by drought, there were really 4,18!) more male electors than a year ago. These are figures provided by the Electoral Officer, from whom the Minister receives his information. This officer says that in the Darling electorate in 19023 there were 7,950 electors against 8,964 in August, 1903 ; in the Barrier elector ate there were in the former year 9,596, and in 1903 there were 10,141; in Riverina there were 9,349 in 1902-3, and 9,362 in 1903 ; in Canobolas there were 10,066 in 1902, and 10,305 in 1903; in Robertson there were 11,013 in 1902, and 11,630 in 1903; in Bland there were 10.43S in 1902, and 10,928 in 1903; in Macquarie there were 10,413 in 1902, and 10,624 in 1903; in Gwydir there were 10,910 in 1902, and 11,387 in 1903 ; in Hume there were 10,180 in 1902, aud 10,763 in 1903. The number of electors in the constituency of the Minister for Trade and Customs has increased as compared with the number last year, and the figures I have quoted show that the people have returned and are returning to their electorates. member does not place my electorate In all the great amongst the drought electorates. extent as in other electorates ; but I think my electorate may be regarded as having been largely affected by the drought. As I say, the people are returning to their homes. If the Minister's electorate has not been affected by the drought, how does he account for the increase of 600 electors during the last twelve months 1 The explanation must be that the electorate, to some extent, has been affected by the drought, and, with the people returning, we shall find the electorates, at the time of the elections in December, in their normal condition. In my opinion the Minister ought to haVe adopted the subdivisions suggested by theCommissioners, who are men of the highest repute, approved by the Minister himself. The Commissioners have performed their work well, and have given satisfactory reasons for the subdivisions they propose ; and if the Minister, even at this moment, would accept an amendment, by which the report coujd be sent back and a redistribution made, in view of the normal conditions which will prevail at the time of the elections, every man and every woman would have an opportunity of exercising the franchise. I do not think it is necessary to say much more about this Bill, seeing that I addressed myself to the subject as each subdivision was laid before honourable members. Buti t seems most remarkable to me that in the two States where the subdivisions are approved of, those subdivisions are in the interests of the Government; whereas in the other States, where the subdivisions were not in the interests of the Government, the suggestions of the Commissioners were rejected. This unsatisfactory state of things requires some explanation. The Minister for Trade and Customs is well aware that in South Australia, if the elections were to take place under the old arrangements, every member of the Opposition from that State would, in all probability, be re-elected; whereas if a",62,Williamlyne I Do Not Feel So Should Have The Same Value Ave Also

384,Mr Henrywillis,"N b , not to thesubdivision takes place, it will necessitate two or more of those members standing for the same constituency, with the probable result of the loss of a seat. That, of course, would be to the advantage of the Government, while a rejection of tlie proposed subdivision would have a contrary effect. As I say, some explanation is necessary, because it . is not proper that certain reports of the Commissioners should be approved and others disapproved in this fashion. However that may be, I voted in favour of the adoption of the suggested electorates, because it is the duty of Parliament, liaving appointed Commissioners to carry out the work in pursuance of an Act passed by this Parliament, to consider fairly and honestly the recommendation submitted, and to decide whether the explanatory report is in accordance with the figures and facts submitted therewith. work could be better done. only the Minister for Trade and Customs, but other Ministers have repeatedly stated that the Commissioners chosen are men of the highest character ancl competence-that better men could not have been selected. In Tasmania, if the elections were conducted under the old arrangements, the Government would, in all probability, lose a supporter; and, knowing that, the Government favoured the acceptance of the report of the Commissioner. Wasi t in consequence of the fact that the subdivisions of the Commissioners would enable the Government to retain their supporters that the reports in the case of Tasmania and South Australia were accepted 1 Why did not the Government approve of the subdivision suggested in the case of Western Australia/a subdivision which the figures and accompanying explanation show to be the best tliat sould have been made. The Minister for Home Affairs stated that he knew the Western Australian Commissioner, who hacl been trained under him, and was a most straightforward man. The Commissioner is, I believe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, and is a man thoroughly familiar with the country and the various centres of population, and well qualified for the work. But if his subdivision had been approved the Government would probably have lost two supporters. It appears to me that the Government have considered all these facts, and have come to the conclusion that in the case of Western Australia it was to their advantage to reject the subdivision suggested by the Commissioner. In the case of Victoria, if the Commissioner's subdivision had been approved of, the Opposition would, in all probability, have won a seat; and the Government saw the disadvantage they would be under. This most probably influenced the Government in urging therejection of the Commissioner's report. The Minister ought to give some explanation of these remarkable facts, because it is not in the interests of Australia that any member of the Government should be charged with gerrymandering. I have no grudge whatever against the Minister, but I am inclined to think that suspicion will rest upon him unless he is able to give some satisfactory explanation to the people of Australia. whether the the understanding arrived at last week, I clo not intend to detain the Committee long with my remarks. The occasion, however, is so important that I feel it my duty to draw attention to the facts of the case. The result of the action of the Government is that we have rejected, the proposed subdivision of the electorates arrived at after a f u l l consideration of all the facts. The drought and every other argument advanced by the Minister for HomeA f fairs, and those who support him, were fully considered by the Commissioners and the subdivisions were made accordingly. It does not speak very highly for the action of the Minister when we find that in South Australia and Tasmania, where previously there were'no subdivisions, the Government accepted the reports of the Commissioners, although in neither of these States was any provision made for a difference between countiy and city electorates. When we regard the arguments used by the Minister for Trade and Customsi n reference to the country electorates of New South Wales, we are forced to consider whether he is really correct in the statements he has made. In the case of New South Wales, at all events, the Commissioner took into consideration all the arguments which have since been used by the Minister, and gave every possible effect to them. The Commissioner took advantage of the quota to such an extent that in each of. seven of the country electorates of New South Wales, even under the proposed subdivision, there are only 125,000 electors as against 150,000 in the city.",63,Williamlyne I Do Not Feel So Should Have The Same Value Ave Also

387,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"In view ofI f the quota had been exactly observed there would, of course, have been just as many electors in the country as in the city. When the Minister said that no difference was allowed in regard to country electorates, he was evidently stating what is not in accordance with facts, and on that ground alone his arguments, so far as New South Wales is concerned, fall to the ground. I much prefer the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Barrier, who, although a member of the Labour Partya cardinal principle in the platform of which is one vote one value-di d not pretend that the electorates now proposed would have the effect of carrying out that principle, but simply opposed the subdivision because it did not ""suit him."" That is an argument we can all understand, although it has only a personal application. If the Minister for Trade and Customs had simply said that the proposed subdivision did not suit him, or did not suit two or three of his friends, and that he had decided to take advantage of his position as Minister and refuse to accept it , we could have understood his action. In the case, perhaps, of one or two members, there would have been a certain amount of sympathy with him, seeing that the Electoral law as framed by ourselves absolutely compelled the subdivision of the existing electorates. But all these points were fully discussed when the question first came before us. The honourable member for Gippsland argued very strongly that the country electorates should be considered much more than the city electorates-that in fact we should not give effect to the principle of one vote one value-anc l he submitted many reasons in support of that view. The House, after very full discussion, rejected the amendment suggested by that honourable member. The honourable member for Bland, the leader of the Labour Party, suggested that the quota should be reduced to one-eighth. He contended that the Commissioner would have a very small difference to work on of only between 2,000 and 3,000, instead of nearly 5,000 at the present time. The Minister pointed out, however, that he thought that quota too small, and, after some, consideration it was increased to one-fifth, the original proposal of the Minister being one-fourth. The quota of one-fifth allows such a large margin that in each of seven country electorates of New South Wales, as I have said, there are no less than 25,000 more voters than in the city. The houorable member for Bland, when speaking on that occasion, waxed very eloquent indeed, and saidI could not on any oonsideration vote for a principle which I believe to be radically wrong. Those were very fine words coming from the leader of the Labour Party, the chief plank in whose platform has been "" one vote one value."" On the first opportunity the honourable member is given of carrying it into practice we find him departing from the principle and telling the miners of Temora and Wyalong, in his own electorate, that the votes of four of them are equivalent only to the votes of three miners in the electorate of Darling. After uttering those bold words, which I believe the honourable member meant at the time, it is a very sorry thing to find the leader of the Labour Party absolutely departing from the principle tliere laid dowu. The honourable member gave no explanation for his departure from principle, and I was tempted to interject angrily at the time to ask the honourable member why he did not do exactly as the honourable meniber for Barrier had done, and say, "" It doesn't suit me."" If the honourable member had said that, or that it did not suit one or two members of his party, I could have understood him. What one most dislikes in parliamentary life is to find a man turning back upon a principle with which he has always been associated. and learned member's leader 1 Has not he often acted in that way 1 may think that my leader has been wrong, but the right honourable gentleman, who was lately member for East Sydney, has, by his. resignation, drawn attention to this matter in a way in which no other action he could have taken would have done. knows what is taking place there. people in the honourable member's electorate do not know what he does, and that possibly accounts for the presence of the honourable member in this House. I venture to say that there is sufficient intelligence in the bulk of the men who study labour questions to induce them to strongly resent the action of the honourable meniber for Bland.",64,Williamlyne I Do Not Feel So Should Have The Same Value Ave Also

What value can be attached to our public utterances if we do not, when opportunity is offered, give effect to the views we have expressed. I could understand the honourable member for Gipps-' land being opposed to any B ill that could be framed on this subject, because his argument would lie against any measure that could be brought in to deal with it. AfterI had heard the honourable member's speech, it was clear to me that it must follow that every member should be compelled to live in his own electorate. It is true that the honourable member made an exception in favour of himself, and stated that although he lived in the City of Melbourne he counted himself as a country member, because he had interests in the country. However, when he was dealing with honourable members on this side who represent country electorates in New South Wales, he counted them as living in the City of 'Sydney, even though some, like myself, have lived all their lives in the country districts-no t in the city, but within a radius of 100 miles of it . if ifc is right to include some of us as living in arrived at it yet. This is not the way in the City of Sydney, men living in some parts of Gippsland might be fairly reckoned as living in the City of Melbourne. I was pleased to find that those members of the Labour Party who have determined fco support the Government in the present proposal did not attempt to explain their votes on any such false grounds as were given by the honourable member for Gippsland. The Government have stultified themselves by their action in this matter. They had the appointment of the Commissioners, who were given full power to investigate matters in the preparation of their reports. The Government have not complained in any way of the conduct of the Commissioners, and they -have not said that they departed from their duty. They have allowed the electoral officers intrusted with the collection of the rolls to continue their work as Federal omcers, but if fche charges made against them are' true, not one of those electoral ofiicers should have been allowed to remain in the service for five minutes. The moment he believed one tithe of the things which have been charged against those officers, the Ministershouldhave exercised his power to dismiss them from the service of the Commonwealth. Ifconly shows how little value attaches to the statements made by thehonorablegenfcleman when wefind that those officers are still in the employment of the Government. They say that those officers did their best, and fchey propose still to retain fchem in their positions. Is thafc the way in which a Government should behave ? Is that a proper line of conduct for a Minister to pursue? A t one moment members of the Government praise the work of these officers, and say fchat everything that they have done is perfectly correct, and that the Government are well satisfied with their work. Then fchey come to this House and condemn the work of those men. That is what we are asked to do now, and that is what we did when we rejected their proposed divisions Nobody pretends fchat the divisions proposed were perfect, or that we shall ever get a division of the States which will absolutely suit every one. I suppose fchafc fche ideal electorate from the point of view of a member of Parliament would be one in which there was only one elector, and that one the honourable member himself. In his electorate the honourable member for Darling is getting down to that, though he has not quite which fco give effect to the principle of representation and to see that fche people gefc their votes. When honourable members compare city and country electorates they must remember thafc while the contention that there should be some distinction in favour of country electorates may have some force in a.Parliament dealing strictly with local affairs,-it loses much of its force in such a Parliament as this, .in which we are dealing with the larger questions affecting the whole of Australia. The laws we pass here can in no sense be described as loGal laws. Each of the States has full power to make local laws, and we cannot interfere with them in any way whatever.

If the members of the Opposition make accusations of gerrymandering in reference to the existing divisions, those accusations apply, so far as the New South Wales divisions are concerned, to the Commissioners who drew up the scheme which was approved of by bhe State Parliament, and, so far as Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland are concerned, to the Parliamentary Committees who framed the proposals which were adopted by the Parliaments of those States. If our proposal now were to alter the existing boundaries, there might be some ground for the charges which have been made, but we ask the House to retain the existing boundaries as marked out by independent Commissions. It has been said that the whole trouble has been caused by the late appointment of the Commissioners, but do honourable members think it was possible to appoint the Commissioners before the lists and other information which had to be submitted to them had been collected t Directly that information was available the Commissioners were appointed. the lists were prepared months before the cases, incomplete, because I have not appointment of the Commissioner.

I said further that there would have been little alteration in the boundaries, except on the western side of one electorate and on the eastern side of another. states in his report that he commenced from tlie electorate of Wentworth. I do not dispute that, but Mr Houston circled round the electorate instead of commencing all along the coast and working directly westward. That is what I intended to convey in making that statement. thing substantial has been advanced to which I am called upon to reply. It has been alleged that I desire to deprive a large number of women of their votes. W it h the assistance of my colleagues and the generous co-operation of honourable members, I think I may claim to have taken a prominent part in extending the franchise to the other sex. Under these circumstances I am not likely to do anything which will have the effect of depriving them of their votes. The fact is that it suits those who opposed that great reform to endeavour to curiy favour with the women afc the present time. The whole of the tirade in which< fchey have indulged has been prompted by that desire. I do nofc fear but that we shall receive fair consideration from tlie women electors of the community.

The Conciliation and Arbitration B ill is being pushed perilously near to breaking point, so far as this Parliament is concerned, and I doubt whether it will have any chance of passing through both Houses of tbe Legislature before we make that appeal to the electors ior which we are all so anxious. It seems that no matter how near the end of the session we may be, that measure is to be allowed to stand over until we pass the precious Bill wbich ia going to upset the whole of the electoral arrangements of the Commonwealth, so far as tbe next Parliament is concerned.
