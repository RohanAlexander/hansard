War From Tho Honourable Member For Yarra An Intimation That He Desires To Move The Adjournment Of The House' To Discuss A Dennite Matter Of Urgent Public Import","ance, namely, "" The desirability of all native-born and naturalized Australian citizens who were interned knowing the charges on which they were interned, so that they may have an opportunity of disproving such charges; and the necessity of having an inquiry into the treat-, ment of internees and the administration of internment eamps."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. last occasion on which this matter was brought before the House was, I think, when it was raised by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), a year ago, or a little less, and the then Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) dealt with the subject, and made a reply to what was said. On the 15th April, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence the following questions upon notice, to which I received the replies attached to them:1. How many persons are at present interned in AustraliaT-Thirty-two . 2. When is it intended to release themTSuch as are not repatriated will be released as soon as transport arrangements are completed, which will take place at an early date.",19,Setup

Seeing that the armistice was signed in November, 1918, what ia the reason for atill detaining them?-'Practicall y aU these internees are from New Guinea, and decision was held up pending receipt of mandate and settlement of Government policy, and at a later period detention was caused by inability to obtain transport. The war is now over, and we are at peace with Germany-the native country of many of the persona who were interned. of the House has fewer naturalized Germans, or Australians born of German parentage, as his constituents than I have. When the first referendum was taken, and such persons had to vote under section 9, only twenty or thirty votes were so recorded in the Yarra electorate, and most of those who votod under the section were proved not to be of German origin. One of them was able to trace back his parentage for 900 years, and to show his British ancestry for the whole of that period, which is, perhaps, more than most of us could do. Therefore, I am not moving now with the idea, of catching votes; I am actuated merely by the desire that every person in thiB community shall receive fair treatment. Those who have been interned should not be allowed to rest under the stigma of having done something justifying their internment. Recently, at Loxton, in South.Australia, an inquiry was conducted on behalf of the Government by Mr Hewitson, S.M., into the alleged disloyalty of certain Germans there. This-extract shows how the magistrate reported about one of those against whom the charge of disloyalty was made:The Commissioner referred to MT.

Guinea. camp at Liverpool have been released on parole. tion that I Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) two or three weeks ago I was told that there were then thirty-two persons interned in Australia, aud that most of them were to be sent out of the country. One of these men, Mr A. Becker, who is interned in the Longworthy Camp, on the 23rd December last addressed a letter to His Excellency the Governor General, and forwarded a copy of it to the Secretary of the Federal Labour party. In this letter he statedI was a planter at Rabaul, German New wealth Government w i ll be stopped, and I am Guinea. Was interned August, 1015.

I am anxious to return there to look after the If there is anything against these men I plantation and protect the widow and children. I sent the letter with a covering note to the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) on the 1st instant. I have not yet received an answer, but understand that the reply is to be that no aliens are at present being permitted to return to this Territory. On the 8th instant Becker wrote to the Secretary of our party a letter in which he statedTo-day a high official from Molbourne visited this camp and informed each of us individually that not one of us interned deportees from late Gorman New Guinea would be allowed to return, as it was the policy of the Government, to his island home. I am thus for ever deported from my nearest relations, and ever deprived of seeing those dear to me again. I have done no wrong whatsoever. Have never been put to any trial as regards my deportation, and consider the action of the Government a most cruel and inhuman one. Please, sir, bring my case before Parliament, and let the Government state the reasons for their cruel action. Besides me there arc others who have their children in that colony, and are deprived of even making arrangements for their support, or saying good-bye to them. Here is another letter from a Mr E. Gruendler, who is interned in the Holdsworthy Camp, New South Wales. 'Writing on the 7th instant to the Secretary of the Federal Labour party he saysI have worked in the Marshall Islands (late They have property in New German New Guinea) since 1903, where I was married in 1900. In>.1913 I was sent by the firm for which I was working to Nauru, from where I was deported to Australia, and interned in November, 1915. After the capture of Nauru by the Australian Military ForcesI gave my oath of neutrality, and I have never broken my oath rendered. Nevertheless, I was brought down here without any legal proceedput to the Assistant ings whatsoever, nor any trial . My wife and four children, who are half-castes of Nauru, have since had to live as best they could, without any support whatsoever from the Government. This morning a high official from the Defence Department, Melbourne, visited this camp and interviewed each one of the internees individually. I was told that I could not go back to my home at Nauru and join my family again, but that I could go to Germany, or to some neutral country. I am sure that my wife would object to be sent to Germany, as being born in {he islands. I appeal to you and your party to see that justice will be done in my case, and that the cruel action of the Commonmy home and family. The only crime, accept it as such, is that I am born Germany. do not want to appeal, but I do not believe in a display of vindictiveness after the fight is over. Is it to be said, "" This man has a German name; we will therefore '.collar' his possession in the island "" ? If that is so, then the people in my electorate might just as well say, ""Wertheim is a German name. Wertheim has a large piano factory in Richmond. We w ill ' cop ' it . "" That would be absolutely absurd. Wertheim had a son who joined the A.I.F. and fought overseas. To punish people merely because they were born in Germany would be to ignore the true spirit of Australia and Australians. We believe in fair treatment.

If it be true, as stated by these men, that the policy of the Government is not to allow any of them to return to their island homes, I urge that the whole matter be reconsidered. children of German parents and naturalized citizens who have been interned should at least know what charge is made against therir. They should know whether or not they have been interned merely because of suspicion. It may be that some enemy, either political, social, or personal, has made untrue statements concerning them, and I hope they will be given an opportunity to disprove these statements. As to the proposed inquiry into the German Concentration Camps, if the whole of the men have been released, perhaps no good purpose would be served by an investigation. Liverpool Camp. I do not know whether there are others. is the only camp for internees. being closed. ment deporting these men? If so, an injustice will be done. If we are afraid to allow two or three of these men to return to the islands where they were working when arrested, 1 can only say that we have not a very strong hold upon those islands. these men. Some two years ago Senator Gardiner asked permission to visit the German Concentration Camp, but was told that he could not conversewith any one of the internees except in the presence of a military officer. I do not know whether the honourable senator raised the question in the Senate, but perhaps, since the war was still in progress, he allowed it to go. Some time ago about a dozen of us waited privately upon the Treasurer ( Mr Watt), who was then Acting Prime Minister, and who, later on, mentioned the interview in the House. We then practically asked him to do what we are asking to-day. Over eighteen months have elapsed since the armistice, and now that the Peace Treaty has been signed, we should see to it that no injustice is suffered by these men. The fact that they were interned will be for all time a stigma against them and against their children, so that they ought fairly to be given an opportunity to clear themselves, if they can, of any charge that is made against them. ister and Attorney-General) [11.25] I The Australian-born regret that I have not at my disposal official information that would aid me to deal in detail with what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has said. In the circumstances, I can only approach the matter from a general stand-point. So far as I know, the Liverpool Concentration Camp is on the point of closing. the Holdsworthy Camp? ing I approved of the closing of that camp, and the release on parole of the persons therein. If that be, as the honourable member and I both think, the only German Concentration Camp in Australia, we can therefore dismiss from our minds one of the points raised by him. The honourable member has urged that Australians born of German parents, who have been interned upon suspicion, point of should have an opportunity to clear themselves, and that Germans with homes in some of the islands should have an opportunity to return thereto, and to take up their property again. As to the first point, I do not know whether it is now a live question. They feel that a stigma is unjustly restI ask for fair treatment for ing upon them. agree with the honourable member that a charge of disloyalty is hard to repel. On the other hand, it is not less hard to sheet home. Let me take a case that will be quite familiar to honourable membersthat of loyalty to a leader or to a party. If I am asked to say whether a man is loyal or disloyal to his paTty, and I say, "" Well, I do not think he is loyal,"" I may be asked to point to an instance of his disloyalty. It may well happen that I cannot do that, yet be convinced of the fact. Everybody may know that a man is disloyal to his leader or to his party, yet cannot .point to an instance by way of proof. It is as impalpable as Banquo'a ghost. So much for that.",21,Intbenees

27,Mr Hughes,"Very well; I quiteDuring this war racial feelings were naturally stirred to their very dregs. Speaking generally, men took sides. There can be no doubt that there were two sides to this question. There was the 3ide of Australia, the Empire, and the Allies, and there was the other side. Some im-partial persons might have been able to regard the position with indifference, and to show that a good case could be put up for the other side. But there were so few as to be negligible. To the overwhelming majority there was only one side. the other side, nor would the other side hear us. As those persons in our midst who saw only the other side were as dangerous politic as leprosy, or some other foul disease, is to the body physical, it was necessary to segregate and intern them. And we had to take them on suspicion, just as a medical man has to commit to an institution any suspicious case. He says to a man, "" Y o u say you are healthy, but you have come off a steamer infected with small-pox. I do not know whether or mot you have smallpox, but I shall quarantine you until the period of incubation is past, and then I shall know definitely."" It was for precisely analogous reasons that we placed certain men in internment camps. !No doubt we made mistakes; but not very many. And in any case, those interned could not complain of harsh treatment. I I am bound to say that the Germans there were fed, housed, and treated better were very far from being loyal.. Therein every way than were the Australian soldiers. I was greeted most familarly by men who had been working on the wharfs, and had been members of my old union for many years. They came forward, and said, "" Hallo, Billy, how 'are you?"" knows why those men were there. They could not get work, and that is why they surrendered themselves for internment. and I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it shows a mean and narrow nature to continue a quarrel after the occasion for it has passed. I am not one to do that. While I fight, I fight for all I am worth, but when the fight is over the quarrel is ended. I would be the last to deny justice to any citizen of this country because he happened to bear a foreign name, or because his fatheT came from Germany. What have those things to do with his case, anyhow? I will consider this matter in a friendly and sympathetic spirit, and if it be said that any man has been denied justiceI speak not of the past, but of any man who wishes to clear his character, who says that he was accused of disloyalty, but that he never was disloyal-h e should They, however, would not hear be given a chance to state his case. I have been asked in this House many times about the Tanunda Club. I have given the answers that questions of that to the body kind deserve. But when I read the evidence concerning TanundaI thought I would like to go there with a Union Jack and an Australian flag as big as this chamber, to hoist them in the town, and make every one of the men there walk underneath them. salute the flags, too. able member says about the Tanunda Club the better. Some of the men who were most bitter were not Germans at all. Germans in this country who, during the war, and under the most provoking and visited Holdsworthy Camp, and trying circumstances, were loyal. But there were some of our own race who fore, when I speak of the Tanunda ClubI speak not only of the Germans. It is perfectly true that the majority of those of German parentage felt' for Germany a sympathy that was quite natural. What could be more natural than that during a struggle between Germany and Great Britain those who have German blood in their veins should lean towards Germany? That was the most natural attitude in the world, and, the struggle being over, I say to them, "" Y o u did really what human nature and the promptings of your race impelled you to do."" But I wish to make it perfectly clear that I do not admit for one moment that the atction taken in regard to Tanunda Club and similar cases was not amply justified by",22,Intbenees

33,Mr Hughes,"There are plenty of the circumstances. There were throughout the coiuitry absolute hotbeds of conspiracy and sedition, and they would have broken into open rebellion had the opportunity but presented itself. I desire to say a few words about the German Islands in the Pacific. We have taken over those islands, and we must have a policy for their administration. That policy must be one which will insure the development of the islands by the British race, primarily by the Australians. I do not mean development by white labour, because that is out of the question. sides, we have no earthly right to say to the Papuans and other islanders that they must stand aside and must not work in their own country. Such an attitude would be nothing short of impudence. But German settlement has gone to considerable lengths in those islands, and German influence is still dominant. We shall never be able to control the trade and develop these islands unless we substitute Australian or British for German control and ownership of the land. Acting on that policy, we have not encouraged the German settlers of the islands, who were interned and brought to Australia, to return. Broadly speaking, our policy is to substitute British or Australian ownership for German ownership. No injustice will be done to the individuals ; everything will be done accordquite justified in interning you. And, ing to the terms of the Peace Treaty. But, speaking generally, we should have fought in vain the 'battles for those islands if we proposed to leave the effecbe able to sit down to your mess in the tive control of them-for those who own the lands own the country-in the hands of the very nation from whom we wrested them after a desperate and bloody struggle. We do not propose to do that. Many of the soldiers of Australia are desirous of settling in the islands; and, after all, although no one has yet raised his voice in their behalf, there is an Australian soldiers' side to this German question, and it must not be forgotten. I do not believe that the Australian soldier wishes to be vindictive towards the German. But he very properly says, "" I have fought a desperate and dreadful fight. You promised to give me a chance in life after the war was over. These islands are necessary for the defence of AusMv. Hughes. tralia. With whom do you propose to garrison them-wit h Germans or with Australians?"" That is the point. And common sense suggests the answer, ""We shall garrison them with those upon whom we can rely when the hour of danger comeSi"" able member's time has expired. I shall see that the men. whose cases have been referred to get a fair deal. -The motion of the Leader of the OppoBesition may be divided into three parts, and I shall deal with them in their order of importance. So far as the internment camps are concerned, I cannot support the Leader of the Opposition, because I was a prisoner of the Germans for six months, and I know that the conditions of the Germans interned in Australia were much superior to the conditions of the British and Australian prisoners who were in German hands. Nobody who was interned in Australia has any real cause for complaint, and I do not believe that complaint regarding their conditions is made by them. I have said to the internees, "" It is all very well to say you have been unjustly interned, but when a country is at war it cannot take any chances. You may not be guilty of disloyalty, but, as a policy of precaution, if for no other reason, tbe Government are although you have been interned, you have had the advantage of a feeling of security, and the knowledge that you will evening, or next morning, with some regularity.

38,Mr Wienholt,"I agree with theplain of being interned. Indeed, I have beard recently from friends that tbe whole of the original settlers of German East Africa have been sent back to Germany. I agree with the argument advanced by the Prime Minister in regard to the Pacific Islands. According to how we use them, they will be a source of either weakness or strength from a defence point of view. I am not one to advocate the vindictive treatment of these people. They ought to be given the full value of their plantations, and with their families be treated reasonably and courteously; but I believe that it would be better, even for these people themselves, to adopt the Prime Minister's policy of settling the islands with Australians and other Britishers. Now we come to the treatment of our out to the internees, but that is not posnative-born and naturalized subjects, and sible within the limited time at my disthis is a different question altogether. In posal. Another reason which causes meregard to these, I entirely agree with the to leave that portion of the subject unLeader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), touched is that the War Precautions Act and intend to support the motion, if only still operates, and I should be rather for that part of it alone. The Prime timid in using some of the information I Minister said that disloyalty, or feelings have received from interned men in case of disloyalty, were to a great extent it might be used against them. I shall stirred up amongst those who had been confine myself, therefore, to the request guilty of it-and I agree this may have that these Australian-born subjects have been so-by some who were not Germans. a chance for justice.

I have on a previous occasion referred to what I regard as the injustice of taking away the franchise from our fellowAustralians. Many of the sons of these men went to the war, and all too many did not return. I intend to support the latter part of the motion; and I also intend, as far as it is possible for one member to do so, to fight the cause of these native-born and fellow-citizens. me great pleasure to find the Leader of the Labour party ( Mr Tudor) bringing this question before the House. TheLabour party, in the past, has stood for humanity and justice, and we find it today maintaining the same attitude. I shall address my remarks principally to the request for a Royal Commission, or a Select Committee, to give Australian-born Germans an opportunity to clear themselves from the charges of disloyalty. I should have liked to deal with the internment camps,, and the treatment meted In South Australia recently, Mr T. The British Constimans at Loxton, and he has presented as it must have been in the thrill of loathing of German militarism through Empire, it was not surprising to find that ambiguous or equivocal or even primal faeie innocent German doings and utterances had, for many persons, only one significance.

39,Mr Gabb (Angas) [11.48],"It afford*German neighbours, individually and collectively. The magistrate admits, what we all know, that under the influence of the lashings of the press, particularly, it was possible that people were suspicious of anything that had a German name or flavour, and, therefore, persons from the beginning were suspected and watched. The point I wish to impress on honourable members is that I am not making an appeal for aliens, because those to whom I am referring are as much Australian as any one here. Their ancestors may have come from another country, but some of them are of the second and third generations. I wish to bring under the notice of the House the case of two men who are Australian-born, and residents of Loxton. The honourable member for ""Wakefield ( Mr Richard Poster) said that one of these men, Mr Drabsch, was the "" pick of the bunch,"" but I know others in South Australia-and the honourable member ought to know them, toowho are just as good as the man re« ferred to. I am rather surprised that the honourable member, who comes from a district where there are probably men similarly situated, should express such an opinion. The report of the magistrate goes onThe first Loxton Recruiting Committee; comprising Mr A. W. R. Drabsch (chairman), Mr H. T. Eime (secretary), Major Esselbach, and Mr K. Wallace, were in office when Sergeant Kempster, in the capacity of recruiting officer, arrived at Loxton in' February, 1916. I desire military members of this House to take notice of this part of the report, because it contains the magistrate's comment on one of the military men concernedThe sergeant, in effect, accused tlie committee of purposely hampering him, or neglecting to assist him, by refusing to supply him with a conveyance to take him round the district. "" I here remark of Sergeant Kempster,"" says the Commissioner, ""and the comment which follows applies to all the incidents in which he is concerned, that his wounds are a voucher for the gallant discharge of his obligations to the Empire during two visits to the Front. He appears to have been zealously anxious to succeed, but the matter and manner of his testimony conveyed the impression that either by temperament or by reason of his experiences at the Front he was inclined to prejudge and misjudge any committee constituted, as this was."" The magistrate points out that, because this Recruiting Committee was so' conMr Gabb. stituted, this officer was inclined to prejudge and misjudge the members on that accoiuit""His statements were (unavoidably, perhaps) vague and general. Some were exaggerated, some contradictory, and one, at least, obviously unreliable, as where he stated as a fact within his knowledge that which in the nature of things could be only hearsay or surmise. Either his memory was sadly at fault, or he was prepared to make out his case without regard to the truth. I find that the evidence does not support the sergeant's imputations."" Mr Drabsch and Mr Eime, who were chairman and secretary respectively of the Committee, were put in the internment camp, and kept there. Thank goodness, in their case they had a chance, by means of this Royal Commission, of clearing themselves somewhat. There are many others, however, in South Australia. I should say there are, at any rata, twenty Australian-born, not to mention naturalized, men-wh o ought to be accorded an equal opportunity. me the date when these two men were interned ? able gentleman the year. My point is that there are others, who, if they had the opportunity, would no doubt be able to clear themselves. One man of whom I know intended to go into business after he came out of the internment camp, and secured a place in a certain town in South Australia; but, no doubt, because of his internment, pressure was brought to bear, and he was unable to keep the premises. There is no doubt that unless these men have an opportunity to disprove the charges against them, they will be penalized if they attempt to enter into business operations. In my own district there are, I think, three men who are amongst the leading business men of the towns in which they reside, and they are placed in a very unfair position by reason of the imputations resting on them. I had intended to show the work which Mr Drabsch did on different patriotic committees, and so forth, and to emphasize the fact that he had a son at the Front; but time will not permit of this. It is to be noted that the Royal Commission could deal only with the cases at Loxton, and then not as fully as they should have been dealt with. This was due to the fact that the military had the",25,Intbenees

In that respect the powers invoked by that Department were contained in the Aliens Instruction Order, No. 2, 1915. Alien enemies might be interned for carrying arms; for failing without good cause to report under instruction 20, which provided for periodical reports; for refusing to sign parole; and on reasonable suspicion of disaffection, or whose freedom was or might become prejudicial to the Allies' cause. The last ground extended to naturalized and other persons. I do not object to that, in so far as it applied to aliens, because such action was absolutely necessary, but the last ground mentioned extended to "" naturalized and other persons,"" in whose cases suspicion was enough to bring about internment. Eveni f it is granted that such ""suspicion"" may be necessary in war-time, it is not necessary to-day; and where is the harm of giving these men a chance to clear themselves? The report proceedsClearly no inference of actual disaffection or disloyalty was to be drawn from the mere fact of internmentThat is a little solace to those who were internedand both the scope of the Commission and the restrictions imposed on grounds of public policy by the rules of the Defence Department barred investigation of each particular case. Every fair-minded man on either side of the House would, I think, like something done to give our fellow Australians a "" fair go."" I should like to make some reference to Tanunda, as the Prime Minister has attacked it, because have moved freely amongst the people there. I have known them to be loyal citizens; and if the Prime Minister were to do so as he suggests, namely, to hoist the TJnion Jack in the midst of the town, he would be able to get nearly every man in Tanunda-if not every individualto walk past and salute the flag. The Prime Minister argues that the German blood is in their -veins, and that, necessarily therefore, their leanings must be towards Germany. He loses sight of the fact, apparently, that their fathers or grandparents came out here because of the treatment which they suffered in Germany. Is it not only natural, but inevitable, that those forefathers should The report of the magistrate have instilled into the minds of their Australian-born descendants a hatred of the German system which drove them out of the Fatherland; and that, instead of those children being pro-German, their feelings should be entirely in the opposite direction? The hall-mark of a small-minded man is fanaticism. I have no doubt that among the members of the Ministry there are men big and broad minded enough to treat all their fellowcitizens in a decent manner; but I am quite certain that the Prime Minister is not big-minded enough to give these German descendants a decent show. I warn the Prime Minister that if I cannot get -more satisfaction in response to my straight and fair questions in regard to the Tanunda Club, I shall move the adjournment of the House one day, and see if justice cannot be done. ' The Prime Minister must either have a dirty case, or no case at all, otherwise he would properly endeavour to have my questions answered instead of continually sidetracking them. If the Government can refuse to answer or trickily dodge answers to questions, what is the use of honourable members placing them upon the notice-paper? I am not bringing forward this subject because I want, or like, to do so, but because injustice has been done, and I feel bound, therefore, to endeavour to counter it. support the principle which has been very clearly enunciated by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Wienholt). It is to the effect that, in the spirit of I the very best British traditions, we owe to all those of whom we are the guardians -whethe r they be native-born or naturalized-the right of fair trial before being adjudged guilty and punished. Whatever may have been drastically necessary in time of war, when empires were flying at each other's throats, does not apply today. Days of trial and stress were not the times for sickly or weak administration. There is another phase of the question, and it goes a long way beyond the points raised in this motion. It has to do with the future life of Australia. I trust that our statesmanship will be sufficiently broad and generous to realize that, if we are'to people this country from the white",26,Intbenees
42,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [12.2],"Iraces of the earth, we must always remember that nothing so rankles in the minds of a community as a sense of injustice. We want no racial animosities in this country. I feel certain that this Parliament will say that if grave errors have been made during the war owing to the inevitable stress of those perilous days, opportunity should now be afforded, if possible, to redTess our mistakes. lieve that the objects of this motion could be satisfactorily met in the cases of those who were interned merely upon suspicion or because-they bore German names. The Prime Minister has stressed that these people were interned at a time when our nation was at war, and when immediate, definite, and drastic steps had to be taken at a crucial stage in our history. I presume that the military authorities have in their possession the whole of the particulars concerning every internee. there is nothing actually provable against them, beyond the fact that their names are German and that they were interned on suspicion, would it not now be far better, far more effective and economical, if the individuals in question were furnished with discharge certificates? These documents could be drafted to show that there was no charge brought against them, and no act of disloyalty proven. As for those against whom there was either the charge or a strong suggestion of disloyalty, I hold that they should be brought to trial, even now, and that only such persons should be tried; and, moreover, that if they should be found to have been openly disloyal they should be deported forthwith. number of Australian-born who -bear German names, as well as others, against whom the military authorities can bring no charge whatever. Surely they could be sent back into the community with a clean, record! To have been interned should not, in itself, be regarded as a stigma. In the case of numbers of internees, the only thing that can have been held against them, either by the authorities OT their fellow-citizens, is that they have German names. We cannot remove their names; neither can we blot out the fact that they were interned during the war. that they were interned. But I won'deT whether the German or Austrian authorities are likely to be issuing certificates to interned Britons, to make known that there was nothing held against them. I doubt if our late enemies are likely to spend any money upon such a procedure. Nevertheless, if we had nothing against those whom we interned we should issue certificates so phrased that they might present them, whenever necessary, in order to clear themselves from any hint' of disloyalty. I am bound to agree with much the Prime Minister has said this morning, and with a great deal, also, of that which was uttered by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Wienholt). But the motion opens up a very big question. The war is over, but are we Australians showing any tendency towards proving as generous as the people of the Homeland? If The individual who happens to have control of that Imperial Department which deals with all the Dominions is a born German, whose name is Lord Milner. able member is correct.

Perhaps he will say There are quite a that the words appearing upon the cre»t of the Prince of Wales, namely, "" Ich Dien,"" are not German. If I ever make a misstatement, however, I will welcome its correction. We know full well that the man who was at the head of the British Navy at the outbreak of war was a born Prussian, and that it was the intense feeling in England and Scotland, and largely in Ireland, too, I suppose, which compelled the powers that be to enforce his retirement.

I , certainly, am not prepared to say that the people of the British Isles were wrong in feeling that if Battenberg had remained at the head of the British Navy our ships ere now would have been under the North Sea. I belonged to the Turn Verein in this city-and am proud to 3ay so-for close upon forty years. During the whole of that time. I had dear friends among the German community in Melbourne. Thirty of them offered their services in the ranks of the Australian 'Imperial Force; and some there are from among them who will never come back. My Democracy was first learned within the walls of the Turn Verein, from those old rebels who were compelled tc fly from Germany in 1S48. And when that old veteran, Techo, desired-awa y back in 1S88-to revisit Germany in -order that he might look once more upon the spot where he was born, and then return to die in the country which had been so kind to him, that brute-beast, Bismarck, would not permit him to enter the Fatherland, even though an amnesty had been proclaimed in the early fifties. This veteran and his old mate stood at the frontiers of Germany, and in their anger they spat upon the German territory on which Bismarek would not allow them to tread again. When the Turn Verein was closed during the war the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) justly said that there was nothing against that institution, but that he thought it would be better to close it. For such physique as now stands me in good stead I have to thank the Turn Verein gymnasium. The Government have been seeking to buy the property, for official purposes, at very much less than its value. I personally offered the Government £10,000. The money was not mine, but my name was linked with that of a gentleman who was prepared to furnish the capital. However, that has been turned down, and I am glad that the City of Melbourne Swimming Club is now making negotiations. I sincerely hope these will be successful. will be opened this winter. that the free teaching of physical culture man blood expressed their fealty and will be undertaken as is desired. Turn Verein was a workmen's club. When on one occasion I visited the swell"" German club, situated in a lane off Collins-street, I quickly saw that it was there that the Germans in our midst were carrying on the old Prussian ideals. Its members held that no one was respectable unless he wasj at the very least, a lieutenant. One of them said to me, "" Will you permit us to have the honour of putting you up for membership?"" I "" said, "" No; I belong to the Turn Verein."" ""But,"" he expostulated, ""that'is a common workmen's club."" I will not repeat the answer which I tendered, but will merely indicate that it was so hot that the individual concerned never spoke to me again. I preferred to be associated with the workmen's club. Of those who were members of that aristocratic Prussian institution I have no hesitation in saying that the majority were enemies in our midst. I have lost two beloved German friends in this war, and one who ended his life most unhappily in Sydney as the outcome of a trouble of which I had been unaware. Now that the waT is over we have nothing against the naturalized or Australian-born Germans, and it is our right and duty to restore to them the freedom of this land. I have sought for information in many directions, but I have not heard of a single instance in which the German, nation, with all its faults, has not played the game towards the naturalized Germans of British birth, but, of course, I know that there are very few Englishmen who have become naturalized Germans. A little while ago students at the Melbourne University, who took the course of modern languages, were compelled to pass in German and French. There may have been an alteration, but if not, the State Government, which endows the University, should insist on the students -being given the choice of one of the languages of our allied nations, or perhaps the language of a neutral country.

On one occasion at a function of the Turn Verein, at which the German Consul presided, I was asked by some of my friends if I would say a few words. that I knew their German system better than they did themselves, but they assured me that they intended to carry their programme right through to the drinking of the health of the Consul. They did so. Then a little revolution broke out. They would not permit the Consul to leave the chair until the Dutch Consul and I had spoken. I took the opportunity .of telling them that I did not blame them for loving their Germany, but that I stood for a higher thing, namely, that it was the duty of every man to give his loyalty to that country which was most kind to him, and that once he had sworn fealty to that country, it deprived him of whatever sentiment he might attach to the country which chanced to give him birth. I told them that I, as an Australian, loving Australia, claimed their children, children, and I pointed out that ultimately Australia would hold them. After the function my old friend, eighty or ninety years of age, came to me and asked me what had put the idea into my head. He said that he had had the greatest difficulty in making his children talk German, and had failed to get his grandchildren to do so. I told him that they were now good Australians, and would soon forget Germany.

However, the fact should be made widely known, so that those people who are anxious to go to America will not be applying for what they will be refused. It would save a lot of heartburning if it were made perfectly plain that the United States of America Government do not desire that any one of German blood or name should go to America, because many persons have already sold their businesses and secured their passports, and there is every probability that when they are prepared to leave Australia they will be blocked by the United States of America consul.

It has been stated that it was necessary to keep certain medical men in Australia, not because of their loyalty to this country, but because of the .professional work they are able to do, and the special skill that they possess. That was said regarding two well-known German surgeons, one of whom was recently released. He was brought to Melbourne from Holdsworthy, and was about to be put on a steamer for Java, when, through some influence, he was set at liberty, and allowed to practise his profession again. Now, the glory of British surgery is its proficiency in that special branch of which this man is said to be the only skilled exponent in Australia. rivalled as the world's master of orthopedic surgery, and there are dozens of men in Australia who, before the war, had more skill than this German surgeon, and scores now who, by reason of their experience with war casualties, excel h i m in skill.

[12.43] -As there remains only a little more than a quarter of an hour for the finishing of tlie debate, and some members opposite may desire to speak, I shall be as brief as possible. I notice, w i th some degree of satisfaction, the altered attitude of the Prime Minister towards the request for an inquiry. He says to-day that he has no serious objection to the request for an inquiry now made by those who were interned. I remember his at[71] titude of some months ago, when I introduced to h i m a deputation of returned soldiers from a district in my division, who approached h i m in reference to certain persons whom they believed to have been wrongfully interned. These returned men, although they had fought for the liberties of this country, felt that they could not support an injustice, and wished to hear from the Prime Minister himself what were the charges levelled against the internees. were three returned men on tbe deputation; but they also presented a petition signed by a number of 'other returned Sir Robert Jones stands unsoldiers in the district, so that it w ill be seen that this was not a mere hole-andcorner affair. A t the close of the interview, after the Prime Minister had emphatically refused to make known what the charges were, I said to him, "" A m I to understand that these men w ill have to go down to their graves without having made known to them the charges alleged against them."" He replied that the nature of the charges could not be disclosed, and he held out no hope that they would ever be made known. That being so, I am somewhat pleased to find the right honourable gentleman taking up a different attitude to-day. that his promise of to-day w ill go the way of all others. I do not expect that much w i ll come out of it ; but will give the Prime Minister the benefit of any doubt in my mind, in the hope, that something will be done. I shall deal with this question in a general way, without mentioning the names of individuals. I have here a copy of a letter addressed to the Ministerf o r Pefence (Senator Pearce) by a New South Wales solicitor, who was intrusted with the cases of some of the internees. The reply that he received illustrates the way. iii which all these cases have been treated. A t the head of his letter, this solicitor gave the names of several in ternees at Holdsworthy Camp, for whom he was acting, and wroteAs solicitor for and on behalf of the above internees, 1 have the honour to request that 1.

They most respectfully and earnestly ask that you will accord them the privilege and opportunity, as requested, of asserting and proving their innocence. The writer of this letter, Mr JohnW i l kinson, who, I need hardly say, is an Australian born, with no enemy blood in his veins, appends the following certificate to a copy of this letter which I have receivedI certify the above to be true extracts from my letter to the Honourable the Minister for Defence of the Sth April, 1918, and that my application for details of the charges and the granting of an open trial waB absolutely refused. Senator Pearce's reply to Mr Wilkinson's letter was a lengthy one, and I w ill therefore summarize it . would not be in the public interest to make known the charges, but that the men concerned might furnish the Department with particulars of any distinct act of loyalty on their part. In reply to that offer, one of the internees, who was a councillor, furnished through his solicitor to the Department a statement showing that, six months before his internment, he submitted to the shire council of which he was a member the most comprehensive scheme ever placed before a municipality for helping returned soldiers to settle on the land, and that he had invited the council to appeal to farmers in the district to make land available for the purpose. He offered 100 acres of his own land free of rent for the use of returned soldiers. It was suggested by him that others should do the same, and that machinery and teams should be supplied to help returned men so settled to harvest their crops. He also showed that he had taken part in recruiting. What was wanted was lip-loyalty. not a lip-loyalist. Instead of ""napping the flag,"" he did practical work. man gave distinct cases in which he had assisted in recruiting, and showed that he had given permission to his own son to go to the Front. All this, however, was of no avail. The final answer was that he would have no opportunity to state his case, and that the charge made against him would not be made known. That is one example of the treatment meted out to these men. There are many others to which, if time permitted, I could refer. In one case an internee pointed out to the Defence Department, through his solicitor, that he had a son at the Front. We all know that there was a provision in the regulations that no man who had a son at the Front should be interned, even if he were of German origin. Buti t took this man a considerable time to have this simple fact made known to the Department. I have here a letter from the Ministerf o r Defence, in which he states that it was not known that the man had a son at the Front, otherwise he would not have been interned. His release was immediately ordered. The fact that so much time elapsed before he could make it known to the Department f i e stated that it that hie son had gone to the Front shows the conspiracy that was going on. D r . EAR:LB PAGE It was just muddlingthere was something more at the back of it all. I agree w i th the Leader of my party ( Mr Tudor) that throughout the war a spirit of vindictiveness was rampant. The Prime Minister admits that the war period was one of frenzy-that men were not able to view things in their true perspective, and there were undoubtedly, unfortunate victims of this frenzy. In many cases internees were Australian-born of the second generation, and the way in which they were treated was cruel. I know some of these men to be quiet, inoffensive citizens.

79,Mr Parkermoloney,"I thinkBritish liberty will be prepared 'to deny them this. I have tried to discnss this matter without any display of heat, but I desire to say to the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Wienholt) that while I agree with his protest against the action of the Government in robbing some of our Australian-born citizens of their votes, he had an excellent opportunity, almost as soon as he entered this House, of showing, in the most emphatic way, his contempt for the Government. He had an opportunity to vote to remove them from oiffice, but on that occasion he crossed over and voted against his own party to keep the Government where they are. I shall not occupy my f u l l time, because I know that the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) desires to speak in the few minutes remaining for the consideration of this question; but I shall expect the Prime Minister to honour his promise. I shall have ample time to express my views. While the war was on many mistakes were doubtless made. It is quite possible that many persons were arrested on suspicion, or upon information given in confidence by different people. Such cases must occur in war time, and it would be absolutely wrong for the Government to grant an inquiry into the reasons which actuated the Ministeri n regard to many of these internments. I am satisfied that 1 manv persons must have been unjustly interned, but during a war such as thatthrough which we have just passed some injustices are sure to occur. It is time, however, that we got back to the conditions that prevailed before the war. I am not content to leave our civil rights or the civil rights of any of our people in the hands of the Defence Department. It is the duty of the Government, as soon as possible, ito take from the Defence Department the control of all these matters, and to put them under the control of either the Department of Home and Territories or the Attorney-General's Department. If any of these people at a time of great crisis committed an offence against our punished before now. member point to any part of the world where, during the war, internees were given a t r i a l ? [ 7 1 ] -8 ing out that by this time those who have 'been interned ought to know exactly where they stand. It is idle to talk about the clemency that has been displayed. I brought before the Government the case of two Australian girls, the daughters of a respected resident of Fremantle, who had a son fighting at the Front. In pre-war days, when we were at peace w it h Germany, and the Germans were our friends, the girls married two naturalized Germans. case for the honourable member ? tleman helped us very considerably. TheAustralian Government ultimately gave a passport to one of these girls and her husband to go to F i j i ; but, unfortunately,, on arrival they were not allowed to land. They were hunted by a mob, their passport was taken from them, and they were even refused permission to return to Australia. Action was taken to enable them to come back here, and I understand the husband is being deported to Switzerland. A decided effort was made by the Defence Department to denaturalize many Germans who had secured naturalization papers. In one case a friend of my own, with a splendid record of twenty years as a naturalized British subject, was interned. It may be that he was properly interned, but he and all others who have been dealt with in this way should know the charges made against them. If there is any charge against them it should be dealt w it h immediately. If there is not, then they should be no longer l e ft with the suspicion hanging over their heads. It is time that the Government determined to deal promptly with these matters. Where offences have been committed, I hope that punishment will be meted out. lic inquiry. public inquiry in regard to these cases, country, they should have been which have not yet been ""finalized, "" if further punishment is desired. the honourable Debate interrupted understanding order 119.

It is estimated by those who are in the best position to know that two years will be sufficient for the vocational training of these men in various industries, because it does not mean a long apprenticeship as, for instance, to engineering. I do not say the men are more receptive at the ages at which they have arrived, but they are more likely to persevere than are boys who are just leaving school. Under the circumstances, I see no necessity for the appointment of the Commission for five years. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) suggests that if we reject the amendment it will mean a double dissolution, but that would not be possible under section 57 of the Constitution; at any rate, if the Government desired a double dissolution, they woidd select a more important question than this. The reason given for the inclusion of the Pensions Department under the Repatriation administration was that the arrangement in three yeaTS could be reviewed, and I lelieve that influenced the voting of honourable members on the point. [2.32] I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) in his objection to the proposal of the Government. I am more convinced than ever that our best interests can be served by limiting the period to three years. I am dead against building up any new Department. I have learned unofficially from soldiers outside that the idea is not that of the Government, but is urged by the returned soldiers, and the Government, therefore, cannot advance the contention that they themselves believe that it is essential to proper administration. If the information I have received is not correct, let the Government say so. I contend that what is intended is merely a buffer between the Government and those who are objecting to certain, action in the administration. I can easily conceive that if the suggestion were submitted by the soldiers it would .be acceptable from a Ministerial point of view, especially from the point of view of the Minister in charge of the Department. However, my objection is to the creation of new Departments that are not absolutely essential, and I have heard nothing to convince me that the proposed change is in the interests of efficiency. I move That the following words be added:-""bu t is amended by inserting the word ' months' after the word ' three'"". The speech of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) is entirely in accord with my views. The whole proposal before us is absolutely 'ridiculous, and had I been present when this Bill was considered in Committee I should have moved an amendment to express my view. The bulk of the pensions work is already completed, and if there is one satisfactory feature in connection with the provisionmade for returned soldiers it is the manner in which that work has been done by the existing Department. The staff of that Department is fully organized to deal with old-age and invalid pensions, and experience has shown that it is thoroughly competent for the work in connection with the soldiers. This work the Department has been doing quite satisfactorily for four years; and now, when about nine-tenths of it has been completed, it is proposed to create a new Department to do the "" washing up."" My object in moving the amendment is to have the work continued as in the past. There is not an honourable member-no t even amongst the new members-wh o has not had these matters brought under his notice; and I challenge any one to say that as much satisfaction has not been found with the Pensions Department as with any branch of the Repatriation administration or of the military service. My desire is to test the feeling of the House as to whether a new Department should be created. ister for Works and Railways) [2.44] I should like to remind the honourable exactly where we stand in relation to the Bill.

Commission therefore will be an administrative, not merely an advisory, body; and it is very desirable, to achieve the best results, that the tenure of the personnel should be secure, because experience gained over a longer term of years in dealing with complicated cases will enable the head of the Department to become practically a repository of information in connection with the cases that may come before the Commission. A new Department will not be created. The magistrates who today are dealing with these matters will go over to the Repatriation Department, but ' of necessity the Deputy Commissioners Will give way to the State Boards. For administrative reasons five years would be preferable to a term of three years, because the Commission will be dealing with large sums of money, and it is advisable that we should get the very best men available for the work. The Commissioners, when appointed, will be disqualified from carrying on any private calling. We want to secure the best men available, but if we accept a limitation of three years we shall, by so doing, limit our choice. than that we should build up new Departments. based upon an entire misconception. merely a transfer of officers from one Department to another.

The idea of the honourable member is to prevent the Repatriation Department from dealing with pensions at all. The issue between the Senate and this Chamber is another matter, and is confined to the tenure of the Commissioners in office: The amendment of the honourable member for Franklin would, in effect, re-open the whole Bill regarding an essential principle. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, and to stand by the proposals of the Government. raise a point of order. The amendment of the honourable member for Franklin is to limit the tenure of office to three months. I ask for a ruling whether it is competent for this Committee to so materially alter its own previous decision. amendment of the honourable member for If the amendment is agreed to the Bill will be virtually destroyed.

I have all along strongly already affirmed. Department should be brought within the control of the Repatriation Commission. My only regret is that the scope of the Commission is limited in that it will not control the matters of war service homes and soldiers' settlements. That is my sole objection to the Bill. I am surprised at the honourable member for Franklin having proposed his amendment. So far as I can recall, there was no hint on the part of honourable members of disapproval of the principles underlying the Bill when it was originally considered in this chamber. The object of the honourable member now, obviously, is to destroy the Bill. Of course, I do not intend to support him; neither do I favour the limitation of office to three years. far as I can recall the proceedings of this Committee, when honourable members were originally considering the Bill, opinion was divided on the question whether the Pensions Department should be placed under the control of the Commissioners or retained as at present. A decision was arrived at, and now the Franklin seeks to limit the tenure of the Commissioners, in respect of all purposes, to a period of three months. Their functions cover more than the administration of pensions, the question on which the Committee was tested before. The functions of the Commissioners are much wider, and the Minister has referred to some of them. I do not recollect the honliams) testing this question in the Committee previously.

There is a clear issue as to whether the appointments should be for five years or three years. The Government previously accepted a proposal to make the term three years. Now, the Minister has given a reason why they should go back on that acceptance. I understand that the reason why the Government accepted the three years' term before was a very strong reason-the fact that the numbers were against them. I can understand the powerful persuasion of numbers in a question of this kind. Perhaps the Minister will inform me, by interjection, whether he feels that the numbers are with him on this'occasion. the voting on this amendment may be, I hope that we shall still have preserved to us. the right to decide whether the term of office of the Commissioners shall be five years or three years. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -The question I put to the Committee was only the amendment moved by the honourable member for matter may come up for consideration later. far-reaching than that which was moved when the Bill was previously before us in Committee. ried, we shall have an opportunity to decide only whether the term of office shall be five months or three months. if this amendment is carried it will destroy the Bill. I wish it to be made clear that whatever the effeot of the voting on the amendment may be, we shall still be in a position to divide on the question of whether the term shall be five years or three years. the amendment is carried. well known to honourable members that when this Bill was under consideration in Ccmmittee before, I voted for an amendment providing that the Pensions Department should not be transferred to the control of the Repatriation Commission. I wish to be consistent; but, unused to the procedure of Parliament, I am somewhat confused as to the effect of the amendment now before the Committee. I believe that the administration of the Pensions Department should be left where it is, and the Repatriation Commission should be confined to the administration of matters connected solely with repatriation. Whether the word "" months"" is substituted for the word ""years"" or not, I cannot see that the result would be to in any way alter the provision with respect to the administration of the Pensions Department included in the Bill. If the amendment is intended to secure the abolition of the Repatriation Commission, that is quite a different matter. of the amendment. the. transfer of the Pensions Department to the Repatriation Commission does not arise under the amendment, which is intended practically to prevent the appointment of the Commission. Pensions Department comes into the matter, as well as a number of other things. Commission is not to be appointed, there will practically be no Repatriation Bill.

159,Mr Maxwell,"The intention of thedc with the control of the Pensions Department? for Franklin says the intention is to destroy the Repatriation Commission. When this Bill was under consideration in Committee on the last occasion, whilst I did not like the idea of transferring the Pensions Department to the Repatriation Commission, I knew that this measure provided for benefits which are not provided for under the existing Act. I am not disposed to vote for the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Corner may be to lose benefits which returned soldiers may derive under this Bill. am prepared to vote for a term of three years, as against five years for the members of the Repatriation Commission; but I am not prepared to cast a vote which would deprive many .soldiers of benefits under this Bill which are not provided for under the existing law. In this measure, provision is made for increased pentional duties were not given to it, to a very sions, and it includes people excluded from large extent there would be no justificabenefits under the existing law. The Minister for Works and Railways( Mr out by an honourable member on Groom) asks what will happen to the women and children; but they will be looked after. He says we have to keep up hospitals, but they would be kept up whether this Bill were passed or not. He asks, ""What about the consumptive patients; how are they to be dealt with?"" Are they not being dealt with now? Unless the Government have some better arguments than have been put up against the amendment so far, they have a very bad case. This House should be careful to retain control of the appointment of the Commissioners, and if we appoint them only for three years, we can re-appoint them if they prove worthy, and if 'their services are still further required. I contend that their work should be done in three years, and the various existing Departments should continue to carry on their work as they are doing now. If we create a new Department for five years, we are setting up a very expensive system at a time when expenditure ought to be curtailed. I hope that the Committee will have the opportunity of taking a direct vote upon the question, of whether the appointment of the Commissioners shall be for five years or three years, and I trust that honourable members will adhere to their previous decision to limit the period to three years. When this question was dealt with previously, on the amendment of the honourable member for Wannon to limit theperiod of appointment to three years, the argument put forward was that thepowers conferred upon the Repatriation Commissioners by the Bill were strictly limited in point of time, and there was no need for the appointment of Commissioners for a longer period than three years. Honourable members had to comeI to a determination upon the point without being able to give consideration to thepowers proposed to be bestowed upon theCommissioners, because they were fixed -by a later clause than that which fixed their term of appointment; and in this; connection Ministers contended that if theadministration of pensions was not intrusted to the Commission, and if addition for its appointment. It was pointed' the Ministerial side of the House that the existing Repatriation Department administration was capable of carryingto a completion the work already undertaken; and that unless additional powers were given to the Commissioners by incorporating in the Bill the proposal which the Committee will be discussingin a few moments, namely, the grantingof assistance to co-operative companies of returned soldiers, there would be absolutely no reason for the formation of new machinery in connection with the administration of repatriation matters. I have had considerable personal knowledge and experience of repatriation work in country districts, and I realize that, to a large extent, the Federal portion of this class of work has already been done. As I showed a fortnight ago, if the Commonwealth had retained control of the moneys handed over to the States in connection with repatriation, and if the Repatriation Commission wereclothed with authority to .take pwrt in thehandling of that work, the Commis-",41,Australia N Soldiers Repatriation Bill

177,Mr Fenton,"I am prepared to aswill be depriving tbe soldiers of the benefits that would accrue to them. It is a most cruel and unfair statement, and is not in accordance with fact, because no Government would be prepared, even if the amendment were carried, to drop the Bill and thus deprive those who are to benefit. I shall vote for the amendment in the hope that it will be carried, because I believe the Repatriation Department will proceed smoothly under the old regime, and that it is altogether unnecessary to create another Department. am glad to be able to take this opportunity of assisting the Government to carry out at least one of their pledges, if it means the establishment of a tribunal on which the soldiers will be represented. If the amendment is carried and the Commission dispensed with, I do not see how the Government can carry out their pledges. I therefore, with great pleasure, support the Government on this occasion. [3.28] -The Government are submitting two amendments made in another place, and if this House agrees to delete the provision relating to co-operative concerns there is no need for the appointment of a Commission. If the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr ture. Our war debt has to be reduced, McWilliams) is carried, the Government have threatened to drop the Bill altogether, and carry out the pensions work by the present Department, and the other work by the Repatriation Department, by granting that body extended powers. I believe that such a proposal would meet with the approval of the majority of the members of this Housei f the whip is not cracked. I am surprised that the Government allowed their colleagues in another place to submit these two amendments to this House. One provides that the Commissioners shall be appointed for a term of five years, instead of three, but the Government know that by deleting the provision relating to co-operative concerns the work of the Commissioners will be so reduced that there will be no need to extend their term. The whole thing is a farce, and I am in favour of the work being carried on by the present Department with extended powers, if necessary. The plausible speech of the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) was as devoid of argument as any speech ever delivered by a member of this Chamber, and that is saying a good deal. I fully believe that the amendment carried in another place would be accepted by the returned soldiers in this Chamber, who have formed a union, and who believe that the Government will have to meet their wishes if they are to have their support. I draw honourable members' attention, however, to the fact that sooner .or later the Government will have to face the financial position, and any honourable member who disregards the seriousness of the situation is not fit to be a member of this House. As I have stated previously, this is an attempt to create a new Department, and its cost will exceed all expectations. If honourable members only realized the expenditure that is likely to be incurred they would not be so anxious to pass a measure of this character. Although the Bill as it left this Chamber provided that the Commissioners were to be appointed for three years, there is nothing in the measure to prevent them being reappointed for a further period. I do not see why the taxpayers should be thus involved in further unnecessary expendiand it must not be regarded as a perpetual liability. afraid the honourable gentleman is departing from the question before the Committee. tention to the indebtedness of the Commonwealth, and the fact that the creation of new Departments involves us still further. I believe I am doing right in supporting the honourable member for Franklin, because the whole of the work proposed under this Bill can be carried out by existing Departments. I understand that twenty-one additional appointments will have to be made. As the returned soldier members of this Chamber have formed themselves into an organization, they are likely to stand by their friends in the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League some of whom will be interested in the new appointments.

Chamberf o r assistance to soldiers in ( establishing co-operative industries. I purpose to disagree with the Senate's rejection of the amendment, and to substitute an alternative one. Honourable members will agree that what is easily acquired is not very much thought of. Many years ago in Queensland the Government endeavoured to assist the unemployed, and to that end furnished them with funds to establish village settlements. No money was put up by the unemployed, but various groups received assistance from the Government. They went on to the land, and as soon as the money was done the co-operative societies burst up and became insolvent. It is true, as the McDonald) reminds me, that in some cases these co-operative village settlers were given very bad land, but in one case they got very good land, at Lake ""Weyba, in the Gympie district. Their committee decided that some members of the group should fell timber, others plough, and others fish. They had a quarrel as to who should build, who should cut timber, and who should fish, and finally they were all on the lake fishing. Under my alternative proposal the clause would readThe Commission shall, subject to the approval of the Minister, have power to assist soldiers by way of loan to the extent of pound proposition, and I hope honourable memfor pound contributed by them in cash or war bonds for the purpose of establishing industries on a co-operative basis, such industries further debate.
