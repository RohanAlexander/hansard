The proposal was made that some kind of merger should take place, but the Government is not committed to any policy on the matter.

27,Mr Speaker (Hon. G. J. Bell),""" the execution fixed for to-morrow of Lndwig Schmidti n the Territory of New Guinea "". Five honourable members having risen in mpport of the motion, movingThat the House do now adjourn, I submit that the contemplated execution to-morrow of Ludwig Schmidt, who was convicted of w i l f u l murder by the Supreme Court of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea and sentenced to death, is a matter of great importance to the people of Australia. I shall discuss the subject, first, from the point of view circumstances the judiciary or Parliaof a large section of the community which is altogether opposed to capital punishment upon ethical grounds, and, later, 1 shall deal with another aspect of the subject. It has been recognized within modern times that the main purpose of punishment is tbe prevention of crime, and, therefore, the fundamental purpose of capital punishment is that it shall act as a deterrent to capital offences. It has been proved beyond doubt, however, that capital punishment has been of no value whatever as a deterrent, and for that reason alone, if for no other, no Parliament or court has the right to take away a life which only the Greater can give. If we, the members of tliis Parliament, are sincere in our profession of Christianity, and are true to the oath which we take, we cannot support in any way the taking of human life. As to the execution which is fixed for to-morrow, every member of this Parliament is in the position of a judge to decide whether or not Ludwig Schmidt shall suffer the death penalty. There are 74 members of this House, and we have the power to prevent effect from being given to the sentence. In this Parliament to-day every honourable member who does not vote to prevent the death penalty from being carried out w ill be just as guilty of the death of the accused as w ill the hangman himself. illusions on that point. Instead of dealing with this matter as an abstract problem, let us face the fact that, for the first time in the history of federation, a white man is to be executed in one of the dependencies under the control of this Commonwealth. Let us consider carefully before we place this first blot upon our f a i r escutcheon. I trust that no honourable member, who may later take part in this debate, w ill enter into the merits or demerits of this particular case, or attempt to determine the defendant's guilt. This Parliament does not sit in a judicial atmosphere. We are not called upon to consider evidence according to the rules of law. We are in no position to judge dispassionately in respect of the weight of the evidence, or the guilt or innocence of the condemned man; but we are in a position to declare whether we believe that in any ment itself should be permitted to authorize the taking of human life. No murder is more premeditated, more coldblooded, than judicial murder, which fixes a certain hour of a certain day when a man shall be called upon to suffer the death penalty all the resources of tbe law are exerted to prevent a condemned man from taking bis own l if e in order that he may live until the prescribed moment appointed for his execution. When condemned men have attempted to commit suicide they have been given medical attention to keep them alive so that the law itself can cold-bloodedly exact its penalty. We have no authority to take human life in any circumstances. Right through the ages history has proved that the death penalty, instead of being a deterrent to crime, has, in many cases, induced people to commit other and more serious crimes, thinking that they might thereby avoid the discovery of their previous crimes. In the early days in England, almost all crimes were punishable by the death penalty. In 1930, a report was presented by a select committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into capital punishment. The report outlined the history of the subject, pointing out that, during the reign of Henry VIII . , 72,000 criminals were executed for theft Let us have no and robbery alone-a n average of, roughly, 2,000 a year. In subsequent years the number of persons executed rapidly diminished. During the ten years 1920 to 1929, the average annual number of persons executed in England and Wales was under fourteen. That is an exemplification of the modern tendency",11,Sentence Of Death Formal Motion Fob Adjournment
28,Mr Baker (Griffith ) [3.17],"I nto avoid the imposition of the death penalty. But this downward trend was by no means continuous. On page 5 of the report of that select committee, the following statement appeared:During the reigns of the four Georges, 1714 to 1830, Itili new offences were made punishable by death, until, in 1810, it was authoritatively stated before tlie select committee of the House of Commons that 220 offences were then capital . . . . Our legislation then proceeded in the spirit of Draco himself, the Archon of Athens, whoso laws, published iu U2I B.C., were said to be "" w r it t e n, the abolition of the death penalty for an not in ink, but iu blood,"" and who declared that ""the smallest crime deserved death, and he could find no other punishment for the greatest."" Charles Wesley wrote in 1776. A fortnight ago, I preached n condemned sermon to about twenty criminals; aud every one of them. 1 had good grounds to believe, died penitent. week. Mackenzie, the h is to r i a n , saysIf a man injured Westminster Bridge, he was hanged . . . if he cut down young trees; if he shot rabbits; if he stole property valued at 5s.; if he stole anything at all from a bleach field ; if he wrote threatening letters to extort money . . hanged. Sir Samuel Bom illy asserted that there was no country in the world "" where so many and so large a variety of actions were punishable by loss of life,"" and Sir Robert Peel, in his speech in Parliament in 1830, declaredI t is impossible to conceal that capital punishments are and the criminal law more whole, in this country than in the world. The report went on to point out the methods by which the death penalty was evaded by juries. An examination of the criminal law shows that the capital penalty was imposed in the early days for the theft of 5s. The result was that juries frequently found tbe defendant guilty of the theft of 4s. lOd. in. order to avoid the necessity for imposing capital punishment. accused person was charged with having stolen £5 from a dwellinga case in which the theft of 40s. was a capital offence-the jury found that the amount, was 39s. Those were the ways in which juries deliberately perjured themselves in order to avoid the imposition of the ""death sentence. The whole tendency of modern law has been to dispose of the extreme penalty. The select committee made certain conditional recommendations, which, although of great importance, do not affect this debate. For instance, it recommended that no person under 21 years of age should be sentenced to death, and that there might be a larger exercise of the Royal prerogative. The definite recommendations were as follows:1. That a bill be introduced and posed into law during the present session, providing for experimental period of five years in eases tiiod by civil courts iu times of peace. In war time, when the fate of the nation is at stake, the position is quite different2. That, meantime and forthwith, a resolution be passed by the House of Commons Twenty more must die next ducfariujr that the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, in tendering advice as to the exercise of the Royal prerogative of mercy, should recommend in each case that the death sentence should be commuted. .') In regard to the penalty that should be substituted for the sentence of death in the cases referred to, we recommend that it be . h e was immediately the penalty now attached to reprieved murderers, interpreted and administered in the same way as at present. That is what, we contend. We have the strongest possible evidence to support our case. I desire to touch briefly upon another aspect of the subject. I have already from ourselves dealt with the arguments against capimore frequent, tal punishment, and I now wish to-refer severe, on the to certain points associated with any country in t'he trial of Ludwig Schmidt. Unfortunately this man was not tried before a jury. SectionS of the Commonwealth Constitution specifically provides that in such cases the trial must be before a jury, but as the High Court has held that the laws of the Commonwealth do not apply to the Mandated Territory trial by jury was unnecessary. This man was tried by a judge who must take full responsibility in the matter. TwoI n a case in which an accomplices were tried at the same time as Schmidt; one was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, and another to imprisonment for ten years, but in the case of Schmidt the death penalty was imposed. Moreover, Schmidt was the only one of the accused who could not speak English and, therefore, could not understand properly the nature of the trial. I give the Government credit for apappeal to the High Court. Counsel maypointing counsel to assist him, and also have advised the Government that there for arranging for the services of an interwere insufficient grounds to justify an preter. depended upon the ability and inGovernment may have considered it tegrity of the interpreter, and being unnecessary to retain the service of the human he may ot may not have counsel in connection with an appeal. interpreted Schmidt, who could not understand Territory is theoretical only.

It is true that this is the fir3t occasion on which the execution of a white man has been contemplated; but tbe honourable member omitted to mention that natives have been -executed in those territories. In 1929 there were two executions of natives; in 1930, four; in 1933, ten; in 1934, twelve; and in 1935, nine. during the Labour regime after the instruction was given by the then Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) that the death penalty in a certain case should not be carried out. Although some of these executions took place during the regime of the Scullin -Government, the Administrator was requested to inform the Government of any further executions that were pro-posed; after that, so far as I am aware, no other executions were carried out -during the Labour Government's term of office. But before that period, during part of 1929 and 1930, several natives were executed. place with tbe knowledge of my government. not gainsay that. The honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) spoke at length nnd sentimentally regarding the awful possibility of a white man being executed in New Guinea, but he made no reference to the execution of the natives of the territory. parently tbe honourable member is content that one law should exist for the white man and another law for the native. fair. The Minister for Defence has misinterpreted my remarks. Those are the facts. Defence is endeavouring to bolster up a bad case. am stating facts of which the House is not aware. This white man has been sentenced to death according to the existing law in New Guinea. That law also obtained when the Scullin Government was in office, but its operation was restricted to the extent that the right lin) has stated. In 1932, however, the law reverted to its original basis with the consent of this Parliament. law was embodied in an ordinance in which this Parliament concurred, and it has remained in force ever since. As members of the Opposition have elected to ventilate this matter in Parliament I consider that the facts should be made known to the House. According to information that the Government has received, a party of prospectors in 1933 penetrated a certain part of New Guinea, a portion of which is wild territory and is not policed or under administrative control; therefore white men are asked to keep out of it. This party was composed of four menSchmidt, Schultze, Groos and King. .News takes a long while to travel in those parts, but a story of what 'might be termed the wholesale shooting of natives and the using of native women for certain purposes subsequently filtered through I do to the civilized districts. The report reached Sydney, and the Minister for External Affairs (Senator Pearce), while on a visit recently to the territories, was also made cognizant of it. The department naturally despatched a police expedition to the scene, and three members of that prospecting party-Schmidt, Schultz and King-were taken into custody. The fourth man escaped, and is stated to have left the territory. Three separate charges of murder were brought against Schmidt. In each of the first and second cases he was alleged to bave killed one native, and, in the third case, two natives. He was found guilty on each count and was sentenced to death. The report of the Chief Justice reveals that the crimes occurred on three separate Minister for occasions over a period of three months. The evidence shows that the native victims were defenceless, and that they were shot in the back by Schmidt while I they were running away.",14,Sentence Of Death Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

If they had been hostile they would have been carrying spears, or bows and arrows. axes with them of the kind used for ordinary peaceful domestic purposes. The only thing advanced by the defence as a justification for the killing was that the prisoner seemed to think that two of the natives had been following him about. He took one of them by the wrist, turned h i m round, and said, "" Y o u go "" ; then, as the man went, the prisoner shot him in the back. The evidence is that he did the same kind of thing to others. No attack was made to j u s t if y this deliberate and brutal murder. or not guilty? From the fact that the trial went on, and lasted a considerable time, I assume that he pleaded not guilty. Three charges were preferred against the prisoner, and on each he was found guilty, and sentenced to death. territory is not entirely under British rule. It is governed by Australia under a mandate from the League of Nations, and tbe mandate was given primarily for the protection and government of the natives. Obviously, it would be most unfair for the Government to permit the execution of natives convicted of capital offences-and I have mentioned the numbers that have been executed from time to time-and to commute the death sentence only when a white man is involved.

That fact places on the Parliament an even wider responsibility than would be placed upon a State Parliament in respect of any death sentence passed by a State court where capital punishment is already the law and where the prerogative to commute the sentence is exercised on the advice of the Executive Council, for nnder the law of the States an accused person is judged guilty or innocent by a j u r y of twelve which, it should be remembered, must be unanimous.

We may dismiss it , therefore, w it h fhi3 passing comment : that, whatever may be said for or against capital punishment, although, as my honourable colleague has also pointed out, this is the first time that tbe question has been raised in this Parliament, very many natives have been executed in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea under the provisions of the ordinance from which the authority which the Administrator of New Guinea has exercised in tliis case is derived. honourable members! able members did not haye the knowledge of any particular execution before it took place, but they cannot say that they do not know that, under this ordinance, very many executions have taken place. But on these they have hitherto remained silent. Now, belatedly, they have raised the question of capital punishment, declaring that we as a Government cannot r i d ourselves of the f u l l responsibility for what has been done or may be clone by the Administrator. I deny that entirely. Our responsibility is no greater in this case than in the case of any other human being in New Guinea who has been sentenced to death. This Parliament has no jurisdiction in the matter. The Governor General has power of pardon in cases of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, but none in this matter, as after the f u l l examination of the question, this Parliament transferred to the Administrator of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea the power to deal with all offences comHe may be made the mitted in the territory.

The Government has considered the Administrator's report, which sets out the facts relating to the offence and to the trial of the prisoner, and has been advised on the legal position. It is satisfied that there is no reason why it should interfere with the course of justice. The Commonwealth's responsibility is grave, indeed, but it is not as stated to-day by the honourable members who support this motion. Schmidt has committed a grave offence against the laws of the territory. He has been tried, convicted and sentenced under those laws. The prerogative of pardon is vested in the Administrator. He has not exercised it. There is another point which needs special emphasis. New Guinea and the islands nearby are held under mandate, and we are the guardians of the natives. It has been suggested, by implication at all events, that the natives may be shot by white men and that their killers should be allowed to go free. truth. able member for Griffith will withdraw that remark.

It has been said that Schmidt was The Government, howdenied justice or a fair trial because he speaks no English, but what of the unfortunate natives who were shot? He told them to go: they went, yet he shot them in the back. Could they speak, English, or German, which presumably the accused speaks? No the Governreason exists for interference by this Parliament. The Government has no jurisdiction. Schmidt has the right of appeal to the High Court of Australia, but he has not exercised that right, and the Administrator has informed the Government that he does not desire to appeal. It is clear, therefore, that his case has been tried on its merits. The sentence of death, so long as death is recognized under the law as the appropriate punishment for wilful murder, ought to be carried out. No other sentence than death ca ! 1 satisfy the natives of New Guinea that they are getting a fair deal. If a native murders a white man and is' hanged, it is just that similar punishment should be inflicted on the white man who murders a native. The points which mainly concern the Opposition are two: first, this is the first time in the history of the Commonwealth that the Commonwealth Government has been called upon to confirm a death sentence on a white citizen-that , of itself, is most important-secondl y that the Labour party throughout Australia is totally opposed to capital punishment.

It may not be the fact that Schmidt knows that he is guilty and deserves to be punished that prevents bim from appealing; it is the absence from the regulations of a provision for an appeal to any court of competent jurisdiction in Australia. A most important viewpoint which must not be overlooked in our consideration of this motion is that Schmidt, contrary to Australian conception of justice, was tried by a judge who sat without a jury. One man has decided his fate, and that on the uncorroborated and unreliable evidence of half civilized natives. order to bolster up the Government's case the Minister for Defence read from a document, and had he not been questioned regarding it he would have made it appear that it was an official document. not so. document I was quoting. not divulge the source of the quotation until he was challenged. before I quoted from it . was a quotation from a l u r i d journalistic write up, or from some sort of novelette or trade journal. just as well have quoted from a story by Charles Garvice. It has been argued that because tbe Opposition is opposed to capital punishment in this case in which a white man is concerned, it must necessarily favour capital punishment when natives are guilty of similar offences. cally deny that that is so. Labour party was in power in the Commonwealth, no native or white man was executed in any territory under its control. The Minisrejoinder to the contention of the Ministerf o r Repatriation that the Opposition is concerned in this case only because a white man's l if e is at stake. We, on this side, do not condone the taking of human life, whether it be the l if e of a white man or of a black man; nor do we endorse the action of the National Government in a sj>irit of vengeance and in a calm and deliberate manner deciding that at a certain hour on an appointed day a human l if e shall be taken. It is none the less murder even if it is legalized. There are some who advocate the old Mosaic law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but in the absence of evidence to show which of three men was the actual murderer, what man, or body of men, subject to human frailties, has the right to say who shall take tbe eye and who shall take the tooth? Others believe in the reformative aspect of a period of detention with opportuIn nities for repentance. If religious and spiritual factors are to _ be taken into account in our legislation and in our administration they certainly should be given consideration in instances of this kind. The Minister for Repatriation said that the public was I told the Housef r o m what public is not so greatly concerned with the vindication of justice as it is w i th the lurid details of executions provided by the press. I entirely agree with the Ministerf o r I did so Defence that the fate of a convicted murderer should not depend on the nature of the government which might be in power; It appears that it but surely that is a weak defence for the Minister to advance in support of the Government's attitude.

88,Mr Rosevear,"It is clear that I t may be that tliere were extenuating circumstances associated with the alleged shooting of the natives by Schmidt. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the natives were shot in the back when they were running away. Possibly that is so; but it may be that their plan of attack was discovered, and while retreating they had in their minds other ways of dealing with the white men, who had therefore good reason to fear further attacks. We do not know the extent of Schmidt's culpability. All we know is that it is alleged that three white men were implicated in certain crime; but whether Schmidt, or plices, actually committed the murder, has not been made clear. The Labour party in Australia is not alone in its opposition to capital punishment. Switzerland abolished capital punishment in 1874; Roumaniai n 1864; Portugali n 1867; Norwav in 1905; It a l y in 188S; Hollandi n 18S6; Finlandi n 1824; Belgium in 1863, and Queensland in 1922. In 1800 as many as 200 crimes were punishable by death in England. A person who stole anything of a value more than Is. was in danger of suffering the extreme penalty of the law. Probably no other country has seen as many executions as has Great Britain, yet 100 years ago the British Government concluded that the death penalty was not a deterrent only four crimes punishable by death in that country, but even so, the fact that there may be extenuating circumstances associated with the crime, nearly always robs the gallows of its prey. mentary on the state of mind of the Government that it should practically give its sanction to the killing of this man because it is alleged ithat he killed three natives, when only a few months ago it asked this House to carry a resolution of condolence at the death of one of the greatest mass murderers the world has known, Dr. Dolfuss, the late Austrian hundreds of men because they were socialists. ber has exhausted his Mr Rosevear. [ 4 . 3 0 ] I remind honourable members that under the terms of the "" C "" mandate, under which the Commonwealth Government administers the mandated territory of New Guinea, it is charged with the responsibility of preserving the welfare and care of the natives, and protecting them against exploitation, and worse, by whites. Here we have a relatively uncivilized country whose people still live largely under conditions of the stone age, in which white and black men are in actual contact. The punishment for w i l a f u l murder, both under the natives' unwritten law and under the white man's one, or both, of his accomwritten law, is death. That penalty has been carried out in many instances. Last year nine natives, I think, were executed for the murder of whites or other natives, and in the preceding j'ear, twelve natives were executed for murder. record! members recall the case of the young and promising son of the mayor of Geelong, who, as a district officer in New Guinea, was callously murdered by natives less than twelve months ago. Do honourable members opposite recollect that the lives of many district officers-and in many instances those of their wives-wh o are working on the edge of civilization, are under definite threat if justice is not done to crime. There are now in this case? Much has been said of humanitarianism by honourable members opposite on behalf of Schmidt who has been proved guilty of the most callous series of murders possible-the murder of unarmed natives by shooting in the It is a remarkable comback as they were running away. Do honourable members put themselves in the position of district officers working under conditions as they exist in New Guinea where they are re]atively defenceless and surrounded by thousands of natives who might quite well-and certainly w ill take their toll of the lives of our white district officers, if the law does not take its course in this case?

The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) suggested that the other two white men concerned in this t r i a l were accomplices of Schmidt. that suggestion I direct the honourable member's attention to the fact that these two men were convicted on charges other than murder, one of grevious assault, and the other of abduction with intent. There was no suggestion, according to the records on the file, that either of these two men had anything to do with the murders. with the murders. and the official papers show that his crime was the most brutal and most callous murder of defenceless natives. My last appeal to honourable members is on behalf of white district oflicers in New Guinea who shall live under constant threat if justice is not to be meted out in this instance. that, in justice to the Government and the party which I led some years ago, I should clear up the position in respect of statements made by the Acting Leader of the House, the honourable the Ministerf o r Defence( Mr Parkhill) to the effect that we were concerned only with reprieve for In the Library. The a white man and that, as a party or a Government, we took no steps to save the lives of natives who were under sentence of execution. I am surprised that the Minister, knowing the facts, should have made such a statement. The facts are that the first case of a proposed execution of a native which came to the knowledge of my Government happened some months after we took office. Details of it were radioed by Sir Hubert Murray, in which he stated that a native had been sentenced to death and that execution would take place in a few days. Immediately, I radioed to Sir Hubert Murray to hold his hand, and consulted the Cabinet, after which, I sent forward the view of my Government, that it was opposed to any execution. No execution took place. Subsequently, we sent out a general request to the administrators of both territories, that the Government required to be advised of any future proposed executions. We were so advised and in every case in which we received national, was present. advice, no execution took place. There request was sent out by my Government, and that request stood u n t i l my Government went out of office. Those are the facts.

We took administrative action and we prevented Schmidt was the man charged every execution of which we were inHe was convicted, formed after the first proposed execution came to our notice.

We are opposed to capital punishment. this view down the throats of any honourable member, but I resent the suggestion that my Government took no steps to save the life of a black man who was under sentence of execution. Treasurer ( Mr Casey) very rightly referred to our obligations and responsibilities under the mandate under which we govern the Territory of New Guinea. I believe we sball carry out that mandate more effectively by the abolition of capital waited upon me from one of the territories to discuss the case of two natives who had been sentenced to death on murder charges, and, knowing that we were opposed to the imposition of the death penalty, the Administrator sent two officers to interview me, and to put forward the arguments in favour of execution. They pointed out that, under the native code, when one member of a tribe was killed, the tribal law demanded the deatli of another member of the tribe, whether the murderer or not, in order to satisfy the tribal sense of justice, and to prevent further deaths. I countered that argument by pointing out that it rested with the Administration to set an example, not of a life for a life, but of punishment to prevent future trouble. I did not argue that a convicted person should be allowed to go scot-free, as the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Hughes) suggested this afternoon, but that he should be sentenced to imprisonment for life, and thus be prevented from repeating his offence. This, I believe, is the best way to teach respect, on the part of the natives, for human life. Those were the convictions upon which Mr Scullin. my Government acted. It has been said that we were negligent with respect to other cases, by failing to look up the reports. I confess that we did not know of numerous other executions-the news came as a shock to me-so whilst we lam not asking all honormay not have been as diligent as we might have been, at least we could not be charged with the guilt of allowing natives to be executed with our authority, as no consent or knowledge. honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker), in moving the adjournment of I am not trying to ram the House this afternoon to discuss tlie proposed execution of Ludwig Schmidt, has .raised a matter of great public importance. The question of criminal punishment is one which all too rarely comes before the legislature for conThe sideration. This afternoon the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Hughes), speaking from his long experience, has told us that he has no recollection of the subject of capital punishment ever having been discussed in this Parliament before; so, if the honourable member for Griffith punishment. A deputation has done nothing else, he has provided this House with an opportunity to discuss this highly important and contentious public issue. I consider that it is quite impossible, futile and mischievous, for Parliament to investigate the evidence in this particular case. As we have not the facts before us, it is impossible for us to deal with the question on its merits, and, in the circumstances, we are utterly dependent, as we have been in the past, as regards the actual decision, upon the trial judge. Today, there has been no suggestion from honourable members opposite of questioning the decision of the judge, although there has been a move for a stay of the sentence which he ordered. It is a matter for regret that the question of capital punishment, raised by the honourable member for Griffith, has been somewhat obscured as the debate has proceeded by a discussion of the facts of this particular case, and that the debate itself has developed somewhat along party lines. It shall be my endeavour to approach it from another angle, which may be somewhat legalistic, but which has, I consider, an important bearing as far as the",23,Mcnicoli Was No Execution After This General
101,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [4.43],"Th ecommunity is concerned. It is a well known and accepted maxim in criminal law that certainty of punishment is far more important than severity of punishment. As regards criminal punishment, we are some generations behind the generally accepted thought in other countries on this matter. The honourable member for Griffith has quoted from the report of a British parliamentary select committee which inquired into this subject in 1930. I would remind the House that, as early as 1S66 a royal commission in Great Britain, recognizing that all murders did not come within the same category, recommended that there should be a grading of varying degrees or classes of murder, and within the ensuing fifteen or twenty years numerous bills for this purpose were introduced into tbe House of Commons, and sometimes in the House of Lords, but as a result of varying political fortunes they were not passed. Very little progress was made from 1SS2 until the appointment of the select committee of 1930. The point I wish to make is that at the in which capital punishment has been present time there is no certainty in the law as regards capital cases. There is a strong body of opinion that capital punishment should be abolished. division of feeling is highly undesirable from the point of view of the general community. Difficulties arise under tbe jury system. Whenever a jury is summoned to try a murder charge, not infrequently there will be found among the jurors men who are supporters of the Labour party, and as one plank of the Labour programme is the abolition of capital punishment, it would be asking too much to expect these men to disregard all political and party bias when capital cases come before them. having the slightest acquaintance with the actual working of the law knows that time after time juries are not only reluctant to convict a person on a capital charge, but sometimes decline to convict in cases where, on the facts, one would consider a conviction was certain to be registered. And this, I repeat, is an undesirable state of affairs from the point of the community generally. The Government should consider, unless tbe consequences to the contrary are so 1.17 ] serious, the desirability of accepting a view which is so widely held by a large section of the community. On this point I refer the House to the following summary of its findings given out by the parliamentary committee of the British House of Commons:Our prolonged examination of tlie situation in foreign countries has increasingly confirmed us in the assurance that capital punishment may be abolished in this country without endangering life or property or impairing the security of society. Further, we have the repeated assurances of the Home Office itself that abolition of the death penalty w ill not bring with it any serious or insoluble problem of administration. That was the considered finding of a very representative parliamentary committee, after a most exhaustive examination of the subject, and after taking evidence from the most prominent English legal authorities. The published report covers more thau 680 pages. The House has already had the actual recommendations of that body placed before it, so I do not propose to elaborate on its findings at any great length. Honourable members have also been informed of the countries abolished, and I could refer to many others where it bas been in abeyance for several years. ""No evidence has been This brought forward, or I submit could be brought forward, which would show a greater incidence of homicide in those countries than in other countries where capital punishment has not been abolished. Honourable members will note that I am not directing my remarks to the present particular case in New Guinea. I should direct attention to the fact that the motion is for the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the Any one execution of Ludwig Schmidt fixed for to-morrow.

108,"Mr Nairn""","What the Cabineti nof tlie territory of New Guinea? It seems to me that it would bo too much to expect the Commonwealth Government to accept the duty of examining every case in which a person residing in a territory such as New Guinea is convicted of a capital offence. I should say that the League of Nations does not expect the Commonwealth to do that under its mandate. We provide the machinery required to give adequate protection to the inhabitants. There are a district judge and a chief judge; reviews of penalties are made by the Executive Council of New Guinea, and effect is given to its decisions by the Administrator, who is appointed by the Commonwealth authorities. The Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Hughes) stated the position correctly when he said that the Government, although it would call for a report in every case in which capital punishment was imposed, would act only in exceptional cases. It would be too much to expect the Cabinet to make a minute examination in every instance. We might as well ask it to make investigations with regard to cases in which capital punishment is inflicted by the State authorities. In the case under review, it would be extremely dangerous if the Commonwealth Government, without special reasons, interfered in the case Mena Griffiths. of a white man who has been convicted of a capital offence. Judging by the reports before us, there is no special reason why the law should not take its course. If the Administrator and the Chief Judge are to be trusted, and if the notes of the evidence are reliable, this is clearly a case of brutal murder, which, if it occurred in Australia, would bring the perpetrator to the gallows. In New Guinea, apart from the period when a Labour Government was in office recently, many natives have been sent to the gallows for murdering white men; but this is the first occasion on which a white man has been charged with, and convicted of, a similar offence. If this accused man were treated differently from natives who have been convicted, doubt would be raised in the native mind as to the impartiality of British justice. ber's time has expired. Mr Nairn. This matter has been brought under the notice of honourable members, so that the House may discuss, not tbe case of Schmidt, but tbe value of capital punishment. Schmidt has been sentenced to death for an offence committed in an uncivilized area, and upon evidence given by ten savages, according to the case presented by Ministers and their supporters. Capital punishment is advocated by honourable members opposite on the ground that the aborigines of New Guinea should be taught what is required under British law. A Minister has admitted that when a native kills a native of another tribe, it is necessary to hang him publicly in order to appease the members of that, tribe. I ask the Ministeri f Schmidt is to be hanged publicly in the presence of natives of New Guinea, to show that that law is impartially observed. One of the strongest arguments in favour of the abolition of capita: punishment is that it may result in taking the life of an innocent person. A few years ago a brutal murder was committed in Victoria, and a lad at Wagga, who at one time had escaped from an asylum, was arrested and charged with the crime. Press reports and police statements were made with regard to this lad, and practically 90 per cent, of the people were convinced that the police had arrested the murderer of That the question ibe now put.

I congratulate the honourable member for Indi( Mr Hutchinson) upon his attitude in connection with this item. The honourable member might very easily have pandered to his electors, but refused to do so. I congratulate also the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock) for his stand. might well emulate their There have been marked alterations of the duties on tobacco, but none has been more drastic and caused more upset in the industry than the high duty imposed by the Scullin Government in 1931. At that time primary industries generally throughout Australia were suffering severely. Tet, as has been admitted during this discussion, the tobacco industry was then being conducted very profitably. Its soundness was evidenced by the fact that storekeepers were willing to advance considerable credit to the growers; obviously quite a lot of money could be made out of the cultivation of tobacco. The industry certainly provided a lot of employment, but at what cost! Because of the smaller quantity of tobacco imported into Australia, due to the expansion of an uneconomic industry, the loss of revenue was very great. With the increase of land values many farmers abandoned dairying for tobacco-growing; encouraged by the high duties, hundreds of people rushed into the industry and endeavoured to grow tobacco on unsuitable land and produced leaf of such inferior quality that it was not acceptable to the manufacturers. increased production of tobacco which resulted from the impetus given by high duties is advanced as a reason for the proposal now before the committee to increase the duties. In 1929 there were 668 tobacco-growers in Australia; by 1931 the number had increased to 2,990, arid by 1932, when the full effect of the high duties had been felt, it had risen to 5,127. Tobacco-growing and curing is a specialMr ScholfieM. I would have preferred a ized industry, but these figures show that reduction of the Scullin almost immediately after the high duty was announced, at least 4,000 persons were attracted to a form of production of which they had little or no knowledge. It is little wonder that such poor tobacco was grown and such large quantities were left on the growers' hands. When the Lyons Government took office the duty was reduced from 5s. 2d. to 3s. per lb. As the crops had been sown under the high duty certain guarantees were given to the growers that they would receive a good price for their product; but so much poor quality tobacco was grown that an enormous quantity of leaf Other honourable members unsuitable for the production of high example. class tobacco, had to be bought. A large quantity of that tobacco is still on hand, and, at the present time, only the best Australian leaf brings a reasonably good price. I consider that the industry was placed on a better basis when the duty was reduced. The raising of the duty now, as some honourable members suggest, would only result in another upset in the industry. As a matter of fact, the Government has raised the duty from 3s. to 3s. 6d. per lb. since 1932, but any further increase will certainly cause further trouble in the industry. Let us consider the reasons put forward in favour of a higher duty. The honourable members for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) and Hume( Mr Collins) both stressed the case in which a company was buying tobacco and making the growers pay the excise. Honourable members know very well that the excise is a charge imposed on the manufactured goods. People are always attracted by the lure of high profits, and the growers who sold their ieaf to the company in question are in the position of people taken down by confidence men; Yet the like the buyers of "" gold bricks"", they were looking for something for nothing. Another argument advanced in favour of a high duty, is that it would encourage the Australian industry. I am second to none in my advocacy of such a policy, but to be worthy of encouragement an industry must be economic. One honourable member who advanced the plea that we should encourage the Australian tobacco industry is, upon other occasions, very much i« foimnv «f ""pruning customs duties imposed to enable us to import articles which, come into competition with established Australian industries. The factor of employment bas also been introduced into this discussion, but increased employment in uneconomic industries is of no value to Australia. A very poor argument advanced in favour of a high duty is that, as we buy most of our unmanufactured tobacco from the United States of America, we should not continue to send sums of money to that country, which buys little from us in return, if it were possible to obtain suitable tobacco from other countries, we should certainly trade with them in preference to importing the product of a country that w ill not trade with us; but we are unable to procure tobacco fro m other countries. from Rhodesia. not have any more likin g for Rhodesian tobacco than for the all-Australian product. We have to continue to import Virginian tobacco, to which our smokers liave been accustomed for many years, and gradually encourage the tasle for Australian leaf by mixing it with the imported leaf. It is very difficult to change the taste of smokers. There are various reasons why the duty should remain as at present. In the first place, the revenue must be protected; the Government does not deny that. raising of the duty would discourage imports and result in a considerable diminution of the revenue. we sumption of tobacco, if the Australian industry is to prosper. If locally-grown tobacco is substituted for imported leaf, smoking w ill decline, and the industrywill not do so well as it would if we continued to import a certain amount of American tobacco and blended it with Australian leaf. The rights of the consumers must also be considered. If the duty were increased by 6d. per lb., growers would benefit probably to the amount of £107,000, but the additional cost to smokers would be about £425,000. I think there can be no doubt that a reduction of the duty would reduce the consumption of tobacco. Though we have been growing tobacco in Australia for 60 or 70 years, the industry has made very little progress, not because of the low duty on imported tobacco, but because the Australian leaf was grown and cured unscientifically, and was not fit for the average person to smoke. A t present 60 to 70 blends of tobacco are sold on the Australian market; those consist of purely Australian leaf, purely imported leaf, and, in between, blends of the two in various proportions. Tobacco manufactured wholly from imported leaf, or containing a high percentage of imported leaf, finds the readiest sale; conversely, tobacco manufactured solely from Australian leaf, or containing it in large proportions, has the smallest sale. The use of a reasonable quantity of imported leaf should ensure a steady consumption could obtain it of tobacco in Australia. If the importation of American leaf were reduced substantially the consumption of tobacco in Australia would diminish considerably. When the duty was reduced to 3s. per lb. it was confidently stated by some honourable members that only small quantities of Australian tobacco would be used, and that the quantity of imported leaf would increase enormously; but, notwithstanding the reduction, importations of American tobacco fell off considerably and the consumption of Australian leaf increased. The present duty of 3s. per lb. on imported leaf gives a protection of 220 per cent. The cost The of American tobacco, exclusive of duty, is about Is. per lb., but that of Australian tobacco is considerably more. Secondly, From what we have been told and from have to maintain the coninformation gained from various sources, the conditions under which tobacco is grown in the United States of America and in Australia are comparable. Probably the cost of production in Australia is slightly higher, but coloured labour is not used extensively in the industry in America. If Australian growers cannot produce tobacco profitably with a protection of over 200 per cent., steps should be taken to place the industry on a sound economic basis by more extensive investigation than is made at present. I know that certain research work is being conducted by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research but further inquiries",29,Division 2 Tobacc Oandmanu

117,Mr Scholfield,"Smokers wouldshould be made because tobacco is now being grown on areas in Australia where production is uneconomic. Most of the arguments adduced against tbe reduction of the duty in 1932 proved to be erroneous. The main contention was that there would be an enormous increase of the imports of American tobacco, but they have actually decreased. that some honourable members who advocate low duties when it suits their own interests should favour high duties when their own electorates are concerned. The honourable member is not in order. some honourable members upon the stand they have taken in connection with this item, but I cannot congratulate others. The investigations prompted by the Government and the undoubted improvement in the marketing of Australian leaf since 1932 have been of great benefit to the industry. Some Australian leaf now compares very favourably with imported leaf; but tbe principal difficulty appears to be that the flavour of tobacco varies according to the district in which it is grown. As the industry develops the growing and curing of Australian leaf will improve and Australian smokers will use the Australian product in preference to imported tobaccoes. The high duties suggested by some honourable members will not induce Australian smokers to use the local product. When I smoked tobacco some years ago I realized that there was a marked difference in the flavours of certain tobaccoes. severe on the right lines it may not be long before every smoker in Australia will prefer the local leaf. World conditions demand reasonable duties not only on tobacco but also on other commodities, and if we wish to trade with other countries we shall have to continue to take their goods in exchange for our exports. We cannot expect to balance our trade with every country, but there must be a reasonable adjustment between countries wishing to trade with each other. the recommendations of the Tariff Board, By increasing the duties on items such as tobacco we would be interfering with a certain volume of trade.

The honourable member did not convince us that there would be a loss of revenue if the duty were increased and the excise reduced.

Further, I would remind the honourable member that a few years ago the Tariff Board considered that £6,500,000 was a reasonable amount of revenue to collect in tobacco duties. If producers permitted some years ago. The number of smokers has increased. tion in that time has been small. The Tariff Board said that while the Australian tobacco industry was being established, £6,500,000 was a reasonable revenue to be obtained from tobacco. When that recommendation was made, the production totalled 12,000,000 lb., but it is now less than one-half of that quantity.

140,Mr Forde,"In moving my amendcreased the duty. duced the duty from 5s. 2d. to 3s -, but later increased it to 3s. 6d. The Opposition desires that an additional 6d. per lb. should be imposed. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Scholfield), in opposing the amendment, stated that in adjusting duties on imported goods, the Government must consider its trade relations with other countries; he added that if an increase of duty led to a restricmended a duty of 3s. tion of imports, we might sacrifice a portion of our trade. I invite honourable members to study the facts in regard to manufactured tobacco leaf. The imported leaf comes from the United States of Americaa country which has bought £15,S34,000 worth of goods from Australia in the last five years, as compared with the Commonwealth's purchases from America amounting to £45,401,000. During that period, therefore, Australia has contracted an adverse trade balance with the United States of America of £30,000,000. In the face of those figures is there any need for honourable members to fear that the shutting out of a few hundred thousand pounds worth of American tobacco will influence that country to restrict its purchases from Australia? I hope that honourable members will approach my amendment in a non-party attitude. The tobacco industry, I contend, has been subjected -to too violent alterations of protective duties; even some Ministers share that opinion. The reduction of duty from 5s. 2d. per lb. to 3s. per lb. in February, 1932, caused consternation in the industry, and the increase of excise from 2s. 4d. per lb. to 4s. 6d. per lb. involved an increase of the tax on home-grown leaf by 93 per cent. The additional protection given by the Scullin Government resulted in a substantial increase of production. For tbe two years 1929-31, the production was 3,200,000 lb., compared with 20,400,000 lb. in 1931-33. Some honourable members have maintained that that increased production was a very unhealthy development. Do they desire a retrogression of the industry? For years the growers had sought additional protection from unsympathetic governments, but without avail; simultaneously, representations were being made by the tobacco combine that Australia could not produce suitable leaf, and that the plant would derive from Australian soil a taint of eucalyptus. All manner of misleading statements were made in this connection; they were proved false first by the select committee appointed by this Parliament under the chairmanship of the honourable son), and later by the Tariff Board. Tariff Board? The Government to-day exacts £7,767,000 from the industry, whereas the Tariff Board reported that £6,550,000 would be an ample tax to impose upon it. The Minister accepts the recommendation of the Tariff Board when it suits him; in this case, he takes an additional £1,200,000 from the industry, and defends tbe charge as being a reasonable one. When he is chided with failing to protect adequately the industry, he says that the Tariff Board recommended 3s. per lb. When the Scullin Government was in office it arranged for the sale of the entire Australian tobacco crop at an average price of 3s. per lb. With the change of Government, duties were reduced from os. 2d. to 3s. per lb., and the then Minister for Customs entered into an arrangement with the tobacco combine to purchase the whole of the crop at an average price of 2s. 3d., or 9d. less than that obtained for 'the growers by the Scullin Government. This sale was made possible because of the steep reduction of the protection; the growers had no alternative but to dispose of their leaf at that price. If they had declined to sell to -the combine, they would have been obliged to allow their tobacco to rot in the field. The sale of the tobacco at 2s. 3d. per lb. meant a loss to the growers, in comparison with the return of tbe previous year, of £300,000, which went into the coffers of the tobacco combine. I mention these facts because it has been stated that the policy of the Scullin Government was disastrous to the industry. As a matter of fact, without the increased protection which we gave, the industry would not have been in any better position than it had been in during tbe preceding 50 or 60 years.

145,Mr Forde,"Why hide behind theing The years 1932-33 and 1933-34, I find that the number of tobacco-growers decreased from 5,527 to 3,565, a falling otf of approximately 2,000. When the Scullin Government came into office only 668 men were engaged in the production of tobacco leaf. That Ministry was at its wits end to foster new primary and secondary industries in. order to provide employment and avert the disaster that Australia. Tobacco-growing was one of the new industries that the Scullin Government considered to be worthy of encouragement. A t that time, Australia was spending approximately £3,000,000 per annum on tobacco of all kinds imported from the United States of America, which purchased from the Commonwealth goods only one-third of Commonwealth bought from it. Remarkable results attended the policy of the Labour Government. The industry quickly gained impetus, aud in the tobacco-growing districts unemployment disappeared. Men who had previously been without occupations were absorbed in tobacco-growing, which is a "" small "" man's industry. But since the Scullin Government was defeated, the area under tobacco has decreased from 26,272 acres to 16,304 acres, and production has declined from 9,700,000 lb. to 4,300,000 lb. The preference of 5s. per lb. given by the Scullin Government put the industry on its feet. The present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) is not so unsympathetic as was his predecessor; nevertheless, he blundered from one precipitate decision to another, without giving due consideration to the facts, much to the consternation of growers. He made several decisions that later he was obliged to reverse. That is why he is now hearing so much about the industry. He stated that all good bright leaf is assured of a remunerative market. That is so, because bright leaf is the best quality; but there remain inferior grades down .to dark leaf that growers have extreme difficulty in selling. The Minister quoted figures to prove that sales of recently-grown Australian tobacco have increased. In my opinion, those statistics are no indication of the position. A good deal of that tobacco has probably been taken out of bond by the company and used for blending purposes. The following statistics show the quantities of Australian leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco: lb. 1928-29 903.000 1929-30 .. 1,206,00 0 1930-31 .. 3,152,00 0 1931-32 .. 2,434.000 1932-33 .. 2,695,00 0 was threatening to overtake 1933-34 .. 3,059,00 0 1934-35 .. 3,179,00 0 16,688,000 ' nitely better than they are in view of the fact that the annual consumption of tobacco in Australia is 20,000,000 lb. the value of tliose that the and Australia produced 10,200,000 lb. in 1931-32. With its bountiful rainfall, suitable soils and favorable climate, Australia should produce the whole of the tobacco required for home consumption. South Africa, in order to establish tobacco-growing, imposed an embargo on imported leaf. The protection which the Scullin Government afforded to the industry was considered to be ample, but I believe that the time has arrived when this Government, if it will not impose effective duties, should ration imports, in order to ensure for our growers a market for the whole of their product. The production of tobacco during the years I have mentioned increased as follows:lb. 1928-29 1,800.000 1929-30 1,700,000 1930-31 1,590,000 1931-32 10,160.000 1932-33 10.271,000 1933-34 3,510,000 2,647,000 1934-35 31,678,000 From these figures honourable members w ill realize that in the seven years only 16,000,000 lb. of Australian-grown tobacco has been consumed, whereas the production during that period amounted to 31,678,000 lb. I obtained the figures from, the Department of Trade and Customs. The imports of tobacco in 1930-31 totalled 22,393,000 l b . ; in 1933-34 they dropped to il,633,000 l b . ; but in 1934-35 they increased to 17,041,000 lb.",34,Division 2 Tobacc Oandmanu

These figures demonstrate that the importation of manufactured leaf from the United States of America is steadily increasing. is the case. regarding imports by telephone from the Commonwealth Statistician this afternoon. The Minister referred to the action of the Scullin Qovernment in making this industry possible as "" a will-o'-the-wisp idea "". The Opposition is accustomed to hearing the Minister make extravagant statements; evidently lie is without any logical argument with which to attack the work of that government. I remind him that the Labour Ministry's policy made possible tobacco-growing on a large scale, and increased production from 1,500,000 lb. to 10,200,000 lb. Tbe same ""will-o'-thewisp "" ideas rectified the adverse trade-balance of the Commonwealth, and laid the foundation for a big development of the secondary industries. The Scullin Government, by making possible tbe establishment of tbe industry, also instigated the gift of £20,000 to the industry for research purposes. action was perfectly justified. amount devoted to research should be increased, because it is the duty of the Government to do everything that lies within its power to assist the growers to adopt improved methods of cultivation. made no grant for research. been no justification for any grant had the industry not been established and increased its production of tobacco leaf from 1,500,000 lb. to 10,200,000 lb. as the result of the protection given to it by the Scullin Government. Would any Government have been justified in the expenditure of £20,000 upon research in an industry which engaged the attention of only 600 growers? Certainly not. But as the number of growers increased to approximately 6,000, there was every justification for such a grant; and there is Board, the members of which have not justification for a larger grant at the present time. The Minister said that the Scullin tariff had re-acted very harshly on growers with little capital, and that its policy had encouraged land speculation. That statement not only is wide of the truth, but also is a wilful misrepresentation of the whole position. The CHAIEMAiY ( Mr Prowse) Order! The honourable member has made use of an unparliamentary expression, which he must withdraw. sir, I withdraw it. What was the plight of the tobacco-growers before the Scullin Government came into office? They were struggling to establish the industry. The tobacco combine, however, got tbe ear of the Government, and the growers appealed in vain for protection. The dried fruit-growers had a similar experience; for years they appealed for marketing legislation. The dairy-farmers sought in vain for some organization that would enable them to handle the selling of their product and obtain a better return from the local market. Far from putting the tobacco-growers in a serious plight, the Scullin Government enabled them to make a decent living, of which they have been deprived since the advent to office of the present Government. The Minister considered that he was voicing the last word when he said, "" I repeat That that the duty proposed on tobacco is The higher than that recommended by the Tariff Board."" Is the Tariff Board to be the final arbiter as to what protection is to be given to an industry? The Minister said that the duty of 6d. per lb. on imported leaf over and above what the Tariff Board had recommended was imposed for the purpose of collecting the revenue needed to pay a bounty to the wheat-growers, not for tlie purpose of giving additional protection to this industry. The truth of the matter, however, is that the incentive given to the Australian grower to increase his production is not sufficiently great to-day, and, if the Minister proposes to follow blindly the recommendations of the Tariff Board, the whole matter should be again referred to that body for further investigation and report. The Government should take f u l l responsibility for its decisions, and not hide behind the Tariff the right to reply to criticism on the floor",35,Division 2 Tobacc Oandmanu

I remind the Minister that before this "" a w f u l "" policy which allegedly put the tobacco-growers on the rocks became operative, the importations of American leaf totalled 22,000,000 lb., while only 1,500,000 lb. was grown in Australia. of Government came into office. average price to the grower of Is. 6d. per lb. was doubled in the first season after adequate protection had been given to the industry. Two thousand persons who at one time were engaged in tobacco-growing have gone out of production. Is that the result of mere caprice or cantankerousness, or is the reason to be found in the withdrawal of the encouragement which led them into the industry? A number of manufacturers of tobacco who were competing with the combine ceased their operations, with the result that the combine became, as chief, if not the only big purchaser of Australian tobacco leaf. The Minister also said that the Labour party's policy had encouraged land speculation. D i d land speculation commence when the tobacco growing industry received encouragement? Isi t peculiar to that industry? the dairying industry? Passing through Bacchus Marsh not long ago, I was in formed that prices ranging up to £70 and £80 an acre had been paid for dairying lands in that locality. contended that a success can be made of dairying operations on land for which such amounts are paid TI s the whole of the dairying industry to be condemned because of land speculation in certain districts? banana industry, or the wheat industry to be condemned for a similar reason?

We should really consider The whether the protection at present afforded the tobacco-growers is sufficient. The protection on tobacco wholly manufactured in Australia is 4s. 2d. per lb., and on blenWhat has happened since? ded tobacco 3s. 6d. per lb. This, I think, affords adequate protection for the Australian industry. A t one time the duty was 2s. per lb. That rate was increased by degrees until, in 1930, the Scullin Government jumped it to 5s. 2d. per lb. The result had some of the features of a gold rush. People entered the industrv who were totally incompetent. Great expectations were followed by great disappointments. Although the action of Sir Claude Reading said, the the present Government in reducing the duty to 3s. per lb. was somewhat harsh, it nevertheless did good service to those who have been able to survive, and many tobacco-growers are now building up their industry on a safe and substantial basis. The present duty on imported tobacco is 3s. 6d. per lb., which, w it h an excise of 4s. 6d. per lb. makes a total of I admit that it is not. 8s. On tobacco wholly manufactured from Australian leaf, the excise is 3s. lOd. per lb., which leaves a margin of 4s. 2d. per lb. in favour of the Australian product.

Price is not the most difficult problem, however, for the growers are at present able to obtain about 4s. per lb. for their best qualify leaf, and all leaf of good quality can be marketed. Reference has been made during this debate to the operations of a certain company of doubtful reputation, which took over quantities growers, manufactured it, and sold the product. It has been complained that the growers received very little return for this leaf. The trouble, of course, was that the tobacco was not palatable, and people would not buy it. The price realized was about 6s. per lb. net. of good ordinary quality fetches 14s. per lb. realized very inferior quality. pose can be served, therefore, by drawing inferences from the sale of that class of tobacco.

In 1927-28 the total quantity of tobacco in bond in Australia was 23,750,000 lb. In the latest year for which we have information available, the total amount in bond was 14,400,000 lb. The manufacI f the same price could turers have discovered that it does not pay them to use too much Australian leaf in blending their tobacco, for an increase in the proportion of Australian leaf in a particular brand of tobacco has always resulted in a falling off of the sale of it . This is not in the interests of either the growers or the manufacturers. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has suggested that the duties should be increased by 6d. per lb. all round. This would undoubtedly be reflected in an increase of the price of tobacco to the consumers, of leaf from various and of the local production. Roth results would, in my opinion, tend to reduce consumption. A t any rate we should not be justified in assuming that beneficial results would accrue to the growers. The tobacco-growing industry is passTobacco ing through a phase not unknown to a number of other Australian industries. It is obvious that tobacco which Conditions were made so attractive in only 6s. per lb. was of certain . industries. that production No useful purexceeded the demand for the particular article, with chaotic and disappointing results to those who had have eveiy invested their capital in the undertaking. It is a very much better policy for us to determine what is a f a i r and reasonable degree of protection to In congive to the tobacco industry and provide for no more than that. to tbe Australian-grown I wish to say a word in the interests of locally manuof the tobacco-consumers in Australia of tobacco has appreciably inwhom there are nearly as many millions In 1927-28 the proportion as thero are thousands of growers.

Nevertheless we should give them as much quantities consideration as we give to any other large class of taxpayers. A t present the tobacco-smokers of Australia are paying undoubtedly about 16s. per lb. retail for better classes of tobacco. Some of us can remember the time when the best tobacco was available in Australia for 8s. per lb. There is a l i m it to the price people will pay for any commodity. If the price of tobacco is made too high, people will not pay it , or they w ill buy smaller quantities. happy result for the growers. In my opinion the existing duty, plus the 8d. per lb. difference in excise, and the small concession in regard to tobacco supplies for aboriginals, is generous to the tobacco-growers and I consider any increase of the duty unjustified. This subject has been discussed at great length and I shall not delay honourable members very long with what I have to say.

They are prepared to pay a higher price for someThis would be an unthing that meets their taste. One of the greatest necessities in the Australian industry is to increase the percemage of bright leaf tobacco. I understand that to-day 50 per cent, of the total tobacco crop consists of bright leaf; that is about twice as great as the percentage produced seven or eight years ago. The increase is a good one, but it is not good enough, and if the industry is to succeed that proportion must be raised considerably. There may be some significance in the fact that to-day when the percentage of bright leaf is at its highest the consumption of Australian tobacco also is at its peak. The boom that followed the abnormal duties placed on tobacco by the Scullin Government is known to all honourable members. Also we have known of land, well described in another Parliament as "" one snake to the acre "" country, selling at fantastic prices.

Since then the duty has been raised by 6d. per lb. and the excise has been reduced by the equivalent of 8d. per lb., despite which a smaller acreage is under cultivation and the crops are being disposed of at a lower average price. This contrariness is one of the greatest puzzles which has ever come before this committee. crop sold amounted to only 3,000,000 lb. and this year, when the duty is higher and the excise lower than in 1932, it is estifalse prospectus to the people engaged in mated, I believe, that the crop w ill be between 5,000,000 lb. and 6,000,000 lb.

A deeper inquiry into the problems of tobacco-growing is needed. debate as to whether the duty shall be 6d. more or 6d. less is a mere waste of the committee's time. the growers, but the tobacco industry requires a deep investigation and some curative other than mere tariff changes. The honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) has pointed out that 1932 was the most prosperous yp.ar ever enjoyed by the Australian tobaccogrower, and he related that fact to the reduction of duty to 3s. per lb. as the result of a change of government. The Lyons Government assumed office in January, 1932, and the prosperity enjoyed by the industry in that year was due not to the reduction of the duty, but to the fact that the crop sold in 1932 was grown in 1931, before the advent of the Lyons Government, and the change of duty. of the tobacco-growers of tbe Commonwealth waited on the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Henty, who was then Ministerf o r Trade and CusI f the wishes of the mover toms, and an agreement was reached that the whole of the crop would be sold et an average price of 2s. 3d. per lb. Sir HENBYGULLETT I arranged that price long afterwards. I emphasize that member promised it to the deputation. The honourable member knows that the 10,000,000 lb. of tobacco was grown while the Scullin duty was in operation. That was the reason for the prosperity of the industry in 1932. As a rule, the honourable member for Henty states the facts of the case, and stands by what he says. That is the reason why. some honourable members have a certain amount of regard for his views, despite their reactionary character. The 10,000,000 lb. of tobacco Last year, for example, ;the would not have been produced if the duty had not been 53. 2d. per lb. The Commonwealth Government issued a the industry, and robbed them of their life's savings. That is the charge that we make against the Government. The plea that j>eople went into production, knowing nothing about the industry, is no excuse. It was a new industry, of which Prolonged few knew anything. Bureaux of investigation were set up throughout the country, an experimental f a r m was estabI do not reflect upon lished in North Queensland, and sheaves and volumes of printed and roneoed matter were issued, telling the people that Queensland was suitable for tobacco cultivation. If it had not been for the action of the State Government in Queensland-it was not a Labour government, but a Nationalist government led land boom. The Moore Government made land available for tobacco growing at £12 an acre. The deposit was £ 1 an acre, and persons who took up land could convert into freehold w it h in twelve years by the payment of £1 a year. That was not over-capitalization. An y one who paid big prices for land would have gone out of the industry. The Lyons Government took office in 1932, and in March of that year, withA deputation representative out warning, the tobacco duties were reduced by 2s. 2d., and the excise was increased by 2s. 3d., removing the preference margin of 4s. 6d. from the Australian leaf.

The people in North Queensland who had entered tobacco production had invested £500,000 in the industry. The action of the Government in reducing tbe duties threw many of them back into the unemployment market. Had the men engaged in the industry been immigrants, there would have been a repetition of the protests which were made in London against the treatment of certain migrants who were repatriated from Victoria. There should be a complete investigation of the way in which the tobacco-growers were treated following the change of government in 1932. that the Government should compensate the growers for the money they have lost. In 1934-35, the Commonwealth Government received fro m the tobacco industry in taxes £7,769,000. growers paid only 10 per cent. The consumers are the ones who pay. ducers., the fact remains that the tobacco industry has contributed that amount in discontent. revenue.

The then Minister said that hope that this item w ill be postponed he could not accept the amendment, u n t i l the committee has dealt with the because the customs item had passed, and excise duties. could not be adjusted to counterbalance the loss of revenue that would result from a reduction of the excise duty. On this occasion I want to give members of the trict in which a f a i r l y considerable Country party an opportunity to vote quantity of tobacco is grown, I feel upon this issue, and I do not intend imjjelled to participate in the discussion, to allow myself to be side-tracked again. and to indicate that I intend to support The tobacco industry is worth something the Government on the issue now before to this country.

Of course he did, begrown that year, and the. result was a cause kilns of that type were erected under instructions from the Queensland Government on the recommendation of the man who was in charge of the experimental station. The treatment meted out to those engaged in the tobacco industry amounts to a tragedy. I do not know how the Victorian or New South Wales growers are treated by the manufacturers, but I do know that the growers of North Queensland are left to the mercy of one buyer. I bave in mind a happening at Dimbulah, where five bales of tobacco which were rejected by the buyer, for poorness of quality, were afterwards taken 26 miles to Mareeba, and It would not be too much to ask sold to the same buyer for Is. 6d. per lb.

171,"Mr Archie Cameron"" (Barker)","record, both as regards quality and quantity of leaf produced. I understand that, in South Australia at least, almost fabulous sums were received by growers for the tobacco produced from a few acres of land. In those days, numbers of people approached me about the purchase of land for growing tobacco, from which they said a return of from £160 to £200 an acre could be obtained. I told them that rather than engage in tobacco growing in the expectation of receiving such returns, they would do better to send 5s. to the promoters of the Golden Casket. The cultivation of tobacco requires a great deal of skill, which is obtainable only by long experience on tbe part of the grower. Skill is required, not only in the planting of the seedlings, but also in the care of the plants afterwards. For some time after planting, tobacco plants may have to be watered as often as three or four times a day, and consequently, tobacco-growing must be confined to comparatively small areas unless the cultivator is prepared to pay considerable sums as wages to employees. Moreover, tobacco plants are most susceptible to disease. In two centres of my electorate millions of tobacco plants are grown yearly for cultivation, not in South Australia, but in Victoria and New South Wales. The dry climatic conditions in those two centres are said to be conducive to the production of plants less susceptible mit that by tinkering with tbe tariff we to blue-mould and other diseases than Should tbe care given to the plants result in a good growth of leaf the grower has then to decide when to pick the leaf; and even then, his troub'es have not ended, for he has to exercise considerable skill in the process of curing it. In my opinion, at least two years should expire after the crop has been reaped before the leaf is prepared in the factory for smoking. One of the most successful growers of tobacco in my electorate is a man who, not knowing a great deal about the industry, the services of a native of an eastern Mediterranean country with a long experience of tobacco culture. to have done better than others who have bought their experience dearly. Mr Ardhie Cameron. As I myself do not indulge in the pleasures associated with "" My Lady Nicotine"" I should like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) to say how many of the supporters of his amendment smoke Australian tobacco. As I see it the motion affects three interests -the grower, the consumer, and the Government, the last mentioned in respect of its revenues. I am definitely a low tariffist, and am not prepared to ask the smokers of this country-mos t of whom are wage earners and producers-to pay more for their tobacco than they pay for it to-day. In my opinion, they are already contributing a sufficiently large amount to Commonwealth revenue with the duties at their present levels. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is really desirOU3 of giving further protection to the Australian growers of tobacco, I suggest that he should endeavour to reduce the excise duty on 100 per cent.

Although any vote given ou this amendment cannot in any way affect the marketing of tobacco, I point out that my experience in South Australia reveals that there is much to be said against the present method of marketing, and that the complaints expressed by members of the Opposition in this respect are generally supported by the growers in South Australia. It seems that tobacco is worth a certain figure on the farm, but an entirely different figure if taken elsewhere and offered for sale, say, two or three weeks later. "" There is something wrong in the State of Denmark"" when we consider the operations of the buying monopoly which controls the purchase of tobacco. I suggest that if honourable members opposite would confer with the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs with tbe object of arranging a better method of marketing whereby the growers would be enabled to exercise control over tbe sale of their product, they would confer on the growers benefits far greater than any which could result from an increase of 6d. or Is. per lb. in the import duty.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Item agreed to. Item 27 (Glucose). This is an item concerning which, I have no doubt, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) will have something to say. It is also closely associated with the important great primary industry of maize-growing, the value of which will be realized from figures giving the quantity of raw material used in 1 the manufacture of glucose for the Australian market. In 1933-34, the quantity of maize required for the manufacture of this product was 509,150 bushels, costing £138,138; the coal used by the manufacturers totalled 12,655 tons, at a cost of £22,246; the value of casks and packages required as containers was £33,332, and the value of the chemicals used was £3,409. Australian materials used represent 76.96 per cent, of the total cost of manufacture, and the wages paid in connection with the cost of manufacture equal 9.83 per cent. Therefore, Australian materials and wages represent 87 per cent, of tbe manufactured cost of the product. The preferential duty in favour of Great Britain is not of any great assistance, as fully 80 per cent, of the glucose is manufactured in England Marr.

H . if a further reduction of duty is made, Lawson, George or if the price of maize in England declines, the Australian industry will be in jeopardy. About fifteen months ago the Australian manufacturers of glucose, having captured the local market, made a substantial reduction of price. They were able to do this owing to the reduced co3t of maize, which at that time was costing 3s. 8d. per bushel; but if maize continues at the present price of 5s. 2d., or in accordance with present indications goes higher, the Australian manufacturers will be forced to increase the price of glucose to an extent which will enable glucose to be brought in from England. In view of the fact that maize used in England is, for the most part, obtained from countries employing cheap coloured labour, whilst Australian manufacturers use locally-grown maize, it is felt that there should be adequate protection for glucose. Maize-growers, of course, enjoy very substantial protection, and it is felt that the request that the manufacture of this important by-product should be safeguarded is not unreasonable. The industry is carried on in Victoria and New South ""Wales by Maize Products Proprietary Limited, and uses between 500,000 and 600,000 bushels of maize, employs over 300 fully-paid hands, and pays in wages approximately £60,000 per annum.",43,Chairman The Honourable Desire The Growers Themselves Acknow

184,Mr Foede (Capricornia) [9.9],"be true to some extent, because the board made a recommendation for undyed cloth ut lower rates of duty. ""What is causing the greatest trouble, however, is the raising of the weight l i m it from 3 oz. to 6 oz. The duties on the heavier weight materials arc satisfactory, but the manufacturers also ask that they be covered by these duties on cloths from 3 oz. up, instead of from 6 oz., as provided in the schedule. L hope that the Minister will reconsider the sub-item, and adopt the amendment which would be in conformity with the following recommendation of the Tariff Board:That sub-item IOS ( A ) ( 1 ) (ft) of the Customs Tariffs 11)33 he deleted, and two -ubitems worded as under inserted in ite stead:(&) Cotton piece goods, dyed in the pieee or coloured woven, ordinarily used for the manufacture into men's nr boys' trousers, knickers, or overalls, and weighing more than 3 oz. per square yard (except piece goods enumerated materials ordinarily used as linings or interlinings for the above mentioned apparel are excluded from this item. Prior to the introduction of the new duties on drills, denims, dungarees, & c , the bulk of the importations of blue and khaki drills, denims, & c , for outer wear, excluding bleached drills, consisted of cloths which exceeded 6 oz. a square yard. When introducing the new tariff it was obviously the intention of the Government that Australian manufacturers should secure the business on cloths exceeding 6 oz. a square yard. In practice it is found that this intention will not be realized owing to the fact that the higher cost of production under Australian conditions will force a veryhigh percentage of the trade previously based on cloths over 6 oz. a square yard, on to overseas cloths which just come in under 6 oz. a square yard at the reduced rates of duty. This can be demonstrated by the following approximate figures of landed costs:A typical overseas blue drill weighing 5.SO oz. a square yard under the old duty landed at 7-id -one mately 6-J oz. a square yard landed at S5d. Under the newduty the 5.80 oz. a square yard cloth still lands at 7id., whereas The 6}oz. cloth will now land at J/>. Forde. 15-id. a yard approximately. An equivalent Australian cloth weighing 6£ to 6£ oz. can be sold at 14-}d. It will be seen, therefore, that an overseas cloth just under 6 oz. a square yard will cost roughly 7d. a yard less than a fri oz. Australian manufactured drill, and owing to this disparity in price many buyers will be content to use the lightercloth and seriously curtail the outlet for Australian-produced qualities. This w ill naturally affect the use of Australian lint and the number of operativeswhich the new industry can employ. It is felt that if the present position isallowed to continue the results contemf plated under the new tariff w i ll not be secured, and the Government's intention in regard to the output of lint and possibilities of employment will not be overcoats, coats, vests, realized. So far as bleached drills are concerned, it is pointed out that the bulk in . sub-item ( AA ) of importations are under 6 oz. a square yard. This has always been the case owing to the fact that the bleaching process reduces the weight of the cloth, whereas, generally speaking, the process of dyeing-eithe r blue or khaki-add s to the weight of the fabric. In the case of bleached drills, therefore, no possibility exists of Australian manufacturers securing even a reasonable share of the bleached d r ill trade as long as bleached drills up to 6 oz. a square yard may be imported under the lower tariff. Special machinery has been imported to produce these bleached drills, and unless the tariff is reduced to 3 oz. a square yard very little scope for their use can be found. It is to be noted that in this case tbe output, of Australian l in t and the number of operatives we can employ w ill be seriously affected. Another serious aspect of the position is that oversea manufacturers are now selling to Australia pure yarn cloths which are just 6 oz. but if finished and sized would be over 6 oz., thus avoiding the duties and depriving the Australian manufacturers of the market which the Government intended them to have. It weighing approxiis known that there are substantial orders going overseas for cloths of 6 oz. and under, which previously came in over 6 oz., and this market is definitely lost to the Australian manufacturer. The importations of these new substituted cloths bas entirely disorganized the programme of certain Australian manufacturers who had laid down a very adequate plant to cater for this market. One firm's sales for the last six months are about 20,000 yards, the production -exceeding 250,000 yards, resulting from an increased capital of £200,000 and a powerful plant. operatives and it is imperative that something be done to maintain their employment. Manufacturers have been engaged in yards, and information has been received -creating stocks to meet the demand of a third purchase of 200,000 yards. which they confidently anticipated would This must seriously interfere with the result from the Tariff Board's recomoutput of Australian factories, have an mendation but which has failed to evenadverse effect upon employment, and milituate because of the reduction to 3 oz.

Any such line of heavier weight materials to switch over demarcation was and is unnecessary, as to the lighter weight materials. That -shirts are not classified as outerwear, and, the lighter weight materials will not give therefore, under the existing tarifl any the same service is undoubtedly true, but weight of drill may be imported at the the price factor is of more importance, old rate of duty, provided it is specifically although, if the item were amended as imported for, and used in, the manufacdesired and the Australian mills were ture of shirts. present under consideration is the weight to which they consider they are entitled, and type of fabric which is imported for the extra cost to the public would only be the manufacture of outerwear.

Australian-made quality, a trewhich can usefully be manufactured into mendous impetus has been given to the trade in lighter weight fabrics for outerwear, with the result that it is now roughly estimated that from 65 to 70 per cent, of the total trade in blue and khaki drills is now under 6 oz., the remaining 25 or 30 per cent, being Australian made qualities exceeding that weight. A large drill buyer in Melbourne has, since It employs 929 the new duties, purchased no less than 150,000 yards of under G-oz. fabrics for use in the manufacture of overalls. Another has placed two contracts for an under 6-oz. white drill totalling 80,000 In short, the effect of the new duties However, what is at enabled to obtain the share of tbe market Por example, under 6 oz. lint would represent considerable employI t is obvious, that unless a reduction of overalls. Any cloth under 3 oz. a square yard would be unsuitable for that purpose. A reduction of the weight to 3 oz. would not affect any of the shirting trade, seeing that any weight of drill might still be imported under guarantee under the old duty. At the public inquiry by the Tarifl Board, the cost of production was considered, and it was shown that the local industry could not compete owing to the low rate of wages paid overseas, particularly in Japan, where the wages for females is only 7d. a day plus keep, as against 35s. 3d. a week, plus 15 per cent. for piecework in Australia. Further, it must be remembered that the price of Australian cotton to the spinning mills is much higher than world parity. Australian spinners and manufacturers of cloths realize the need for assistance to cotton-growers and do not complain of the protection given to tbem. sider, however, that this factor should be taken into f u ll consideration when the protection to the manufactured article is under consideration. It is urged that the item be amended £279,159. to read 3 oz., as since the introduction of the 6-oz. weight, one firm has been compelled to reduce its hands by approxihow employment will be affected in the mately 100-fro m 1,015 to' 929-and respective countries as a result of the proother manufacturers are affected.

Mr Forde. I could quote a number of others. I should like the Minister to take this matter into consideration. If he'will give the assurance that he will have the item reconsidered, I shall not press my amendment. Doubtless, we shall be told that this is one of the matters which affect trade with Japan and other countries. The Government should exercise the greatest caution in entering into trade treaties with European or Eastern countries. It will get out of one difficulty only to get into another, without any commensurate gain to the producers of Australia, and will prejudice the development of interEmpire trade. Recently the president of the Graziers Association expressed hopes for the early conclusion of a trade treaty with Japan, pointing out that Japan's purchases of Australian wool were now double those of They con1929. This is but a half-truth. The facts are that Japanese wool purchases in 1928-29 were 104.939,000 lb., valued at £8,693,000, and m 1934-35 they were 196,124,000 lb., an increase of 95,185,000 lb., valued at £8,41S,0Q0, a decrease of The vital question to be considered is similarly posed trade treaties. They must be If we carefully peruse the that which we ship to Japan, is manufacturers' raw materials, tending enorFor the years 1930-31 to 1934-35 in the same period were valued at to the growers and wheat 20 per cent., valued at £11,600,000, maximum employment. If we take our imports from Japan, we find that they embrace silk and art silk piece goods, £7,2S6,000, or 44 per cent.; cotton and linen piece good3, £2,343,000, or 14 per cent., and other manufactured goods approximately 30 per cent.; whilst the balance includes raw silk, spices, oils, hair, fibre, &c. Amongsti t all we find there is but a limited quantity of materials for treatment by Australian manufacturers. If we look around us we shall find evidence on all sides of the fact that Japanese competition is definitely hampering Australian manufacturers. deed, it threatens the secondary industries of practically all countries of the world. Unfortunately, there are in the community gentlemen like Mr Abbott, president of the Graziers Association, who would throw down the whole tariff wall against imports from Japan, in the erroneous belief that that country w ill cense to buy our wool unless we allow its goods to be imported into Australia. The Japanese know quite well that, in the development of secondary industries, Australia has the definite objective of increasing employment. That we should ask what it applies-preferenc e for local industries-is not an unfriendly gesture; No country has protected its own industries to a greater extent than has Japan. W it h a depreciated yen, and a bounty on exports,' Japan has captured markets throughout the world. This problem w ill have to be dealt with in a friendly spirit. Japan comes to Australia to buy our wool, not because it likes our climate, but because our fine merino wool cannot be purchased anywhere else in the world. Yet stand up against labour conditions such as prevail in that country where the employees receive 7d. a day a.nd work 54 hours a week? Thousands of women live in compounds, and work under conditions which no Australian could be asked to endure. I understand that the Minister will contend that we cannot shut out imports from Japan, but Japanese manufacturers copy goods of overseas origin without regard to the rights of inventors or designers. The Australian originator of any worth-while idea, provided it is copiable-and invariably it is-know s f u l l well that he may only hope to sell the article in the few months which elapse before it is possible to have a sample sent to Japan to be copied and quantities returned to Australia for sale. A Sydney business man recently made a trip to Japan loaded up with a supply of articles that he desired to have copied cheaply. With the low-wage conditions operating there, the depreciated yen. and more important still, the government's subvention of exports by means of a for m of credit manipulation, it is always possible to secure cheaper imitations from InJapan than to make the goods in Australia or any other British country. We must look to our manufacturers for the re-employment of the great bulk of tlie 250,000 unemployed in Australia to-day, and also the 30,000 boys and 10,500 girls who leave school annually and search in vain for work. We owe a responsibility to these young people, and we cannot hope to have them absorbed in industry unless we are prepared to protect our own manufacturers, who invest their capital in this country and observe arbitration awards and conditions of employment. The people of Australia are accepting protected industries, wages and conditions blindly, and are not heeding the fundamental principles on which they must rely for their bread and butter. It would be well for them to take a keen interest; in this matter, for, without protection the 500,000 persons engaged in various secondary industries to-day would be out of employment. Australia is the only country that is foolish enough to make its secondary industries vulnerable to imports of cheap-labour countries. All other countries are for t if y in g their how can our manufacturers industries against outside competition. Are our manufacturers always to be suspect, and overseas manufacturers sacrosanct? Tbe Tarifl Board was created to encourage Australian industries, yet it has been asked by the Lyons Government to adopt the role of an obstacle to protection. When the people endeavoured to nail the responsibility for' tariff reductions, the Government said that it was carrying out the recommendations of the board, and the board declared that it was complying with the. directions expressed through the Ottawa agreement. We heard to-day an announcement by tbe Minister that that agreement is to be reviewed. The honourable member must confine his remarks to the item. warning with regard to imports from Japan. I hope that the Minister will not. pay heed to speeches such as those of the President, of the Graziers' Association, because they are based on wrong premises. item covers the alterations which were made to the duties on cotton piece goods about eighteen months ago, and which brought about a boycott of Australian goods in the Lancashire district boycott. last long, but there was a temporary boycott. Much exasperation was occasioned m England by what was considered the failure of the Government to carry out either the spirit or the letter of the Ottawa agreement. This is one of the few instances in which the Government departed from the recommendations of the Tariff Board, and in which the action of the Government has resulted in much criticism. I feel obliged to support the proposal, because I know that to attempt to have the duties reduced would be useless. It is necessary to adopt them in order to counteract further claims put forward on behalf of manufacturers in Australia for even greater protection than that recommended by the board. It was surprising to hear from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) that although the proposal means an increase by about 50 per cent, of the actual retail cost to the consumers class of goods such as dungarees, and although tbe increase is given for the purgoods to the public. It had its genesis pose of assisting a large section of manuin the idea that people in the electorate of facturers, employment has diminished. It is difficult to know how that has come about. The anticipated result of these duties was a rise in the cost of the goods of about 50 per cent., and that increase has occurred. Overalls that were formerly sold retail at 14s. each are now procurable himself-out to establish and foster the retail at 21s. The Government made the division, for which there seems to be good reason, in accordance with the weight iu each square yard of cloth. For cloth weighing 6 oz. and upwards to the square yard it applied a very heavy duty, increasing the cost of a characteristic article in Australia from 7£d. to Is. Id. The first result, of course, was an increase of the retail price by 50 per cent. Another result, which was not foreseen by the Government, was that in consequence of the increased price it placed the better article beyond the capacity of the ordinary purchaser. These goods are used almost exclusively by working people, and it was found that these people either could not or would not submit, to such an increase, with the result that the sale of goods made of cloth weighing 6 oz. and over to the square yard, has fallen off greatly. In the past, the proportion of this class of clothing was from 75 to 80 per cent, of the total, and the percentage of clothing made from the lighter material was about 25 per cent.; but, owing to the alteration of the tariff, the position bas been reversed. The reason is not that the public bas any preference for the lighter material, which is, of course, less serviceable, but that the increased cost of the heavier material has forced people to use the cheaper article. It is to be regretted that the use of clothing of an inferior quality has been forced upon the purchasers as the result of the new duties. In addition, the manufacturers, having a reduced demand for cloth weighing 6 oz. and over to the square yard, are now seeking to prevent the use of tbe cheaper class of material. Tbey are asking for an additional duty on cotton materials below 6 oz., so that the public will be obliged to switch back to the class of goods formerly purchased. The protection of the cotton industry of a very common gives a fair example of the accumulative effect of the tariff in raising tbe cost of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde), and in other parts of Queensland, could profitably grow cotton, and also in the fact that the honourable member, who was at that time Minister for Trade and Customs, laid growing of cotton in North Queensland. member is not now discussing the item.",45,Harrison Di D The Board By Adding To Paragraph 1 Of Su B Item A

Its efforts have been unsuccessful and it bas been obliged to discontinue them. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tells us that there has not been an increase'of Australian manufacture which would please him.. There can be no such increase unless the public buys the goods, and the people will not buy inferior Australian goods sold at a price for which they can obtain better quality imported goods. Our manufacturers should be required to provide satisfactory material, but they are always endeavouring through their representatives in Parliament to.secure a complete prohibition of all imported lines. time. for Moreton( Mr Francis) has a local interest in this matter, and because the cotton-growers of Queensland stir up their representatives in this chamber at election time, the public of Australia is called upon to pay an excessive price in an attempt to establish the Australian the honourable industry. These goods are used by the workers and it is pathetic to listen tomembers of the Labour party standing up for protection which imposes such a burden on the people they are supposed to represent. However, the instigators of this claim for an increased duty are not the representatives of the Labour party, because they do not know the facts, but are firms such as Bradford Cotton Mills originally chiefly instrumental in getting the existing duties imposed. The report of that company for 1935 showed that it paid a dividend of 14.15 per cent, on its total capital, yet it now ask3 this Parliament for the imposition of prohibitory duties on the lighter weights of cotton goods. The effect will be to reduce and not to increase materially the Australian purchases of these goods. Unless the weavers improve their technique and make their men do their job in a more tradesmanlike manner they cannot hope to compete against the imported cloth. The effect of their seeking this increase on the lower type of cotton goods will be that those goods will go out of use in Australia. It does not mean that there is likely to be a rapidly increased production of Australian cotton piece goods. That will not eventuate until the manufacturers turn out a suitable article. So long as they turn out material as at present, whether light or heavy weight types that the public will not have, manufacturers will be obliged to import raw materials from overseas and pay an extra price of something over 6d. a yard and charge to the general public an average increase of 50 per cent, in the cost of the garments they wear. Such companies should not be encouraged to pay dividends of 14 per cent, annually. Further, the workers engaged in manufacturing should not be permitted to learn the intricacies of the business at the expense of the Australian consumers.

I am not entirely satisfied with the Government's proposal, which represents some moderation of previous proposals; but the members of the Opposition are making an effort to exploit the public for the benefit of certain manufacturers aud those whom they employ. [10.21 -Some years ago, the Federal Parliament decided to assist the cotton growing industry in Australia by paying a bounty on the production of raw cotton,. and also to encourage the manufacture of cotton piece goods in Australia. A f t e r encountering many obstacles due to tariff amendments, variation of the bounty, adverse seasons, and unfortunate economic conditions throughout the world, the industry is now making wonderful progress, and to-day it promises to be as successful as was anticipated when it was established by the Bruce-Page Government. At that time those engaged in cotton production were promised that if they couldproduce raw cotton of the right quality they would be assisted, and that is what is now being done. member for Perth( MrN a i r n ) quoted extracts from a document, the author of which he declined to disclose, which may have been prepared for h im by some ardent free trader. The remarks of the honourable member concerning the cotton industry are similar to those which could be made by any person who does not believe that Australian manufacturers can produce cotton piece goods or in fact any other commodity. The honourable member goods manufactured in Australia by the Bradford mills from Australian cotton are practically valueless, and that some firms which have obtained goods from this firm have been compelled to return them. It would be interesting to know how a company which has had such unsatisfactory transactions with Australian manufacturers could pay a dividend of 14 per cent. From the information supplied by the honourable member, it appears that the goods the company is producing are of such a highly satisfactory quality that they are purchased extensively by tliose requiring them. He cannot have it both ways. Experts who have visited Australia consider that Australian cotton is second to none in the world, and that there is a ready market for Australian cotton, not only in Japan, but also in other countries competing w it h GreatB r it a in iu the manufacture of cotton piece goods. Those whose policy it is to denounce Australian industries should at least admit the value of cotton production to the primary producers instead of decrying everything produced in Australia. Those engaged in the industry have overcome many of the difficulties with which they were confronted in the in it i al stages of production, and I understand that an almost record crop of raw cotton w ill be available this j'ear. Efforts are being made to sell the whole of the crop to manufacturers who prefer to use Australian products, and the removal of an anomaly which existed previously w ill assist the growers. producing sufficient cotton to supply the whole of Australia? land is producing sufficient cotton to The honourable supply the class of cotton goods for which suitable machinery has been installed. cotton has increased. cotton are not produced in Australia. type of machinery is required to manufacture certain classes of cotton goods, which are not manufactured here, and the manufacture of cotton piece goods in Australia is confined largely to goods which claims that cotton piece can be made from Australian cotton.

The committee should support the increase of the duty in order to assist a further increase in the manufacture of cotton piece goods from Australian cotton .in Australia, because what has been accomplished in the industry up to date is of such great credit to it that all Australians should be gratified to see its extension, not its abolition.

The manufacturers must be able to supply goods commensurate with the ability of the working man to buy. The Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Forde) has moved an amendment with the object of giving the Government certain instructions, and if it is carried into effect the result w ill be again to increase the cost of overalls to the Australian working man.

To that extent the new duties have penalized the working men; yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to impose some greater penalty upon the class which he claims to represent in order to bolster up an industry in his own State. I contend that the honourable member bas no just claims to substantiate his case. The obvious intention of the application of protection to an industry which supplies raw material for others must be based on a study of the industry-the Tariff Board has taken that factor into consideration, and has established it as one of the fundamental principles-but , in the case of the cotton-growing industry, there are other industries, such as the spinning and weaving, which use that raw material, to be considered, and cheek by jowl with them is the clothing manufacturing industry itself. It would be futil e to attempt to support or develop the primary industry concerned if cohesion, collaboration or co-operation with the subsidiary industries cannot be obtained. The spinning trade has been compelled to use a higher and more expensive grade of yarn than is necessary, with the result that the weaver I who purchases the yarn is immediately placed at a disadvantage. Some considerable time ago, before this duty was introduced, cotton tweeds were included in a similar schedule, and the duties were increased considerably. This had the effect of setting in motion an ever-increasing spiral of costs; for instance, to-day the weavers have added from 2d. to 4d. a yard to tbe cost of eotton tweeds, which puts up the price of a pair of cotton tweed trousers by Is. The excuse offered is that the old and khaki drill trouseTS. stock of imported yarn has been used up, and that the weavers are forced to buy Australian yarn at an increased price, and, therefore, must charge more for their product in order to recoup themselves for the extra outlay. If honourable members w ill look at the balance-sheets of some of the weavers they w ill see that they are getting a return on their capital of as much as 14 per cent. They are taking f u l l advantage This higher rate is of the duty, and raising their prices, because, they say, they must purchase Australian cotton. It is well known that the firm of Davies Coop has a very large stock of drills that they cannot get rid of, because the quality is so inferior to that of imported goods. These drills are f u l l of dressing, and the dyes are not stable. They are incapable of giving service that the consumer demands, being quite unfitted to stand up to hard wear. When tenders for the supply of overalls or d r ill uniforms are called by certain municipal councils and by governmental departments, English drills are always specified, because it is impossible' to Tely upon the quality of Australian drills, or of the dyes used in their preparation. Before the imposition of these duties, most manufacturers turned out at least 80 per cent, of overall production of d r ill of its proposals. 6 oz. or over, whereas now, in order to bring the price of their product down to a competitive level, they are turning out garments made of material under 6 oz. in weight which are incapable service. duties has been altogether harmful. I suggest that, if the Government is determined to persist in its attempts to develop the cotton industry in Australia, it should pay a bounty to the growers on the whole of the cotton crop produced rather than impose a duty which has the effect of forcing upon the consumers an inferior article at an increased price. We are just emerging from the depression, and many working men, who are now obtaining employment for the first time, perhaps, for years, are unable to pay the high price demanded for the clothing they require. The result is that they must either do their work in ordinary clothing, or buy inferior cotton d r ill clothing. I am surprised that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), who professes to represent the working man in this Parliament, should advocate these higher duties. I cannot support the amendment. Downs) [10.26] I think that honourable members should bear in mind tbe fact that the Government, when imposing these duties, was actuated by a desire to -encourage the development of the cotton industry in Australia. We must realize that the great northern areas of the continent must be developed and populated, and cotton-growing offers a suitable occupation for the people. If we are to hold this country Ave must populate it ; otherwise we may some clay have to answer for our neglect at the bar of the League of Nations. remind the representatives of Western Australia that very much the same as that of the people of Queensland. well as in the Northern Territory, there are enormous country in which sub-tropical industries must be developed. The Government, in imposing duties to protect the whole industry, was actuated by a most laudable motive, and Parliament approved It tried to develop the cotton industry by means of a bounty, but that was not altogether satisfactory. It was recognized that there wa3 a large market for cotton goods in Australia, and the Government determined to secure of rendering the same that market for the Australian cotton The effect of the increased industry. The Tariff Board conducted an exhaustive inquiry, and recommended the imposition of certain duties, which were duly imposed. Now that action has been called in question. Certain clothing manufacturers, who, where costs are increased, never hesitate to charge an extra Is. for tbe clothing tbey sell, have suddenly become solicitous regarding the price the working man pays, and on that ground are opposing the duties which w ill assist the growers of cotton. Some of these people are rigid protectionists in regard to their own manufacturing industries, but when it comes to the development of an important primary industry they aTe free traders. Before the T a r if f Board was established, this Parliament used to be flooded with ex parte statements setting for t h the views of one side and the other on tariff questions. Parliament realized the necessity to sift all evidence submitted to it in regard to tariff issues, and for that reason the Tariff Board was established. Nowi t should not be necessary for honourable members to determine questions affecting the tariff on evidence suddenly sprung upon them in the course of a discussion in committee. All such evidence may now be submitted to the Tariff Board. Witnesses are obliged to give their testimony before the board and are subject to cross-examination. On the whole, the Tariff Board principle has worked admirably. We feel that we can generally accept I tlie findings of tbe board almost without question because of the impartial their case is and able manner in which its reports are prepared. It would be unthinkable for us In that State, too, as to revert to the old method under which honourable members uspd, in debate, areas of sub-tropical material handed to them in the lobbies of the House and respecting which they had had very little, if any, opportunity for investigation. Under that system it",54,Littlet On Groom Di D These Upon To Pay On The Local Market Is 2s 2d

The honourable member for Perth did not make it clear whether it was the process of manufacture or the raw material that ho condemned, but in any case, in effect, he reflected seriously on a great primary industry of the Commonwealth. Which of these two honourable members are we to believe-the one who said that the material was too inferior for use or the other who said that that it was too good for use and that Queensland cotton was "" too pricey "" ? The real truth is that Queensland cotton has been tested thoroughly during the last 50 or 60 years. Mr E. J. HARRISON -The complete process of manufacture does not depend solely on cotton. Sir LITTLET ON GEOOM -That is so; but Queensland cotton has been spoken of in the highest terms by manufacturing experts. The great range of climate in Queensland makes possible the production of cotton of almost every grade, but the Queensland cotton-growers have always endeavoured to market only the highest quality cotton. At this stage I do not intend to discuss the merits or demerits of [18] the particular case brought under notice. I wish to emphasize that Government are p edged to safeguard the 1 interests of the industries of Australia. I trust that tbey will remember this and also bear in mind that the welfare of both our primary and secondary industries must be encouraged if we are to promote the best interests of tbe Commonwealth. Progress reported. The old NE W GUINEA RESIDENT'S SENTENCE OF proposedThat the House do now adjourn. Within a few hours-som e time to-morrow morning-the first execution of a white man under the authority of the Commonplace. I wish to take this eleventh-hour opportunity to enter my emphatic protest against the taking of human life whether in compliance with a sentence of a court of law or otherwise. I understand that the Government has received certain information concerning the particular case to which I refer, and that the information was furnished by the judge who sentenced the man to death. Section 80 of tbe Commonwealth Constitution provides Thet r i al on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury. Any trial other than by jury instituted within any portion of the Commonwealth, excluding its dependencies, would be unconstitutional; but it was decided by the High Court in 1915 in the case Rex v. Bemasconi that the Commonwealth Constitution, in this regard, did not apply to dependencies. In other words tbe Commonwealth Parliament has very much greater constitutional power in respect of dependencies than it has in respect of Australia. This Parliament has ratified an ordinance which gives absolute power to the Administrator of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea to exercise the royal prerogative of mercy. The fundamental difference between",56,Littlet On Groom Di D These Upon To Pay On The Local Market Is 2s 2d

This is exercised, in respect of trials within Australia, by the appropriate Commonwealth or State Ministry of tbe Crown tendering advice to the Governor Council. side the Commonwealth, Papua, New Guinea, Nauru, and other dependencies of the Commonwealth, the exercise of the Royal prerogative of mercy is vested in an administrator. Tbat is due to a flaw in the legislation passed by this Parliament. Easy as it may be to pass a law, it is easier to drive timed to take place-to consider whether a hole in it. expected to realize the full implications of trator of New Guinea regarding the comthe legislation with which they deal. They cannot be aware of the many cases which may arise under it. It so happens that, by reason of legislation passed by this Parliament, the Administrator of New Guinea has the power of life or death over persons who are found guilty of certain crimes, and sentenced to death. That was not the intention of this Parliament when the law was passed. I have not the slightest doubt, nor has any other honourable member, that, when this Parliament vested powers in the Legislative Council and in the Administrator of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, it did not. intend that the Administrator should have the power to decide whether a sentence of death should be commuted or not. Irrespective of the legal position,, I am further convinced that, were the Government to do as tbe Scullin Government did, and instruct the Administrator that the death penalty should not be carried out, this man would not die within a few hours' time. Administrator is an official of the Commonweafth Government, and, although there may be some legal difficulties about the situation, it is beyond doubt that Parthat unless he was unable to come to a liament has the power to pass an ordinance to deal with this matter. If an ordinance were prepared and ratified by this Parliament, authorizing the commutation of the death penalty, and instructing the Administrator not to carry out the sentence-and it could be done in five minutes-the Administrator would he guilty of murder if he proceeded with the execution. I do not suggest that that Hfr. Tinker. would happen; but I am pointing out what would be the position if an ordinance were disobeyed. The particular matter with which I am now concerned is that some time to-morrow a white man named Ludwig .Schmidt, a or Governor General in German, is to die. Members on both In respect of places outsides of the House are concerned that such as the Government has so little information on the subject. Had not the matter been raised last Wednesday by question, and again last Friday, the Government would not have taken any action in the matter. Even then, it waited until to-day-les s than 24 hours before tbe execution is Legislators cannot be it would communicate with the Adminismutation or otherwise of the death sentence. I drive home the further point that, although we do not know the wording of the radio message sent to the Administrator by the Government, we are informed that a reply has been received from him stating that counsel for the condemned man, after consultation with him, has decided not to appeal against the sentence. That proves either that there is something wrong with the reply which we understand has been received, or, what is more likely, that tbe man Schmidt is in such a dazed state, a few hours before the time fixed for his execution, that he is unable to give a definite reply one way or the other. Had he replied asking for an opportunity to appeal, I have no doubt that the Government would have been willing to hold over his execution. I am convinced, that once tbe execution was held up, the execution would never take place whether the High Court The upheld the appeal or not. If the report that Schmidt does not wish to appeal is correct, he has virtually signed his own deatli warrant; and no man would do decision affecting his own welfare. tally deranged. man would be in a fit state to decide any important matter a few hours before the time fixed for his execution.

[10.51] I listened with great interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) on this tragic subject, and I commend him for the zeal which he has shown in what appears to most of us to be a humane cause. We should be recreant to our duty as members of this Parliament, entrusted with the guardianship of the Mandated Territories, if we did not pay heed to what he has said from the depths of his heart. I also listened attentively to the debate this afternoon 1 ask the honourable member not to refer that the execution is to to the debate earlier in the day. that, this afternoon I voted for the closure motion, not because I desired to see the business of the House taken out of the hands of the Government, but because not having had an opportunity to speak on the adjournment motion, I wished to Surely, if we are Christians, and indicate that, because of the operation of the Standing Orders, after having heard the honourable member for Griffith, I was not satisfied.

I gather that this condemned man does not understand the English language, and that other persons were involved in the crime for which, apparently, he will have to pay the supreme penalty. The facts elicited to-day clearly prove that there is a good case for the postponement of the execution. I do not, however, suggest that tal punishment; that touches national Therefore, the Federal Parliament could not, alone, assume the responsibility for deciding it.

Government has the will to do so it is not too late for it to deal with this matter , and I suggest that the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Parkhill), who made a very fair statement of the position to-day, should call a meeting of the Cabinet to-night and communicate with the Administrator, indicating that it is the desire of this Parliament that the execution of this man, Ludwig Schmidt, should be postponed until further inquiries can be made by the Commonwealth Government. f 11.31 I intend to deal with this matter from an angle not yet touched upon by honourable members. straight out for the white man in the tropics as against the black, but not because I believe in being cruel to tlies1 native people. This Parliament should insure that the status of the white man living in territories which we govern under mandate should not be imperilled. Leading British medical authorities have stated that environment and heredity are irnportant factors in criminal psychology. These leaders of thought emphasize that we must re-orientate our ideas with regard to crime. We should not seutence a man simply because he has committed a crime, nor should we make convictions on native evidence alone. For instance, I prefer to believe that this crime was committed under duress, such as fear. Those who have not had experience of life in such countries as New Guinea are probably unfamiliar with fear of this kind. I do not believe in the hanging of a white man to impress the black man, or vice versa. My views on this aspect of the matter agree with those so ably expressed this afternoon by the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). I say I straight out that I fear a wrong policy will be adopted if this execution is carried out to-morrow. Government by ordinance is a quaint and inept way of governing any isolated oomjnunity. Some years ago a Lord Chief Justice of England was impelled to state publicly that the liberties of the people were being filched from them by ordinances implemented by regulations subject to bureaucratic interpretation. The Mandated Territory of New Guinea and the NorthI f the ern Territory, in particular, suffer in this respect. I emphasize that point. Figures published in Census Bulletin, No. 6, dated the 30th June, 1933, show that there were only 2,043 whites in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, compared with a native population, including indentured labourers, of 456,924. As the number of natives could not have been accurately counted, we can reasonably say that the native population of New Guinea exceeds that number by some thousands, at least. According to the Official Year-Booh. No. 28, 1935, page S68, the number of natives in the Sepik region, where this crime was committed, is 100',190. I speak I shall now quote an extract from an article which was published in the Rabaul Times of the 14th February, to show that the opinion is held locally that the natives have got out of hand in that area, and that the status of the white man must not be reduced in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, where the white man comes in contact with the black. I ask the Acting Leader of the House to take particular notice of this comment. The article, which is beaded "" Action, Please,"" and was written by Gordon Thomas, describes an interview with a former resident of Eabaul on the la iter's return to that town after an absence of a few years. It statesA one-time resident of Eabaul passed through the town the other day on one of the overseas vessels. He paid me a visit, and we sat and chatted over times and conditions which are now changed. He spoke of the new buildings which had been erected; the scaled",60,Death
244,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"streets; the number of women residents; the general progress; electric light. ""Tliere are many improvements,"" he said, "" b u t underlying it all tliere is a pronounced feeling of dissatisfaction with labour conditions."" And he told me of some of the complaints poured into his ear during his short stay: Planters, miners, householders, all had their tale of woe, tinged with a tone of despair. It was the same old tale that has been told for years past: the lack of discipline among natives; respect from the servant to the master and the complicated legal formalities necessary before any attempt is made of an ameliorative nature. To my visitor the changed attitude of the servant to the master, of the black towards the white, was far more marked than to those of us who have lived here continuously during the change, and have, as a result, lost our keen powers of observation. . . . A ll these little discourteousies and disrespectful mannerisms have gradually crept in one by one and they have been tolerated hy the democratic white, until now the rising native generation knows nothingor next to nothing-of that respect which is due to the white from the black, and tlie situation now is that the white, who demands those qualities in his servants, is looked upon cither as a crank or a harsh task-master. My visiting acquaintance is only one of a score from whom I have received similar complaints. A concluding paragraph in the article reads as follows:We have no one except ourselves to thank for the present unsatisfactory situation. For years now natives-bot h in Eabaul and other centres, on plantations and in mining campshave consistently introduced a change in their attitude authority and this change hits been allowed to develop, possibly under the delusion that such development is a part of the mandatory terms under which Australia governs the territory for the ultimate purpose of allowing these people, at a later date, to "" stand on their o w n "". Such an interpretation of the League's mandate is entirely an erroneous one, and the system of "" sparing the rod and spoiling the c h i l d "" can have only disastrous Tesults for the native generations at present and to come; and it is certain that the Permanent Mandates Commission has no desire to sacrifice the moral and social future of these natives on the altar of such a policy, nor is it desirous that white prestige should be the price paid for a territory filled with an indolent and arrogant people. I urge honourable members to read the whole of that article. This Parliament dare not allow Ludwig Schmidt to be hanged to-morrow, thus lowering the prestige of the white man in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, because of some will o' the wisp idea that there Mr Blain. must be some reprisal to impress an the ships; motor-cars; inferior native race on account of a crime committed by one whom we must presume to be a "" low white "". Honourable members have not been told what the Government intends to do in regard to this matter. For the first time the absence of since the establishment of federation, unless the present intention is altered, a man is to be hanged by the Commonwealth Government. The reply of Schmidt, through the Administrator, to the radio message sent, by the Government, that he does not desire to appeal to the High Court of Australia, leads one to believe that he is incapable of arriving at a sane decision in tlie matter. We all have the keenest desire to continue to live as long as life will last. This man was certainly placed at a disadvantage in having to avail himself of the services of an interpreter during his trial. Admittedly, the Government placed legal assistance at his disposal. That practice is adopted by State governments in the case of prisoners who cannot afford to provide for their own defence. Schmidt was tried by a judge in a strange country, and being unable to speak our language, had to have the assistance of an interpreter. The evidence against him came from a district which no man may enter withoutfirst obtaining a licence, because the towards official and unofficial natives of that particular part are uncivilized. What methods were adopted to collect that evidence ? A strong point was made of the fact that one native was shot in the back. It is quite on the cards .that he attacked the camp of these prospectors, was observed, and while running for shelter was shot at for the prospectors' own protection. For many years I have followed occupations which have brought me into contact with the Australian aboriginal. I am not one of those who would stand for the ill-treatment of the Australian aboriginal or of the New Guinea native. We should afford both every protection. But what basis is there for the argument that the hanging of Schmidt will bave a civilizing effect on the uncivilized portion of New Guinea? I contend that it will merely leave a stain upon the Commonwealth Parliament. It has been proved that hanging is not a deterrent of the crime of shooting blacks. J",61,Death

To-day an argument was advanced which surprised me very greatly, in justification of the continuance of this barbarous method of dealing with persons who commit murder. It was that during the last two years 21 New Guinea natives had been hanged. able member is referring to a previous debate. to what took place in iliis House. ber distinctly said the argument had been used to-day. gleaned tlie information that 21 blacks had been hanged in New Guinea. Those hangings have not put an end to the spearing of white men by the New Guinea native. I do not thiuk that the practice of hanging natives should continue. Our case is not affected by the fact that Ludwig Schmidt does not desire to save his neck. As the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) has said, it looks as though he is anxious to commit suicide. His disinclination to appeal against the sentence passed upon him does not prove that hanging is right. The principal point to be considered is, that this Parliaof one who is prepared to go to the galment has not had the evidence in the case placed before it. If in one of the courts of Australia a man was charged with murder, and the only evidence tendered against him was that of ten aboriginals, no judge or jury would convict. I doubt whether the New Guinea native is of higher intelligence than the Australian native. Therefore, we should consider the matter very carefully before deciding that the sentence of death in this case shall be carried out. It is contended by some people that murder is justified under strong provocation, but the view taken by the Labour party is that it would bo better for a thousand guilty persons to escape punishment than for one innocent person to be hanged. principle of British law. be remembered that Ludwig Schmidt has not been tried by a jury of his own countrymen, and it behoves this Parliament not to give its consent to his execution to-morrow. The Administrator, General McNicoll, was a member of this Parliament, and no more humane man has ever sat in this House. But he has to administer the law as he finds it. About Christmas, 1934, a man was arrested in connection with the murder of Mena Griffiths. The press commented on the case and the effect of certain evidence which the police held was made public. The police were satisfied, and I was certainly convinced, that they had the right man, but it was subsequently found that, at the time of the murder, the person who was arrested for the crime was at Wagga. The murder was committed in Victoria. He chanced to have attended a picnic held by the Salvation Army, and, an Army captain happened to recognize him, although he had been identified as the person seen in the company of the victim near Melbourne. This man had been an inmate of a mental institution, and the real murderer has since confessed to the crime. I do not think that any member of the Cabinet would ever regret the action if the death penalty were commuted to life imprisonment, which would be a greater punishment than hanging. If the radio message received to-day that the convicted man does not wish to give himself a fighting chance is the statement lows in preference to being imprisoned for life, 1 urge the Government to stay its hand on behalf of this Parliament, seeing that the Commonwealth Cabinet has not been responsible for the hanging of one white man since the establishment of federation. ber has exhausted his time.

253,Mr Brennan (Batman) [11.27],"the principle of capital punishment. I do not expect the Minister representing the Prime Minister( Mr Parkhill) although I believe he is a humane man, and must be seriously concerned by his responsibility in this matter, to accept my view as to the moral propriety of applying the principle of capital punishment in any circumstances. He may hob: that it is an old-established process it connection with the administration of the law in British and some other communities. In other countries, I am glad to say, it is becoming progressively less used, British communities being amongst the last to retain the old barbaric practice of strangling the victims of the law-. I do not ask tbe Minister to settle the matter offhand by consideration of the personal question which revolves around this convicted man and his fate; yet I think that a very strong case has been made out, and is patent to everybody, that at least the execution of the sentence should be postponed. The attitude taken up by tbe Government appears to be that the matter is not within the competence of this Government or this Parliament, because this Parliament has deliberately remitted it to another responsible body, the Administrator and the Executive Council of New Guinea; this Parliament has deliberately divested itself of its responsibilities and the responsibilities of government. But I ™.xbmit , very confidently, that that is an unconvincing and unsound lino of argument, and for two main reasons. In the first place the Commonwealth Government, in the last resort, is the responsible body charged with the duty of governing and administering the affairs of this territory, and has the last word. think I can safely say, as a lawyer, if not as a layman, that we can put it beyond the Administrator to carry out the execution of this condemned man. even in possession of the depositions. We have the power within ourselves. Under the imperfect system of governentirely correct in saying that the Goment that applies to this and other terrivernment has not even seen the depositories ordinances are passed by the local tions.

In practice to-morrow. I make these submissions to A'e know that the Government^ does not the Government not as a merely captious Mr Brennan. afford honorahle members an opportunity to discuss them, nor does it call special attention to them. Because of the predominant position of the Pederal Governmeiit and the Pederal Parliament, v hen I was a member of the Scullin Government, as my late leader in that government pointed out this afternoon, we took immediate steps to inform the responsible authorities in these territories that, as a government representative of this Parliament, which, in the last resort, has the authority and speaks to tbe League of Nations as the final responsible authority, we would not consent to or approve of capital punishment being carried out in any territory. We invited the local authorities to inform us in cases similar to this. As the result of that action no further executions took place during the regime of that government. We, therefore, established a very sound precedent for interference, if honourable members would like to call it so, though I much prefer intervention; but this Government too has made a precedent for itself. It has this day intervened in this matter, and has caused an urgent despatch to be sent to Rabaul for the purpose of obtaining information on a single and comparatively unimportant point. On what principle has the Government so intervened, except it be upon tbe principle that, unless it is satisfied as a government that full justice has been done, this execution will not be allowed to proceed? I now ask the Minister, having taken that responsibility, and recognizing, as he admittedly does, by implication, that there is responsibility on the Government .to see that full justice is done: does he say that he is fully apprised of all the This night I facts in connection with this murder, the trial, the adjudication and the sentence?",63,Death

It is said that the condemned man does not want to appeal. How can the Minister know how that matter has been submitted to him? The condemned man is a foreigner and speaks English very imperfectly. How can the Minister possibly know that the reason the condemned man does not want to appeal is because he feels that an appeal would be utterly futile, and he would have no chance of saving his life?

The accused was brought to Darwin, tried before Judge Wells, and after' a long and searching trial found guilty, but he was allowed to go free. At the time it was thought that the best way to impress the natives of Arnheim Land was to give Tukiar his freedom. He was enticed by a missionary to come into Darwin. He volunteered to do so, but because of the statements made to him by the missionaries, the judge would not allow him to be executed. He was kept in Darwin ""for some weeks and then allowed to return to his tribe and to impress upon other natives that the white man was anxious to give him another chance. between the action of Judge Wells and the decision of the Administrator of New Guinea. With other honourable members, I believe that the life of a black man is as sacred as that of a white. This case has attracted attention because, I believe, it is the first instance in which the Commonwealth Government has been asked to intervene to save the life of a white man found guilty of murder in New Guinea. So far as I can gather, three men were associated with the crime. crimes. possibly the administration has been lax -The law of the land in New Guinea is It is quite a. common occurrence for white officials in the territories under tbe control of the Commonwealth to be guilty of loose methods in handling natives. This is not the first time that white men have been associated with the maltreatment of male and female natives, but it is not always necessary, according to judges, to impose capital punishment on the white men or even upon the natives. I , with every other white man in Darwin, attended the funeral of Constable McColl. I also saw Tukiar in the cell with other natives. I heard part of the court proceedings. Afterwards the man was allowed to go back to his own people to show them that the white man kept his word. He had been decoyed to Darwin on board a missionary vessel under some bond that he would be allowed to go back again. Also, the judge thought there might be some extenuating circumstances to account for what he had done. I do not think that it is necessary to hang this man in New Guinea, or, indeed, any other man, in order to protect the white residents there from the natives. Surely it is not necessary to try to pacify the natives by making a scapegoat of some one, though, indeed, this man would not be a scapegoat, he being undoubtedly guilty. I remember how quickly the Scullin Government took action when it heard that some one was in danger of being hanged. The authorities were asked to stay their hand until the desires of the Government were made There is a distinct difference known, and the Administrator acted upon the Government's request. I have known Administrator McNicoll for many years, having first become acquainted with him when he was a schoolmaster. I know that he would be the happiest man in tbe world if Cabinet allowed him to refrain from taking this man's life. He has no savage traits, although he was a gallant soldier. If the Government would request him now to delay action until the matter could be more fully considered, he would be happier than any member of the Government will be tonight. being vindicated in the sentence passed by the judge on this prisoner, and concurred in by the Administrator. I suggest to those honourable members who have spoken so sincerely against the principle of capital punishment that they do not attempt furtherfcoassociate their argument with this particular ease, but that, upon some suitable occasion, they move a definite motion that in no future case shall capital punishment be inflicted, or, in straight out terms, that capital punishment be abolished so far as the Commonwealth Government has power to do so.

As has been pointed out, the really fatal objection to the arguments of honourable members of the Opposition is that this Parliament has no power to interfere in the matter. vious occasion. request was made by the Prime Minister to the Administrator that certain action be taken, and favorable consideration was given to that request. This Parliament, however, has no jurisdiction whatever in the present case, and all the argugoverned by acts of Parliament which ments of honourable members are quite futile insofar as any effect they may have on the course of the case. no power, why did it send a radio message to-day to General McNicoll? Mr E, GREEN -Becaus e this Parliament is responsible for the mandate we hold over New Guinea, and there is no reason why the Government should not desire to know the facts of the case even if it cannot interfere. Discretionary power in matters of this kind is vested in the Administrator of New Guinea, not in this Parliamnt. The law operating in New Guinea is based on the criminal code of -Queensland, which still contains the deatb penalty, and nothing can be done regarding the abolition of capital punishwhole subject involves a principle which ment in New Guinea until the criminal code there is altered. The death sentence will riot be removed from our statute book by means of a catch vote on such a motion as this. If honourable members consider that this penalty is an anachronism, they should move, in a proper way, to have it expunged from the law. Parliament approved of the ordinance that has been brought into operation in this case, and should not now be indulging in a futile discussion of this description. Speaking personally, I sincerely hope that this monster will be hanged to-morrow. Wednesday, 25 March, 1936. a.m.] -Every honourable member must commend the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) for the tenacity with which he has fought for the relaxation of the barbaric criminal code which we still have in force in Australia and in our mandated territories. I do not agree with the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) that neither Parliament nor the Government has any control over this case, nor that Parliament has deliberately adopted a policy of which he spoke. To take his second argument first, it seems to me to be calamitous that our mandated territory should be governed by ordinances which are not brought directly under the notice of honourable members of Parliament. Our territories should be have passed through their various stages and been subjected to the whole attention of honourable members. It is wrong that territories should be governed by ordinances which honourable members hardly ever see -and of which the public know nothing. I agree with the honourable way) that the Administrator of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea would probably be very glad to be relieved of the responsibility of making a decision in this case; but, even if he would not be glad, he could be relieved of the responsibility by the mere alteration of an ordinance. An executive act-a n exercise by the Governor General of his prerogative of mercy-woul d take away from the Administrator the power to determine such a matter as this. This should be very carefully examined by the Government. It has been said at various times that this man's blood is something which we owe to the natives of New Guinea, and that if he is not executed the natives will feel that their kinsmen who have died through the carrying out of the death sentence, have been wrongly slaughtered. It appears to me, however, that if this execution is carried out, it will perpetuate capital punishment in New Guinea.

I am opposed to capital punishment, as is every other honourable member on this side of the House, not because it is a plank of our platform, but also on principle. I am opposed to it because I believe in the fallibility of human justice, and human beings should not put it out of their power to correct an error. Capital punishment takes from human beings the power to correct an error of judgment. I am also opposed to capital punishment because I believe it barbarizes the community that inflicts it. Capital punishment in New Guinea, in Papua and in other countries where uncivilized communities live, is worse than in civilized communities. ""We are accustomed to this practice. The Christian ethic, in the course of 1900 years or so, has become encrusted with many inconsistencies. We do not realize our inconsistencies, but uncivilized peoples see things differently. On the one hand we invite the natives to submit themselves to the influences of civilization and would say "" Yes, we would shoot a man of the Christian ethic, and on the other hand we offer them the spectacle of a professedly Christian community resorting to methods which the Christian ethic refuses to accept. I hope that the Government will give further consideration to this case. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Perkins) very wisely and forcibly said, a decision of such importance should not be made in the absence of the Prime Minister. The case should be considered by the full Executive and every Minister of the Crown available in the country should give his attention to it. If this execution is carried out, the system of capital punishment in New Guinea, Papua and other Commonwealth territories will be perpetuated. I am, as I have said, opposed to capital punisbment and I believe that a number of honourable members opposite are, in their hearts, abo opposed to it. I hope that the subject will be considered, not merely on the circumstances of the Schmidt case, but on -the wider basis of whether it is a wisi Mr Blackburn. policy to inflict capital punisbment in Commonwealth territory, particularly among uncivilized communities. Trade and Customs) [12.8 a.m.] -Thi3 subject touches us all very deeply. Those who are endeavouring to save the life of this man are really discussing the general principle whether capital punishment should or should not be inflicted. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr1 Holloway) frankly said that this was the case. But is there not a danger that in considering this case on humane grounds, we may drag in a good deal of false sentiment? bers : Is tliere no crime, however hideous, horrible and diabolical in respect of which, if it were committed against their own kith and kin, they would not feel justified in taking a life? A person who would not do so, in some circumstances, would not be worthy of manhood. I believe that if they were put to it they for the crime""-suc h a crime, for example, as that for which a man stands condemned at this moment in Victoria. A man who would do innocent children to death deserves that swift justice should overtake him. It is only British justice that a man who has been haled before a court on a capital charge, and, after a fair trial, condemned to death, whether by judge or jury, should suffer capital punishment, That justice is also what the natives understand. If a man is convicted and condemned to death, under the law of the land for some atrocious crime, are we not acting iu the interests of the injured person by punishing him? Rather than wax sentimental about a destroyer of innocent children we should have regard to those who have suffered injury at his hands.

I wish to correct the impression created by the Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Forde) that any ordinance made by the Government of which he was a member could have been vetoed in another place. Ordinances for the government of the Mandated Territory are not prepared by the Commonwealth Government, aud certainly they would not have been prepared by the Scullin Labour Government. They are promulgated by the Executive Council of New Guinea, and may be vetoed, not by the Commonwealth Parliament, but the Governor General. has not the right to veto this sentence. Scullin Government, had it wished, could have intimated to the Executive Council in New Guinea that it desired an ordinance to abolish capital punishment. It could have instructed the Government nominees on the council to take this action, so the excuse of the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) and other honourable members opposite, that the existence in the Senate during the regime of the Scullin Government of a majority in Opposition to Labour is not sustained. made, would have been disallowed in the Senate. so. This Parliament has not the power to disallow ordinances made by the Executive Council of New Guinea. The honourable gentleman was Attorney General in the Scullin administration and should know that New Guinea and Papua are responsible for their own ordinances. the approval of the Minister in charge of territories. are subject to veto by the Governor General. the Governor General acts on the advice of the Ministry, so the ordinances would be subject to veto by either House of this Parliament. able member is entirely wrong. The the Executive Councili n the Mandated Territory that it desired the abolition of capital punishment, and ordinances would probably have been promulgated to give effect to that policy. Such action was not taken. The Scullin Government had exactly the same power as is vested in this Government-n o more and no less. As regards the crime for which the man has been condemned to death, I am glad to know that honourable members on both sides have expressed their abhorrence, and that none condones it. I remind the House also that the Commonwealth is responsible to the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations for its administration of the territory, and every member of this Parliament must accept his share of that responsibility. We should not have one law for the white man and another law for the black. From my personal observations, I realize that we cannot afford to allow tbe good name of Australia to be besmirched by so administering the law as to give the world the impression that we have one law for the white race and one for the black. Our officers in New Guinea have been endeavouring, by peaceful penetration and other methods, to induce the natives to conform to our social system and ordinances, if abandon cannibalism, tribal murders, and other crimes, and it is gratifying to know that they have been highly successful. The natives are entitled to all the protection which we can give them. We should insist on the strict observance by whites of the laws relating to the territory. WhilstI was Minister for the territories, I had occasion to deal with a most atrocious crime, and was guided by the trial judge in the administration of the law. The crime for which this man has been convicted is, I think, infinitely worse. The simple question which we have to determine is: Is the law relating to capital punishment right or wrong? Honourable members opposite take the view that capital punishment should be abolished. Their opinion is shared by a considerable section of the people. I agree with the view generally held that it is a survival of the stone age, and ought",71,Henry Gullett I Am Of Negotiations F O R Trade Treaties S Ir

But surely this is a subject which may more fittingly be discussed in connection with Commonwealth policy. abolished in Australia, it must naturally follow that it will be abolished in the territories under our control. Tbe thought that this convicted man is about to receive his punishment is abhorrent to all honourable members; but we should not entirely overlook the feeling of the natives of New Guinea, who look to the Commonwealth for protection. Notwithstanding the sentiments expressed by the Scullin Government, six black men were hanged in 1930. Administrator took that action without consulting the Commonwealth Government. When it was consulted, the definite instruction was issued that no person was to be hanged, and that instruction was observed. suggesting that the Scullin Government had these matters brought to its notice before the sentence of death was carried out; but it knew that certain men were to be hanged, or if it did not, it was unaware of ordinary administrative acts.. While I was the Minister who administered the affairs of these territories I saw on the files the minute of the right honorber is perfectly ridiculous. able member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) that there should be no further hangings without the Government being first advised of the intention. But that does not get away from the fact that had the Scullin Government so desired, it could have instructed the Legislative Council of Papua to amend the ordinance. The Minister representing tbe Minister in charge of territories (Senator Pearce) admitted the other day that owing to the serious position which had developed the Government had advised the Legislative Council of New Guinea that it should amend the shipping law of tbe territory. Similarly, the Scullin Government could have instructed its official nominees on the dence adduced; we may doubt the wisdom Legislative Council of Papua to pass any ordinance it desired to have promulgated. There is no gainsaying the fact that if the Scullin Government, the present Government, or any other government, desired to alter the law of the Commonwealth, of New Guinea, or of Papua, f u l l power exists enabling it to do so. If capital punishment is does not know what he is talking about. He is misleading the House, and that should not be done in a case of this sort. cast in the same mould as the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan).

I know what powers are vested in the Minister who administers them.

We may question whether this man has bad a fair and proper trial; we may question the nature of the eviof enforcing capital punishment in order to impress the natives; but we do not, in any shape or form, condone the offences of rape and murder which have been committed in the mandated territory.

315,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [12.45,"there We do say, however, that tbe argument advanced, particularly honourable member for Richmond( Mr time an ordinance was tabled in this R. Green), was perhaps the most fallacious that could be put forward in a parliament which seeks to administer the affairs of a territory which is inhabited principally by uncivilized blacks. What is the strength of the honourable member's argument? He said'that the natives have the inherent belief that murder must be avenged by murder. We do not question that. It is the law of the jungle, the law of an uncivilized race. We send missionaries to civilize these people, and teach them Christian ways. We appoint administrators, and set up councils, to guide them along the paths of self-government, although we do not give government. supposed to be directed towards civilizing the blacks and inducing them to discard the law of the jungle. Yet the honourable member for Richmond has argued to-night that because uncivilized natives believe that a murder can be avenged only by another murder, their instincts are to be satisfied by the legalized murder of a white man in the early hours of this morning. of temper or passion, but clamly and deliberately, is to strangle a white man to death in order that the law of the jungle-a life for a life-shall be perpetuated by white men in order to maintain the prestige of a white man's government in the eyes of uncivilized We bave been told that this House is responsible for the ordinances under which these territories are governed. How many members are acquainted with the manifold ordinances that are promulgated? Every act passed gives the Executive the power to promulgate regulations and ordinances. I question whether Ministers themselves have a knowledge of one half of the ordinances which are on the files in their departments. among the many thousands that liave been promulgated there is one which denies to a white man in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea the British right of trial by jury, he can be condemned and hanged on tlie decision of a single judge. MoreMr Rosevear. before Schmidt was born. over, he can be hanged, as this man is to be, on the uncorroborated evidence of unby the civilized blacks. Because at some remote House of which probably no honourable member had cognizance, we are told that everything must proceed as arranged, and that any move for the alteration of the practice must be delayed until some future date. Honourable gentlemen who have spoken on behalf of the Government have shown distinctly that they are in favour of capital punishment. I have never listened to a Minister speak with such enthusiasm and relish for his task as was shown by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett), but I do not know how he will sleep well now that the job is done. them the powers of selfWe are asked to believe that if the Scullin All our efforts are Government had abolished capital punishment, Schmidt would not have been hanged to-day; but I have no doubt that if the Scullin Government had taken that action the present Ministry would have immediately re-introduced capital punishment in New Guinea, because it evidently believes in hanging. The honourable member for Parkes, who has had considerable experience of the adminisNot in the heat tration of the territories, says that the natives do not know the meaning of a hired assassin murder. It is true that they do not appreciate the value of human life, and that we might just as well hang a mad dog as a native of New Guinea for a capital offence. Yet Schmidt was convicted on the uncorroborated evidence of uncivilized blacks. blackfellows. There were three accomplices, and I understand that not one of them turned King's evidence. Therefore the Administration had to rely entirely on the evidence of the natives. What else is there to show that the convicted man was responsible for the crime ? The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, in order to bolster up the case of tbe Government, told a story of the rapes and murders that have taken place in Because New Guinea of recent years, and mentioned that Schmidt had been charged with three murders; but what is there to show that the police and the Administration have not made him the scapegoat for the other murders? It is all very well to talk about tbe character of the Adnrinistrator. I realize that he is a humane mail, but, no doubt, he had to endorse the verdict of tbe judge, and I doubt whether the Executive Council of New Guinea had power to up3et it . The ultimate decision rested with the Cabineti n Canberra, and it is apparent, as a result of the cablegram which the Government sent asking questions of the accused or his counsel, that the Government had only the slightest smattering of what happened in regard to this case. appeal or not was the only matter about which we had any doubt. the Interior( Mr Paterson) now says, in effect, that the Government had all the information it required except the little bit which it obtained by radio, yet the hill) remarked, in justification of the sentence member may not refer to a debate that has taken place earlier. said at the deputation tation was supposed to be confidential, a request in that direction having been made by honourable members opposite. pleading for a man's life, the confidence sought in that direction should go by the board. Perhaps the honourable member and I have different views as to the value of human life. A t the deputation this morning to which I have referred, the Minister had no official report, either the judge, but relied upon an extract from a novelette or a trade journal. Yet the Minister for the Interior has declared that all the Government did not know about the. case was whether or not tbe accused desired to appeal. that that journal was the Government's Sole source of information. The Opposition is not fighting for this man's lif e for the purpose of condoning the crime. Its main object is the abolition of capital punishment. We are not satisfied that a prisoner who has not received a trial by j u r y has been properly tried, and we contend that no person should be convicted on the evidence of uncivilized natives, uncorroborated by any reliable testimony. Nor are we satisfied that this man has not been made a scapegoat for the numerous murders which have been committed in New Guinea in recent years. We say that sufficient doubt surrounds the whole of the circumstances that, lest an irreparable mistake should be made, the execution should be postponed until a proper and f u l l inquiry has been conducted. To those honourable members who have tried to salve their consciences by saying that, at some future date, the Opposition can move for the abolition of capital punishment, let me suggest that this procedure w i ll be useless, if it be ultimately shown that this man was wrongfully hanged, and that we set a bad example to the native population in accepting their standard by declaring that one murder can only be wiped out by the committal of another. I contend that the execution of this man, whether guilty or not, w ill have an infinitely worse effect on the native mind than anything else that could be done. T h a t depuorable members opposite know f u l l well that the Commonwealth Government has no jurisdiction in this matter. Cabinet consider it? being a lawyer, should not have to ask me such questions. The case of this man has been made the basis for a general discussion on the question of capital punishment. That is the only reason from the Administrator or why the matter has been brought before Parliament. Mr Speaker, I regard as grossly offensive to me personally the statement that an ulterior motive was responsible for the I suggest raising of this matter. honourable member for Barton( Mr. Lane) to have said that this matter had been brought forward so that the Opposition could present its views on capital punishment. only!",73,Henry Gullett I Am Of Negotiations F O R Trade Treaties S Ir

Honourable members will realize that if that remark is offensive a great many more offensive remarks have been made concerning members on the ministerial side of the chamber. able members opposite, particularly those of tbe honourable member for Dalley( Mr from what one would expect in a legisRosevear), are only so much eye-wash. Honourable members opposite have said that if the Administrator allows the execution to take place it will be a lesson to the natives that the law of the jungle is countenanced by the white man. Capital punishment has been exacted in Australia in order to restrain fiendish men from taking advantage of weak and innocent people and perpetrating crimes of violence. Hanging is too good for sue!) people. Too often we hear of little children being murdered and women outraged. I never contemplate tbe hanging of a condemned prisoner without a revulsion of feeling and the wish that some other form of punishment could prove more effective. I have never been able to convince myself that certain crimes can be met only by the imposition of capital punishment. If it were only a matter of dealing with native jungle law, I could quite understand some of the speeches of honourable members to-day; but I remind them that capital punishment was in existence long before New Guinea was ever thought of by the white races. Honourable members opposite have been trifling with this matter, and have made many statements which they know are false. permissible, Mr Speaker? able member for Barton is not in order in saying that honourable members made statements which they knew to be false. ""When honourable members brought this matter before the House they endeavoured to convey the impression that they were actuated solely by sympathy with the condemned man, and that their only consideration was the saving of his life. But while they have expressed their horror at the proposed execution, 95 per cent, of their arguments have constituted an attack upon the Government on the question of capital punishment generally. They know that the party to which, they belong stands for jungle law in politics and in industry, to the detriment of innocent men who are brought to the verge of starvation as a result of it. Some of the arguments advanced during this debate are different lature such as this. My reply to honourable members who say that if I take no steps to interfere with the Administrator in the discharge of his duties, I am guilty of the murder of the condemned man, is that they are equally guilty of encouraging men of this type to murder innocent natives. The one contention is surely as logical as the other. Honourable members opposite say that they want to save the skin of a man who shot natives in the back; they espouse the cause of such a man, but have no sympathy for hi3 innocent victims. We all regret the necessity for capital punishment, but I cannot find it in my conscience to allow a convicted murderer to be given his freedom. My sympathy goes out to the members of the Cabinets in the various States of Australia who are called upon to determine whether sentence of death shall be enforced upon a criminal convicted of a capital offence. Buti f I were convinced that capital punishment was necessary in order to protect innocent persons against the actions of fiendish men, I should not hesitate to refuse to grant a reprieve. Honourable members opposite have said that Brigadier-General McNicoll would be glad to receive a message instructing him to postpone this execution. I can quite believe that Brigadier-General McNicoll bas manfully performed his duty, painful though it was for him to do so, and I feel sure he would be glad to receive such a message. On the 22nd I withdraw the remark. February last I presented a petition to opposite the Administrator of New Guinea on behalf of a man who had received a sentence of four years' imprisonment for stealing gold. Six months ago a similar petition was presented by an honourable member opposite on behalf of the same man. Both petitions were refused. I was asked by a relative of the prisoner if I would take the matter further.",75,Henry Gullett I Am Of Negotiations F O R Trade Treaties S Ir

I was informed that the Administrator was the only person who had any jurisdiction in such matters. members opposite are endeavouring to prove that the Government has power to intervene; but, from the information which I have just given, it will be seen that, even in a comparatively trivial case, Cabinet could not assist .the man whose case I have cited. I do not think that the present Administrator wishes to shirk his duty, and is not anxious to be relieved of the responsibility of doing what is expected of him. should ? ment of honourable members opposite, this man is being executed to satisfy the law of the jungle, or to appease the wrath of the natives. Capital punishment has been in operation in Australia for many years, and honourable members opposite, who are opposed to such a policy, have delayed the House, not in the interests of the accused person, but to enable them to express their views on a plank on the platform of the Labour party. BecauseI believe that the Government has not the power to intervene in these matters, and that the Administrator should be allowed to carry out the important work with which he is entrusted, I hope that the Government will not be influenced by tbe appeal of honourable members opposite. This subject bas been dealt with from various angles during yesterday and to-day. The arguments advanced by the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) have been difficult to follow. In the first place he said that the Government has no power to intervene in the administration of New Guinea because the affairs of that territory are controlled by ordinances, and later he said that it had. I direct the attention of honourable members to the New Guinea Act of 1920-26, section 13 of which readsExcept as provided in this or any act, the acts of the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall not be in force, in the territory unless of the black man in a country which we approached the Attorney-General's expressed to extend thereto, or unless applied to tlie territory by ordinance made by the Goveruor-Geueral under this act. Section 14 providesUntil the Parliament makes other provision Honorahle for the government of the territory, the Governor General may make ordinances having the force of law in the territory. If either House of the Parliament passes a resolution, of which notice has been given at any time within fifteen sitting days after any such ordinance has been laid before the House, disallowing the ordinance, the ordinance shall thereupon cease to have effect. Although the honourable membei* for Parkes endeavoured to make it appear that Parliament has not the power to intervene, it will be seen that the power rests with the Parliament. act in operation to-day. when the Scullin Government was in office. New Guinea Act which takes from the Governor General the prerogative to exercise mercy in cases of this kind, aud as the Governor General acts on the advice of his Ministers, the Cabinet could, if it so desired, make a recommendation which might result in this man's life being saved. has no voice in the administration of New Guinea. responsible Ministers considered this matter in Cabinet? I am making my speech in my own way. The fact is that Ministers have not taken sufficient interest in this matter to realize the responsibility and power of the Parliament in this case, which is the first of its kind to come before the Commonwealth Parliament since the inception of federation. The members of the Opposition are concerned not with the merits or demerits of the case, but with tbe imposition of capital punishment in a territory directly under the control of the Commonwealth. It has been said that if this man's life is spared the prestige of the white residents in New Guinea will suffer. Is this man to be executed because uncivilized natives demand a life for a life ?

Isi t a fact that quite a number of these men, prior to coming to Australia, were drawing a war pension aud were given a lump sum in f u l l compensation for their war injuries because they believed that in course of time their health would improve in tlie .Australian climate instead of gradually getting worse and forcing them to apply for invalid pensions from the Commonwealth? 4. In view of tlie deplorable state of affairs existing among Imperial ex-service men, due mainly to distance precluding them from attending tribunals in person to make their Hppeals, will he make representations to tlie imperial authorities for the purpose of establishing in each State of the Commonwealth committees or tribunals to deal with their claims ? Thef o l l o w in g replies have been f u r n is h e d by the M in is t e r for He a l t h a n d Repat r i a t i on :1. No more difficulty than any other I m perial ex-service men experience. 2. There is nothing to debar an ex-service man from applying for the acceptance of any disability he regards as war-caused. greater use of air mail by both the British Ministry of Pensions and the Repatriation Commission is making for expedition in the Tcceipt of decisions. It is Tint regarded as prejudicial to ex-service men that representations are made by correspondence. 3. Making what is known ati final awards is part of the policy of the British Ministry of Pensions and had equal application to a l l ox-service men whether remaining in the United 'Kingdom or proceeding abroad. 4. The British Ministry of Pensions has itself investigated the position of ex-service men In Australia, and, in point of fact, its representative, Mr F. N . Smith, OBE., recently left Australia after visiting all States. Access was given him to a l l files of British pensioners resident in Australia and he interviewed many of them and corresponded w i th many others. Mr Smith also heard numerous representations from representatives of organizations of British ex-service men resident in Australia. appropriate report to the British Ministry of Pensions on the matter and therefore, it would not be proper lor the Commonwealth Government to make the representations desired.

I a m n o w in a positio n to in for m t h t honourable member as f o l l o w s : To cope with extraordinary requirements arising out of the decision to reclothe the military forces, a considerable number of new employees was taken on in the Commonwealth Government Clothing Factory in 1933. The reclothing of the military forces was accelerated in 1934 in preparation for the royal visit in connection with the Victorian Centenary Celebrations. The reclothing is now completed and nothing more is in prospect except the annual turnover. Already, in anticipation of requirements, a considerable amount of reserve stock, has been accumulated, and the factory can no longer continue to Tetain employees on the scale of the past two years. In June, 1932, the number of employees was 240, a total greater than had existed for years previously. In June, 1935, the number had reached 482, a total considerably in excess of normal requirements, and consequently reductions are now in process. The reductions are being put into effect as slowly as possible. The He -will doubtless furnish an",79,Commission S Stajp Imperial Ex Service Men Pensions
