1,Mr Speaker (Hon.. Sir Littleton,"Minister state .precisely the position of Australia with respect to the optional clause of article 96 of the statute of the Court of international Justice? proposed that Australia shall be a signatory with reservations, or will her position be that defined by the Prime Minister of Great Britain? position yesterday afternoon (vide page 548). The Commonwealth, of Australia, the other dominions, and Great Britain have decided to sign a declaration of acceptance of the optional olause during the sittings of the present Assembly of the League of Nations-wit h certain reservations, which are bow under consideration. Before the final act of ratification, which will confirm the signing, an opportunity will be given to this' Parliament to consider the whole matter. optional clause' accessible to honourable members ? tern al affairs branch of my department to prepare a short memorandum giving the' text of the optional clause, a list of the countries that have signified their adherence to it by signing, and a general survey of the position, and honourable members will he supplied with' copies of it. . CONDUCT OE BUSINESS. rumoured that the Prime Minister has decided that the House shall sit throughout to-night to discuss the MaritimeI n dustries Bill. It is very, early inthesesable members curtailing their remarks sion to adopt such tactics, especially in connection with such an important measure. The right honourable gentleman is exhibiting a lack of consideration for honourable members. On this side of the chamber there are at least twenty honourable' members who have not yet had air opportunity to express their views ia relation to the measure, and there must be many opposite who also desire an'd are expected to address themselves to it. Will the right honourable genfleman not provide better facilities for the full discussion of the motion for the second reading than can be afforded during an all-night sitting? ' night, it will be because of the need for completing the second-reading stage of the Is it bill, and to enable every honourable member to speak upon it, which, I understand, is what the honourable gentleman desires. I remind him that yesterday I indicated the wish of the Government to bring the second-reading debate on this measure to ab end to-morrow. I then suggested that honourable memhers might practise selfdenial by so curtailing their remarks that they would not occupy the one hour and five minutes whioh is allowed to each speaker by the Standing Order. . I still urge honourable members to exercise selfdenial. If they do so, the period during which we. shall be compelled to sit will be considerably shortened. debate is not' completed to-morrow, is. it intended that we shall sit until Saturday morning? there will be no necessity to sit beyond to-morrow; but I am not prepared to reply to a hypothetical question. ter aware that the taxpayers, who find the money that is necessary for the upkeep of this Parliament, have expressed utter disgust at parliamentarians sitting all night to conduct, the important business of this country? Can he not, out of bis fertile brain, evolve some better system ? for me to exercise my fertile brain. There are two methods by whioh all-night sittings can be avoided. One is by honorsomewhat; and the second is by utilizing the machinery provided by the Standing Orders for the shortening, of debate. If it is the desire of honourable members that we should have recourse to the latter method, I am quite prepared to meet them; but I am under the.impression that they prefer to have an opportunity of expressing their views. whether the Standing Orders provide means ior the punishment of the Leader of the House for compelling honourable",9,Printing Committee

The Chinesei l l question is the personal servant of the actor referred to, whose stay in Australia is not expected to exceed six months, and, i i i accordance with the usual practice in relation to the servants of visitors of good standing to the Commonwealth, the servant was admitted under a limited exemption to enable his employer to have the benefit of his services merely as an attendant and not to displace any local labour.

No arrangements have been made for filling the position of Director of the Division of Maternal and Child Welfare. last the 'honourable member for W a n n o n : ( Mr Rodgers) asked me the f o l l o w in g question:W ill the Minister for Public Works inform me who is responsible for damage done as a result of the carrying out of the Murray river waters undertaking? Six authorities associated with this work-the Victorian Government, the New South Wales Government, the South Australian Government, the The answers to the Commonwealth Government, the Murray River Waters Commission, and, to a lesser extent, the State Rivers and Water Supply Board. None of these bodies seem capable of protecting public property. What authority, I ask, is responsible for the nremature inundation which has destroyed roads and bridges before new ones arc constructed, and which has seriously damaged public and private property ? I now have pleasure in f u r n is h in g tbe following information:The Public Works Department, New South Wales, and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission, Victoria, are the constructing authorities for the Hume reservoir works, and as such arc responsible for all matters in relation to the acquisition of lands required for purposes of the works, and for the submergence of lands as a result of such works. I am informed by the constructing authorities that all reasonable precautions were taken well in advance, firstly by the service on landholders of notices to treat for the purchase of lands affected by the storage, and, secondly, by warning shire councils and other interested local bodies, together with private landholders, as to when submergence might be expected to take place. In addition, measures were taken to provide suitable outlets by deviation of roadways and the provision of a punt before the submergence of existing traffic routes. The punt, of course, is only a temporary substitute pending completion of the Bethanga bridge over the Murray river, which bridge is expected to be completed during the coming year.",12,Processed Fruit Rebate On Sugae

The question of paramount importance to tained in any previous statute. It interbe considered in this debate is not feres whether we shall retain federal arbifrom giving and the otlier from obtaining emtration, but rather what we shall do to ployment except upon terms settled by the preserve and safeguard our industrial concourt.

Further, I think this Act is productive not provide wages, nor do they secure of litigation, with its concomitant ill feeling continuity in industry, or the observance and i ll will between employers and employees, of awards. I propose to delve, to some who are by this Act forced into hostile camps. extent, int o the history of arbitration. In I believe the object of the legislature in passthe early days of Australia, the system will between employers and employees, but I of individual bargaining existed, and fear it has not had that effect. whatever may be said in favour of, or against it, it must be admitted that many The deprivation of the liberty of the working men became independent, and public at large is involved in this matter. even affluent under that system, simply beThe Federal Arbitratio n Court was estabcause they were able to labour on a piecelished work basis. It cannot be denied that the very definite promise and undertaking there was a great deal of sweating, and by the unions that if compulsory arbitraoften unsatisfactory conditions; and no tion were instituted, the awards of the one in this chamber, or outside of it , court would be f a it h f u l l y and punctually would like to see such things return. obeyed. That was the only foundation For, after all, we, in Australia, are one upon which the system could rest. Our people, with a complete community of Conciliation and Arbitration Act has been interests. We are descended from the in operation since 1904, and under it the one stock and have similar aspirations Commonwealth Arbitration Court has and hopes. Whatever affects one section, been affects all in greater or less degree. Under industrial disputes. the system of individual bargaining, adgest vantage was taken of men's necessities, ances of Australia have been more and they were compelled to work for low or less severe than those of any other wages. We therefore evolved a system country. That does not affect my present peculiar to Australia, and called it argument. I am concerned now in showindustrial arbitration. I believe that New ing that since we have had Federal and South Wales had the first arbitration State Arbitration, there has been no subsystem, and the example of that State stantial improvement in the conditions of was followed in 1904 by the Commonour workers.

It precludes the one from obtaining employment at their specifio bunal can prescribe terms of management, There are many other matters to which I refer, such as the operation of the The courts, of course, make before the court; but it is not necessary to do of the most alarming and deplorable amount ing this Act was to promote peace and goodby this Parliament upon functioning. We have had I do not sugthat the industrial disturbI n that year, Sir Frederick getting higher nominal wages, they have",13,Murray River Waters Scheme
40,Mr G. Francis (Kennedy) [2.49],"Lave they been getting continuity of employment. I am alarmed and aghast at the unemployment existing in Australia to-day. We have successive Commonwealth increases in wages, always accompanied by such increases in the cost of living that the real wages have not been increased at all. At one time there was a reasonable opportunity of securing continuity of employment. To-day there is no such thing. It has been said that under our system of arbitration industries have developed. I do not believe that at all. If we consider the decreased value of money, the increase in population, and the general conditions of the world to-day, it will be found that as a matter of fact our industries have not correspondingly increased, are conditions so far as the workers are concerned. The Arbitration Act has been amended upon eighteen occasions, and we have tried in every way to make it a perfect piece of machinery under the limitations imposed by the Constitution. Yet, what is the position? The British Economic Mission pointed outThere lies -no task before the Australian people more urgent than that of, in some way breaking the vicious circle, and of bringing down costs of production, as is being done in the other industrial countries of the world, without lowering tlie standard of living of the workers, as measured not by money, but by real wages, whicli are the reward of labour in the form of goods and services. Again Mr Gillies, one of the members of the Queensland Board of Trade and former Labour Premier of Queensland, saidI t is impossible in existing circumstances example' of a piece of machinery of the mostto improve the standard of living in Australia, and w i ll remain impossible, unless and until employers and employees co-operate to increase production. Every one must agree with that. The Labour party, so-called, has arrogated to itself the fathering of industrial legislation. It has made arbitration its child for a certain length of time, and while it suits its purpose. As has been said elsewhere, the Labour party so loves arbitrationthat it willnot consent, toits being abolished, but it so hates the system that its members will not. obey' it.. They cannot have it both ways: A man who faces' north by south can. make no"" progress. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) affected to look back with pride upon his association with Mr Justice Higgins in the Eederal Arbitration Court. Mr Justice Higgins was apparently the oracle from which all wisdom came. Yet, during the hearing of the case of the King versus MacKay, Mr : Justice Higgins, in criticizing the Arbitration Court, saidI t is the function of the legislature, not of the judiciary, to deal with social and economic problems; it is for the judiciary to apply, and, when necessary, to interpret the enactments of the legislature. But here, this whole controversial problem, with its grave social and economic bearings, has been committed to a"" judge, who is not, at least directly, responand we sible, and who ought not to be responsive, to public opinion. Eveni f the delegation of getting no improvement in duty should be successful in this case, it by no means follows that it w ill be so hereafter. I do not protest against tlie difficulty of the problem, but against the confusion of functions-agains t the failure to define, the shunting of legislative responsibility. It would be almost as reasonable to tell a court to do what is "" r i g h t "" with regard to real estate, and yetlay down no laws or principles for its guidance. That criticism is as true to-day as when uttered by Mr Justice Higgins. Sir William Irvine, an eminent jurist and now Chief Justice of Victoria, had this to say about arbitration1 I have no hesitation in saying that whatever the ultimate settlement of this hugely difficult question of the relations between labour and capital may be, the particular machinery whicli the Labour party have been and are supporting, namely, the Conciliation and Arbitration Court of Australia, has failed to perform the duty for which it was brought into existence. It has failed lamentably. I am going to refer to the record of the court in a very short time. It has been a momentous cumbrous and most unsatisfactory kind, because it has cost the people Of the country whose interests on both sides it was supposed to conserve, immense sums of money, whilst the results of its action have been wonderfully little. The reason is that it is not a court at all. I am not saying anything whatever in criticism of the President of the court. You cannot make atliing a court by calling it a court. You' cannot make functions judicial by calling the place where they are administered a court Judicial functions and the functions of a court are those' which determine the rights under the law between parties. There must be law before we can determineany rights between parties The function of this so-calledArbitration Court is not to : determine rights under thelaw at all, butto make' law. So much for exalted legal opinion on the subject of arbitration. This expensive and cumbrous system has been in operation since 1904, and any man looking back upon its record dispassionately, f a i r l y , and without party bias, must recognize and concede that it is one of steady retrogression. It is true that while arbitration courts were constantly granting increases of nominal wages, and agreeing to every claim that the unions lodged, there was a certain degree of obedience rendered to the awards of the court Now, however, when the economic position w ill not permit, this course to be followed any longer, a very different condition of affairs obtains. years, strong opposition to the existing arbitration system has developed even among the trade union organizations themselves. In August of 1927, the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council passed a resolution accepting the prin ciple of a complete break with the Pederal Arbitration Court, and the transference by the unions of their fight against piece-work to the industrial field. In July, 1927, the building trades group, supported by Mr G. Eymer, of the Australian Railways Union, passed the following resolution"" That this meeting of the Trades and Labour Council welcomes the action of the members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in Sydney in defying the award made by Judge Beeby providing for piece-work, which by past experience has proved inimical to the interests of the members of the working class. ""Further, that this council considers that sooner than accept such degrading conditions it would be in the interests of all workers to repudiate the Federal Court of Arbitration, and we seek the support of other councils in this matter."" Again, Mr J. P>. O'Connor, President of the Australian Tramways Union, speaking in. September, 1927, SaidThe Arbitration Court is overboard so far as tramwaymen are concerned. We will recommend to the members of our union that the court shall no longer be used. It has comPrime Minister has done. W it h in very mitted industrial suicide. Organized labour has not been alone in its opposition to the system of industrial arbitration. of the Central Employers Federation held Mr G. Francis. at Perth, MrM . L . Brooks made a strong attack upon the existing arbitration system. Mr MacDougall, speaking in November, 1928, is reported as follows:Mr James McDougall, the retiring president, referred to the operations of the Arbitration Court, the waterfront dispute, and other .subjects which concerned employers. In particular, he criticized the system of compulsory arbitration under whicli, he said, conditions that were utterly intolerable had been imposed on industry. . . . Labour leaders and trade union officials had held out the promise that if employers and employees were compelled to submit tlieir differences to compulsory arbitrament, strikes would be a thing of the past. But to-day, after working to a greater or lesser extent under the system for more than twenty years, the conduct of business, because of the lawlessness of certain unions, ""Within the last fewwas as uncertain and embarrassing as it was in any period of the country's history. There is less peace in industry now than there was before tbe arbitration system came into force; Not long ago, as honourable members w ill remember, Mr Justice Beeby was urged by the waterside workers to hasten the making of an award covering wages and conditions in their industry. The Waterside Workers Federation gave an undertaking that if he would make his award, they would obey it , and ensure its obedience by all affiliated groups. Yet, when the award was made it was straight away denounced as an in famous instrument, and it was disregarded and broken. Not only was it defiedby those who were affected by its conditions, but it was disobeyed by the Queensland waterside workers, although it gave exactly the same conditions as those under which they had been working. They struck against the name, and not against the fact. There is still operating in New South Wales a lockout in the coal mining industry. I do not say, and I do not think, that the action of the coal owners could be proved to constitute a legal offence, but there does unquestionably exist a lockout. The men are suffering, industry is suffering, and the public are suffering as a consequence. Members of this House have clone their best to have the matter settled, and in this connection nobody could .have done more than the recent times penalties have been imposed' by this Parliament for breaches of arbitration laws, and members of trade union At the annual convention organizations have been fined for failingto obey those laws. Yet all these things. have not prevented industrial disputes,nor situation, in fact, is going from bad to worse. We have to ask ourselves whether, in such circumstances, we ought At that time, I , and most other honourable to continue a system which is costing the members, believed that there was no alternative country many hundreds of thousands of to compulsory arbitration; but a great deal pounds and which is not giving us peace fidence in the principle, and I wish to make it or security in industry.

He told the people that the Commonwealth authorities could not enforce the awards of the court; that Queensland had an infinitely superior' system of industrial control, and that the State authorities alone could ensure industrial peace and the observance of awards. Under the federal law, strikes, lockouts, and picketing are unlawful, but in Queensland a system of authorized strikes and lockouts prevails. When the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) was Secretary for Public Works in the Queensland Government he also had a great deal to say about the relative merits unanimous verdict for a strike. of the Commonwealth and State systems, and he advocated in no uncertain terms the method of industrial control devised by his Government. He said that the measure then introduced in the Queensland Parliament would provide the most perfect instrument for the regulation of industry that had seen the light of day in any civilized country. Commonwealth Arbitration Court was a lame duck, whicli could not enforce its awards, and had no power to make a common rule. vising us to keep this lame duck. But we cannot forget that the trade unions will accept the awards of the court only when the conditions granted are favorable to their members. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot expect to be allowed to work under favorable awards and at the same time contribute funds to enable workers in other industries to strike against unfavorable awards. One aspect of this subject has not yet been touched upon. There is more than a suspicion in Australia that the workers in different industries are not allowed to exercise a perfectly independent choice as to whether they will or will not strike. employment. I am not suggesting that A good deal of tyranny is exercised over them. Very few secret ballots have been taken on the desirableness or otherwise of conducting a strike, because the union leaders realize that in many instances the men would veto any strike proposal. The Mr Q-. Frauds. following is an enlightening comment on this subject by Mr R. D. Elliott. It appeared in the Melbourne Herald on the 15th February, 1926, under the heading of "" How a strike was averted "":Mr Elliott was speaking on ""Humanity aud Industry,"" and he referred to a dispute which arose a few years ago, affecting a firm that employed about 100 men. A mass meeting of tbe employees was called, and the union secretary and the manager both addressed the men. On a show of hands, a unanimous verdict for a strike was given.. One man then walked quietly past the representatives of the employers and said, "" Take a secret ballot."" He came back again with the same advice, but was careful not to let any of the men know what he was suggesting. The manager addressed the men, and the secret ballot which followed gave an overwhelming majority for a return to work. The union secretary harangued the men and called for a show of hands, resulting in a The manager persuaded the men to take a fourth ballot, a secret one, and the men reversed tlie strike decision. "" The moral of this story is obvious,"" Mr Elliott added. Not long ag'o a disagreement occurred at Cairns as to whether the waterside workers there should adopt the rotary system of work or strike. At the meeting of workers which considered the subject He also said that the a show of hands revealed that practically all the men present favoured a strike. But one person demanded a secret ballot. This was taken, with the result that a Yet to-day he is admajority of 70 per cent, voted against a strike. By some means another show of hands was taken, and again practically every hand was raised in favour of a strike. Another secret ballot was held under the segis of the industrial magistrate, and again an overwhelming majority voted against a strike. It must be clear, therefore, that the men are not allowed to please themselves in these matters. Liberty is the most priceless heritage of mankind, and we should exercise all vigilance to ensure that the working men of this country are not robbed of the liberty to exercise a free choice in respect to matters relating to their every union official is a tyrant.

The trouble with the union officials is that they have to keep their seat in the saddle and ride hard to maintain their place. They have ""to obey the behests of a few noisy extremists. This is not as it should be. In fact,the sooner that such a state of affairs is altered the better it will be. Let us consider in a little more detail the attitude of the trade unions towards the Arbitration Court. I quote the following from a report which appeared in the Cairns Post on the 3rd August last, in connection with certain proceedings which were being taken under the terms of the "" perfect"" method of industrial control introduced by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) when he was a member of a former Queensland Labour government. The remarks which follow were addressed by a responsible union official to the judge of the court:If we cannot get the protection of tbe court, we shall have to take what steps we deem advisable to protect our members. Theni t will be found that a union which is regarded as an unwieldy organization would be able to kick as violently as a baby elephant. He did not say that was a threat. If those observations did not constitute a threat, I do not know what a threat is. I cannot imagine any more threatening gesture or any more threatening words. If anything stronger had been said, surely the speaker must have laid himself open to a charge of contempt of court. I wish to deal briefly with the speech delivered last night by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell). The honourable member did not go back half far enough. He spoke of happenings in the last six years; but he should have taken into consideration the experience of the twenty years which have elapsed since the introduction of industrial arbitratiqn. The substance of the honourable member's argument was that he had lost faith in the judgment of the Prime Minister( Mr not a single primary or secondary indusBruce) and the Attorney-General( Mr try in Australia can carry on its operaLatham) on industrial matters. '.fa. MAXWELL I did not say that. phrase of the honourable member's argument was that, although formerly he,had every confidence in the judgment of the result of six years of "" f a t "" government. Prime Minister and the Attorney-General .and had shared their opinions on industrial matters, those honourable geutlemen had been. proved to be wrong. Consequently, he said, he JIOAV had no confidence in their opinions, but his confidence in his own judgment was not shaken. Such an argument does not appear to me to be logical. It is quite possible, of course, that the changed views of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General on industrial questions are unreliable; but so may be the opinions held by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell). None of us is perfect. We are all liable to make mistakes. The honourable member made it clear that his confidence in the personal integrity and honour of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General remain unshaken. My confidence in the integrity of the honourable member is also unshaken. At the same time, I do not tliink that any convincing argument was submitted in support of the view that the judgment of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General was wrong. Formerly, the honourable member held views identical with those of his leader and the Attorney-General. If they made mistakes he made precisely similar mistakes and on the same grounds. The honourable member had a good deal to say about the mandate the electorsgave to the Government. I am not greatly concerned about whether there was or was not a mandate for the introduction of this bill. We should not always be expected to take the safe course. There are times when the timid, doubtful, and apologetic course is wrong. The Government should not be expected to say, "" We are your leaders; therefore we will follow you."" I do not subscribe to that view. The economic situation of Australia, with its record number of unemployed, its high cost of living, and the inability of its industries to compete in the markets of the world, is such that courageous action is necessary.

44,Mr Fenton,"That is the lamentableresult of twenty years of industrial arbi: tration. This system was to have brought an industrial paradise into being; but the paradise has not materialized. Our workers are not as well off to-day as they were before we established this system of industrial control. They have not had a real increase in wages. As a matter of fact, the purchasing power of their money has been decreased. The following figures furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician show, by means of index numbers, based on the index number 1,000 in 1911, the increase in wages in Australia over a period of years:30th June, 1914 30th December, 1914 1085 30th December, 1925 30th December, 1920 30th December, 1927 30th December, 1928 Although nominal wages have risen, correspondingly greater increases have occurred in the cost of living. Assuming that the amount required to purchase a given quantity of food and groceries,. and to pay a certain rate of rent, was 20s. in 1911, it has risen as follows in subsequent years1925 1920 1927 . 1928 .. 35 1 1929 (First quarter) 1929 (Second quarter) The increase in wages therefore has not effectively kept pace-with the increase in the cost of commodities. Our taxation has increased by leaps and bounds, and our public debt per capita has grown tremendously. We have not improved our position as a borrowing power in the world's money markets. Our economic position must cause every thinking person the most serious anxiety. Arbitration courts do not give wages but only fix rates of wages. When the first Arbitration Court of Queensland conducted an inquiry into a certain branch of the mining industry, I had the privilege of appearing before it as the representative of the mine-owners association. I refused to argue that the wages paid were a reasonable compensation for the risk that the men took and the work that they did. The judge asked me if that was not my contention, what was my answer to the' claim. I replied that although I represented the employers, my case did not rest upon that ground. I said that I regarded mining as a hazardous employment, and that the men could not possibly be paid a wage which would compensate them for the work they did and the risk that they were obliged to take; but it was a question for the court to decide whether the men should take what the industry could pay, or should get a nominal award for higher wages and close the mines. The result of the hearing was that an increase of about 20 per cent, in wages was given. At that time over 70 mines were working in the area covered by the inquiry; but five years later only .. 1079 two mines were working, one on the tri1887 bute system, and another on wages. .. 1938 Mining had been killed and ceased to 1955 be a factor in the production, of the State. 1959 Charters Towers, at one time one of the most famous gold producers in Australia, has ceased to be a mining centre.

On such fields as Black s. d. Jack and Broughton the surface has been .. .. .. 34 8 only scratched.

The. reason for this collapse of the industry was largely that the courts had superimposed conditions which were not too great a reward for the workers to receive, but were more than the industry could stand. Labour members have frequently said that if an industry cannot afford to pay the wages that the workers are asking, it should be shut down. The courts have proceeded on that basis for a long time, and so many industries have been shut down that the country is experiencing record unemployment, which is to nobody's advantage. member says occurred could not have happened under the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which is required to take into account the probable economical effects of any award. true.

They have treated the Arbitration Oourt as they treated the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, which was sabotaged out * of existence. The workers were warned that if they continued their policy of strikes and obstructions the Government would dispose of the Line. They took no heed, and eventually the Line as a Commonwealth Government enterprise ceased to exist. The time has now arrived for the Commonwealth Arbitration Court also to disappear. Honourable members opposite talk as if when the Arbitration Act is repealed, all forms of industrial regulation will cease. I do not believe that the regulation of industrial affairs should end; but if arbitration is to bo satisfactory there must be power to enforce the decisions of the tribunals. As the States have sovereign rights complete and ample, and can make whatever legislative provision they choose for the adoppossible have been done to test thoroughly tion of the existing awards of' the Commonwealth Eederal Court, and provide any awards of their own, I see no reason why this matter should not be left to their control. They have also the police and the machinery for enforcing the judgment's of the courts. In Queensland strikes and lockouts are authorized under State law and there is legalized picketing. . In pursuance of what union officials are pleased to call ""peaceful picketing"" men have boarded railway trains, searched the passengers, thrown some of them out of the trains, capsized some trains, and prevented the running of others. Under this system one man was done to death, and evidence was given in court that one union served out loaded revolvers to some of its members who were to engage in ""peaceful picketing."" member wishes to relegate the regulation of industry to. the State tribunals. were happening the Commonwealth Arbitration Court was in existence and could do nothing to stop them. That court bans strikes, lockouts, and picketing. The State Arbitration Act makes all three lawful, and if the police'who were available to maintain law and order could not prevent outrages, what could the Commonwealth do. without a police force? Some of those who are opposed to the abolition of the Arbitration Act have said that the people should be asked by another referendum to grant increased powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. I cannot see that anything would be gained by the taking of another referendum. Eveni f the people bestowed greater powers on this Parliament it would still be .without ability to enforce obedience to the Federal Court, because it would have no police force unless it created one for that particular purpose. In the United States of America the militia have been called out on occasions to quell industrial disturbances, and I hope that we shall never be driven to such extreme measures in Australia. The arbitration system has been tried out since 1904. The original act has been amended from time to time, and all things the system; but for the reasons I have stated we have failed to make a > success of it. The conditions of the workers have not improved. The courts have awarded nominal increases of wages, but changes of economic conditions have prevented the workers from getting any advantage .thereby. Actually there has been no net improvement in the working conditions of our people. In-some cases they have been given shorter hours, frequently so short that they have not been able to obtain employment. What is the use of prescribing wages if men cannot obtain employment at those rates? Throughout Australia there are millions of jobs waiting to be filled and work waiting to be done that is necessary for the development of the country and the stimulation of our industries; yet tens of thousands of men are walking about the country looking for work, with no chance of getting it. That is what we have achieved under this cumbrous, frightfully expensive, and totally ineffective machinery. It is time that we scrapped it. By the time another referendum could be held and the necessary action taken, in the event of the people agreeing to the Commonwealth Government having wider powers, our economic condition would be a great deal worse than it is to-day.",21,Bhuce

53,Mr G. Feancis,"Whil e these evilsI am pleased that, by this legislation, the Government proposes to repeal the whole of our arbitration laws. arbitration system was once the idol of the Labour party; but it has not improved the conditions of the people, and, therefore, we should not continue it. It has hampered industry, has been the means of closing avenues of employment, has restricted the development of onr enterprises, and has placed us in such a position that we cannot either compete with other countries or find work for our own people, although we have borrowed heavily to maintain the standards that have been set up and give an appearance of prosperity. It is time that we threw this machinery on one side and took other steps to place ourselves on a more economic basis. Only the maritime industries will remain under federal control. The Attorney-general, in a very able speech, has explained the reasons for that. I believe that the waterside workers will welcome the committees it is proposed to appoint, and that in future they will be more contented, and work under healthier conditions than those that have existed under the federal arbitration system. It is a vicious practice to place employers and employees in separate classes. This proposal will have the effect of bringing them closer together. Before arbitration was effective in Queensland I had the privilege of being associated with a successful attempt to apply the principle of conciliation. I , and three other repreters. When the responsibility is laid sentatives of the Mine-owners Association, met 30 representatives of the miners at a round-table conference, to discuss an application by the men for increased rates of pay. We placed our cards on the table and frankly discussed the position. considered that the wages they were then receiving were sufficient. I replied, "" No; I never have, and I never shall. You cannot compensate a miner for the risk he takes in such a hazardous calling. But it is for you to-say whether it is better to carry on under these conditions or to have no work at all."" The representatives of the men went through the balance-sheets of the companies, held a private conference, and then said, ""'We shall allow matters to stand as they 'are for, at any rate,, twelve months, when the position can be reviewed."" They took The that action because they recognized that their difficulties were appreciated; but that the industry could not be further burdened in its existing condition. That arrangement stood, not for twelve months but for over three years. I am not suggesting that loss should be suffered and sacrifices made by the workers. I believe that they are least able to bear them, and that they should first be borne in another quarter. There must be efficiency in industry. I do not mean that the employees should speed up. Those who are responsible for the management of industries should be thoroughly efficient. They should have modern plant, and be economically capable of functioning in competition with other countries. Payment to the workers should then be on a piece-work basis, so that the man who has the ability to earn more than the living wage will receive it, and those who cannot earn a living wage will engage in some other calling for which they are more suited. It is the duty of the community to see that men are employed at work for which they are fitted. It will generally be found that those who are failures are engaged in the wrong calling. I have no hesitation in supporting the bill, and I hope that, under it, we shall derive a greater measure of economic satisfaction and justice for the people. The States only can control these matupon them, we may look for peace in industry, with a corresponding increase in national prosperity.

Without arbitration competition will become acute among the printers in the various States, and wages and conditions of work will be lowered so that prices may be cut. The employees in the printing trade have been working in perfect harmony for nearly twenty years under an award of the court. To-day there are 407,000 persons in Australia working under awards and they are now to be disfranchised so far as the Federal Arbitration Court is concerned. Their organizations have expended thousands of pounds to gain the protection of the Arbitration Court, but now their efforts to improve their conditions are to be frustrated. The Government has no mandate for its action. Its excuse for the abolition of federal arbitration is that some of the unions which promised to obey the awards of the court have acted in defiance of them. That can be said about a great many persons in this country. Under our [22] marriage laws persons take certain vows. They promise to do certain things. Yet we find the divorce courts crowded with those who have broken their vows. No man would say that that justifies the abolition of our marriage laws. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis) said that we have no courts to administer the arbitration laws. I I asked the Prime would remind him that we have no cpurts to administer the land tax or the customs. The State courts carry out that work. The Commonwealth would be put to enormous expense if it had to provide its own gaols and courts. An arrangement has been made with the States for the utilization of their courts to carry on the work of the Federal Government. It has been said that under arbitration this country has made no progress. Let me give some figures to disprove that statement. In 1903 the number of factories in the Commonwealth was 11,551. In 1927-28, the number was 22,775. It has more than doubled, notwithstanding the arbitration system and the overlapping of awards. In 1907 the value of the output It was a Cabinet of factories was £93,549,165. Last year it was £416,994,009, an increase of nearly 500 per cent. The value added to raw material was, in 1907, £35,997,706. Last year it was £167,402,772. In some cases, under the arbitration system, our secondary industries have increased 400 per cent. The salaries and wages paid in secondary industries were, in 1907, £18,323,977. Last year the figure was £91,365,319, an enormous increase, despite the restrictions imposed by Arbitration Court awards. In 1901, when federation took place, our population was 3,824,913, and last year it was 6,336,786. Our population has doubled under federation and the system of arbitration. This country is progressing by leaps and bounds, yet honourable members supporting the Government see fit to decry it. According to the Statistician's figures, the number of disputes in 1913 was 208, and last year, 287. The number of disputes in the intervening years has undoubtedly fluctuated, but some of them consisted of a stoppage of work for onlytwo or three hours. Looking at the history of other countries we find that Great Britain and America have had more prolonged and",24,Bhuce

64,Mr E. Eiley,"The printing tradeserious disputes than has Australia. I believe that Australia's favorable record is due to the fact that we have a system of arbitration and conciliation. The supporters of this bill say, ""let iis have round-table conferences between the parties, and settle our disputes in that way."" I remember when that system was in operation in Australia, and we can put it into operation again under the present system if we like. As a matter of fact, many industries to-day are working under agreements which have been arrived at in conference, and have been registered in the Arbitration Court, thus obtaining the force' of law. Before the introduction of the arbitration system we had the system of round-table conferences, and with what result? There was a constant succession of strikes and lockouts, while industry was conducted under sweating conditions. SupposeI am an employer of labour, and am conferring with my employees regarding wages and conditions. I say to them, "" Those are my terms; I am prepared to give you soand-so."" If they do not take it, there is a strike or a lockout, until eventually the We in Australia have been pioneers in employees are forced to accept the terms offered. Under the present system, if conciliation fails, the parties go before the court, Avhich determines the matters in dispute. I believe that the great prosperity which this country has enjoyed in the past is due to the fac{ that we have had a system of arbitration in operaconferred by arbitration. In New South tion which has ensured comparative peace in industry. It is true that we have had strikes and lockouts, but no piece of machinery is perfect. We must remember that we are dealing with human beings possessed of reasoning powers, and if they feel that they are being unjustly treated, they will resent it. We cannot prevent strikes altogether, but we can aim at reducing their number and extent as much as possible. That is what this party stands for. If the Government is so sure that the people are behind it in its determination to abolish arbitration, let them go to the country on the issue. Nothing would please the Labour party better. We know that the people are in favour of arbitration, and we know that no Government, which would oppose their will in that respect, would be returned to power. Mr E. Riley. not do that. that advice; it is too cautious. I have gone to some trouble to take out the figures dealing with imports into Australia for a number of years past. Notwithstanding all the trouble we have had on the waterfront the returns show that our imports have been constantly increasing. In 1903 the imports into New South Wales were 4,463,000 tons. Year by year they crept up until last year imports totalled 8,674,000 tons. In Victoria, imports have increased during the same period from 3,409,000 tons to 8,444,000 tons. While the Government here has been preparing to abandon arbitration, what has been happening in Great Britain? There they had a strike in the cotton industry, and the Government appointed an arbitrator, who settled the dispute, thus enabling 500,000 employees to go back to work. Thus while we are abandoning arbitration Great Britain ia taking it up. There is no justification for the Government's present proposal. many directions, and we have pioneered industrial arbitration. I look back with gratification at the fine work done by the Arbitration Court, which has set up fair standards of living, and prevented sweating. It is only necessary to recall the conditions of the shop assistants in the past to realize the benefits which have been Wales, young women employed as shop assistants used to receive about 12s. 6d. a week, after ten or twelve years' service. They received no wages at all for the first three months. Erequently, when they did become due to receive a decent wage, they were dismissed. Arbitration has altered all that. It has provided a scale of wages to which employers must adhere. It has also protected the decent employer against his unscrupulous competitor. I take my hat off to many employers who have invested their money in industry, and who are anxious to do the right thing by the public, and by those whom they employ. Sometimes, however, they are compelled by unscrupulous competitors to cut wages and impose bad working conditions under penalty of being forced out of business. If this bill passes-thoug h I am inclined",25,Bhuce
65,Mr Penton,The Government will,26,Bhuce
66,Mr E. Riley,"No, it will not taketo think that the Government will pass out of office first-the result will be chaos in disputes which have been settled by conindustry. In Tasmania and South Australia, for instance, there is no guarantee tions which have benefited include those that any legislation will be passed to take of the carpenters, watchmakers, engineers, the place of the present Commonwealth Arbitration Act. The Governments in those States are opposed to the principle of arbitration; they do not want any regulation of industry at all. They want to go back to the good old days, when the employers imposed their own terms upon the workers. Then an employer advertised for a man, and perhaps a dozen applied for the position. The man who was the hardest up, who had a wife and family to support, got the job, because he was prepared to accept what the employer offered. If the Government is honest, it will admit that its. purpose in bringing forward this legislation is to affected by the awards made. If this bill reduce the workers' standard of living. The Prime Minister has stated that we must reduce the cost of production, but there are other ways of doing this than by reducing the workers' wages. Production costs can be reduced by bringing down the rate of interest on borrowed money. We are paying 1J per cent, more for our borrowed money to-day than we were before the war. £1,000,000 a week. huge sum is coming out of the proceeds of industry. No action is being taken by the Government* to reduce the rate of interest, but now that the labour market in every State is glutted with an oversupply of man-power, the Government thinks it an opportune time to bring down this measure. I would welcome a dissolution of Parliament on this issue, and if the Government possesses the courage of which it boasts, and is confident of the approval of the people, let it take the chance and test the feeling of the public at a general election. If it takes that action, I am afraid that I shall miss a good many of my friends opposite when Parliament re-assembles. himself will be among the missing. member who has interjected will also be missing. He is here only by accident, anyway. Personally, I intend to oppose this bill by every means in my power. I have here a long list of industrial ciliation and arbitration. The organizadrivers, cooks, &c. In those cases agreements were reached and registered in the court. What will happen to those agreements if this bill passes? The workers who are a party to them will be without any legal protection whatever. Honourable members on the Government side have spoken about overlapping in the present system, but I do not see how this bill, if passed, will overcome any of the difficulties arising out of overlapping. At present 143 industrial unions are registered under the Federal Arbitration Court, and 769,000 workers may be passes, they will have no protection unless the States enact legislation to take the place of that which it is now proposed to repeal. We have no guarantee, however, that they will do so. It seems a tragedy to me that the trade unions which have spent money and taken infinite trouble to secure industrial awards should now be called upon to make completely new arrangements. The Government cannot claim that in bringing this measure forward it has the support of the people of Australia. The matter was not mentioned in the Governor General's last speech, nor was it mentioned by the Prime Minister in his policy speech. It was certainly not mentioned by any honourable member on this side prior to the last election. When I look at the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), and when I think of other distinguished members of the Commonwealth Labour Government such as Mr Andrew Fisher and Mr Chris. Watson who desired to make this Parliament the dominant legislative power in the Commonwealth,. I realize how far we have drifted from the ideals which we once set ourselves to attain. We now have men composing the Government of the Commonwealth who, far from taking any steps to make this Parliament dominant in the government of Australia, are prepared to hand over all control ' of industrial affairs to the Parliaments of the States.

I should like to see honourable members opposite remain true to their election pledges. They were elected to support a Government which allegedly stood for conciliation and arbiwipes out all industrial laws passed durtration, and for the preservation of law and order. Now they are going back on their pledges, and demonstrating that they deceived the people when they sought their suffrages. How can the people be expected to have any respect for the law when they see their lawmakers prepared to abandon the principles for which they professed to stand? I am strongly opposed to this bill, and I hope that the Government will be defeated on it. -This measure is without parallel in the legislation of the Commonwealth. For a quarter of a century the National Parliarelate to the maritime industries: ment has been building up, stretching out, but these have been deliberately inserted and consolidating its powers. The passing years have seen successive governments vieing with each other in an endeavour to exercise more effectively the powers granted to them under the Constitution. From the inception of federation until this ill-omened day the watchMinister in introducing the bill, for, as word of the National Parliament has been ""Advance Australia."" The Leaders of parties, Avhether in office or in opposition, have striven zealously to develop and exercise the authority vested in this Parliament by the framers of the Constitution. Checked in one direction by decisions of the High Court, they have striven along other lines; but their adA^ance has never halted. And during the last tAventy years every government has demanded and endeavoured to obtain such amendments to the Constitution as Avould increase the poAver of this Parliament. The leaders of all parties, though not ahvays agreeAttorney-General, who folloAved him ing as to the form of the amendments desired, have declared quite definitely that there Avas a need for wider poAvers to be vested in the Parliament. But Avhile they havo regretted the limitations of the Constitution, they have not halted nor stumbled in their onward march. They have endeavoured to exercise to the utmost all existing power. It merely by adverse seasons, and that Aushas remained for this Government to sound the trumpet for a general and shameful retreat from a difficult but vitally important strategic position. The system of Commomvealth industrial arbitration has serious defects, but the purpose of this bill is not to remedy them; not to improve the system, but to destroy it. At one fell stroke iting the last 25 years. It abolishes the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, in Avhich, as the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Eiley) has pointed out, 769,000 workers are registered and 407,000 persons working under its aAvards. It leaves not one stone standing upon another of that temple of industrial legislation slowly and painfully reared by successive governments. And it does this in the name of industrial peace! The object of the measure is to destroy. It is called the Maritime Industries Bill, and it contains some provisions which for the purpose of misleading the people. The main and real object of the measure is not to build up, but to pull down. Like the honourable member for FaAvkner( Mr Maxwell), Ave all listened intently to the speech .of the Prime the honourable member said, the onus rested upon him to make out a case which Avould satisfy us and the people of the country that there was some overAvhelming reason Avhy a system of industrial control, Avhich had been laborously built up by successive Parliaments in the last 25 years, should not only be destroyed, but be destroyed summarily and Avithout a moment's delay. Those of us who were in a position to exercise an opinion upon the point came to the conclusion that the Prime Minister did not make out a case. His speech was f u l l of sophisms, irrelevancies and platitudes. And the Avhile making pretense to logic, followed along the same lines. The substance of the Prime Minister's argument in support of the bill Avas that the economic and financial conditions of the country were very bad; that the depression through Avhich we Avere passing Avas deeply rooted, and was not caused tralia's great problem, if she was to solve her financial and economic difficulties, was",27,Bhuce
71,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [4.30].,"to reduce the cost of production. If we could do something effective in this direcposition to-day, and when the Prime tion, our export and home trade would be strengthened, our industries extended, unemployment reduced, the cost of living decreased, and the purchasing power of wages increased. And he went on to say that the Government was definitely of the opinion that, these objects could only be achieved by making it possible for the employers and employees to get together. It was also definitely of the opinion that the co-operation of the two sides of industry could not be secured while the existing dual control of industry was allowed to continue. He emphasized the statement that a solution of these problems was at once vital and urgent. They were so urgent, we were told, that the Government was prepared to stake its existence upon its proposed method of solving them. Last night the honourable member for Fawkner, like other honourable members who had spoken earlier in the debate, asked the Prime Minister to explain why the solution of these problems, which had been always with us, suddenly became so vital and urgent. But no adequate explanation is given. But we are told that the matter is so urgent that after a recess of five months and a session of two weeks there must be an all-night sitting of the House to deal summarily with the measure. Delay is fatal. Let us look at the position as it was when the Government decided to go to the country last year, when Parliament met in February, when it adjourned in March of this year. It. has been pointed out during the debate that, whatever the defects of the Commonwealth industrial system, they are not new. What they are to-day they were :iny time during these last ten years. Whatever is wrong with federal control to-day was wrong with it in November last, when, we went to the people, when the Parliament met in February, and when. Parliament adjourned in March. Nothing has changed; the system to-day is as it has been for 25 years or so; if there is any change it is a change for the better.' Time is curing some of these defects, the decisions of the High Court in recent years have given a more liberal interpretation to the provisions of the Constitution, and so enlarged, to some extent, the powers of this Parliament. But the Minister made his . startling and unheralded announcement to the Premiers Conference that the Arbitration Court and the entire Commonwealth arbitration system must be abandoned, has not altered by one jot or tittle from what it was in 1926, when the right honourable gentleman brought down amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which remodelled the court and gave it, for the first time in its history, the legal atmosphere and judicial panoply which the right honourable gentleman now deplores. Whatever is wrong with our arbitration system to-day was wrong with it iu 1927, when the Attorney-General again amended the act and gave his positive assurance that they would so perfect the system that we should be assured of industrial peace. Whatever has changed the federal systems of arbitration is today what it. was when this Parliament was elected, and as it was when, we adjourned in March. What then is the reason for the introduction of this bill, the purpose of which is to destroy the federal arbitration system? Has the situation changed since November, since March? We ask in vain. We have been told a good deal about the financial and economic conditions of the country; but these are not different from what they ^were in March last, when Parliament adjourned. Has the price of wheat declined? Has the price of wool fallen? Has some great financial cataclysm overtaken the country? We know that the position is substantially what is was in March last. Anyhow, in what way can the measure now before us remedy the position ? The Prime Minister has told us, among other things, that his opinions on industrial arbitration have remained unchanged. He still believes in the regulation of industry, but it is suggested that when he spoke so perfervidly of the regulation of industry, he meant the regulation by the States and not by the Commonwealth. He believes in arbitration as firmly as ever; but he believes that the federal system should be scrapped. Let us examine the right honourable gentleman's position as set out by his words, and interpreted by his actions Let us go back to the beginning. When the right honourable gentleman accepted a portfolio in my Ministry compulsory arbitration was definitely a part of its policy. That Government believed in compulsory arbitration as opposed to direct action. That was declared very definitely in my policy speech. By accepting a portfolio in that Ministry the right honourable gentleman adopted that policy as hi? own, and until the Parliament adjourned last March he knew no other. When he assumed office as Prime Minister he took that policy with him and steadily gave effect to its principles for si:: years. He believed in the federal system of compulsory arbitration; the enforcement of the law for the preservation of peace, the benefit of industry, and the good of the whole people. Penalties were of the very essence of his creed. The present Government measure after measure to amend the Arbitration Act, and in every one, enforcement of the law, compulsion and penalties have been outstanding features. It is true, as the Attorney-General has asserted, that on one occasion he said that if the parties would not accept the awards of the court and loyally work under them, the Government would have to reconsider their position. He may have said that it would have to consider the scrapping of the arbitration system, but I do not recollect that he went so far. Certainly, the people were never asked to express an opinion' on any such suggestion. The Government appealed to the country last November on the issue of the enforcement of the law against the waterside workers. The Prime Minister was then a firm believer in the efficacy of federal law. Did he suggest a surrender to the States? He did not. Did he doubt that the Commonwealth law could be enforced? He did not. Did he ever suggest that if it were necessary to restore economic conditions in industry the Government would propose the scrapping of the arbitration system? He did not. But he claimed when the Parliament met in February that he had secured from the electors a mandate endorsing the licensing system on the waterfront. He had gone to the country on the enforcement of federal law. The people-so he told ushad supported him. Tha+ was a triumph Mr Hughes. for the federal law and of course for the Government and its policy of penalties for law breakers. Now he tells us that compulsory arbitration is wrong, that penalties are barbarous, that we must abolish all courts and tribunals that prevent the parties from getting together and. reaching an amicable agreement. But yesterday, the strike was the one great offence against the majesty of the Commonwealth and the interests of the people. To-day it is one of those sportive gestures permitted to a free people. No longer is to strike an offence. But yesterday, the Prime Minister was a protagonist of penalties, and the enforcement of the law, to the hammering of people into reason, and compelling them to agreement. Today he preaches the gospel of brotherly has introduced love; the parties are adjured to turn the other cheek; penalties are swept away. The system is to-day what it was ten years or one year ago; but the Prime Minister's opinions are radically changed. To what are we to attribute this wondrous change? The right honourable gentleman says that he still believes firmly in the maintenance of the Australian standard of living, but the cost of production must come down. And so he proposes to abolish the court which has been the guardian of the economic and industrial welfare of the people, and is to-day the only barrier between them and industrial chaos. The right honourable gentleman says that he is not in favour of a reduction of wages, but he has decided that the court, which has been the greatest factor in establishing and maintaining decent wages, must be swept away. He undermines the foundation of the system responsible for Australian wages and the standard of living, and tells us he is against any reduction. He believes in the maintenance of the Australian standard of living, that he does not believe in a reduction of wages; but that the cost of production must come down! These are vague and meaningless generalities. How is the cost of production to come down, and at whose expense? Is there some magic incantation, some hidden virtue in this measure, which being released, will produce plenty where there is now scarcity? If not, how is the cost of production to be reduced? Are wages or profits to come down? parties are to ""get together."" This phrase is like the "" blessed word Mesopotamia,"" but what does it mean? The right honourable gentleman spoke as if getting together were some new discovery he had made. But there is nothing new under the sun. These things we tried in our youth, and in every country in the world, except Australia and New Zealand, the conditions to which he would have us return have always been in force. There is nothing to prevent the workers and employers of England from getting together, some of them do, and some of them do not. What is to happen when they do not agree? That is the question. When ""the parties agree, there is no trouble, but what is to happen when they do not agree? The workers have but three alternatives-arbi which made the basic wage possible. The tration, the strike, starvation. A man must either take up arms to defend his position, submit to the judgment of an arbitrator, or accept conditions imposed upon him by the employer. For 25 years we have resorted to arbitration in preference to strikes. What were the conditions in this country before arbitration was adopted? The framers of the Constitution, fresh from the spectacle of the greatest industrial conflagratio'n this The right honourable gentleman does not country has ever seen, and while its embers were still warm, placed the arbitration provision in the Constitution in order to provide a better means of settling disputes. Those men had seen ""the print of the nails""; their fingers had been thrust into the wound. They knew what appeals to force meant, and they pointed out a better way, and for a quarter of a century we have followed the trail they blazed. Until to-day, nobody has proposed that we should evacuate the field into which the framers of the Constitution led us. Now the right honourable gentleman suggests that in some magic way, the getting together of the parties will be facilitated hy the abolition of the Arbitration Court, tt can only help them to get together if it leaves the workers, or some of them, less protected. He says that the parties will not get together while there is a dual system of arbitration. By that he must mean that so long as there is some authority to which the workers can look We are not told. The for protection, they will not be compelled to accept anything against what they believe is right. If we remove that protection what will happen? The parties will, says the Prime Minister, ""get together."" I am reminded of the limerickThere was a young lady of Riga Who went for a ride on a tiger; They came back from the ride W it h the lady inside And a smile on the face of the tiger! When the parties get together, on which side will the worker find himself? We are told that the Arbitration Court is to be abolished in the interests of the whole community. The Prime Minister, while declaring that he believes in the maintenance of the Australian standard of living, yet proposes to destroy the temple, so diligently built up by his predecessors, right honourable gentleman says now that he believes in the settlement of disputes and fixation of wages by State courts. If the State courts can protect the workers the parties will not come together in the way that the right honourable gentleman expects. So long as the worker has some protection from an independent tribunal he will not accept conditions which he considers unfair. appear to realize that this problem has been considered in all its aspects for years before he came into Parliament, and that in repealing the Commonwealth Arbitration Act he is destroying a system under which nine-tenths of the workers of Australia have been reared. I doubt if 10 per cent, of our active workers have ever known any other; it is part and parcel of their industrial existence, an integral part of our national life, and upon it is based that standard of living which is reflected in the physique of the Australian people, their greatest asset. In what way does the Prime Minister think that the destruction of the federal court will help the parties to get together, except by depriving the workers of that temple in which they have found refuge and protection all their lives? The right honourable gentleman tells us that this would reduce the cost of living. This is another of the vague statements in which he loves to indulge. How will it do so? He says that this measure will reduce the cost of living, in order to allay right honourable gentleman has to fly with. the dread of those-and grows with every passing day-who fear that the effect will be to reduce wages. He says in effect that although money wages may come down, the wage-earners will really be better off because the cost of commodities will be reduced. Let me ask him one or two plain questions. After all, we are not dealing with a hypothetical case, but with the circumstances of a people whom we know, and with whose standard of living we are intimately acquainted. have food, raiment, and shelter. the Australian dietary. What item of it is to be reduced in cost? Is the price of meat to.be reduced? That, of course, would mean thut prices of sheep and cattle would have to be reduced. Does the right honourable gentleman tell us that this will be the effect of this bill? The pastoralists and the farmers will have something to say about that. Does he mean that the price of bread will come down ? Well, the farmers will havo something to say about that also. Wheat-farming does not pay as it is. Are we to understand that the right honourable gentleman means that the price of wlieat is to come down? What the wheat-farmer wants is what the sugargrower and the producers of dried fruits now, in some measure, have, and what the dairy farmers are getting-an assured price for their products in the local market. adapted to the Australian costs of production. to be told that, in the interests of the general community, the price of wheat mustcome down ? Of course, the Government will say that it does not mean that. The whole trouble is that it does not mean anything. Are the prices of rice, dried fruits, and sugar to come down ? system which has been in operation for Are the prices of butter, milk, and cheese to fall ? Those are the staple items of our was elected, and most, if not all, honoi-T dietary. Not one of them will come, down. 'Is the price of clothing to fall? It can fall only if the price of wool falls, and, if the price of, wool falls materially, my constituents to support _ it. last Sir. Hughes. Australia falls with it. There remains only rent. In the main, rents can fall only if there is a drop in land values. Is that what we are to expect? It is the only feather that the the number But we know very well that none of these things will happen. This talk about a reduction in the cost of living; that he is still in favour of the Australian standard of living; that he does not believe in the reduction of wages, is a palpable sham, a smoke screen behind which he is veiling his real purpose. The reasons that he advances are not the real reasons. What the real reasons are the people of this country will demand to know. What is responsible We must for the change in the right honourable Take gentleman, who, all his political life, has stood for arbitration; who followed the track blazed by those who went before him; who upheld the virtues of the federal system; but now, at a moment's notice, without the happening of any event, without the authority of the people, without consulting his party, without notifying this Parliament, without intimating to il. when we met in February, either in the Governor General's speech, or at any other time, that he proposed to submit this measure for our consideration? Why has he tabled this measure which with every resource at his disposal, he strives to force down the throat of Parliament? The announcement, of his intention fell upon us, as the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) said last night, like a bolt from the blue. What motive spurred him on ? The right honourable gentleman said They want prices that there were three alternatives before him. He tells us that he Are the wheat growers was convinced that a cliauge was necessary; that this was vital and urgent. He had to consider what form the change should take. There were, he said, three alternatives; for the fourth-continuanc e along present lines-wa s unthinkable, Yet it was on the continuance of this 25 years that every member on this side able members opposite. I certainly .was elected on that issue to every Parliament in which I have sat. I pledged myself to November. ister declared its continuance to be unthinkable. He. was, so he tells us, driven back upon the other alternatives. These were the evacuation of the field of arbitration by the Commonwealth, another referendum, or a grant of wider industrial powers by the States to the Commonwealth. The alternative of a referendum, the right honourable gentleman dismissed briefly. It would mean delay which was itself fatal, and was precluded by the very nature of the position iu which he found himself. Further, it would cost £100,000. That, of course, to a gentleman like the Prime Minister, who has probably spent many times that sum on the commissions with which the whole country is littered, was a fatal objection. And so, in short, there could be no referendum. When, after making his announcement to the Premiers Conference he gave an interview to the press, he said, "" We have tried twice, and the people will not agree to it , "" thus seeking to convey the idea that he had been a tireless worker in the vineyard of constitutional reform. The facts show a very different light upon the position. He has been in this, as in other things, a dilettante. What are the facts? He has been in office for six years. He and his colleagues began with a burning desire to alter the Constitution. His colleagues wanted it for one reason, and he for another, but they were agreed that the Constitution ought to be altered. But their burning enthusiasm spent itself in words. He has made but one ill-conceived attempt to amend the Constitution. The announcement of his purpose burst upon the people, just as this bill has done, unheralded. An awed populace gazed at one another. seen of a man subordinating everything to the great purpose of amending the Constitution, a matter, he said, so vital, that He means to convey the idea that he unless it were done the Heavens would fall. Having thus adjured the people, he left Australia, depriving us of the incalculable benefits of his leadership and his inspiration during the greater part of the referendum campaign. He left the conduct of the campaign to the Attorney-General, a man of great parts, a most excellent lawyer. until-two days after the referendum had been taken. gentleman gave up the active leadership of the campaign, and disappeared before the vote was taken. General, although a man of parts and an excellent lawyer, is one of whom it can hardly be said that his temperament and style of oratory are calculated to impress the people. He was left in charge. Be that as it may the referendum was overwhelmingly rejected by the people, although the Prime Minister had made a personal appeal to them to approve the amendment for his sake. After the referendum the right honourable gentleman appointed a royal commission to inquire into the constitutional position, and recommend the form of amendments that ought to be presented to this Parliament for subsequent reference to the people. For two years this commission has been engaged in its labours. During that time we have heard little or nothing of it. The first notification we had that the commission was still alive was an admission that it has cost somewhere between £17,000 and £18,000. Its labours are now completed, it is to present its report, so the Prime Minister told us earlier this afternoon, on Saturday. But he will not wait for his commission's report. Ho does not want to hear what it recommends. He has waited two years, but he will not wait another day. He has even decided to force through the second reading of this measure before the report of the commission has been tabled in this House. But let me return to the question of another referThe spectacle was endum. He asks, what is the use of referring the matter to the people, seeing that they have rejected it? has time and again approached the people. That is not so; he approached them only once. The circumstances under which that submission was made, the form of the questions and the shortness of the campaign, were quite sufficient to explain its rejection by the people. The people rejected his proposals, but it is quite untrue to say",28,Bhuce

The right honourable gentleman's proposal was rejected by 13 per cent, of the total number of votes polled. He is satisfied with having made one splendid gesture. It is characteristic of him that he persists with nothing; but proceeds from stunt to stunt. clear to the people that the right honourable gentleman has failed to use his many opportunities to secure such amendments of the Constitution as would have ensured that control of the industrial sphere which is essential to peace and progress. He spea-ks of a referendum. It is for him to explain why he did not submit proposals at the last election. He ought to have done so. The proposals submitted in 1913 and 1919 were presented to the people at the same time as the elections. And in the interval between 1913 and 1919, although the war was on, the Premiers of the States were approached for a grant of wider powers. The. right honourable gentleman has said that he asked the States to grant wider powers to the Commonwealth and that they unanimously declined to' do so. What are the facts? is that he was a humble suppliant to the Premiers, who scornfully rejected his humble petition. this: He said to the Premiers, "" In the. face of the referendum you will not, I suppose, agree to a grant of power; but if you will, I ask you now to grant it."" He then, went on to say that in the alternative the Commonwealth would vacate the industrial field. The Premiers were astounded. They had never heard anything like it in their lives. They contrasted-and I want the members pf Mr Hughes. this House and the people of this country to contrast-hi s attitude then with that on the per capita question. On 'that occasion he did not say "" There are my proposals. If you will not accept them. I must, of course, take what you offer me."" He stripped them of every financial feather; he shut his ears to their prayers for mercy; he left them no alternative but the proposals were rejected meek acceptance of his terms. There is no doubt that when he wanted to bring them to heel he knew how to do so. But in this case he had made up his mind to vacate the industrial field. He realized that that was the safest and best way to get out of the difficulty in which he found himself. It is not only arbitration that is on trial to-day; the right honourable gentleman is also on trial. This measure is brought forward, not to save Australia, It must be made perfectly but to save the right honourable gentleman. This adoption of the doctrine of brotherly love is not an admission that he has at last seen the error of his ways in exalting penalties and punishments to the seventh heaven as a means of bringing about industrial peace. The right honourable gentleman finds himself in the position of being no longer able to stand behind any measure which rests upon the enforcement of the law. He can no longer pose before this country as a man who is prepared to enforce the law impartially. That is the real, reason for the introduction of this measure. The proposed change will bring chaos where there is now order. Hundreds of thousands of law-abiding citizens will be fearful that the. industrial heavens will fall. Within the last 25. years we have built up a system that has adjusted itself The suggestion to the circumstances of the Commonwealth, and in turn these have adjusted themselves to the federal system of indusWhat happened was trial control. Every great Labour organization is built upon a federal basis. All the great capitalistic enterprises have adjusted themselves to the same standard. It is impossible for the States to control the conditions of federalized industries or to deal with major industrial disputes. No State can mete out even-handed justice to great industries. An engineer in Perth and an engineer. in Sydney follow the same calling, do the same work, aud demand that they shall do it under the same conditions. There can be no industrial peace without uniformity, and the only authority which can ensure uniformity, and which has secured a great measure of uniformity, despite the limitadefects; but I have always urged' that tions imposed upon it-the Federal Court -is to be swept away. Into this relatively extension of the powers of the central ordered arena the right honourable gentleman proposes to bring chaos. He proposes that there shall be set up six conflicting tribunals, each supreme within its plored the fact that cases are heard in a narrow limits, and unable to deal with anything outside those limits. We are now told that the States are to evolve a scheme by which their efforts will be co-ordinated. If they can do that, the Federal Court; that there must be a surely it would have been possible to bring about a greater degree of uniformity between the federal system and the laws of the States! We know very well, however, because Sir William McPherson has told us so, that months, even years, must elapse before we can hope for the evolution of such a system. And at best the States cannot evolve any system comparable with that which exists to-day. The contention that the States can deal with great industries which are organized ou a federal basis as the Commonwealth can is opposed to common sense and our own experience. It might be argued that if we were to dissolve the federation, each State could deal with its own problems. So it could. They could appoint a council to deal with such general questions as defence and the tariff. So they could. But these would be ineffective make-shifts. It was because the people rethe present system is unthinkable. We cognized that some permanent authority was needed, that federation was consummated. The Federal Court is the keystone of the industrial arch. It has maintained whatever measure of peace and uniformity we have had in this country. It has become an integral part of our lives. Its imperfections have always been admitted, but until the right honourable gentleman came on the scene, no one suggested that it should be destroyed. . As the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) has shown, the result must be a reduction of. wages. One State will compete against another. The employees in New South Wales may work 44 hours, and those in Victoria 48 hours, and conflict will necesmerely because'the criminal laAv is defied sarily ensue. The tendency will be for State tribunals to adjust the matter by reducing wages and extending hours. I do not say that the present system is in all respects what it should be. I have long ago pointed out its many and serious those defects could only be cured by au authority, and a simplification of procedure. The right honourable gentleman delegal atmosphere. He said, ""We want the parties to get together."" He suggested that the federal arbitration system could not function, except through legal atmosphere. That is not so. There is nothing to prevent us from exercising the power of conciliation and arbitration through tribunals, committees, or any other instrumentalities Ave may care to create, presided over by laymen. Until 1926, the court Avas not a judicial body. It is true that it was presided over by a judge; but he acted in a non-judicial capacity. Sir John Quick, who has discharged the functions of an arbitrator for six years, is not a judge. Therefore, that argument must fall with the others. We have been told that the GoAernr ment stakes its life upon the passage of this measure, and that there is no alternative but to pass it Avithout delay. He tells us that an amendment of the Constitution appears impracticable. There is no possibility of the necessary poAvers being granted by the States; are asked to belieAe that the previous r utterances of this statesman, and of all those Avho have preceded him for the past 25 years, are as the twittering of sparrows; that there never has been any possibility or hope of securing industrial peace under this system. Alternatively, we are told that because the timberAvorkers have defied the law, the system of federal arbitration must be abolished. That, of course, is merely an excuse. We regret that the timber-workers luwe defied the IBAV; but it is not the first time that a federal aAvard or other laws of the land, have been defied. No one would dare to suggest that the criminal code should be swept aside by certain persons in the community. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court is to be sacrificed, and with it all those men in the industrial arena who depend upon it to ensure them decent wages and conditions of labour. Tbe Commonwealth is in difficulties, the precise nature of which we are not told; but they are such as to demand immediate action. And the only action of which the right honourable gentleman is capable of taking is to run away, and to hand over the job to some one else. The Prime Minister was elected on a policy which rested upon the enforcement of the law of federal law. He posed as a champion of law and the effect of its penalties upon the evil-doer. upon the law being obeyed, contemptuously pulls down the temple of the law. He spurns the Royal Commission on the Constitution which has been labouring for two years, and whose advice is to be tendered to him on Saturday. Possibly the recommendations of that commission will disclose a means whereby the Government may obtain wider powers and have greater scope for endeavours to assist this country. Because the recommendations of that commission may heap upon him greater burdens, he is compelling this House to conclude the discussion of this bill before its report is tabled. The right honourable gentleman has been recreant to his trust. He has betrayed the people; yet he says that he has the authority of the people for this unauthorized, policy. In saying this he insults our intelligence; he affronts our sense of decency. He knows that this proposal was never submitted to the people. They are aroused against it; the thunders of their protests break upon his ears. If he had mentioned it during the last election campaign, the people would have been up in arms. If the right honourable gentleman had embodied the abolition of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in his policy, every hoarding throughout this country would have been covered with posters, and the columns of every newspaper-and the daily journals almost without exception supported him-would have throbbed with appeals to the people to stand behind the statesman who had passed this long awaited, this courageous proposal, which would at last bring 'Mr Hughes. economic sanity to a country that had been intoxicated with the heady draughts of false doctrines. [Extension of time granted.] If this measure had been placed before the people, this issue would have subordinated all others; it would have been the one vital question upon which the elections would have turned. The abolition of the Arbitration Court was not even mentioned then. The right honourable gentleman has said that the people are behind him. The people are not behind him. That is made evident by stating the position as it really will be if this becomes law. He speaks And now he, who insisted of the Federal Government vacating the field of arbitration as if he were stripping the National Parliament of the powers conferred on it by the Constitution. But this is beyond bis power-beyon d the power of any man. There can be no surrendering of powers; all that the right honourable gentleman proposes is to refuse to use such powers. Literally, he is the creature of a day. What he does to-day, another can undo to-morrow. Whatever was the issue of the last election, at the next election, come when it may-it may come sooner than many honourable members wish-thi s measure will be the issue upon which everything will turn. Then we shall see what the people will say. Nothing will distract the electors' attention from this issue. The right honourable gentleman claimed that he has the authority of the this iconoclastic people for what he is doing. He has not.. He claims that he has the authority of his party-that party he never consulted; He may have; I cannot say. One thing, however, I do know: he has not the authority of the platform of that party which, in plain and unambiguous terms, commits the party to the maintenance of federal control of industry. I know, however, that he was elected upon avery clear and definite arbitration policy. The policy of the Nationalist party, as laid down in 1926 at the triennial conference in Adelaide, is very clear in its attitude towards arbitration. It reads(/) The constitution to be amended to give the Commonwealth further control of industrial matters and extended powers for the maintenance of essential services where neces.: sity arises. ((/) Tho establishment throughout Australia of a uniform working week in each industry, which shall be as short as is permitted by the economic circumstances of tlie nation; and the fixing of working hours to be entirely removed from the political sphere and to be the responsibility of an independent and expert tribunal. (fc) To make observance of all awards obligatory and binding upon all parties thereto with equal penalties for breaches. (J) The power of the Government to interfere in all industrial disputes. Every member elected as a Nationalist has subscribed to that platform, and is bound by bis pledges to support federal arbitration and tbe maintenance of tbe federal system of control. Tbe Prime Minister has contemptuously ignored that platform in this instance as on previous occasions. He is a Nationalist, but the platform of his party and his pledges to the people are nothing to him. As for me, my course is clear. I was elected to support federal arbitration. I told my constituents in very definite terms that I intended to support it ; that I was opposed to the drastic penalties which the right honourable gentleman proposed. I said I did not believe in them. I . said then, as I say now, that I believe, as I have done for many years, that tribunals and committees are more effective ih settling disputes than arbitration courts. But about the arbitration system I was quite definite. I have quoted the platform upon which the Prime Minister was elected.. He was elected to maintain the system of arbitration that has existed in Australia for the last 25 years. He proposes to destroy it. If he has his way he would leave this Nationalist Parliament without power to deal with the greatest problems that confront the civilized world. If this measure is passed, we shall be a National Parliament in name only. If constitutional sanction could be given to this proposal, and this Parliament were deprived of the powers which he proposes to abandon, it would become a mere sham. The right honourable gentleman has on two occasions been wafted into power on the battle cry of the maintenance of industrial peace. This cry cannot serve him again. He can do nothing to preserve peace; he can do nothing in the face of a great industrial upheaval which would paralyze this country. But, if this measure is passed we shail have no power. There is no parish, municipality or shire council that will not have greater power in regard to industrial matters than this great National Parliament. It is saddening that this thing should be done by the right honourable gentleman, who has been entrusted with the government of this people, that it should be done in the name of industrial peace, that it should be done not because there is some great and powerful need for it to be done, but in order that the Prime Minister may save his face; that he may not be confronted with the ghost of that hideous blunder that he made when he withdrew the prosecution against John Brown. It is in that act of his that we must look for the genesis and find the explanation of the measure which is now before the chamber. I hope that the second reading of the Bill will be defeated, but if unhappily it should not be defeated, I propose to move in committee an amendment to the effect that it shall remain in abeyance until the people have been consulted on tbe proposed change. [5.48] -It has been said, during the course of the debate, that this is the most drastic proposal ever submitted to this Parliament during the 29 years of its existence. The aim of the Government -is to revert to the conditions that existed before, federation, and it may interest honourable members if I review the position of this country .before the present system of arbitration was instituted. In considering the proposal of the Government to destroy the great edifice of arbitration, one is reminded of the sign-boards that are frequently seen in our cities today outside buildings that are to be demolished. Those sign-boards bear a notice that "" so and so "" the wrecker is here. It might be truly said that outside the Arbitration Court edifice of Australia to-day is emblazoned on a sign-board, ""Bruce the wrecker is here."" This bill may be described as the most ""wrecking"" proposal ever submitted to this Parliament. Prior to the introduction of federal arbitration there had been established in Victoria,, for instance, a wages board, .and in the other States some other tribunal.",33,Bhuce
76,Mr Parkes Moloney (Hume),"Rut they were won only after years of agitation and strenuous fighting on the part of those engaged in the various industries of Australia. Until then destitution and misery had been rampant and wide-spread. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) has told us that women and children employed in the clothing trade were forced to work for a miserable pittance under conditions that barely kept body and soul together. Some measure of relief was given to them by the provision of State tribunals. Unfortunately some States refused to set up any tribunals to remedy industrial evils. We have on record the words of persons who were largely responsible for that situation. The President of the Melbourne Shopkeepers Association, when giving evidence before the royal commission inquiring into the working of the first wages board, saidA great deal of sweating goes on, it is admitted, but this is beneficial to tlie nation. You cannot win a battle without killing a lot of men. That callous utterance was made in the bad old days, at the time the first wages board was established in Victoria to remedy industrial evils. On -the advent of federation, when the customs barriers between the States were demolished, the workers applied to the wages board for increased wages, but they were told that if their claim was granted the industry in which they were engaged would be ruined because of the resultant competition from New South Wales. A similar argument was used in respect of the claims of workers in New South Wales. It was really the existence of those conditions and the lack of uniformity in the agreements or awards made by State establishment of a Federal Arbitration Court. The first Commonwealth legislation was passed in 1904. The right honourable member for North( Mr Hughes) said, wisely and well, that the effect of the Government's policy will be to take us back to the old industrial conditions, the existence of which actually led to the establishment of federal arbitration. The late Mr Justice Higgins was the first president of the Federal Arbitration Court, and many years of successful arbitration followed his jurisMr Parker Moloney. diction. He laid down principles that protected not only the workers engaged in our various industries, but also the fair employer, from the competition of unscrupulous employers. He established H standard wage that would maintain a man and his family in reasonable comfort, living as a decent citizen in a civilized community, and for that act alone his memory will be kept green in our minds. It is that great system which this Government is out to destroy, and which this party and, I venture to say, the great majority of the people, are out to protect at all costs. The first question that must agitate the mind of the student of industrial affairs is whether arbitration has been a success. Until the meeting of the State Premiers, the Prime Minister had never said that the federal system of arbitration had failed. to the contrary. He had previously defended the system of arbitration. The Attorney-General also defended that principle, and pointed out that there were 150 employees' organizations, representing about 700,000 unionists, and 27 employers' organizations registered under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act; that the awards of the Federal Court totalled 149, one-third of which were arrived at by the mutual consent of the parties. The. important factor is that an overwhelming majority of the organizations registered under the act have worked peacefully. During 1905 and 1906, there was no strike or stoppage of work within the large field of industry committed to the care of the Federal Arbitration tribunals that led to the Court. From 1916 to 1919 there were but two disputes, one of which was the seamen's strike; and it is well to note that those disputes occurred in a period Sydney when prevailing war conditions altered the whole scheme of things. The facts concerning the manufacturing industries are remarkable. From 1917 to 1928 there were only three interstate disputes, which concerned the glass bottle industry, the railway workshops, and the building trades. The Government has contended that the number of disputes would diminr ish if the control of industriallegislation",37,Bhuce
77,Mr Theodore,His statements were,38,Bhuce
78,Mr Parker Moloney,"Yes.was left to the States. That is an astounding claim, and it appears to be the only excuse of the Government for the introduction of this drastic change. One crushing reply to that contention is to make a comparison of the number of disputes of a purely State nature with those of a federal character. In the year 19-27, there were 339 State disputes, of which 24 concerned the manufacturing industries. As against that there were but three disputes under the federal arbitration system between the years 1917 and 1928! Until recently, honourable members opposite not only did not claim that federal arbitration was a failure, they boldly declared that it was a pronounced success. It is interesting to note that during the period 1913 to 1923, the average time per annum lost by each worker through strikes, equalled only 1^ days. The statistics for the period 1923 to 1927 show that the time lost by each worker per annum was only four-fifths of a day. Those statistical facts demonstrate the great success that has attended the federal system of arbitration. A committee set up by the Commonwealth Government reported in 1924 that the average loss from unemployment for the period under review was 22.9 days per annum. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) pointed out, the days lost per unionist per annum in England as the result of strikes was nearly 18-J times greater than those lost for a similar reason in Australia. Those figures are not a figment of the imagination; they are statistical actualities that have not, and cannot, be denied, and they demonstrate irrefutably that federal arbitration has been a pronounced success. One seeks in vain for the reason why this Government was prompted to introduce this drastic change. Certainly it cannot be. because the existing system has been afailure. The facts are all against that. It would be very interesting to put the Attorney-General of a few months ago . into the box to answer the Attorney-General of to-day in this matter. The honourable gentleman has been freely quoted from both sides of the House, but I haye. here a statement that has-not yet been cited, one that will-surely rise in judgment and be used in condemnation of the honourable gentleman by the people of the country, who after all are the final arbiters. On one occasion, the present Attorney-General found himself at a smoke concert given by the Kew -Victoria-branc h of the National Federation, and I have here extracts of his recorded speech, in regard to a principle of which he was then . an ardent advocate. The honourable gentleman is reported to have saidAs to industrial relations, it is essential that there should be permanent industrial peace in order to obtain the greatest efliciency in primary and secondary production. The Arbitration Act had its defects, but it was working much better than many people gave it credit for. It was useless to talk about scrapping the Commonwealth's industrial legislation. and he concluded by sayingThe people of Australia would never tolerate tliat. I believe that the honourable gentleman still has that conviction. It was because of that that he carefully avoided making any reference to the subject when he was last before the electors. ... would not have tolerated that action then, but they would be glad to have it done now. the Attorney-General again appears before the electors his statements of the past will rise up like so many stubborn, unlaid ghosts, to his great discomfiture. The honourable gentleman declared that it was his considered opinion that the people of Australia would never tolerate the scrapping of the principle of federal arbitration. No doubt he was able to impress upon the mind of his leader that the people of Australia would oppose any such action, hence the reason for this mean, contemptible practice of going behind the backs of the people to do that which he is not prepared to submit to their decision. honourable member to withdraw the suggestion that an honourable gentleman was guilty of a mean and contemptible practice.

The honourable Minister said that the "" farmers of the community would soon settle a railway strike, if one occurred, and iu saying that he sets himself up as the violent advocate of direct action. I say, deliberately, that he does not represent the opinion of the farmers on this matter.

Does he seriously tell the members of this House that the farmers and pastoralists of Australia are in favour of the abolition of the Arbitration Court? Let me put the position, as one who represents a country constituency. It is not too much to say that before the advent of arbitration, there was not only incessant strife and turmoil in the pastoral industry, but sometimes bloodshed as well. Prom the time the Australian Workers Union was formed in 1886that great organization of 150,000 members, the largest in Australia-unti l the issue of the award in 1905, there was incessant strife and unrest in this industry. Yet, from the time the award was made up to the present date, there have been only two disputes in the pastoral industry. Those who say that the pastoralists of Australia want to revert to the bad old days do not voice the opinion of the pastoralists. The honourable member for Gwydir also does gravs injustice to the farmers of Australia in saying that they wish to revert to the days of cheap labour. The sensible farmer knows that the troubles which confront him are not due to higher wages. Very few-small farmers employ labour to any extent, and even those who do are fully aware that their chief troubles arise from high rates of interest, and the operation of opposed to. this bill. I go further, and middle-men and combines who exploit them in connection with everything they use on the land, including artificial manures, machinery, supplies, &c. Compared with these exactions, an increase of a few shillings in the workers' wages is comparatively insignificant. The pastoralists and farmers of Australia want peace in their industry, and they have got it under the Federal Arbitration Court. the present proposed change. what authority does the honourable member say that? president of the Federal Council of the Farmers and Settlers Association. that he represents the view of the majority of farmers, but even he damns the proposal with faint praise. The pastoralists did not ask for the change, and even the President of the Pastoralist's Association admits that the federal arbitration system has worked reasonably well. Hearing honourable members opposite, especially the Country party section, one might think that the man on the land was favorable to the Government's proposals. But surely his interests and those of the workers engaged in secondary industries are closely interrelated. The man on the land recognizes that a high standard of living among the workers in secondary industries means a greater spending power in the community, making it easier for him to sell his wheat, his potatoes, orhis onions. Let us ask ourselves who wants this change. I have shown that the pastoralist does not desire it. It cannot be that men engaged in business have asked for it, for the higher the standard of living among the consumers, the greater their turnover, and consequently the greater, their profits. No sensible business man wants this change. . The right honourable member for NorthSydney( Mr Hughes) said that 100 per cent, of the workers were say that anoverwhelming majority of",40,Bhuce

The Australian Natives Association, which is representative of a large section of the community, recently passed the following resolution:That the Australian Natives' Association protests against the proposed repeal by the Federal Government of some of tlie Commonwealth legislation with respect to conciliation and arbitration, being of opinion that in the best interests of the people of Australia fuller rather than restricted Commonwealth powers should be obtained. The President of the Association, speaking to the resolution, saidAlthough the Federal Government might feel that the position, in consequence of certain happenings, was not an ideal one, nevertheless there was a clear mandate from the people that the Commonwealth should, by its legislation for arbitration and conciliation, f u l ly exercise the powers given to it under the Australian constitution. The association viewed with grave apprehension the proposal to surrender to the States the exercise of industrial control and legislation, and it was considered that the Commonwealth Government should place the whole position frankly before the people of the Commonwealth with a view to obtaining the necessary powers to enable it to control industry. That resolution is typical of the opinion of the great bulk of people outside this chamber. It is not alone the opinion of the workers, for among manufacturers there is only a small minority in favour of the bill; and that minority is composed of men who are always opposed to anything which might lead to an increase in wages. The competition among our manufacturers Many of them have not forgotten the days when border duties' were in operation; they do not want to get back to the conditions which existed then. members can visualize the chaos that would be caused in industry if manufacturers in Sydney, working under 44 hours a week and paying high wages, had to compete with manufacturers in Melbourne if the working hours were longer and the wages lower. It was because of the chaos that existed in industry in the early days of federation that pressure was put upon to bring about a system which' would ensure uniformity; Now the Government would put back the hands of the clock, Mr Parker Moloney. and revert to the conditions which existed Numin pre-federation days. The dislocation of industry which would result from the abolition of the Eederal Arbitration Court would not be confined to manufacturers in the capital cities, some hundreds of miles apart. Let us consider the effect of these proposals in two border towns. Let us imagine that in the woollen industry at Albury certain rates of wages and conditions of labour apply, and that across the border, say, at Wangaratta, another woollen mill is operating under an entirely different set of conditions; Can the result be other than chaotic? The manufacturers of this country do not wish such conditions thrust upon them. If the adoption of the Government's proposals will so seriously affect interstate trade, with how much greater force can it be said that overseas trade will be affected. Should my statement that the Government is acting under instructions from the outside bodies to which. I have referred be challenged, I ask from what quarter have those instructions come? The Prime Minister did not say that, in submitting these proposals, the Government was acting in the interests of only one section of the community; he said that the bill was introduced in order to prevent overlapping. Last year, the Government introduced an amendment to the Arbitration Act to avoid overlapping, and its introduction was based upon the. decision of the court in the Clyde Engineering Company's case. The decision of the judge in that is largely interstate. case made it clear that where Eederal and State awards clash, the federal award prevails. In .that decision there is a complete answer to those who complain of the Honourable overlapping of awards. Last night when the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr : Maxwell) was speaking, the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) interjected that now there were seven clashing tribunals-si x in the States and one in the Commonwealth. That was an entirely erroneous statement. In all interstate disputes, there is only one tribunal, for, as I have said, when State and Comparliamentarians r monwealth tribunals clash, the latter prevails. . There is now only one deciding authority; but this bill will, set up six authorities. The Minister for Home Affairs( Mr though, as I have suggested, he might Abbott) said that the workers had not obeyed federal awards. He would have us believe that they would be entirely obedient to the State awards. What authority has he for that assumption? A3sumi7ig that the Government is sincere iu respect of State tribunals-althoug h there is no' certainty that State tribunals will bo set up-wha t assurance has it that unionists throughout Australia will be more willing to obey the awards of State tribunals than those of a federal tribunal ? Is there any reason why they should obey a State tribunal and disobey a federal tribunal? That is a line of reasoning that only honourable members opposite are capable of taking. The honorhill) quoted a number of statements, which he attributed to members of trade unions, in an endeavour to prove that the Labour party was opposed to Federal Arbitration. only parts of the various statements were read. If the honourable members who quoted similar opinions honest, they would have admitted that it was the Arbitration Oourt and not the principle of arbitration which was generally under discussion. None of us suggests that the Arbitration Court is perfect; but we hope to improve it. The persons whose remarks have been quoted by the Attorney-General, and other honourable members opposite, complained principally"" of the making of partisan appointments to the Arbitration Court Bench, the loss of time in securing awards and the penal provisions of the act. We all remember that a little while ago this Government did an unprecedented thing in appointing the president of the National Federation to the Arbitration Court Bench. Quite properly that appointment raised a storm of objections. It was amusing to listen to the Attorneyare fond of saying that members General quoting from the Communistic Pan-Pacific Worker, with the object of proving that the the Labour party was opposed to the principle bf arbitration. He seemed to forget that he himself had now adopted the view which he ascribed to the communists. yet been able to discover the reason why the Attorney-General quoted so extensively from the Pan-Pacific Worker, have read the newspaper through and allowed that to represent his own present changed view upon arbitration. A good deal has been said about the mandate given to the Government by the people at the last election. Not a word in the Prime Minister's policy speech, nor in any of the speeches which he delivered during the election, suggested that anything of the kind was contemplated. The right honourable gentleman travelled from one end of my electorate to the other, and I read the reports of many speeches which he delivered. In not one of them was there a suggestion that any action of this sort would be taken. The slogan of the Government was, "" We shall maintain law and order,"" and on every platform Government candidates promised that if the Government were returned to power it would tighten up our arbitration court machinery. But As a matter of fact it apparently intends to tear the act into little pieces, and throw them to the four winds of heaven. had been The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), made some enlightening remarks last night about certain telegrams which the Prime Minister despatched to his followers, after he made his declaration to the Premiers Conference that the Government would abandon the field of Commonwealth Arbitration. That these telegrams were despatched in the circumstances stated has not been denied; and that honourable members opposite, with two or three exceptions, accepted the decision of the Prime Minister on this subject, shows that they have not the vestige of a mind of their own. The Prime Minister did not ask the members of his party whether they were willing for him to take this action. He simply told them that he had taken it. He acted and then condescended to consult them. Honourable members opposite of the Labour party are caucus bound; but we have never had a leader who has treated his followers in that fashion. The Prime Minister evidently knows the kind of followers he has. All he has to do is to say, "" I have I have not done so and so. Come here and bow down. Do exactly as I want you to do."" The followers of the Government, with a few exceptions, are mere marionettes.",41,Bhuce
101,Able Member For Warringah ( Mr Park,"This step is the most retrograde and anti-federal that any Commonwealth Government has ever taken. Mention has been made, during this debate, of the leaders of other days, such as Sir Edmund Barton and Mr Deakin. The action of this Government in connection with industrial arbitration is enough to make these men turn in their graves. Although they did not subscribe to the policy of the Labour party when they were members of this Parliament, they at least were sound Australians. Compared with the authors of this' proposition they appear as a As has been well said during this discussion, if this retrogressive step is taken it will reduce the National Parliament to the level of-a legislative council. Such language is not extreme. When the Prime Minister threatened his supporters with an early election if they did notagree to the passage of this bill he adopted a cowardly course; but it was not resented by his servile followers. However, the right honourable member will not force an election over this issue. I believe that if the majority of honourable members opposite were allowed to express their own opinions on this measure they would vote against it ; but the bill has been forced upon them. It is some satisfaction to us to know that the great majority of the people of, Australia are sound on the principle of federation. If the Government dared to make this an issue at an election, it would be swept from oflice. The people would express in no uncertain way their opinion of a government which shirked its responsibilities in this fashion. surer) [8.40] -The most important issue that can be discussed in the National Parliament of this or any other country is the means by which continuity of employment and good wages may be maintained. Prom the beginning of history, mankind has been seeking to fashion some social organization which will ensure continuity of employment and satisfactory working conditions. It has never been content with past achievements, but has continually sought after improvements. With the object of achieving the desired end, different forms of government have been set up from time to time. These have not been an end in themselves, but merely a means to an end. In Australia we have formed a Commonwealth Government under a federal constitution for this end. A federal arbitration court had been made possible only by a short clause inserted at the tail end of the Constitution as a kind of afterthought. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) said that if the bill abolishing that court were agreed to the. National Parliament would be reduced to someTriton among the minnows. thing less than a shire council, and the whole reason for federation would be destroyed. The right honourable member seemed to have forgotten that the Commonwealth Constitution was fashioned after twenty years of earnest thought by the best brains of the nation. The subject of industrial arbitration was not in the minds of these men when they drafted its original provisions or conceived the federal idea. How the removal of this small part of the federal function, which originally was not embodied in the Constitution, does away with the main reason for federation, passes comprehension. Surely the right honourable member was guilty of extravagant language. Arbitration systems are not an end in themselves, but a means to an end. As one means of securing continuity of employment and good wages, Australia set up her Commonwealth Arbitration Court. This also was simply a means to an end. If we find that the ends which we are seeking, namely, continuity of employment and good wages, cannot be secured by this means, we are in duty boundto seek some other means of attaining them. The consideration of whether this is or is not the best means of achieving our objective should be approached in the most detached and impartial manner possible, for the question is economic rather than political. The subject should certainly be considered apart from any considerations of party prejudice and passion. But the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore), reduced the discussion to the plane of party prejudice and passion. He made certain vile' insinuations as to the motives of the:",43,Bhuce

He talked about wage slaves and potential sweaters in a way that would have disgraced a Domain meeting. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) also attempted to create an atmosphere of venom aud spite, and showed personal malice against the Prime Minister which was totally unwarranted. He suggested that because the Prime Minister made what he termed a mistake in regard to a certain prosecution that was launched, he was willing to reduce the whole industrial life of Australia to a state of chaos to cover his tracks. Such a statement will not be believed by a single responsible citizen of Australia, much less by any honourable member of this chamber. It will be laughed to scorn, as it deserves to be. We are asked to consider the regulation of industrya subject that touches the brain and heart of industry-in an atmosphere that has been befouled in this way. How could a major surgical operation be conducted under such conditions as . that ? The surgeon might easily find himself operating on the wrong part of the patient's body, or even on the wrong patient. The Opposition is endeavouring to cloud the issue, by making honourable members imagine that they are called upon to give a decision on a matter that is not really before them. That is the attitude of the so-called leaders of labour, who, in this particular instance, and during the last five or six years, at the very least, have been leading industry in Australia to destruction, and have brought forward no constructive proposals that will help its progress. These actions demonstrate the undoubted proof of Gomper's dictum that industrial problems are 99 per cent, economic, and only 1 per cent, political, and that they ought to be entirely divorced from politics. It was interesting to read in the cable news from the Old World yesterday a statement by Mr Ben Tillett, a noted Labour man for many years, and a great agitator, who now considers that the time has come to.organize industries economically in order to bring into being a constructive leadership that will direct the people into paths of greater prosperity, enable them to look at periods of temporary depression with equanimity, and increase the agree that if we wish for progress there ' must be some constructive leadership of this nature to bring harmony instead of to increase discord, to attract new capital to industry rather than to drive it away, and to eliminate overlapping in the control of industry. Everybody must agree that such a system would increase production and the effective wages of the people. The Government's present action, like its past policy, aims at a constructive leadership of that kind. It recognizes obligations of industry, and desires full use to be made of its opportunities in this country. The Government is trying to emphasize the points that the different parties to industry have in common, and not the points in which their interests are opposed. Its action, as I shall show later, will tend towards uniformity of basic wage awards throughout Australia; it will remove the expense now borne both by unions and employers in policing awards; it will stabilize industrial conditions ; it will encourage the advent of new capital, and it will completely divorce the Eederal Parliament from the continual contemplation of industri.il problems that prevent it from giving due attention to the developmental, social, national and international matters'that claim its consideration. Its action will also result in greater continuity of employment, increased production, and more effective wages. The first step is to transfer control of industrial regulations from the federal sphere, where it is necessarily incomplete, owing to constitutional limitations, to the State sphere, where it is complete. The Opposition is trying to misrepresent the true issue before the Parliament. The real issue is between single State control and a dual State and Eederal control, the Federal control being handicapped by the constitutional limitations that have been fully described by the Attorney-General. To consider the issue in its true light, it seems essential that what is not the issue should be clearly stated, so that we may see exactly what we now have to decide. The issue before us is. not-' between arbitration and no arbitration. It is not between the regulation of industry and no reguthe electors of the State Parliaments were lation of industry, because every State aliens, with a base standard of conduct, has its system of industrial regulation. and people who, if they had complete conPour of the States have arbitratrol of industrial arbitration, would give tion systems that are almost identhe workers something different from the tical in form with that of the Commontreatment received from the Pederal Parwealth. Two other States have systems liament. which the people of those States regard travesty of the truth? Not one person with greater pride, possibly, than that in Australia outside this Parliament will with which the other States look upon believe that there is the slightest truth in their particular systems. The statements that contention. made by the so-called leaders of Labour that the actions of. the Government will before the Parliament is not an deprive the workers of all protection attack on wages. It has been said that are an insult to the intelligence of the this bill constitutes an attempt to reduce workers of Australia, more than one-half wages. That is also an insult to the of whom are working under awards of intelligence of the workers, because, State tribunals, and not under federal as I have said, there are more men awards. There are now between 500,000> satisfactorily employed under State and 600,000 men working under State awards than under federal awards. Even arbitration awards. Altogether, there are in those cases where they have the oppor420,000 men and women who belong to tunity of obtaining awards from either unions that have federal The Statistician is sure that 110,000 of we find that they frequently prefer these are working under federal awards the latter. and the remainder of them are probably awards in operation in Australia,, under State awards; but, even supposing and only 26 of them are availed of the whole of them were working under in Queensland. Why is that ? If federal federal awards, the proportion would be awards were more favorable, is it about 6 to 4 under State as against imagined that there would be only 78 of federal awards. Yet, honourable members them in operation in South Ausopposite try to gull the people that tralia, 90 ' in New South Wales, 117 the proposal of this Government is an in Victoria, and 61 in Tasmania?

In New South Wales in 1919-20, when the federal basic wage was £3 7s., the State award was £3 17s. When we examine the position of the outside organizations of industrialists, we find that their great fear is that any attack on wages will come from the Federal Court, and not from the State Courts. The New South Wales Labour Council, and the Australian Labour party, in 1928, when the Arbitration Bill was being discussed in this Parliament, issued a joint manifesto, in the following terms:There can be no question that the bill is deliberately drafted to skittle the awards obto them by means of a referendum. The tained by the workers in State Courts, estabright honourable member for North Sydlished by Labour Governments. Yet members opposite, have the impudence to tell the Government that it is trying to reduce wages by sending the workers to the State Courts! Statements such as that I have just read show that the so-called leaders of Labour have no warrant from the unions for their statements. In the last six or seven months, we have had the timber workers trying to escape from the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, and obtain a State award. A similar position has arisen in the shearing industry in Queensland. In New South Wales, the State award for shearers is 4s. higher than the federal award. How can it.then be said that the Government is proposing to transfer industrial control from the Federal to the State sphere, in-order to bring about' a reduction in wages? A reduction in wages of itself would not increase the prosperity of the country. Prosperity can be brought about only by increasing the production of the country, and that is the object of the measure by making it possible to increase the volume of production without increasing costs. Passing to my next point, the issue is not State arbitration or Federal arbitration. That was the issue in 1926, when the Government brought down a measure to obtain from the people complete control of industry by the National Parliament. That measure was agreed toalmost unanimously by the Parliament, and the Government appealed to the people for an amendment of the Constitution. Everybody knows why that referendum was defeated; it was because -men like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) formed the industrialist section and became the campaign directors for the ""Noes."" Although all members of this House were satisfied that the Government had adopted the right course in seeking ful l federal powers, only two or three honourable members opposite had the courage to say on the platform, what they had said in Parliament. The others were forced to be silent, and they broke the heart of their then leader, who is now living in retirement. It has been suggested that it is quite easy to get the people to agree to proposals submitted ney ( Mr Hughes) said it was only necessary to keep on submitting a proposal to the people in that way, because finally they would become so sick of it that they would agree to it. He tried to show that the people were being gradually educated to the opinion that the Commonwealth should have complete control in the sphere of arbitration. But what do the figures indicate? At the second last referendum, it was defeated by one per cent., and at the last referendum it was defeated by 13 per cent., so the people are apparently being educated backwards. Even when there was almost unanimity among the various political parties. in Australia, we found that it would be almost a super-human task to carry a referendum in favour of granting increased powers to the Commonwealth. Take the agreement between the States and the Commonwealth for the provision of a sinking fund and the consolidation of the State debts. Everybody in Australia believed that that was an excellent proposal ; yet what took place ? One would expect no objection to be raised by the people; but practically 700,000 electors voted against it, although all parties in Parliament and the country supported it . When the proposal was submitted to the State Premiers that State industrial powers should be handed over to the Commonwealth, the Labour Premier of Western Australia ( Mr Collier) immediately said that .he would not support a proposal to give complete industrial powers to the Federal Parliament. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) was Leader of the Govermnent in Queensland, he subsidized, from Government funds, an attempt to prevent State instrumentalities in Queensdefinite opinions on that matter, and exland from being brought under the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court. I take it that that is still the position which he occupies. tation. fact. I can prove it by giving the actual to problems connected with developdate and the comments of the Auditorment and the amelioration of our social General. The expenditure amounted to conditions.

There have been continued efforts to promote strife, wrangling, and discord in the community. Everybody must agree that duplication is one of the most potent causes of conflict and discord. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes) was Prime Ministeri n 1922. The Governor General's Speech at the opening of Parliament in that year contained the following passage:Action will be taken to put an end to the clashing jurisdictions, conflicting and overlapping awards, uncertainty, delay, expense, loss, and other unsatisfactory features of the present machinery for dealing with industrial disputes. The late Mr Justice Higgins, whom many towards production. A t the honourable members opposite have eulogized during this debate, is credited with the following statement:It is a grievous wrong to those who have the responsibility of carrying on business undertakings that they should have to obey at the same time, on the same subject, two distinct authorities-Stat e and Federal. If there is to be regulation, and there must be, it should come from one authority. In 1924, the following statement was made by the late Mr Justice McCawley, president of the Queensland Court of In dustrial ArbitrationEmployers justly object to a system, which permits employees to chop and change between Federal and State Courts. I could quote similar extracts from the to gain political power. pronouncements of every public man, who has spoken on this matter in Ausrather than tralia, no matter where he stood in poliProfessor tics.

Does any person in his heart believe that by such means the workers of Australia will ever be led to the promised land, or that the millenium will be hastened? In Russia there is a Soviet republic, organized and run by the workers. It has issued many decrees, one of the early examples of which deals with strikes in essential services. If any man who is employed in waterworks, electric light works, or other essential service, should go on strike, the punishment meted out to him is death. That they have not receded from that position is proved by the fact that that law still stands. On the 6th March, 1929, the Soviet Government promulgated a decree to deal with action such as that which has been taken in Australia by those who are inciting the timber workers to defy the law. That decree lays upon unions the onus of disciplining their members and of preventing acts of violence such as those for which the basher gangs in Australia have been responsible. The Soviet Government realizes that production must be increased and its cost reduced, because that is the only way in which the effective value of wages can be maintained. Yet here in a capitalistic state we' are asked to tolerate a system for which the leaders of a workers' republic will not stand! Honourable members of the Opposition have not the courage to denounce the . destructive propaganda that is being carried on in Australia. It is worthwhile examining at some length the timber workers' award. The history of that award makes the most depressing story that industry has yet faced in Australia, and is a poor advertisement of Australia in other countries. For many years the timber industry has been in a depressed condition. Every year as a result of modern invenOr. Earle Page. the attempt that tion more substitutes for timber have been placed on the market. The increased size of buildings and the necessity to Every labour organ preaches give protection against loss by fire led to steel and concrete being more largely used in the construction of houses and buildings generally. The use of timber became less as the years went on, and it was necessary to go further into the bush to obtain supplies, which com try came under the notice of the Oommonwealth Arbitration Court. That court decided that it was declining, and that efforts should be made to revive it. After an inquiry lasting many months an award was made which, it was hoped, would improve the condition of the industry. Although the weekly number of hours was increased, the wages also were raised. fact. In New South Wales the increase amounted to 5s. a week. The timber workers were badly advised by their leaders to strike against the award. The employees in bush mills had been working 48 hours a week for eight or nine years When the pampered darlings of the trades hall in the city were asked to work the same number of hours as those poor fellows in the bush, they said"" Go on strike and we will stand behind you."" Later, when they were told that they would have to comply with the law, Jock Garden replied, "" Still they tell you to stand up to the law. If that is the law I say to hell with it "" . Senator Rae, a member of the Labour party who was returned at the last election as a member of the Senate as a Labour candidate said of the federal arbitration law, "" It was a law made to be broken. Workers should consider it a duty to break it . "" That is the way in which members of the Labour party consider this question. Instead of denouncing the men who are flagrantly breaking the awards'of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, they merely refer to the withdrawal of the prosecution against John Brown, which was done by the Prime Minister in a generous spirited effort to settle the coal difficulty and without dissent by miners representatives who were urging a conference.

During the six and a half years which the Government has been in office, the members of the Labour party have openly assisted the seamen, the waterside workers and the timber workers to defy the awards of the Arbitration Court. When a genuine trade unionist is anxious to work under the court's award he is regarded as a most contemptible person, and is persecuted in every possible way. These people have the utmost contempt for those who wish to observe the awards of the court. Although the leaders of labour have continually stated that the men engaged in the timber industry are not receiving sufficient remuneration for the work they do, they actually reduce the earning3 of other unionists by forcing them to pay a weekly levy to assist the timber workers who are out on strike against au award of the Arbitration Court, which they say they wish to maintain. They are instrumental in reducing the wages of certain workers in order to fight aii award of a court from which they are receiving considerable benefits. Even the police who are performing their duty are denounced and their numbers are taken so that they can be persecuted later, if Labour gets back to power. In stead of the improvement of the conditions in industry their main objective appears to be to disrupt society. What are the facts? These men are trying to destroy, not merely the timber workers' award, but the whole fabric of our arbitration system. Mr Jock Garden, the secretary of the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney, saidThe class significance of the Arbitration Court is gradually being realized by the workers and they are gradually throwing off interjection by the honourable member for tlie stultifying and doping effects of the Echuca( MrH ill ) . court.

""When exception was taken to my remarks by the honourable member for Cook( Mr Riley) I was about to read the following statement made by Senator Rae:THE CURSE OP COMPULSORY ARBITRATION. Perhaps the most disastrous effect of the arbitration system is that it has a direct tendency to keep the worker standing still while the rest of the universe is constantly changing. When any legal system condemns the huge majority to a condition of stagnation . . . what must be the consequence? Clearly the choice lies between rebellion and slavery. What organized labour has gained from arbitration in numerical strength it more than lost in average quality of unionists it created. It is impossible to estimate the moral hood of the United States of America, in harm which has been done to the Australian working classes by this hasty and ill-considered acceptance of arbitration as a solution of Labour's problems. agree with that? of the chamber, stand for arbitration, whereas honourable members opposite, who assert that they favour compulsory arbitration, subscribe to such utterances by men whom they and their supporters return to Parliament. order. The Treasurer has quoted a statement by a member of another place with which he says honourable members on this side of the chumber agree. I object to that assertion. It is a slander upon me, personally, and I ask the Treasurer to withdraw it. is offensive to the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) I withdraw it. Here is one type of leadership pursuing a material objective with the savage methods of the beast, stirring up the primitive fighting passions of the people into a frenzy of destruction, the result of which can' only be to reduce wages and lessen employment. The object seems to be to depress labour, discourage enterprise and forethought, prevent the accumulation of capital, encourage recklessness and extravagance, and ultimately to ruin industry. We require constructive leadership which will increase wages and bring about continuous employment. Honourable members opposite seem to forget that plentiful and cheap capital is the life blood of industry, and the vitalizing stream that brings back unemployed labour into full activity. A wise labour policy should be devoted to the fostering of thrift and of investment, strengthening of the sense of security and the accumulation of capital. If capital is plentiful and cheap, labour will be dear. On the other hand if labour is plentiful and capital scarce, labour will be cheap. Every trade unionist should be advised to save and to use his funds for the purpose of purchasing shares in the business in which he is engaged, instead of using them for the destruction of the business and ruin of the country. Mr Warren Stone, president of the Railway Men's Brotherthe World's Work in 1924, said that organized labour in America had gone through three stages of evolution. The first was the period in which class consciousness was aroused, when it Was necessary to evolve a sense of solidarity before there could be any effort towards better wages and working conditions. The second was the struggle for collective bargaining, involving the use of force, sometimes economic and sometimes physical, on both sides. The third lay in constructive development and co-operation rather than war. The most striking evidence of this was in labour banks and co-operative profit-sharing by employees in the United States of America to-day. In that country they are saving for the control of industry, and not for fighting purposes. In the Philadelphia Transport Company, for instance, in the course of a few years the men have increased their wages considerably, in addition to their dividends. with the bill? leadership of industry in Australia. From January, 1922, to February, 1924, the workers in this company alone received 120,000 shares, worth £800,000, or one-fifth of the entire stock. By February, 1925, 11,000 employees owned £2,000,000",51,Bhuce

As a result of this financial interest in and control of their own company the men have a system of increasing their own wages according to the length of time they have been on the job. For instance, surface motor men and conductors increased their earnings after three months from 60 cents per hour to 63 cents, and after one year to 65 cents: This is what the employees are doing in the United States of America, and we contend that it is time the unionists of Australia did the same. The coal industry in Australia has been held up for many months, and tlie amount lost, in wages would have been sumcient to buy a couple of the collieries. ' Professor Carver, a noted economist, has pointed out that in ten years the workers could be one of the dominating financial factors of the world, if they invested their savings for this purpose. Such a progressive and constructive leadership is what the Commonwealth Government has been aiming at during the whole period of its existence. It has been said by. Labour members opposite that the industrial legislation introduced by this Government has brought about industrial unrest; but when this measure is introduced for its repeal .we are told industrial disputes have been less under this Government than ever before. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. When they attacked the Arbitration Act they said it caused industrial unrest; when we proceed to repeal it they say that it has lessened strikes and disputes. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) said that up to 1920 the average time lost per working man was 1.6 days, and from 1924 to 1928 seventenths of a clay. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) tried to show that industry in Australia was more peaceful under federal arbitration for the last four years than ever before. The Sydney Worher, issued on the 24th August last, statesAccording to figures prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician and otlier authorities, the average time lost each year, by eaoh worker over the age of twenty during the period from 1013 to 1923, was one day and a half. Between 1923 and 1927 (the last year of completed statistics) the time lost per worker annually decreased to eight-tenths of a day. Between 1913 and 1927 about one-third of the total number of strikes lasted not more than one day. Last year the Labour Opposition tried to make out that this Government's arbitration legislation had produced industrial unrest. Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot tell us in one breath that under the administration of this Government the number of strikes and disputes has diminished and in the next breath that our tampering with the arbitration system has brought about industrial unrest and chaos. When this Government first came into office and during the past three years, we carried out a constructive policy, and dealt with questions such as the amalgamation of tax collection, the provision of sinking funds, and rural credits under the Commonwealth Bank. We brought into being numerous progressive and constructive works. During that time the personnel, legislation, and procedure of the Pederal Arbitration Court remained unaltered. Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, the seamen's strike took place. It was a strike against an award of the court. The Seamen's Union deliberately had itself deregistered, and in this House the Labour party challenged the Government to go to the country to a fight to decide the methods by which we should secure industrial peace. Until then .the industrial law had not been amended, so it could not havo been any tampering with that legislation on the part of the Government which altered the position. Since that dispute took place we have tried to improve the position. In 1926 we tried to secure jjower to abolish duplication of awards by means of the referendum. I have already dealt with that subject, so there is no need for. me to say more about the lamentable spectacle which honourable members opposite presented at that time. Failing constitutional amendment if we are to eliminate dual control, we must take the action proposed under the bill. Everybody knows' that duplication of control is oppressive and harmful. Some say that there should be complete federal control. I admit that that has many advantages, but when the Government put the position before the country those advantages, apparently, did not weigh sufficiently in the minds of the people to cause them to accept the referendum. present more unionists working under State awards than under Federal awards. The United States of America operate I heir industrial affairs without any federal control. The existence of State Governmental activities, which are ever increasing, and which the honorahle member for Dalley says should be entirely under the control of the State Governments, makes it practically impossible to abolish duplication if the Federal Government remains in the field of arbitration. for Dalley also stated that more time is lost through unemployment than through strikes. Surely that emphasizes the necessity to have one parliament dealing exclusively with national problems and the proper development of this country and not overwhelmed by the intrusion of industrial that whoever handles industrial arbitration should have complete control. The Federal Parliament has not complete power, and cannot get it. Governments have complete power and will measure is passed. argument that might seem to have weight against the Federal Government evacuating the field of arbitration and transferring the control to the States, and that is that there might be less uniformity as regards the basic wage. That seemed to be a valid argument until I examined the figures. I then found that the federal arbitration system had brought into the industrial field, not uniformity, but added confusion and chaos. I found that there is actually less difference between the basic wage rates propounded by the State tribunals in. the various States at any given time than there is between the federal in the same localities. For instance, at the middle of 1926 the States, independently, and acts of Parliament, almost uniform basic wage of about £4 5s., whereas federal rates about that time ranged between £4 2s. 6d and £4 12s. 6d. in different places under a rigid system of index figures. In May of this year the range of federal rates all over Australia was from £4 2s. to £4 13s, Dr. Earle Page. whereas State rates were within 3s. of There are at each other. That is to say economic pressure and competition brought the rates closer together than the Federal Court did. On the 1st August the federal basic wage was, in Sydney, £4 14s. 6d., Brisbane £4 Os. 6d., Adelaide £4 Ss. 6d., Perth, £4 6s. 6d., and Hobart £4 5s. 6d., while the State basic wage rates were-Ne w South Wales, £4 5s., plus endowment, South Australia, £4 5s. 6d., Queensland, £4 5s., and in Western Australia £4 7s. Therefore, there can be no real The honourable member claim on the part of the Opposition for increased uniformity of rates as the result of federal arbitration. Another argument used by the Opposition was that federal control had always improved the condition of the workers, but that is disproved by the fact that in problems. It is clear Queensland the Federal Shearing Award is not being observed; the shearers prefer to work under the State award. In New South Wales .the shearing rate is 4s. The State more than that prescribed under the Commonwealth award. In addition, the hours have sole power when this prescribed by the Parliament of that State are 44 per week, whereas in federal There is only one industries the hours are 48. The Labour party has repeatedly admitted the futility of the Federal Court, and it has attacked in turn every judge of that court. At present honourable members opposite have no wholehearted support for the court as constituted. They say that it should be a business-like council, something on the lines of the Industrial Peace Council controlling the coal industry, yet the fact remains that, despite the operation of that council, there has been more industrial unrest in the coal industry than in any other industry in Australia. That i? not a very good advertisement for the alternative suggested by the Opposition. basic rates operating The issue resolves itself into single or dual control. Dual control adds a disturbing factor, and if there is one thing by fixed tribunals we want to do more than another it is to had an keep industry free from industrial turmoil and harm. The existing overlapping of awards gives the Communists, an opportunity to cause paralysis to the community, and to manufacture the poison with which they propose to kill the existing social system. A single authority would force the extremists into the open, and in that way their activities could he considerably curtailed. T?iOvision has been made for continuing satisfactory agreements after the repeal of the federal law. Mr Bavin, the Premier of New South ""Wales, is already dealing with this subject, and Mr Moore, the Premier of Queensland, has convened a meeting of Premiers to discuss it. The present State legislation tends to assist collective bargaining, so there would be no danger in transferring to the States the f u l l power of arbitration. The State Parliament is under the control of the same electors as the Commonwealth, and is more responsive to them. The external trade and commerce in the federal sphere is only a fraction of the whole, while that of the States is much larger, and is under their sole control in all its aspects. The last argument used by the honorbitration system. The Labour agitators able member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) have led the workers rashly and have and also the right honourable member for allowed themselves to become destructive North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was that rather than constructive leaders. the Arbitration Court, because of some 25 years of operation, should remain untouched.

An unbiased observer must admit the sound? ness of the Government's action. The Leaders of the Labour party have abdicated their position of industrial leadership in Australia.

Let us not forget that there are other men in this chamber who assailed the Prime Minister until they also received from him favorable consideration that changed their opinions. They assailed the Prime Minister until the Government put something into their hands and converted them. Do not let us forget, too, that when the late Prime Minister, the right honourable W. M . Hughes, was in London and Paris, "" These contempa couple of honourable gentlemen who are now sitting on the front Treasury bench, were prepared to lick his spittle to gain the favours that he bestowed upon them. Yet now they have the impudence to attack honourable members on this side, and to designate them as miserable and contemptible ignoramuses. Far better is it to be ignorant than to be cultured, educated, talented, and to sell one's talents I ask any honourable member, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, who listened to the Treasurer to-night, whether he can honestly say that this posing statesman, with his jackdaw-like strutting upon the stage of politics, said one word that tended to raise the tone of the debate.. Is not the poorest, meanest man on this side of the House as well fitted as he to occupy the position which he holds? Certainly none could disgrace it more than he does.

Metaphorically speaking, he visited China, Russia, England, the United States* of America, and other parts of the vast universe, in an endeavour to pick up phrases uttered by some obscure individual, that he might use them to cast a reflection upon the character, and the public conduct of men who, whatever their shortcomings, are nevertheless the representatives of the majority of the people in their constituencies-me n who are Australians, elected by Australians, and representatives of Australians. The Treasurer had the audacity, the impudence, and the unblushing shamelessness to endeavour to make those honourable members responsible in the public view for something said or done by men thousands of miles away.

That would be a gratification to me. Even in my own constituency there are thousands of weaklings, the recipients of benefits from unions who, under the arbitration law, inaugurated by the Eederal Parliament, were brought within the fold of unionism; they paid their dues into its coffers, not because of inspiration, or of their faith in unionism, but because inconsistency. What is their justification of what it guaranteed to them in the way of insurance of better wages and conditions. Thousands of such people, who to-day belong to unions, march behind and fight for nationalist candidates. When this bill becomes law and the existing privileges are swept away they will change their opinions. This measure cannot weaken my position, or that of any Labour member in this country.

As the passage of this measure will strengthen the position of every man on this side, so it will correspondingly weaken the position of honourable members opposite. This action of the Government will be the rallying point, and will give impetus to the ultimate triumph of the Labour party in this House. Eichmond( Mr E. Green), asks why, if what I say is true, we do not let the Go[23] vernment have its way. It is because we do not view fhe position from the point of view of political expediency. This action of the Government will cast hundreds of thousands of the present generation back to the wilderness, and they will and travail that their fathers suffered before them. In suffering, they will come to understand the great advantages of unionism, and so will become a rejuvenated, and inspiring force. What they field of industry, they will more than regain when they triumph in the field of politics. They will be able, by virtue of their being endued with the power of government, to attain greater privileges than even tlieir predecessors enjoyed. It is questionable, apart from the possible triumphs of to-morrow, how far honourable members opposite can justify their adherence to the policy of political tor supporting legislation which will meaD intense suffering and the destruction of many of the weaker industrial organizations ih Australia ? To the most militantand forceful industrial organizations the action of the Government means nothing. To those who for the most part follow nomadic and spasmodic occupations, whose life is a constant transition between employment and unemployment, strikes do not mean anything more than a period of ordinary unemployment, such as is frequently imposed on them by the vaployers. But to the great body of men and women, who have only the shelter of a union to protect them from victimization, who have grown up under the shadow of this law, it will mean, in many tions. It is for that purpose that the Government initiated the measure, and for that reason that this party cannot ally itself with the Government in the matter. This country has passed through an era of non-organization of labour, of laissez [aire-som e say more lazy than fair.

And so they built up, in this country, a national system of industry, which corresponded with the national organizations of labour. They also built up a national system of arbitration, its faults few, its virtues many. The proof of that is that nine-tenths of these organized working men and women of Australia have lived for many years in peace and contentment within the shadow of the law. honourable member for Richmond( Mr law. Green), not even his colleagues, would hold such an opinion. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, know that my contention is true. Even the members sitting on the Government bench know that nine-tenths of the organized working men and women registered under the arbitration laws of the country have lived for many years in peace and contentment, and in conformity with the law. No one but the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) would deny that. The fact remains that only a small section of the workers-and that a section which would be rebellious if there was no law-is in favour of the abolition of arbitration. The absurdity of the position is that the Government proposes to sweep from beneath the sheltering wing of this law nine-tenths of the workmen who have lived in peace and harmony under it. The only people to whom the Government proposes to preserve the benefits of arbitration are those whom it cannot control. Speaking the other night, the Attorney-General said that the laws of the Oommonwealth had been effective in preserving peace on the waterfront. Having set up effective instrumentalities by which peace has been secured, the Government now proposes to abolish them. We all know that peace on the waterfront and elsewhere has been preserved as peace is preserved between nations. When men or nations are beaten and driven into the earth, there is peace. Men who are beaten are peaceful for a time, but eventually they will gird up their loins and get strength once more into their vitals. Those whp have beaten them may say, "" There is peace; they cannot fight."" But how absurd it is for the Government to say that, because men are beaten down to the earth, not by.force of the law, but .by the forces of hunger and destitution, resulting from unemployment, all is well! That was the condition of affairs 30, 40 or 50 years ago. In 1893 the shipowners took £2 a month from the pay of the seamen. Por a time they had not even a crust of bread. But later they rose as from the mire, and pitted blood against. blood, sinew against sinew, muscle against muscle. Men who are crushed to the earth to-day will rise again to-morrow. And the day will come when the men on the waterfront will rise again despite this This bill is not designed to secure peace. It is a pretence and a sham; and it will fail. I propose to make one short quotation from Zola's book Work. Honourable members will recollect that in his works, such as L'Assommoir and Nana, he dealt with drink, prostitution and other aspects of the social system as he saw them. He dealt with some of the many social problems that confront civilization. Towards the end of his life he commenced the writing of four books based on the characters of the four apostles, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. He spoke of Work, Truth, Paith and Justice as the four apostles of a newer society. He pictured a new era in society and a better class of workmen-to use the Prime Minister's expression, ""men of vision and ideals."" What greater ideal could a statesman have than the making of a better class of men and women, with better hearts and brains? How does the Prime Minister show his statesmanship? At the first sign of trouble he runs away from the task confronting him. The Treasurer said that the question before us was not one of politics, but of economics. It is more than a question of economics, for it has to do with living humanity, their faith and their beliefs. In this world we have to cope with many matters which to-day",57,Bhuce

It is not the habit of the Labour party to run away from the task confronting it ; rather does it lend its heart, its brain, its muscle, its sinew to the task. It is not a case of giving only of our gold; we must be willing, as has been written, to offer our blood. No true statesman will abandon the task on which he has set his heart. I recommend Work to the Nationalist party. In it Jordan says to LucWhat shall I do? It is plain enough; I shall start again. One ought never to throw up a task.

We must persevere and give it the best in us as long as we are erect, full of intelligence and virility. How lacking in statesmanship, how cowardly, how pusillanimous is this great Nationalist party? The Treasurer said that we should not view this legislation from the stand-point of class; but honourable gentlemen supporting the Government for the most part cannot avoid class. The Prime Minister is the symbol of class. The last section in the community to attain class consciousness was the poor and the downtrodden. The Government has shown its class-consciousness time after time. Who does not remember the time when the Right Honourable William Morris Hughes was a member of the Labour party? He left it for reasons which we need not now discuss, and formed the Nationalist party. Who does not know that from the carcasses of those who have deserted or left us the anti-Labour forces have been able to suck the life-blood of political existence? They realized the need of new blood; and it was deserters from the Labour party that had to inject it into them. The right honourable gentleman 4 gave new life to that party. It used him for a period; during the. war it even honoured him, but after the war it threw him overboard. member want him back again? for ever. He went, and 40 other men with bers of the party are loyal followem him. Where are the majority of those men who went with him from the Labour party ? their political graves. into political oblivion; thrown out like so much dirty water. But, for some reason, the Nationalist party has not been able to cast out William Morris Hughes; he alone of those who left the Labour party remains on the other side. But he is a desolate and lonely figure. Now the members of that party are after his scalp once more. They object to him because he cannot escape from endorsing the things in hunger and poverty and misery; he rose from the pit. Poor workmen lifted him up on their bucklers to the most honoured position in this country. In our arbitration laws there is evidence of his driving force, some of his blood, his brain, his talents; and now, in spite of his present associations, he cannot forget the things of his early manhood. both parties. going after him, and will not desist till he is cast upon the rocks. I have little more to say; indeed, I should not have risen had it not been for the remarks of the Treasurer, who lowered the debate to a level inconsistent with the so-called dignity of this chamber. I do not profess to be a dignified person, or to exalt any debate in which I take part. I am a plain commoner who does not profess to be a superior person bestowing my patronage upon inferior creatures. I claim only to be the equal of any man who sits on the front Ministerial bench. If the speech of the Treasurer is an example of statesmanship; if the Treasurer himself is the best that Nationalism has to offer; we on this side have nothing to lose by comparison. In conclusion, I ask, who on the other side are opposing this bill? Are its opponents the weakest men in the Nationalist party? Does Louis bers can pick them out-the weakest,",58,Bhuce

154,Mr Anstey,"The Government isof the Government. It is true that on the Government side there are some critics of the hill. Any man free from prejudice must admit that, whatever their motives, the men on the Government side who are opposing this measure are unquestionably the most able men of the party-me n so mentally powerful, and possessing such moral force, that the Government would be delighted to throw overboard half the crew on the front bench to secure their aid. That is their condemnation. We have no fear of the future. Legislation must be taken by and large. Judged by that standard, the arbitration legislation of the Commonwealth has been of great benefit to the people. The Government knows well that it is not because arbitration has failed that it is being abandoned. There are other reasons for the Government's action, and they can be described as subterranean. ' The Government has made a false move; its sun has begun to sink; and once more the siin of Labour is about to dawn. Labour will ultimately triumph. The passing of this bill will mean the destruction of Nationalism and a corresponding augmentation of the political power of the workers. The measure before us can only be regarded as' a valuable aid to the Labour party-so ""let her go!"" p.m.] -The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) said that it was a great mistake for the Government to go on with this measure because only a few unions were giving trouble, while many thousands of unionists were working amicably under the awards of the Arbitration Court. That may be so, but one reason why I support this measure is because I know that those men and women to whom the honourable member refers will go on working contentedly when the Eederal Arbitration Court is abolished. It is not the presence of the court that makes them work in -peace; they are doing so because they have been able to come to a satisfactory agreement with their employers. If they are not able to continue in agreeI should introduce a system similar to ment, the State industrial tribunals will do. what is necessary to ensure that industry is carried on, I have no fear whatever on that ppint. Honourable members opposite are always talking about what the people will do. One would think that they were the only representatives the people had in Parliament. I trust the people; honourable members opposite do not. The only good thing that compulsory arbitration has ""done is to so inform the public mind that sweating conditions will not be permitted to exist when the present federal arbitration legislation is repealed. Honourable members opposite have suggested that the workers and employers will fly at one another's throats as soon as this bill is passed, that sweated conditions will prevail, and that the workers will be made the tools of the employers. That is absurd; we have passed the stage when anything of the kind would be permitted. I have always opposed compulsory arbitration, and have spoken more strongly against it in this Parliament than has any other honourable member. I am supporting this bill, not because I am slavishly following the direction of any party, but because I believe that the measure is right. If we are to have a satisfactory industrial system, we must have one set of industrial conditions, whether imposed by the Commonwealth or by the States. If full industrial powers were vested in the Commonwealth the Eederal Court would be able to make awards to suit the conditions existing in the place where a dispute occurred. But the States can do that too; they have full control within their own boundaries, and can handle industrial matters quite as well as any Commonwealth Court. If a dispute arises, the States can set up the necessary machinery to deal with it. It has been said that if control of industry is left to the States, each will set up a different standard, and uniformity will be lost. We have neverhad uniformity, so we cannot lose it. I am not concerned whether one State will pay a little less than another, so long as, the people are contented, and are doing their jobs. Personally, I am in favour of going farther even than is proposed in this bill. that operating in Canada, where they bave industrial boards without any compulsory powers whatever. If the workers",59,Bhuce
155,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot) [10.15,"do not like to obey tbe recommendations of the board, tbey may go on strike, and if the employers a.re not satisfied they may lock out. Then public opinion usually settles the matter. If a union on strike has the support of public opinion, it will win, but if a leader inposed to set up under this bill? duces his men to go on strike when public opinion is opposed to him, he will quickly forfeit the confidence of his followers. Similarly, an employer who locks out his workers without just cause, will be quickly disciplined by public opinion. There is more work done in Canada, and less time lost through strikes under this system, than under the system we have in operation here. However, this bill provides for a system of arbitration, or regulation, call it what you like. It provides for the setting-up of a committee which shall consist of representatives of the employers and employees, with an impartial chairman. ""When the committee comes to a determination, according to its tenor,, and in respect of the matter specified in the notice by which the committee was summoned, be binding upon all employers and employees engaged, during the currency of the determination, in the industry to which the committee was assigned, and in respect of which the determination was made. Therefore, that determination will have the same effect in law that an award of the Arbitration Court has now. I am opposed to arbitration as it exists now because it is necessary, before the system can be put into operation, to create a dispute. It is true that the parties may settle their differences by conciliation; but if they fail to do this, the court must be invoked. [Quorum formed.'] ""When the parties get into the Arbitration Court, they become merely litigants, each fighting for its own hand. This causes proceedings to be exceedingly expensive and unduly protracted. system is an absolute farce, and has been for many years. I am glad to see that a great many unions and employers are able to work satisfactorily together, and have the good sense to keep away from the court. One taste of it has been enough for them. Another objection to the present arbia dispute occurs over land or a debt, the tration system is that a judge is appointed parties concerned go before a judge, who must learn all about an industry from evidence. of industry will be possessed by the chairman of the committees which it is prothose committees will at least be surrounded by a number of persons who are thoroughly versed in the industry, and upon whose assistance he can count. The chairman of a wages board is usually a capable man, who is able to do good work. It is proposed, under the bill, to set up councils which, in some respects, will be similar to the Tasmanian and Victorian wages boards. The chairman » of each board will be a judge, and so will not be connected with either the employers or employees. Our judges are men of average intelligence and worldly knowledge, who may be relied upon to make impartial findings. The discussions at that determination will the meetings of these councils will be frank and informal. The parties will lay all their cards on the table, and as, apart from the chairman, they will be fully informed of the facts relating to the industry under consideration, their decisions should be reached without any delay. This system is far more likely to give good results than the existing system of industrial control, and it will certainly be less costly and more expeditions. The wages board system in Victoria is working better than the Arbitration Court system to-day. Under existing circumstances it is unreasonable to expect industry to develop, for the parties which appear before the Arbitration Court are concerned chiefly with obtaining the greatest possible advantage for their own side. They do not care very much about the effect of an award upon the industry which they are The whole supposed to represent. The union leaders, as well as the leaders of the employers' organizations, know very well that they must do something to keep their jobs. Consequently, as soon as one dispute is settled, they set to work to manufacture another. The' representatives of the two parties fight like cats and dogs, while the industries of the country languish. When",60,Bhuce

But in the case of ah industrial dispute the general community suffers until the parties reach an agreement. While a dispute is in progress men remain unemployed and women and children frequently starve. When tbe Arbitration Court was first set up, we placed at the head of it an eminent equity lawyer, who was also a fair-minded and clever man; but politically he was, in my opinion, a faddist. He laid down the principle that industry must return to the employees a living wage,, that is, sufficient to maintain a worker, his wife and a family of three children in reasonable comfort. The president of the court "" fixed the minimum wage without having any regard to the capacity of industry to pay it. That may have been a humane procedure; but it was economically unsound, and, therefore, senseless. Unless we give heed to economic law> we must meet with disaster. doubt that, in the last few years, we have not taken economic considerations sufficiently into account. Consequently, the Government was faced with an extremely difficult position. The States would not agree to a grant of additional power to the Commonwealth, sq something had to be done to meet the situation. We have had a series of industrial disturbances in the last twelve months. We have had trouble with the waterside workers, the timber workers, and a number of other less serious disputes. The Attorney-General last year introduced a bill to amend the Arbitration Act with the object of compelling both sides to obey the awards of the court; but, unfortunately, that object has not been achieved. The awards of the court are still being flouted. Unfortunately the leaders of the men are encouraging them to disobey the law. Even the unions which are working peaceably under awards of the court are breaking the law in another respect, for they are providing the money which makes it possible for other unionists to remain on strike. Government was justified in taking this bold step with the object of reaching the goal of industrial peace. We ought to be able to put the workers in a position to keep their wives and children in reasonable comfort, and at the same time accumulate a little money for a rainy day. There is good common sense in such a policy.. The Government is of the opinion that if the way were cleared for the employers and employees to meet in conference to discuss their problems with as little formality as possible, substantial progress would be made. I have often said that it is unfortunate that the employers have not more confidence in their employees, and do not reveal to them some of the problems which have to be faced to the management of big businesses. Such a policy would cause the men to be more reasonable in their demands. member think this bill would have been before us if the timber workers had accepted the award of the court I confidence of the Government, but 1 imagine the bill would have been put before us in any case. I am prepared to There can be no support the Government in its industrial policy, for I am convinced that it is wise. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has indicated his intention to move an amendment which, if carried, would have the effect of deferring further consideration of this measure until the people have been consulted. I can see no virtue in taking that course. The honourable member . for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) weakly argued last night that the Government should take another referendum. He said that as it was thought to be quite proper to go before the people regularly for re-election, nothing could be said against making repeated requests to them for additional power. I submit there is no analogy between the two cases. Different questions are submitted to the people for"" their consideration at each election, whereas the referendums which have been taken on the subject of power over trade and commerce have been submitted in practically identical terms on each occasion. The negative majority In all these circumstances the at the last referendum was larger than ever before. In these circumstances it would be a waste of public money to take another referendum.

159,Mr Atkinson,"I am not in thea conservative attitude and leave things as they are. They prefer to preserve the existing position than to risk taking a step into the unknown. A great deal has been said during this debate about the attitude of the Labour party towards industrial arbitration. On this point I quote the following comments of Mr W. J. Duggan, president of the Australian Trades and Labour Council, which appeared in the Melbourne Herald on the 19th August last:The attitude of Labour is a simple one, but it is being confused by side issues and the misconstruction of our object for purely political purposes. For many years the Arbitration Court served its purpose well, but in latter years it became the special attention of the legal fraternity, particularly those who move from the ranks into the political realm. Claims of unions were often defeated on legal technicalities. This has grown up to such' an extent that the feeling against the Arbitration Court became very strong. The culminating point was reached last year when the Government introduced a bill to amend the Arbitration Act and invested the Court with powers that hitherto were regarded as nothing less than an alteration of the Constitution. What is desired to-day by the Labour movement is that the court should be constituted on an entirely different basis, so that industria l legislation w i ll remain in the federal' country from progressing. I have prosphere. It is suggested that Labour intended to submit a proposal exactly on all fours with that contained in this bill. It was on the same lines as the old wages board system of Victoria, which is closely followed in this bill, the only difference being that they desired the federation to have full control over all industries, while under the present bill the control applies only to the maritime industries. Of course, this Parliament is acting under its trade and commerce powers and not under its industrial powers. The Government has done its best to amend the Arbitration Act to make it workable; refused to accept the awards of the court and have made the industrial position impossible. Judging by our previous experience in referring matters to the people by referendum, the electors expect this Parliament to act, and do not wish to be troubled with proposals .submitted to them in that way. If I am not mistaken, the chief charge levelled against the Government by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was that the bill was an attempt to reduce wages, and would result in workmen having^ to accept whatever conditions the employers cared to impose. The honourable member must have a poor opinion of the intelligence of the public if he expects it to accept such a statement. ""What the workers require is hot necessarily high wages but real wages. I should like to see workmen earning £20 a week if industries could be carried on under those conditions. Some honourable members opposite have said that if industries cannot afford to pay good, wages they should cease. A good many industries languish and die because persons with capital are not prepared to invest their money in them; they prefer to invest in governmentbonds. If industrial conditions in Australia were all they should be, it would be unnecessary for us to be troubled with migration problems. Australia would then be a magnet that would attract the best type of settlers from all parts of the world, and our only task would be to keep out undesirables. Compulsory arbitration ha's done more than anything else in the last twenty years to keep this bably more personal friends amongst, the workers than have some honourable members opposite, and I understand their points of view. If they are given a fair opportunity they are prepared to do a fair day's work for the wages they receive. I need not refer to the history of arbitration in Australia, although I know it fairly well. I am satisfied that the Federal Arbitration Court has done more harm than good. It has been a storm centre' rather than a means of bringing about industrial peace. I have no hesitation in according the bill my whole-hearted support. When we have had experience of .the new system probut the unions have posed by the Government, I feel sure that much happier conditions than now obtain will prevail, because workers and employers will be found pulling together to make their industries successful. impressive speeches have been delivered on the bill. Eminent lawyers on both sides of the chamber have discussed it, and some of those who sit behind the",62,Bhuce
160,Mr Price (Boothby) [10.55],"Som eGovernment have denounced it. Any honourable member who was wavering in his opinion must have been profoundly influenced by the eloquent address of the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr monwealth. That is a retrograde step, Maxwell). If honourable members opposite will consider the measure on its merits and forget party interests they will surely vote against it. Three honourable members on the other side have shown sufficient independence to oppose the bill,* and it must be agreed that the great weight of evidence is against it. It behoves every honourable member to express his opinion on this vital measure, which is one of the greatest issues that this Parliament has ever had to consider. Many years ago, when my late respected father was Premier of South Australia, the toilers in industries had no tribunal such as the Eederal Arbitration Court to which they could appeal. I am greatly concerned when I find a Government prepared to wipe out many of the reforms that have been fought for and won in the past. I , therefore, propose to fight the bill to the bitter end. I am a new member of this chamber, and I consider that the way in which the Government conducts business is a disgrace, and a trayesty on British parliamentary institutions. When the Transport Workers Bill was under discussion it resorted to the miserable, contemptible action of applying the ""gag,"" and thus prevented twenty honourable members, who sit on this side, from expressing their views. A similar attitude was adopted when the financialagreement was before this House. On that occasion the axe fell on me. I was exceedingly annoyed, because the matter was of vital importance to my State. backing of servile members, who are willing to do its .bidding and force through legislation. Those who sit on this side are always ready to express their views on vital matters that are brought forward. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) told us this, afternoon that we are to be kept here until the second reading stage of the bill has been completed. The attitude of the Government towards the States on this occasion is entirely different from that which it adopted in the case of the financial agreement. Theni t took from the States some of their sovereign rights. Nowi t is proposed to hand over to the States powers that are at present being exercised by the Comwhich will prove detrimental to the great mass of the people, and consequently it will not have my support. This evening we had a sorry exhibition from the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page),who holds a very responsible position in the Commonwealth. If he is typical of a responsible Minister, it is a poor look out for the future of Austaalia. During the course of his speech I interjected that I hoped it would not be cabled to London. I made that interjection pointedly. If the Commonwealth or any of the States were seeking a loan on the London market, his remarks would prove detrimental to it. Statements such as he made are uot conducive to the welfare of the people. The Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Abbott) has tackled the question from a different angle. It would appear that certain members of the Government party were wavering, and he set out to bring them into line. The outstanding feature of his speech was the use of the term "" fangless snakes."" That will live in the memory of those honourable members for many years to come. When the time arrives for the Government to face the electors,' it will feel the sting of their indignation. I hope that we shall go to the country in the very near future. The Government claims to have been given a mandate for this legislation, but they will find great difficulty in convincing the people that that is so. Prior to the last election in the literature published by the Bruce Government supThe Government has the porters, great stress was"" laid upon its advocacy of the principle of conciliation and arbitration; yet to-day it proposes to overthrow arbitration. be overthrown, and control is to be retained only over maritime industries. the ruin which the honourable member and his friends have caused. follows the present one will have",63,Bhuce

The sooner the people have an opportunity to pronounce judgment upon the Government the happier they will be. One is justified in assuming that a vast majority of the Australian people are strongly opposed to the Government's anti-arbitration policy. Even honourable members opposite do not understand the reasons that actuated their leader in taking this drastic step, which will have such a detrimental effect upon a large number of Australian workers. The only intimation they received concerning the Government's change of front was contained in a somewhat mysterious telegram despatched to every member of the Nationalist party. Although honourable members opposite have stated from time to time that they are free to vote as their conscience dictates, it will be found, when a division is taken, that they will follow the directions of their leader and support the measure. The Prime Minister and those supporting him frequently condemn trade unionists, for adopting a policy of direct action; but, in this instance, they are using similar methods. member approve of direct action? the slightest justification for the Governto the 31st December of that year.

Away with honourable member for North Sydney( Mr arbitration, Hughes) stated that the outcome of the Government's action will be that different What this association wanted was freeStates will have varying rates of wages dom of contract between the worker and [24] and conditions, which must ultimately have the effect of reducing wages. The Federal Arbitration Court was established with the object of co-ordinating industrial conditions throughout the Commonwealth ; but, under this proposal, there will be a disparity in rates of wages as between the States, with the results I have indicated. The Federal Arbitration Court was established in 1904, under the presidency of the late Mr Justice Higgins, who was capable of understanding the difficulties with which the workers were confronted. While he always endeavoured to give a decision which was fair to both parties, he was never unmindful of the fact that many of the employees who came before him were actually living on the bread line. Unfortunately, some of the judges who have succeeded him have not treated the workers with the same consideration. This has undoubtedly been respousible for a good deal of the industrial troubles which have occurred in recent years. In response to a request submitted to the Industrial Registrar, I was informed that there are 141 Commonwealth arbitration awards at present in force, which, if this measure becomes law, will remain iu operation until the 30th June, 1930. But, the honourable since this proposal, which has the approval-of the State governments, has been introduced, the Premier of Victoria has asked that that time shall Be extended this Bruce-Page system of arbitration, maritime workers are to be controlled by the federal authority. The Government The Constitution provides proposes to penalize a large section of Australian industry by depriving both employers and-employees of their federal industrial awards. Does any honourable member seriously contend that such action is conducive to industrial peace? In 1928 a conference of the Metal Trades Employers Association was held in Sydney, and from that conference a circular was sent out containing the following statement:Industrial arbitration had pampered the let us get back to the open door, to the open economic ring.",64,Bhuce

166,Mr Price,"I do not. There is not the employer. Are the Australian manufacturers prepared to go back to free trade, and face the competition of those countries in which low wages and sweated conditions prevail? If the Governmeut proposed to withdraw the existing protection of industry, and allow the products of cheap labour countries to enter duty free, there would be a tremendous howl from the manufacturers of Australia. The Government should remember that there are others to be considered besides those who belong to the employing class. There is the great mass of the workers, who form a very big section of the population, and who play an important part in the country's industries. They also havo a right to be protected. The manufacturers are for ever approaching Parliament for further protection against the products of cheap labour countries. The Minister for Customs could, if he wished, tell the House that he haa always some representative of the manufacturers on his doorstep asking for still more protection. Personally, I believe in a protective tariff, but side by side with protection of industry we should have protection of the rights of the workers. I am not one of those who believe in direct action in settling disputes between employers and employees, nor do I believe in the methods which this Government is trying to force upon the people. I believe in arbitration, and it is not very long ago industrial committees in connection with since the Attorney-General also believed the shipping and waterside industries. in it.

The Attorney-General said, on the occasion to which I refer, that most of these organizations were working in peace under awards of the court. Compare the Attorney-General's statement on that occasion with his remarks when introducing the present bill. The Government is determined to get rid of arbitration by hook or by crook so that we may return to the old system of strikes and lockouts. The administration of the law in this country by the present Government has been one-sided, and its action in connection with the withdrawal of the John Brown prosecution was disgraceful. grave now. will live iu the memories of the people of Australia for a long time to come. I am pleased that the matter was debated in this Hou3e, and that a record was taken of those who voted in support of the Government's action, and those who opposed it. It will serve to show the people of Australia where honourable members stand on that issue. This bill provides for the setting up of ing group of industries in Australia?

168,Mr Price,"It is not in the grave; itwhen I was in England was the prominence given in the newspapers to industrial trouble in Australia. In view of the fact that we have so little industrial trouble, comparatively, it is a shame that such prominence should be given in the overseas press to this side of our industrial affairs. On one occasion, at least, the publication of such news had a very detrimental effect upon our position in the British money market. At that time we were endeavouring to float a loan. A great deal of the money was undersubscribed and left with the underwriters. The Government should do something to check the publication of such damaging news in the British press. I challenge honourable members op-' posite to show that any industrial country in the world has been freer from strikes than Australia has been during the last eleven years. has tried to make the people believe that in bringing forth this bill it desires to promote industrial peace. Has any one ever heard anything so absurd? I cannot understand how any man with a logical mind can argue that six State tribunals will bring peace to industry more than the Commonwealth Court has done. If the proposals of the Government are put into effect, industry must in the near future, be in a chaotic state. That the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has not entirely prevented strikes from occurring is no reason for repealing it. No one would suggest for a moment that the Police Offences Act should be repealed because a few offenders go unpunished. Industrially, the Government has undoubtedly run amok. It has pulled one lever after another in the attempt to run the train of State on to the right line until it has now lost all sense of direction. It is difficult to understand how the intelligent men who support the Government could have allowed themselves to be forced into supporting this bill by a mere telegram. But, apparently, honourable members opposite have come to the conclusion that they must stand behind the Government whateverit may do. The Prime Minister deserves to be congratulated, not only upon his strength, but also upon the weakness of his followers. The Sitting telegrams which caused such a remarkable change of front must have been remarkable. When one considers the effect of a recent long-distance telephone conversation between the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister on the John Brown case, and the effect of the telegrams to which I have referred, he is forced to the conclusion that the Postmaster-General's Department is playing an important part in national affairs in these days. I hope that there will be a sufficient number of honourable members voting against the bill to prevent the smashing up of our arbitration machine. Prom my earliest days I have been closely associated with the Labour movement. I have carefully studied the effect of the industrial legislation of the Commonwealth and the The Government States over a long period of years. Many stalwart Labour leaders including my father, the late Honourable Thomas Price, fought strenuously in days gone by for a workable system of industrial arbitration. We had to suffer many privations in our family circle in my boyhood days because of my father's staunch and self sacrificing support of this principle. Happily the conditions of life are somewhat easier for me to-day than they were then; but I shall never forget those days, and I should consider myself a renegade if I failed to prevent with all my power the backward step which the Government is proposing to take. We should still be engaged in the work of industrial reform, but the Government is reactionary in this as in other respects. Serious injury will be done to this country if this bill is passed. The measure can do nothing to restore harmony in our industrial relations, but on the other hand it may cause untold trouble which we shall find it difficult to rectify. I shall fight the bill to the bitter end, and feel that in doing so I am acting in the best interests of Australia, the land that I love. By improving the existing Commonwealth industrial machinery we may do a great deal to add to the contentment and joy of our citizens, but by voting for this measure we shall undoubtedly bring chaos into industry. suspended from 11.55 .p.m. to 12.S0 a.m. (Friday).

When the bill providing for it was introduced in New Zealand in 1894, the Minister in charge of the measure said that an was being made. the operation of the system would be closely watched for a while; if it worked well it would be retained, but otherwise it would be wiped off the statute-book. In those'days, New Zealand was regarded as one of the most democratic countries in the world. Soon afterwards New South Wales adopted similar experimental legislation, and tbe eyes of tlie world were turned towards that State and to New Zealand; but other countries did not care to copy that legislation. In 1904 the Commonwealth adopted this system. The framers of the Constitution realized that it would possibly be asked for, aud they made provision for it in the Constitution; but they regarded it with some suspicion. Although legislation has been enacted providing ostensibly for conciliation and arbitration, the system has not been effective. Its main object was to bring peace to industry, and that would have meant progress! The workers expected three good results from compulsory arbitration -improve d wages, shorter hours, and uniformity of working conditions in the various States. If , after a trial of over a quarter of a century, we could prove that federal arbitration has made wages more effective, shortened hours, and caused uniformity of conditions, the present debate would be unnecessary; but I intend to show that our legislation has failed in all their purchasing power has also risen 25 those respects. able member discover that? clusion a long time ago. Honourable members on this side are not all like "" dumb driven cattle "". If the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) is true to Nationalism, honourable members supporting the Government on this measure must be out of step with it ; but I suggest that that honourable member is out of step with his own party. Many strikes have occurred in Australia under federation. For the last six months the timber workers have made our arbitration law the laughing stock of the Commonwealth and even of the whole world. Attempts have been made to amend it ; but experiment strikes still occur. If the workers are He added that uot prepared to obey the awards of the Arbitration Court, what is the use of maintaining a system from whicli no good results can be obtained? The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) quoted statistics that appeared to me to have no bearing upon the present issue. There may be some justification for the strikes that have occurred in Great Britain, Canada and the United States of America. The men in those countries have struck for conditions that the workers in Australia already enjoy. The industrial population in those countries is so large that the conditions there are not comparable with those in Australia, which is a primary producing country. Twenty-five years ago we adopted what were thought to be advanced methods of preventing strikes; but we find to-day that the industrialists are striking against the awards of the Federal Arbitration Court. I would abolish even the majority of the State arbitration tribunals. Wages are undoubtedly higher than they were in 1904 and this applies even in countries that have no arbitration courts. A professor of economics in Sydney stated some twelve months ago that wages in New Zealand had certainly brought peace to industry, risen; but the real purchasing power of those wages was not greater than in 1900. In the United States of America, however, where compulsory arbitration does not obtain, wages have increased and per cent. The purchasing power of wages in Australia has slightly increased since 1904; but there are tens of thousands of men out of employment to-day, and this is due, in the main, to the effect of the awards of the courts, because industry",66,Bhuce

171,Mr Perkins,"I came to that concannot afford to pay the wages that have been fixed. To arrive at the average wage, it is necessary to make allowance for the large number of men who are out of work. Many wage-earners are taxed by their unions in order to keep strikers going. Strikes are practically incessant, and, if we take that fact into consideration, it will be recognized that the workers throughout Australia receive a lower wage to-day than in 1904. Therefore, it cannot be said that the effect of the Arbitration Court has been to increase the wages of the workers. Let us now consider the hours of work. Originally, the attainment of a 48-hour week was regarded by the unions as a triumph. We saw men proudly marching behind their banners on Eight Hours' Day. Many of them now have a 44-hour week, and it is mainly because a Labour Government in New South Wales, independent of the Arbitration Court, made provision on the statute-book for that number of working hours, and in many industries the Commonwealth has been obliged to follow that lead; but this reduction of hours cannot be attributed to arbitration. The hours of labour have been considerably shortened also because tens of thousands of unemployed have brought the average number of hours actually worked down to 36 or 38 per week. Uniformity of conditions in industry is impossible. Australia is a big continent with varying. climates. Different conditions are found in Tasmania from those experienced in North Queensland, and similarly the conditions in the eastern States are entirely different also in the cities, as a result of the disasfrom those in Western Australia. Only twelve of the awards of the Eederal Arbitration Court apply throughout the Commonwealth. The Premier of New South Wales is anxiously awaiting the passage of the present bill. arbitration. that he does; but I am positive that that is not his intention. He proposes to bring forward amending legislation that he hopes will not only produce peace in industry in New South Wales, but will provide employment for starving workers. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr ceived the reply, "" No . He is talking Maxwell) and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) have emphasized the fact that no mandate has been given to pass this legislation. A hundred and one things are done by governments for which they have .no direct mandate.

During the war the people were not asked to consent to the War Precautions Act being placed on the statute-book, and even after the war the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) carried on without a mandate under that act.

The States will have control of industries within their own borders, and will be in a position to take the necessary action to settle any dispute that may arise.

It is not desirable, nor does it make for peace in industry, that such a state of affairs should be allowed to continue. During the past five years there have been 2,064 registered strikes in Australia, of which 1,006 have been settled by direct negotiation between employers and employees, 86 by the intervention of a third party, 100 by State tribunals, and only 63, or 3 per cent, of the total, by the ducts. No sooner is a new award given Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Yet it is seriously urged that this expensive machinery should be retained to deal with that number of disputes! last sixteen years, the workers have lost in wages a total of £18,791,000, a yearly average of £1,175,000. Surely it is time we woke up and realized that the fetish which we have worshipped for so long is not what we thought it to be! Last year there was a big waterside workers' strike against an award of the court, and this year the timber workers are defying an award. Such action is merely bringing the system into derision. Since«its inception arbitration has imposed a tax upon the worker who continues at his job, because he has had to contribute to the support of the families last six years, the Australian Railways Union has spent over £9,000 in obtaining and last year the Federated Locomotive Enginemen spent more than half their income infighting claims. lin) sympathizes with the timber workers who are out on strike, on the ground that the award is too outrageous for them to accept, and members of the Opposition have carried a resolution congratulating the strikers on the fight they were putting up. When those who help to make the law have so little respect for it, very little argument is needed to prove that there is something fallacious in the system. Every honourable member has been inundated with letters from various unions, stating how peaceful and law abiding they have been; yet each week, they are contributing to a fund which is used to enable another union to defy the law. Mr Perkins. Ever since the arbitration system waB established in 1904, whenever wages have been increased by an award of the court, this Parliament has been asked to assist the industry concerned by imposing an additional tariff. Thus, the cost has been passed on to the public. We have also added to our indebtedness abroad. The time came, however, when the shoe began to pinch. The primary producers had to keep their production costs at the lowest possible rate, and pool their prothan the cost of living is considerably increased. In the last four or five years, as a result of Arbitration Court awards, During the no fewer than 22 industries have had to close down, and the position will become more acute the longer the existing system is allowed to continue. An industry can pay only according to what the manager can make out of it. If wages continue to rise and hours continue to be reduced, it must eventually go out of business. It is surprising that the tide did not turn long ago. This year, the price of wool dropped materially. It is estimated that, even if we had as big a clip as we had last year, the owners will receive £20,000,000 less than they did then. In Queensland the new Governof strikers. During the ment, which was elected recently found it absolutely necessary, if it was to assist the unemployed, to cancel all industrial awards from the court, awards in country districts. The New South Wales Government contemplates taking similar action. In my electorate, as well as in many other parts of New South Wales, the land-owners are not undertaking any scrub-cutting, clearing or ring-barking, because they cannot afford to pay the' award rates. In consequence of this, large numbers of men are out of employment, and in some cases are faced almost with starvation. As I understand that there are a number of honourable members on this and the other side of the chamber who wish to contribute to the debate, I shall conclude my remarks by saying that in my opinion arbitration has failed at practically every point, and although we are told that the Government has not received a mandate, it must be admitted that it has made au honest attempt to remedy the evils associ[Quorum formed]. ated with our industrial system.",69,Bhuce
182,The Leader Of The Opposition ( Mr Scul,"-If Bruce) ( Mr Latham) and those who have spoken in support of the bill have contended that in abolishing the Federal Arbitration Court it is not the intention to reduce wages, the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Book shows that' our manufacturing inPerkins) has set at rest the minds of honourable members on this side of the House on that question. The honourable member admitted that he has always been opposed to the present policy, and said that he would not only assist in abolishing the Federal Arbitration Court, but was also opposed to State arbitration. The honourable member, like many others, leaves the chamber directly he is attacked, and is amongst those who fight and run away in _ the hope that they may live to fight another day. The honourable member for Eden Monaro has shown quite clearly what is in the minds of honourable members on that side of the House. He said that federal arbitration was a success only at its inception and shortly afterwards; but that it soon began to be irksome, and that those engaged in industry had to approach the Federal Parliament with a request for higher customs duties. The honourable member asserts that the time has come to abolish arbitration because the present rates of wages cannot be paid. Although this is only a newcountry, I know of no other having such a large area and with such a small population, which has such a record of prosperity. Only one-fourth of the Commonwealth has been developed. It is the policy of the Government to abolish the Federal Arbitration Court without substituting some equally effective system. point tribunals to deal with the wages and conditions of the workers within their boundaries. the industrial conditions of merely a handful of the workers that are at present under the Commonwealth Arbitration Court; practically 600,000 workers will be deprived by it of federal industrial protection. The position of Australia is not so serious as the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis) and other honourable members suggest. The honor the Prime Minister( Mr able member for Eden-Monaro( Mr and the Attorney-General Perkins) said that 22 industries had gone out of operation during recent years. I do not know if the honourable member was referring to industries, but if he was, I cannot accept this statement. A perusal of the Commonwealth Yeardustries are developing rapidly, and 'that the number of their employees is correspondingly increasing. A remarkable feature of the debate on this measure is that particular attention has been directed tb the fact that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is to be abolished, and that little consideration is devoted to the interests of those who are to be seriously affected by the change. The Prime Minister referred to the position confronting the Commonwealth, and we have been informed, through the columns of practically every newspaper in Australia, that the Commonwealth Treasurer is responsible for the present unsatisfactory position of our finances. He' is admonished everywhere by Nationalist newspapers. He has been told that he has been a failure, and in fact a member of the ministry when a private member said that the right honourable gentleman was "" the most tragic Treasurer . Australia has ever known."" For a cash consideration-because of the emolument which the member now receives as a Minister-h e is no longer in a position to criticize the Trea r surer. honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) has stated that for a cash consideration the Minister for Customs withdrew certain criticisms he had made concerning the Treasurer. I repeat it-wa s that the present Minister for Customs said that the Treasurer, who is the leader of the Minister for Home Affairs, was the most tragic Treasurer Australia has ever known.

I distinctly heard the honourable member for Kalgoorlie use the words "" cash consideration "" in connection with the Minister for Customs' present attitude towards the Treasurer, and I ask that those words be withdrawn. on the point. has stated that the cost of production must be reduced. A similar statement was made by the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Perkins). He pointed out that the only logical outcome was a reduction in wages. The late member for Fremantle ( Mr Watson) rendered one service to his country when he was in this chamber by showing that, in the butter industry, the amount of money received by the butter producers was no measure of the amount extracted from the consumers who bought the butter. [Quorum formed.] The Prime Minister said that the cost of living must come down. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett), writing in that very reputable journal, the Argus, on 24th June, referred to the huge deficit in the federal finances, and saidNo tariff, no matter how high it is, can compete against a diminishing working week. Australia will continue to remain economically depressed so long as there is a desire to reduce the hours of working. So it is quite clear what was in the mind of the Minister for Trade and Customs, as well as in that of the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis), who stated that the salvation of the workers lay in the general adoption of piece-work. The honourable member for Kennedy went on to say that the reason for the closing down of the gold-mine at Charters Towers was that the men were asking wages too high for the industry to bear. I have previously had to put the honourable member right on that point. The honourable member should have enough experience to know that, when a mine is petering out, as all mines inevitably do, no reduction in wages can make it continue working. If I were permitted to use the expression-whic h I am not I would say that the honourable member for Kennedy became almost a master of mis-statement when he suggested that the I rise to mines at Charters Towers were closed, because the workers asked for too much. He, in effect, charged the workers in the gold-mining industry with having asked for more wages than they were entitled to. honourable member to deny it. could compensate the men for the work they did, and for the risks they undertook.

206,Mr A. Geeen,"No protest fromarbitration, and is now trying to get clear of the quagmire in which he finds himself as quickly as possible. There are, it is true, several deficiencies in the Pederal Arbitration Act as it stands at present. They have been referred to on many occasions. If that act had bei-.a amended it would have been of greater service to the community, and would liave prevented a considerable amount of the industrial unrest which has recently occurred. The court as at present constituted is unable to deal with disputes within a reasonable time. In March last thenwere no fewer than 160 cases waiting to be dealt with. Men do not approach the court unless they have a grievance, and it is no crime to be dissatisfied. Ever since I can remember, men hrye been dissatisfied with their conditions. Employers have sought for bigger profits and employees have wanted more wages. Discontent is a natural failing, if it be a failing at all, which is not confined to one class in the community. One complaint we have against the Arbitration atmosphere Men are inclined, like our worthy friend the Attorney-General, to spin words ad infinitum, without indicating clearly what they are driving at. This is particularly so when they are not too clear in their own mind about what they desire to express. There is no reason Court should delay hearing the cases coming before it, for provision is made in section 36 of the act to enable it to detail some of its lesser power to subordinate authorities. Unquestionably the court has good features, from the point of view of the workers. It has provided, for instance, that overtime shall be paid at the rate of time and a half for Sunday work, and work outside of the ordinary hours. that the State authorities that may be set up will adhere to these principles. The Commonwealth Court has also granted a shorter working week in the engineering and other industries. These advantages may be taken away by the State authorities. Under section 25B of the amended act of 1927, it was provided Mr A. Green. that the economic results of paying a certain wage in industry should not be considered in relation to the basic wage. But there is a significant clause in the bill now before us which readsA board shall, in considering each determination submitted to it under this act, take into consideration the probable economic effect of the determination in relation to the community in genera] and the probable economic effect thereof upon the industry concerned. It appears, therefore, that the protection given to the workers under section 25B to which I have referred will be removed if this measure is agreed to. The insertion of the clause that I have quoted clearly indicates the intention of the Government to reduce wages. The State wage-fixing authorities have, to some extent, taken into account the Commonwealth basic wage in fixing their award. It has been satisfactory to note that, since 1920, the High Court judges have repeatedly declared that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has considerably more power than it has exercised. Consequently, we should be taking steps Court is that its to strengthen the hands of the court. has been too legal. There is no justification for handing with legally trained minds over complete industrial power to the States. As a matter of fact, the State authorities in South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria are not able to deal with some of the big questions which have come before the Commonwealth Court. If disputes occur in the industries concerned, chaos must result. It is highly why the Commonwealth significant that immediately the Prime Minister announced the Government's intention of withdrawing from the field of industrial arbitration, certain State leaders declared that they would exclude certain callings from the benefits of arbitration. It is apparent therefore that some workers will have no authority to which they can apply for a declaration as to We have no undertaking their wages and working conditions. I nstead of dealing with suppositious cases, honourable members opposite will be well advised to turn their attention to the specific points I am bringing under their notice. I have no desire to impute motives to the Government, but I should be lacking in my duty if I refrained from saying. that it is significant that the Commonwealth Government withheld any declaration of its intention to abandon industrial arbitration until anti-Labour governments were in control in five of the six Australian States. member think that this is part of a huge conspiracy. perhaps the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Abbott) who made a flowery speech the other night, may be able to let another snake out of his bag, which would give us some information on this point. Labour Premier of Western Australia accepted the proposals of the Prime Minister. tunity to do anything else. He was in the ^ame position in this connection as in respect to the Einancial Agreement. The Prime Minister went to the Premiers Conference and asked, ""Are you fellows prepared to surrender to the Commonwealth complete control over industrial affairs?"" The State Premiers replied, "" No; we are not"". The Prime Minister, with a wave of his arms, then said, "" ThenI am swimming out"". The Premier of Western Australia would certainly not agree to the granting of complete industrial power to the present Commonwealth Government for he has no confidence in the ability of the Government to exercise such power wisely. The Treasurer suggested tonight that the Labour supporters of Australia were responsible for the rejection of the last referendum proposals. That is not so. Unfortunately, Labour polled a minority of votes at the last election. Thousands of Nationalists as well as hundreds of thousands of Labourites were not prepared to grant unlimited industrial power to the present Government, and so it was withheld. If this bill is passed, I should like to We are likely to have a bumper crop one ask what the Government would do in the event of an interstate railway strike occurring? Such a dispute might occur at any time and it could cause incalculable injury to the nation. It would soon reduce trade and commerce to chaos. If the Government throws, away the industrial power that it now possesses it will have to stand with folded arms in such a situation. Why is there the need for such unseemly haste in dealing with this bill? When the Attorney-General introduced the amending Arbitration Bill in December last, he allowed the discussion of it to stand over for two or three months in order that honourable members might thoroughly familiarize themselves with the measure. But we are now being asked, after a few hours' consideration, to abolish the whole of our industrial machinery, which has been constantly improved since 1904. The Commonwealth system of industrial control was born in the minds of great men like Charles Cameron Kingston and Alfred Deakin, and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), with his wide knowledge of industrial affairs, did a great deal to improve it. Now a dilletante Prime Minister wants to shuffle, out of this important field of Commonwealth activity because his dignity has been hurt by reason of the fact that he has made a mess of things. The right honourable gentleman has told us that Australia is in a perilous economic position, and that she is, in fact, facing ruin. But what are the facts ? An examination of the Commonwealth Year-Booh, which is compiled by an independent authority, shows that the value of Australia's production increased from £184,00u,000, in 1911, to £446,000,000 in 1926-27. No doubt the rise in prices in the years following the conclusion of the war contributed to some large extent to this huge total; but the increase has been consistent all through, taking the good years with the bad. In the year 1924-25 the total was £8,000,000 higher than in 1926-27. That was accounted for by the fact that in 1924-25 our production of' wheat and wool was valued at £24,000,000 more than in 1926-27. We know that in some of our industries seasonal conditions play an important part. year and very little the following year, although the workers put in the same amount of labour.

The index on Year-Booh as 1,000, and in the year 1926-27, it is given as 1,00S. figures show beyond question that the workers have beeu doing their share_to bring about the increase in production. That is a refutation of the suggestion that Australia is "" going to the dogs."" On this occasion, as on many others, some honourable members opposite are prepared to defame the workers of Australia, and the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page) is the arch-offender in this respect. It is disloyal to lead people abroad to believe that Australia is a land of strikes. While our association with Great Britain is valuable, so f a r as trade is concerned, and while we appreciate the heritage handed down to us, we as Australians have others, and that is the work of developing our own country. Attorney-General stated not long ago that those who called Australia a land of strikes did a grave disservice to this country. He did not repeal that observation during the present debate, but'the Treasurer has shown a readiness to defame his country to keep political statements do more to harm Australia than any others, and instantly undo any good that may result from heavy expenditure on advertising propaganda. It has been frequently said, and just as often conveniently ignored, by honourable members opposite, that during a period of years up to 1927, the working time lost through strikes in was uot three quarters of a day per workman, whereas in Great Britain, the loss amounted to two and a half days per man. land as a land of strikes on that account? But the Treasurer is prepared to defame the workers of Australia, who lose only one-third of the time lost in the Old Country through industrial Mr A. Green. Mr Wickens, the Commonwealth Statistician, points out the following in teresting facts:A great deal of erroneous deduction litis been made from the figures published in connection with industrial disputes, more especially in regard to "" No. of disputes occurring "", due in large measure to the infigure for the year 1911 ability of the Bureau to publish within the this basis is given in the narrow limits of an official publication full details of the "" causes "" of the bulk of these disputes. A close analysis of the returns, These however, discloses that the vast majority is due to causes which amount to nothing more than pure difference of opinion between workers and management on the questions at issue, nnd is only capable of settlement by the parties themselves, although in the case of a protracted dispute common sense or economic necessity often dictates the appointment of an outside mediator to settle the trouble. The number of disputes settled by "" direct negotiation"" is thus largely explained. The Commonwealth and State Arbitration Tribunals have covered by their awards all matters of wages and working conditions which it is possible to incorporate in such documents. The analysis referred to reveals the remarkable fact that only about 15 per cent, of tlie total disputes that occur touch questions which are either covered by awards or are susceptible to treatment by an arbitration tribunal. a task that transcends . all The following typical causes of non-arbitral strikes under the several classifications Tha referred to above will enable a proper perspective to be taken of these disputes, viz.: 1.

It . is an outrage. which honourable members opposite will tolerate tactics of this nature is amazing. It shows that they lack political decency as well as argument. It has been stated that one of the reasons for rushing through this legislation is the desire of the Government to burke the consideration of the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution. Taking all the circumstances into consideration, that is undoubtedly a reasonable conclusion. So far as the debate has proceeded, no cogent or substantial reason has been advanced for these proposals. Their introduction is but another illustration of the entire absence of consistency, stability, and fixity of purpose that has been so pronounced a feature of this Government, more particularly or three years. Political principles, constitutional powers, and all else are to be jettisoned to satisfy the petulant caprice of a Prime Minister who appears to be drunk with' vanity and arrogance. During the last year or two he apparently has worn his faith in much the same way that he wears his clothes-read y to make rapid changes to meet changing circumstances. member rise above that level? be able to rise to a higher level than that to which the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Abbott) has risen. He is not particular either as to the language he uses or the kind of political company he keeps. He finds himself to-day sleeping in the same political bed as the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett), whom he attacked only a year or so ago, declaring, that he ought to be ashamed of his remarks. I am not, however, concerned with the political principles or standards of honor of the honourable gentleman, and do not intend to take serious notice of any interjection he may make. The principal characteristic of the Government during the last two or three years has been its vacillation. Vacillation is usually regarded as evidence of weakness of character. To suggest that the Government has a mandate for this amazing legislative proposal is to insult The extent to the feeblest intelligence. A refreshing feature of this debate has been the honest candour, and the high principle and courage on this question of the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) in particular, and certain other honourable members opposite who have not been prepared to jump at their master's bidding like tame monkeys. Other Government supporters have declared from a thousand platforms their adherence to the principle of arbitration; yet notwithstanding this, they are now prepared to jettison that principle at a word from the Prime Minister. Australia is asked, in effect, to accept the dictatorship of the Prime Minister. That is evident from the fact that his party was not consulted before he deduring the last two cided to bring forward this proposal. During the course of his second-reading speech the right honourable gentleman declared that he made it "" perfectly clear ""-that blessed verbal idiosyncrasy which serves in the absence of argument-that one of the principle questions on which the Government was appealing to the people was the obtaining of "" peace in industry and a better understanding between the parties concerned."" He went on to say that he told the people that the "" Government would take any steps that were necessary to bring that about."" How can he claim to have been given a mandate for this proposal on such vague phraseology? That he does make such a claim proves that the Government will sink to any depths of political duplicity to justify ""the abolition of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Peace in industry is to be obtained by bringing about a condition of anarchy and chaos, and a better understanding between the parties is to be arrived at by placing the workers at the mercy of the organized employers.

Any person who analyses his speech must agree with the honourable member for Fawkner, that it was one of the weakest that has ever been delivered in support of a legislative proposal by a leader of a Government. Recognizing that he lacks argument, the right honourable the Prime Minister takes refuge in the vague declaration of the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) made during the course of a lengthy second-reading speech, in introducing the amending Arbitration Bill in 1928, that the policy of the Government in regard to arbitration would have to be reviewed if there was not a complete acceptance of the Government's policy. It cannot be expected that notice would be taken of a single sentence abstracted from a lengthy speech; and stress has been laid upon the fact that during the election campaign such a declaration was conspicuous by its absence. If ever the Government had an opportunity to make perfectly clear its policy in regard to industrial arbitration, it was at the last election. They cannot claim that the matter was not brought forcibly under the notice of the people, because at the time, there was a dispute on the waterfront, and the Government's arbitration policy was being challenged by a large section of trade unionism. Prime Minister evidently feels that his .goes on to say that no Government needs a mandate for its entire policy. No doubt that may be true in regard to minor issues; but that before the House is of paramount importance. By the greatest stretch of imagination no one can claim that a proposal of this drastic -character is included in a general mandate given at an election. This proposal affects not only approximately 750,000 workers registered under the Federal Arbitration Court, but the economic well-being, security, and standards of living of, perhaps, 1,000,000 women and -children. Ultimately about 2,000,000 persons will be affected by this alteration of policy. No one in his wildest dreams contemplated a change such as is now proposed. The provision for the exercise 'of federal powers in relation to industrial matters is one of the most vital matters in the Constitution. One of the things that led to the creation of. the Commonwealth was the desire to establish a measure of uniformity in industry, and to equalize the economic competition between the States. It was never contemplated that all the powers provided in the Constitution should be utilized by the Federal Parliament, and no one suggests that it is of vital importance to the economic well-being of Australia that every power contained in the Constitution should be exercised; but the industrial power affects the well-being of a large percentage of the population, and was included only after considerable argument and much controversy. It was placed there with the intention that it should be exercised. The exercise of our industrial power has been sanctioned for the past 25 years-sinc e the first Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was passed-withou t any protest from the people or any suggestion that a change should be made. The abandonment of this field of legislation strikes a definite blow at federalism, and has been so regarded by the representatives of all interests in the community who are anxious to extend the federal spirit. It will also be condemned by good Australians who are anxious that this nation should carry on its The work in the spirit in which its founders brought it into existence. reasons are inadequate, and The Prime Minister advanced reasons for the introduction of this measure in the same manner as a drowning man clutches at a straw. He contended that there is great urgency rendering necessary its introduction. One may repeat a question which has been previously asked, "" What is the motive behind this policy""? We are told that Australia is faced with a serious economic position, and obviously the inference to be drawn from the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General is that the Government is alarmed at the federal basic wage, which increases with the cost of living, so that the Government decides it must take action to reduce wages, lower the standard of living and increase working hours. The Government has not the courage to admit that this is part of its policy and attempts to obscure the real issue. Examining the real economic problem confronting Australia to-day, one is forced to the conclusion that it has been caused by mis-government on the part of the present Federal Administration. During the last six years we have witnessed an orgy of arising from non-productive expenditure. The Government customs tariffs, has failed to check imports. relieve unemployment and has failed to solve urgent national problems. not prevented a general rise in interest rates, and, generally, has failed to regulate the problems associated with industry. addressing facturers to the necessity for in tion of the methods of distribution. One might pertinently ask what the Prime Minister and the Government of which he is the leader, have done to grapple with these problems beyond talking about them. Industrial development is seriously affected and depression caused by unearned increment, over-capitalization in business and the absurdly high prices of property due to the actions of speculators. I shall quote later from a letter. I have received from Captain Lawrence, the general secretary of the Merchant Service Guild, not only because he directs attention to these obvious facts, but because he is the secretary of an organization which is not affiliated or in any way identified with the Labour movement. He is an officer of an organization completely detached from the Labour movement, and which possibly includes among its members thousands who support the Nationalist party, therefore his views should carry weight with Government supporters. In dealing with the economic problems of industry, Captain Lawrence points to the fact that the capital value of property in Sydney has increased approximately a hundredfold during the last twenty years. He refers to the ridiculous disproportionate increase in city property values; he shows how land in a suburb of Sydney has increased from £37 a foot to £400 a foot during the last five years. Factors such as these are responsible for our economic difficulties. To place upon the workers the full responsibility and add to Mr Coleman. their burden taxation imposed by increased output, lower wages and longer hours is obviously an act of class bias. One, in listening to the calamity bowlings of honourable members opextravagance posite, would imagine that wages in Australia were excessive. It is has trifled with interesting to note that the basic wage in Australia, founded on the HarThe Government has failed to vester judgment, was fixed after making provision for only bare necessities. It It has provided the lowest possible standard that could be prescribed. No provision was made iu computing the basic wage for luxuries for the workers. Consequently, The Prime Minister, in there is extreme resentment in their ranks a meeting of manuwhen any attempt is made to lower wages some days ago, referred or reduce the standard of living. We rationalization hear quite a lot about the increase iu industry, and a re-organizavalues. Statistics disclose that from 1901 to 1924 wages increased by 117 per cent., and the cost of living by 91 per cent. Real wages increased over a period of 25 years by only 13 per cent. On the other hand, rents have increased since 1901 by 116 per cent.; but nothing has been done to regulate dividends, profits or rents. Captain W. G. Lawrence, general secretary of the Merchant Service Guild of Australasia, made the following observations in the course of an article recently published, replying to an attack on arbitration by Sir Mark Sheldon:During the war years and right up to 1922 (after which it became the practice of the court to insert quarterly adjustment tables) the cost of commodities other than labour rose 85 per cent., but labour did not rise until terrible losses had been sustained by the workers. Labour, therefore, did not set the land jobbers at work. Labour did not' encourage the city property boomsters. Labour did not water the stock of public companies. Labour did not put the war prices on utilit y services and commodities. Labour did not double the interest on money. Labour inflated nothing, and it had to wait for years to be restored from time to time to the living wage. The share to labour in the wealth produced is no greater to-day, nor has it ever been greater than it was in 1907-it is even considerably less, owing to the fact that the skilled worker to-day is receiving relatively a much lower rate than he received in 1907. If , therefore, Sir Mark is honestly looking for the cause of the high taxation he will seek it among his capitalistic friends, who turned the war into an opportunity to boost values. I commend these utterances to honourable members opposite. They are not thf opinions of the wild communist they PO often condemn, some class-conscious individual, or a member of tbe Labour party, but those of a gentleman who represents a middle-class organization of shipmasters and officers. He clearly indicates that, where sacrifices are concerned, it is generally the workers and the so-called middle-class, from whom the Government derive some measure of support, who are affected. A good deal of propaganda dulged in by members of the Nationalist party in connection with the 44-hour week, iu which they declare the 44-hour week to be impracticable. A publication of the United States Labour Department sets out the scale of wages and hours of labour iu American industries as at loth May, L928. In a great majority of skilled industries a 44-hour week predominates, ;ind in many others the hours worked are 40 and under. The Prime Minister has .sheltered behind the suggestion that a system of payment by results or piecework is a solution of our economic problem. In that connection the Prime Minister is in disagreement with the views of many economists, who contend that the application of piece-work or a system of payment by results is not only difficult of application, but inflicts injustice upon the workers. The Arbitration Court has been reluctant to extend the piece-work principle, because of the dangerous possibilities associated with it. It is, therefore, arrant humbug to ask this Parliament to consider this measure in a non-party spirit; it is apparent that the Government has been actuated by a partisan spirit in introducing it. It would appear that the gospel preached some years ago by the Single Purpose League is now being embraced by the Government. Let me quote the following, from a manifesto issued by the Metal Trades Employers Association:Industrial arbitration has pampered the workers so that they have become bowelless and was arrived at after consultation with tyrants and unmitigated ruffians. Away with a section of the employers. It is interesti t ! Let us get back to the open economic ring. ing to quote, for purposes of contrast, Presumably that reactionary and vicious the remarks of the Attorney-General expression of policy summarizes the atti-made in the course of an address tude of the present Government, which delivered in Wesley Church some time has yielded to the pressure of those finanago. He is reported as follows:cial interests who are anxious to destroy the stability and tranquility which have when they talk about scrapping arbitration prevailed in a great majority of industhethat tries under arbitration. It would appear ing under it , and 558,000 employees working that the Government policy has been based upon secret consultations between representatives of the Government and such organizations as the Metal Trades Employers Association. It is well known that private discussions have taken place from time to time between members of the Government and representatives of the employers, particularly in Sydney. has been inThe Attorney-General has been reminded that he now finds himself in agreement with the dreadful "" reds,"" whom he spent so much time denouncing during the last few years, and he quotes with gusto their statements in opposition to arbitration as a justification of the present action of the Government. He does small credit to his professional ingenuity when he shows himself unable to find better arguments in support of the Government's policy than that. He quoted from an article writen by Mr Arthur Rae which, perhaps, when analysed from a philosophical point of view, may contain elements of truth. The article quoted was to the effect that arbitration has lulled the workers into a sense of economic security. If it has produced that result it would surely be a good thing for the Government to continue the existing policy rather than abandon it. Perhaps it would be just as well for the Attorney-General to link.up with the Communist party, since he finds himself so completely in agreement with it. It has been suggested that the States could deal adequately with industrial matters. The fallacy of that contention becomes apparent when we take into consideration the theatrical industry, and others with ramifications extending beyond the limits of one State. It seems evident that the change of attitude on the part of the Attorney-General is based, not upon principle, but upon expediency, One of the facts that people should consider is there are 140 unions registered under Arbitration Act, 330.000 employees workunder State awards. Any proposal to abolish industrial arbitration would produce chaos. Mr Latham set out to answer the question, "" Should we scrap arbitration."" The subject should be considered on the high ground of principle, not of varying expediency. Now principle gives place to expediency. He advances as an objection to the Federal Arbitration Act that the creation of disputes involved introducing a legal atmosphere. is well known that the necessity for creating a dispute as a preliminary to conciliation and arbitration is to-day practically a legal fiction. The old diffithe report of the Royal Commission on culty has been overcome, and a dispute, for the purposes of the law, consists merely of a demand and refusal. The activity of the court is in no way impeded by this technical obstacle. The extent to which conciliation has entered into the settlement of industrial disputes is shown by the large number of consent agreements which have been arrived at in recent years, but which would never have been reached the shadow of a court in the background. also made the remarkable declaration that there was no loyalty to the principle of arbitration There is absolutely no ground for such a sweeping declaration. ""With the single exception of the timber-workers' disputeand in that case much might be said for the attitude of the timber-workers-the industrial sphere in Australia presents nothing to support the Attorney-General's statement, or to justify the change which the Government propose to effect. On the other hand it is a paradox that the maritime workers, who admittedly have been the cause of much industrial disturbance, are receiving a measure of protection under this bill. Reference has been made to the failure of the people to pass the referenthe opportunity to obtain for themselves dum of 1926. In that case the same impulsive action was taken by the Government as it is taking now. It rushed the questions before the people without any attempt to educate them upon the matter, and after having made it a party issue in the first instance in this House. No attempt was made to take the Opposition into the confidence of the Government in framing the proposals. The people reMr Coleman. fused on that occasion to vest in the authorities, which were to be constituted, the powers sought by the Government, and they refused because they did not trust the Government nor the authorities it proposed to create. The proper time to submit constitutional amendments to the people is at a general election when the people can, if theyso desire, change It the Government and the Constitution at the same time. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) vainly asked why the Commonwealth Constitution was not submitted to members before this bill waE brought forward, so that they might consider it in relation to the Government's proposal. His question is likely to remain unanswered. This bill deprives hundreds of law-abiding industrial organizations of legal protection. It destroys the federal organization of trade unions in much the same way as if the but for Federal Constitution was destroyed, and we returned to the old situaThe Attorney-General tion of State versus State. It takes away from those organizations which have loyally accepted arbitration, amdng trade unionists. the protection of their legal charters. It nullifies industrial awards which it took trade unions thousands of pounds to obtain. It uproots a system of industrial jurisdiction which, though admittedly a fruitfu l cause of litigation in the past, has nevertheless now become stabilized as a result of High Court decisions. This proposal, if carried through, will not only deny legal security to hundreds of thousands of wage-earners, but will also inflict injustice upon tens of thousands of so-called middle-class workers-clerks , _ actors, journalists, &c -the majority of whom have supported this Government in the past. Those workers waited for a long time for decent economic conditions. I speak with knowledge on this matter, because prior to being elected to this Parliament, 1 was secretary of a clerical organization. I remember that when the living wage in the State of New South Wales was £3 a week, many of these clerical workers with fifteen or sixteen years' service to their credit, were receiving only about 35s. a week. The conditions prevailing in banks were shocking, as the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) knows well. Even eight or nine years ago the extent to which sweated conditions prevailed among clerical workers would astound honourable members. Now these law abiding unionists, whom honourable members opposite profess to represent, are to be denied the protection of arbitration. Take, for example, the journalists, those men who play such an important part in moulding public opinion in this country. Until they received their award in 1916 from Mr head of the New South Wales Nationalist Justice Isaacs their conditions were bad, and their remuneration very low. The dame thing might be said of the school teachers, and many other workers of that kindsurely knows that school teachers do not come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. of that. tion of the State. many of the other workers the honourable member has mentioned. under the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. My remarks are directed generally to the defenceless position of this class of workers. Before arbitration was extended to them this class of worker was even more defenceless than were the wage-earners. factor that led more than anything else to the revolt of the middleclass workers against ditions, was the fact that when the basic wage in New South Wales was raised in 1918 from £2 15s. to £3 per week, those middle-class workers did not share in the increase. This led them to organize on industrial lines, and to deprive them of the rights they won through their organization will be a very serious matter from the point of view of honourable members opposite who look to them for support. Here is what the secretary of the Merchant Service Guild has to say about the conditions prevailing in that industry before the institution of arbitration:Before tiie first Commonwealth award was would be logical to abolish also the promade, the conditions of employment for tection accorded industry by the tariff. masters and officers on tlie Australian coast w,»re little short of slavery. There was nu regulation of liours or overtime and officers frequently worked up to 120 hours a week, while 84 hours a week was about the average. In the event of the Federal Arbitration Court being abolished there is no guarantee that the State industrial tribunals will be extended. The nominee and property franchise Upper Houses of the State legislatures constitute a barrier to the liberalization of existing State tribunals. We have already had a declaration from Mr Bavin, the Government, that it is proposed to reorganize the Industrial Court in that State. Queensland, under a Nationalist administration, proposes to do the same thing. In Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia, the existing industrial tribunals are hopelessly inadequate, so that the positions of large sections of workers in those States will be very serious if this bill is passed. MiddleThey are under the jurisdicclass workers will suffer the most. If the bill is passed the stability of a large number of businesses will be destroyed, and confusion will be caused in manufacturing industries governed by federal awards. There is a marked disparity in not only the relative, but also the actual State basic wage which' operates in the various States. I do not desire to quote the numerous opinions of judges on the desirableness of retaining the federal arbitration system, but the The following statement which appears in a recently published book, The Fixation of Wages, by Mr Anderson, an 1 their conacknowledged authority on arbitration, is suggestive:It would appear that the case for the regulation of industries by State industrial authorities is not a very strong one. Mr Anderson argued the case from the point of view of the employers, and drew attention to many anomalies which exist under the present State law. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) stated, and as most economists agree, it is eminently desirable that the same authority should control tariffs and wages awards. If the protection of wages by the Arbitration Court is abolished, it",78,Bhuce

217,Mr Coleman,"The journalists areOne section of industry should not be protected at the expense of the other. It appears to me that the passing of this bill must bring about a reduction in our wage standards, for the federal basic wage will become a thing of the past. It will no longer exist in even the maritime industry, for the bill contains no provision for the fixing of a standard basic wage. Any interference with our economic standard of living must adversely affect price levels and rents, and so bring about economic disaster. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham), in his speech on the bill, stated that it had only recently been decided that certain of the trade and commerce powers of the Commonwealth could be exercised in relation to industrial matters. It is a pity wrong. It is quite definitely laid down in that the honourable member did not amplify his statement' and indicate the way in which the decision to which he referred affected the power of the Arbitration Court. This bill has undoubtedly been drafted in a cunning fashion. It is designed with the object of preventing the acceptance of any important amendment at the committee stage. Some Government supporters are deluding themselves with the idea that they will be able to amend the bill in committee, but, you, Mr Speaker, very well know, that amendments must be in conformity with the title and subject matter of the bill, otherwise they cannot be accepted. It would appear, therefore, that the Government is leading the House on to a veritable quick-sand of deceit, with the object of entrapping its followers. bill will founded. It will be useless as a means of preventing trouble, and must, inevitably, increase the irritation that already exists in the maritime industry. The bill does not seek to vest exclusive control over the maritime industry in the Commonwealth, for its provisions will apply only to interstate ships and wharfs dealing with interstate and overseas ships. Intra-state ships and wharfs from which intra-state ships depart will be conthere is a 44-hour aet. Your suggestion that trolled by State awards. from which overseas ships depart will be controlled by the federal authority. But this control will not extend to overseas ships such as those operated by the Mr Coleman. Canadian-Australian and the AustralianNew Zealand lines. As a matter of fact, the bill is a hotchpotch of the confused ideas of a legal theorist. Ridiculous and absurd anomalies will be caused, for two or more sets of conditions will apply on the waterfront. Intra-state and coastal shipping will be subject to conditions which will differ from those applicable to interstate and overseas ships. How on earth such a system can be expected to bring harmony into industry, I cannot conceive. The measure must inevitably cause countless difficulties. The idea which some honourable members opposite seem to hold, that it will give complete plenary power over the maritime industry, is utterly the bill that the Commonwealth authority shall be limited to interstate ships, and the interstate and overseas wharfs from which such ships are worked. The anomalies that must inevitably be caused by the system occurred to Captain W. G. Lawrence, secretary of the Merchant Service Guild, in Sydney, who wrote to the Attorney-General on the subject. But the only reply he received was that he should discuss the matter with the shipowners. Captain Lawrence then wrote to the Attorney-General in the following terms:Some of our members work part of a month in tlie interstate trade and part of a month in the intra-state trade, either on the same vessel or possibly on another vessel. Unless, therefore, their conditions of employment were common to both trades the gravest confusion The would arise, particularly with regard to all those rights which flow from continuous seris a political freak which vice under one set of conditions. Another make confusion worse conquestion is the difficulty of determining with any accuracy just when the vessel ceases to be interstate in character or vice versa. I foresee the utmost difficulty in preserving industrial rights to employees unless the conditions of employment are uniform for both State and interstate trades. On the question of extending interstate provisions by means of State tribunals, here again there seems to be but the remotest hope that this will be possible. Not only has it to be recognized that each tribunal has a large personal element about it , but the industrial laws in the various States are anything but. uniform; for example, in New South Wales The wharfs the purely intra-state employers may consent to accept the interstate award will be put to the test; but I fear that there are even greater elements of difficulty here than would exist in an effort to secure uniformity by medium of all the State tribunals. The inescapable prospect is that utter chaos, together with injustice to the employees, will take the place of the present peaceful and contented manner in which the industry is working, so far as my members are concerned. It is to be hoped that the decision of the Government in the matter is not irrevocable, or that a closer examination of the situation will eventually convince the Government of the dire consequences of shattering the one uiece of legislation which has promoted and sustained in almost every instance both industrial peace and industrial justice. The Attorney-General replied to the following effect:.1 suggest that you should approach the ship-owners direct, and suggest that your members will be prepared to work the intra-state trade upon interstate conditions if the employers will consent. I think that you will find that the employers will be prepared to welcome the suggestion. The futility of such a scheme must be apparent to everybody. I propose now to examine some of the principles of the bill. First of all, the definition of "" organization"" is ambiguous and unsatisfactory. status is given to an organization. There may be a multiplicity of organizations, which can have no other effect than to cause a state of war in the industry. We shall undoubtedly have "" scab"" shop, or in this case, ship, organizations on the American plan. doubt whatever that the object of this provision of the bill is to smash the power of the maritime workers' organizations. There can be no other reason for inserting it. The powers proposed to be vested in the Minister also call for criticism. The administration of the measure will be semi-political in character. The Attorney-General will have a large measure of discretion in determining who may constitute the boards to be set up under the bill, for he will ""have power to select the representatives. The organizations will be permitted to suggest the names of representatives, but the appointments will be made by the Government. is in error in making that statement. The appointments can be made only on of any disclosure which would result from the recommendation of the chief judge. the order upon any trade secret or the Suggestions may be made to the judge, financial position of any person. who will recommend the appointments to H o w c a r e f u l l y is the interest of the emthe Minister. read the bill, but the inference I drew from it was that the Minister would exercise the power of appointment. The proposal to appoint the representatives for a period of three years is also open to serious objection. The fact that the proceedings before these committees will not be open to the public is calculated to undermine the confidence of the workers in the tribunal, as also is the fact that no viva voce, or verbal, evidence may be tendered. Then again, the committees will be empowered to take into consideration the probable economic effects of proposed awards. This will apply to even the basic wage, so that the protection which was accorded the basic wage in the amending arbitration act passed last year has been removed. Under this measure, not even the basic wage will be safe. This is worthy of comment, seeing that Sir Neville Howse, campaign director for the Nationalist party at the last election, made great political capital out of the No legal fact that the Government had protected the basic wage from examination iu the light of existing economic conditions. The undoubted effect of removing this exemption will be that coolie competition and price-cutting in the maritime industry will determine the economic ability I have no of the industry to pay a certain wage standard. Coolie competition will be possible because of the suspension of certain sections of the Navigation Act. Absurd anomalies will be caused because ships trading between Australian aud New Zealand ports, will not be subject to the control of the Commonwealth awards. As I have already said, the Canadian-Australian line will also be excluded from Commonwealth control. It is interesting to notice how careful the Government has been to safeguard the interests of the employers. There will be no disclosure of the financial position of the shipowners, unless the court orders it. Clause 34 provides that before making any order for the disclosure of information and the production of documentsThe court shall consider the probable effect ployers safeguarded in every d i r e c t i o n.",83,Bhuce

219,Mr Coleman,"I may have misI t is provided that the present judges of the Arbitration Court shall constitute the Maritime Industries Court. Government has been hard put to it to find positions for the Arbitration Court judges, but it is not justified on that account in incurring the heavy expense that will be entailed in setting up the overmanned Maritime Industries Court. The judges of the Arbitration Court draw £11,500 annually in salaries, and the other expenses of the court amount to £15,500. The total cost of the court is, therefore, £26,000 annually. Wakefield ( Mr Collins) elicited the information, in reply to a question, that it was anticipated that the passing of this bill would result in a saving of £10,000 per annum. I challenge the Attorney-General to indicate how that saving will be effected, seeing that more than half the cost of the present court will be spent on salaries to the members of the proposed Maritime Industries Court, and a good deal of the balance of the £26,000 will be spent in salaries to the conciliation commissioner and his staff. The principles upon which the bill is based are calculated to promote industrial unrest in the maritime industries, and it would appear that the Government is determined to take a retrogressive step rather than a step forward. It fails to realize that in the present age education is a potent factor in industrial unresr. The workers are not prepared to'accept a lower standard of living than they now enjoy, and the Government, instead of talking about destroying. that standard, should direct its attention to its improvement. Ministers are like so many political beggars on horseback, riding to a hell of chaos and industrial anarchy. Many members on the Government benches have climbed into power on the votes of trade unionists, who believed that they stood for arbitration and the basic wage principle as set out in the Nationalist policy. But to-day those workers find themselves basely betrayed by the introduction of this legislation, for which there is no mandate from the people. This is an act of political treachery and cowardice. It is a political confidence trick. ber must withdraw that remark. Mr Coleman. say that the tactics of the Government in The regard to this bill indicate a measure of artifice and ingenuity, in endeavouring to justify its actions, that is unprecedented in the annals of this Parliament. Immediately after the conference held in Canberra in May last between Commonwealth and State Ministers, the Australasian Council of Trade Unions announced its decision to launch a campaign throughout the Commonwealth as The honourable member for a protest against the proposed partial abolition of federal arbitration. During the last few weeks, honourable members have received letters and circulars from organizations in all parts of Australia containing strong protests against the bill. Many of the resolutions mentioned are framed in practically the same words, which suggest to me that the communications are not forwarded voluntarily, but under pressure from the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. At the May conference, the Prime Minister discussed many matters of vital importance to the people, and particularly referred to the presence of two systems of Commonwealth and State arbitration. In placing the matter before the conference he saidThe Commonwealth Government, as a result of the considerations which I have submitted to you, is definitely of opinion that either extended powers must be conferred upon the Commonwealth, enabling it to exercise sole control in industrial matters, or the sole responsibility must be assumed by the States. It has been recognized for many years that there has been considerable difficulty in beneficially administering the present, act. I intend briefly to trace the attempts made by various governments to improve the position. It has been claimed by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that he launched three referendums. Certainly he was the Attorney-General in the Fisher Labour Government in 1911 to 1913, when the people were asked to amend the Constitution to confer additional industrial powers on the Commonwealth. In 1919 the Hughes Nationalist Government made a further appeal to the people; but, unfortunately, they again refused to grant honourable memthe increased powers asked. It remained for the Bruce-Page Government in",85,Bhuce

It is absurd for the right honourable member for North Sydney to claim that the referendum of 1926 was not taken in the best of faith. He complains that there bad not been a sufficiently active educational campaign to induce the people to realize the great importance of this matter. Reid( Mr Coleman) agrees with the right honourable gentleman, and he asks that the people should be appealed to on a fifth occasion, claiming that if they were, they would probably grant the increased powers. The honourable member for Reid remarked that the people had not been sufficiently educated on the matter; but the fact remains that on four occasions the electors refused to grant these increased powers asked for, by referendum, by the Labour and National Governments. [Quorum formed.] The present time might be opportune for of the wide interest that has apparently been caused by the campaign announced by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. It is on record that the Prime Minister on no less than five occasions has endeavoured to meet the difficulties surrounding tbe administration of the Arbitration Act. In the first place, at the definite conclusion that the present he launched a referendum and a great deal of expense was incurred. All the Ministers and members of the Nationalist party, and to some extent members of the Labour party, conducted a campaign throughout Australia, and every attempt was made to ensure its success; but unfortunately the proposals were defeated. A second attempt by the Government, and by the Prime Minister in particular, was made when a special delegation was sent to the United States of America to study the industrial conditions there. On this body all the conflicting industrial interests were represented and no expense was spared. Every possible assistance was given to the commission, both in Australia and America; but, unfortunately, there was not that co-operation that we were entitled to expect among the members of the commission. Separate reports were forwarded to the Government, and little notice was taken of them, because of their divided nature. Even then the .Prime Minister did not despair. He made a third attempt to improve the position by summoning a peace conference. Invitations were sent to various organizations throughout the Commonwealth, and it was expected that these bodies of both employers and employees would have sufficient confidence in the Prime Minister to pay him the compliThe honourable member for ment, at least, of meeting in conference and trying to arrive at an agreement. It is extremely regrettable that the Australian Workers Union, one of the strongest labour organizations, refused even to send delegates to the conference. It meant that the Prime Minister was again unsuccessful in his commendable efforts to improve the relations of the opposing sides in industry. The .fourth attempt took the form of several important amendments to the Arbitration Act whicli were expected to improve its administrative functions. This effort has not been successful. His fifth proposal was made when he appealed to the a further appeal, because State Governments' representatives at the May Conference to surrender voluntarily the powers that the Commonwealth needed to enable the Pederal Arbitration Court to function properly. In the course of this appeal, the Prime Minister saidThe Commonwealth Government has arrived duplication of powers i u the Commonwealth and the States is not only unsatisfactory in principle, Imt in practice, it is responsible for serious economic waste and for irritation of personal relations between employers and employees. The present duplication imposes grave handicaps upon Australian industry, both primary and secondary. It seems to me that the attitude of the State Governments should be placed on record in Hansard, The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) said that there was no guarantee that the States would provide compulsory arbitration for the workers if the Commonwealth withdrew from the field. Before one can decide that matter,'I think that it will be necessary to study the report of the May conference, and see exactly what attitude the States took. The Acting-Premier of New South Wales stated that his Government was not prepared to transfer full industrial powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. Sir William MacPherson, the Premier of Victoria, said:As to the vital question of the arbitration system, upon which the Prime Minister has dwelt) I say frankly that my Government could not recommend to the State Parliament that full power to legislate in regard to industrial matters should be handed over to the Commonwealth. If, on the other hand, the Commonwealth Government, after these years of trial, sees fit to stand aside and allow the States to deal with their own industrial affairs, we shall be quite prepared to accept that obligation. As one who has had some 30 or 40 years' experience in business, I say that the operation of the Arbitration Court is solely responsible for the way in which we are suffering, both industrially and financially, in Australia to-day. So far as industrial legislation is concerned, we are quite prepared to shoulder the burden and to deal with our own people. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) has claimed that the arbitration system in Queensland is more satisfactory than that of the Commonwealth, and :.hat under it the timber workers' strike would have been settled long ago. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) replying to an interjection by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr ArchdaleP a r k h ill ) , said that the shearers in New South Wales struck for the higher rates of wages that were being paid in Queensland under a State award. Those expressions of opinion show that in at least one State there is an excellent system of arbitration that should make a highly satisfactory substitute for the federal system. federal awards were in force on the 22nd August, 1929, compared with 252 State awards and determinations that were in force on the 31st March, 1929. I particularly wish to show the attitude towards this proposal of the Premier of Queensland, because he has taken exception to some statements that have been made by representative leaders of the Labour party. A t the conference held in May, he saidThe most important of the questions to engage our attention is, perhaps, that of our industrial relations. I personally should have preferred the Commonwealth Parliament to have been accorded by the people of Australia the riglit to take over the whole field of industrial legislation. Had that been done we should not now be suffering the disadvantage of having different systems operating in the various States. Under these varying systems, competition in certain industries has become very acute, and has rendered almost impossible the successful carrying on of some of them. I realize that the position to-day is difficult, and rather than have over-lapping systems of arbitration, I should prefer the States to manage their own industrial affairs. Mr Mackay. Queensland recognizes that the shackles on industry must be removed. I am perfectly frank. Where there is responsibility there must also be authority. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) argued that the South Australian Government is opposed to the principle of arbitration, and that there is no guarantee that the States can make provision for the settlement of industrial disputes. The first of those allegation? is disproved by the following statement made by the Premier of South Australia at the May conferenceThe Prime Minister dealt with the subject of industrial laws. I say frankly that my Government would not recommend to the South Australian Parliament that the field of industrial legislation should be wholly transferred to the Commonwealth. I do not take that attitude because of any petty reason, or because I think that the Commonwealth Government could not deal with the problem, and would not do what it thought best in the interests of the States. But we are convinced that most of our industrial troubles are local, and that because of .geographical and geophysical differences, it is almost impossible to make a common rule for the various States. We realize the responsibility that will be thrown upon us if the Commonwealth relinquishes the greater portion of its control of industrial affairs. It w ill be seen that the South Australian In Queensland, only 24 Government f u l l y realizes the responsibilities they will be called upon to bear, and are prepared to shoulder them. There is only one other Premier whom I desire to quote, and his opinion should carry weight with honourable members opposite. .1 allude to the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Collier, who saidI should be inclined to restrict the activities of the Federal Parliament rather than to extend them. [ admit that there are some industrial questions over which the Commonwealth should have control, and they would be questions of common interest or concern to all the States. It would be possible, of course, for one State to fix, by legislation, wageB and working conditions that would operate to the disadvantage of competitors in other States. I would not advocate that the Commonwealth Parliament should vacate altogether the field of industrial legislation, but in the main I should prefer it to be controlled by the State Parliaments. I should feel somewhat diffident about asking my Parliament to hand over to the Commonwealth complete industrial powers. Our people would be quite willing to undertake the responsibility of setting up industrial tribunals to replace those that are now controlled by the Commonwealth. When he had heard those expressions of opinion the Prime Minister thought it was his duty to tell the State Premiers where the Commonwealth Government stood. I u the course of a very able speech he showed the disadvantages under which the Commonwealth was working, and referred to the many efforts that had been made to remove difficulties. He summed up in these wordsThe Prime Minister then stated that if all the State Governments had concurred in recommending the transfer of f u l l industrial powers to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Government would have been prepared to assume f u l l responsibility. The position was, however, that all the States concurred in refusing to take such action. He had already explained that the Commonwealth Government was not prepared to remain in the field of industrial legislation unless f u l l powers were transferred. He, therefore, announced that the Commonwealth Government would submit to the Commonwealth Parliament proposals for the repeal of Federal legislation on industrial arbitration, subject to transitional provisions for the continuance of Federal awards and agreements for a period sufficient to enable the States to assume f u l l control. The Commonwealth Government proposed to retain control in shipping and waterside industries where the Commonwealth Constitution conferred sufficiently extensive powers to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to handle the questions arising. Lt canuot be said that action was taken hastily. The Government can claim to have explored every avenue for a way out of the difficulty in which they found themselves. In all the circumstances, honourable members on this side at least w ill agree that the action taken was perfectly justified. The National party, as a whole, does not believe that industrial arbitration should be abolished. Sof a r as the workers are concerned, it will not be abolished, and they w ill not be left at the mercy of the employers. There are two sections in Australia which the National party wishes to discourage. One is the old-time Conservative, who would submit the workers to long hours of employment and low rates of wages; and the other is the extremist, who is continually preaching class hatred and fomenting industrial strife. [Quorum formed.] If any person wishes to be given an illustration of the attitude of the National party as a whole, he w ill find it in a few sentence? uttered by the Prime Minister during a recent visit to Queensland. He then saidI am not trying to destroy the trade unions of this country. WhatI am trying to do is to protect them. I am convinced that unions are part of our social system, and are essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth. Unionism must stay, but it has to be a trades unionism controlled by the workers themselves, and not by a few extremists. Honourable members who sit on this side support that statement. If they thought that the workers would suffer as a result of the partial withdrawal of the Commonwealth from the field of arbitration they would vote against the bill. But they are not of that opinion. Tens of thousands of workers in Australia are working peaceably under awards of the federal court. We submit, however, that they will be equally well provided for by State tribunals. I have already quoted the honourable member for Herbert in confirmation of that assertion. existing court, which is to be reconstituted. ber for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) can rest assured that the present Government in Queensland will realize its responsibilities, and I am sure that the court w ill be reconstituted in a manner which w ill not in any way injure .the workers. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions is, doubtless, responsible for the present, agitation against the abolition of the Federal Arbitration Court, as that organization has passed resolutions which have had the effect of in j u r in g the confidence of the workers in the Commonwealth court. It cannot be denied that this organization was supporting the timber workers in their defiance of the award of the Arbitration Court. On one occasion a representative of that body said that it was inconsistent to pretend that the Commonwealth arbitration system was operating in the interests of the workers. A further illustration of the attitude of organized labour towards the court is contained in the statement made in Perth by Mr Grayndler, the secretary of the Australian Workers Union, as reported in the Worker on the 21st May, 1928, in these wordsBe was confident that practically all the unions which have federal awards at the",86,Bhuce
223,Mr Fobde,He was referring to the,89,Bhuce
224,Mr Mackay,"The honourable mempresent time will have nothing more to do with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as soon as the awards expire. . He further saidFor some considerable time there has been disquietude in industrial circles at the manner in which the Commonwealth arbitration was being influenced politically, and at the convention of the Australian Workers Union, held in February last, it was decided that even the pastoral industry brandies of the union should be authorized, if they so desired, to apply for State awards. These statements confirm the attitude of Labour organizations generally. When the Commonwealth arbitration system was originally instituted it was said that the workers were expected that it would lead to the abolition of industrial warfare. Jurisdiction was to be confined purely to interstate disputes, but to-day disputes arising in any part of the Commonwealth are artificially made of an interstate character, and matters of purely State jurisdiction have been taken to the Commonwealth Court. Of course this unforseen development has led, as the Prime Minister pointed out, to a good deal of overlapping. There has been conflict between Pederal and State authorities and general industrial confusion. This has undoubtedly hampered development. A.t a conference of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, held in July, 1927, it was stated by a delegate that the Commonwealth arbitration system was detrimental to organized labour. Resolutions were passed in which it was declared that a perpetuation of arbitration was against the best interests of the Commonwealth. Australasian Council of Trade Unions held in 1928 the unions were recommended' to withdraw from the Federal Arbitration Court. already been mentioned in the debate, wrote an article headed "" The Curse of Compulsory Arbitration, "" in the course of which he said:It is impossible to estimate the moral harm which has been done to the Australian working class by its hasty and ill-considered acceptance of arbitration as a solution of labour's problems. All these quotations clearly show that there is a general objection to the present arbitration system and that the opposition now being shown to this measure is Ur. Mackay. purely a political move. Doubtless the members of the Opposition would like the Prime Minister to apply the closure so that they could use such an act for political purposes; but the right honourable gentleman has assured honourable members that the debate may continue so long as they desire. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) in speaking on the Transport WorkersB ill in this House, saidWe, on this side of the House, and the trade union movement outside, are willing to admit full responsibility for any breaches' of the law that may be committed. Such laws as those passed by the Bruce-Page Government, dealing with industrial matters, are to obey the awards, and unworthy of observance. There is not sufficient accommodation in all our gaols to hold the people who are committing breaches of the industrial laws passed by this Government. Recently the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, a body which is truly representative of the trade unions of Australia, decided to sever all connection with the Bruce Page Arbitration Court. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), in speaking to the same measure, saidEver since 1021, Labour has felt that the Arbitration Court has been only partially fulfilling its true functions. At the Labour conference held in that year, it was resolved that it would be desirable to replace the court by industrial councils on which both the employers and the employees would be adequately represented. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) contended that the Arbitration Act was a travesty on arbitration. All these statements clearly show that there is a very marked difference of A t another conference of the opinion among honourable members opposite as well as among certain Labour organizations. The statements I have quoted represent the true attitude of Senator Rae, whose name has labour towards Commonwealth arbitration. The members of labour unions approach the Commonwealth Court when it suits them and the State Courts when they think they can obtain better terms. We heard unrestrained and relentless criticisms of the court before the Prime Minister announced the Government's intention to abolish it , but since that announcement has been made it would appear that its former opponents are anxiou3 to prove what a friend it has been to organized labour. I am strongly of the opinion that it is the definite policy of the Labour party to refrain from assisting in any system of co-operation between the employers and the workers. Many unionists make no secret of the fact that it is their desire to destroy the present economic system. They are making every effort to render the investment of capital unprofitable and every hold-up in industry is a step in that direction. Honourable members on this side stand for conciliation and arbitration in the settlement of industrial disputes, and for the maintenance of the necessary safeguards to ensure the payment of reasonable wages and decent working conditions. Until the people are prepared to give the Commonwealth the necessary power to enable the Commonwealth Court to function effectively it is not unreasonin the Brisbane Courier of the 1st June, able to ask the States to undertake this responsibility. It cannot be said that the Government has neglected to explore every avenue in an endeavour to secure peace in industry. On five occar sions it has tried to find a way out of the difficulty, and that is the best recommendation of its sincerity in this instance. -In submitting this proposal for the abolition of federal arbitration the Government has committed an act of grave injustice to a very large section of the workers of Australia, and I regret that we should have to debate this measure at 3 o'clock in the morning. It cannot be denied that its object in introducing this measure is to facilitate a general reduction of wages in Australia. It will be actGovernment knows that even its own ing in collusion with the Nationalist Governments in five of the six States, which will reconstitute the existing State courts in such a way that the workers will receive nevertheless, this statement appeared in A set-back from which they will take a long time to recover. In the matter of arbitration and a general improvement of the workers conditions the Labour party has a very creditable record. Before the advent' of the Labour party employers believed in the old system of freeis being struck at approximately 750,000 dom of contract under which the workers .were reduced to a state of poverty and were compelled very often to accept "" tucker"" for services rendered most progressive. It has always endeavoured to assist in improving the laws, and in modifying the power of oppressors throughout the world. It has ameliorated the conditions of living of the great majority of those in the countries in which its influence is felt. Although we may not be successful in preventing the passage of this bill, a day will come when the Labour Government will again be in power, and be able to' re-establish federal arbitration. Then why should the Government cause this dislocation ? The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) said that the Premier of Queensland, Mr Moore, was not opposed to the repeal of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In this connection, let me quote something which appeared clearly setting forth the Premier's views. It is headed, "" Industrial laws-Premier' s conflicting viewsMr Moore against repeal."" Then appears the following telegram, sent from the Courier's Sydney representative:The, Premier of Queensland ( Mr A. B. Moore), before he left for Brisbane, said that he opposed the repeal of the federal arbitration legislation when it was under discussion at the Premiers' Conference at Canberra. I venture to predict that within ten years there will be a return to the federal system. Mr Moore knows well that there will later be in power a Federal Government that will be pledged to re-establish federal arbitration. he predicts. supporters are deserting it on this question. No one can accuse the Melbourne Age of being a Labour newspaper; a recent issueAn institution which has become an integral part of a nation's life for a generation is not to be tampered with hastily, petulantly, or in a period of panic or industrial pessimism. The Age realizes that in this bill a blow workers throughout Australia.

When, however, the Government was asked to withdraw the prosecution against Mr Holloway, who was a sick man, it was said that the prosecution could not be interfered with, and that the law must rake its course. He was fined £50, and would have gone to gaol except that some of his friends came to the rescue, and paid tlie fine for him. imposed upon the Waterside Workers Union, although this money had to come out of the pockets of the workers, who were not so well able to pay it as the wealthy John Brown would have been able to pay any fine imposed on him. In workers were afraid to come under the Federal Arbitration Court. While the Labour Government was in powpr in Queensland there was in existence one of the finest arbitration acts in the world, and the Arbitration Court meted out jusrice to both sides. That court, however, is not to remain in existence any longer, but to be reconstituted by the Tory Government. [Quorum formed.'] This Government is committing an act of political cowardice in seeking to evacuate the field of federal arbitration. It is a retrogressive step, and will, I beany reference to the present proposal of lieve, result in the defeat of the Government when next it faces the electors. Because the Prime Minister could not obtain f u l l powers from the States, he proposes to hand arbitration entirely over to the States to deal with. That is not the act of a statesman, but of a man who It imposed heavy penalties is shirking his responsibilities. It is no wonder that the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) said that the news of the Government's determination came to him as a great shock. We now find that the members of the Prime Minister's party were not consulted before he arrived at his decision. It was stated in The Canberra Times that the Attorney General was so indignant at the Prime Minister's action in withdrawing the the prosecution against John Brown that he threatened to resign from the Cabinet, he did. At because his position would be untenable, and it would be impossible for him to administer the arbitration laws of this country. Apparently the Times had some inside information, because it went on to say that the only remedy was to repeal the Arbitration Act, so that the Attorney General would not have the action of the Government over the John Brown case thrown up at him every time he put the law into operation against the unions. The position of honourable members opposite who have spoken their minds in defiance of the Nationalist party machine is precarious, and I am reminded of thf A fine of £1,000 was lines of Jane TaylorThough man a thinking being is defined, Few use the grand prerogative of mind; How few think justly of the thinking few, How many never think, who think they dor We know that these members will be disciplined by their party, and will probably Queensland large sections of have the Nationalist endorsement withdrawn. The Nationalist party has boasted that it gives its candidates absolute freedom to speak as they like in Parliament; yet the first time a few of its members exercise that right, they are excluded from party meetings and threatened with political extinction. The honourable member for Fawkner must havo made some honourable members think seriously when he said that neither in the Governor General's speech nor in the policy speech of the Prime Minister before the last general election, was there the Government.

Honourable members opposite have contended during this debate that the Commonwealth arbitration system has failed because the awards of the court cannot be enforced, but they did not say that during the last election campaign. On the contrary they made a point of the fact that the Government had an arbitration policy which would compel both employers and employees to adhere to the decisions of the court. The campaign director of the Nationalist party in New South Wales, Sir Neville Howse, issued a book of notes for use by Nationalist speakers.

But we are told to-day that the court must be abolished because of the impossibility of enforcing its awards. This story is different from that told to the electors. The fact of the matter is that the Government sought and obtained a mandate from the people to strengthen the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. It certainly had no mandate to abolish it. The book also contained the following paragraphThe following are the main principles embraced in the new Arbitration Act as brought in in conformity with that policy and passed:(1) Preventing of overlapping between Federal and State tribunals. (2) The correlating of the awards of the courts with economic realities. (3) Development of a system of voluntary arbitration as distinguished from compulsory arbitration.

Many returned to the Treasury bench. The speech of the Prime Minister in introducing this bill must be put down as an admission of the dismal failure of the Government to carry out its arbitration policy. The right honourable gentleman now wants to hand the task over to some other authority. When the Attorney General introduced the amending A r b i tration B ill on the 15th September last he saidThere are 149 wages agreements filed in the court and under most of these industry is working peacefully and on the whole satisfactorily. The Attorney-General did not at that time consider that the Commonwealth system of control had failed. A careful reading of the campaign notes of the Nationalist party prior to the last election fails to show that the Government had the slightest intention of abandoning the field of industrial arbitration. Speaking on the subject in December, 1927, the Attorney General said:The abolition of the court would not solve any problems; on the contrary, it would create uew problems. On the 28th A p r i l , 1928, the honourable member said:Those who say that arbitration has broken down are not acquainted with the facts. At that time the honourable member was a great federalist, and he spoke as a champion of the Commonwealth system of conciliation and arbitration. He shared the views of the late Hon. A l f r e d Deakin, who, in the heyday of his political life, said:Tlie ideal of the Constitution is equality and that a few Australian manufacturers do uniformity in all national matters. With that end in view, it prohibited the imposition of taxation in such a way as to discriminate between States or parts of States. The ideal can hardly be realized if uniformity of protection is coupled with wide diversity in the conditions of manufacture. Effective and useful as State industrial laws have in many cases proved, their operation is circumscribed by State boundaries, and it can hardly be claimed for them that they do or can secure uniformity in the conditions of manufacture throughout Australia. No authority but the Commonwealth Parliament can do this, and the attempt to do it in the way that has been outlined is in fullest harmony with the federal aims and character of the Constitution. What has happened lately to cause the Attorney-General [Quorum formed.] honourable members should be compelled to discuss this bill at 4.10 a.m. They could have been called together every day next week to debate the subject in reasonable hours. But the members of the Government need not imagine that by adopting these shock tactics they will wear us down. We shall fight the bill to the bitter Ur. Forde. end, although many supporters of the Government are asleep in other parts of this building. If this measure is repealed the protection which 140 organizations and 400,000 workers of this country enjoy w ill be removed. If the electors were asked to determine whether the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should or should not be abolished I feel sure that they would give an overwhelming majority in favour of the retention of the court. In my opinion the Government has introduced this measure after consulting with the Nationalist. Premiers of the States. This is a conservative action inspired by large conservative employers of labour and Nationalist leaders principally outside of Parliament, who desire to break down Australia's standard of living. While we have federal as well as State awards, it is more difficult for Tory Nationalist Governments to lower the workers' standard of l i v in g ; but with only State courts appointed by Nationalist governments, who would probably see that friends of the Employers' Federation were placed on the bench, it would be an easier matter to bring about a wage cut and to increase the hours of work than if the Federal Arbitration Court were continued. I am sorry to say not realize that a reduction of wages would mean a reduction of the purchasing power of t h e ' great mass of the workers who are the main customers of shopkeepers and tradesmen such as drapers, butchers, bakers and fruiterers. In the United States of America high wages are favoured because it enables the people to be well fed and clothed, and thus money is kept in circulation. A wage-cutting campaign, which I fear is about to be launched, would be disastrous to the community. I believe that a large section of business men would be opposed to it . Only to alter his views? the Nationalist party and big conservaIt is disgraceful that tive employers are in the forefront of this fight. The Melbourne Age, in a recent issue, made no secret of the intention of a large section of employers to use their heads with the Federal and State Nationalists Governments to bring about a general wage cut. It said:It is, however, no secret that their ambition is to get the whole system of compulsory arbitration discarded, and the old individualistic freedom of contract doctrine re-established in all relations between capital and laboura shameless forcing back of the hands of the clock to the concepts of 50 years ago. . . . There are people who for profit would renew some at least of the appalling conditions that obtained in the early stages of the industrial era. Prominent men such as Nationalist leaders, presidents of employers' federations and of chambers of commerce, from one end of Australia to the other, have talked of the necessity for reducing the cost of production While they have not had the courage to state on the public platform that they favour a general reduction in wages, they admit in private conversation that in their opinion wages must come down. As long ago as June, 1922, the Prime Minister was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, in an article by the financial editor of that journal, as follows:Mr Bruce, in his speech at the dinner of the Commercial Travellers' Association gave evidence that he had entirely grasped the significance of the high costs of Australian production and the falling world prices in relation to Australian economy. Equally he burked the real issue, the necessity of more economical living on the part of the whole population of the continent . . . Part of the remedy is a reduction of wages. That is disagreeable, and is sure to be fought against . . . Yet an appreciable reduction in the cost of living cannot be brought about unless a reduction of wages takes place. Since that date concerted action has been taken to produce an atmosphere suitable for a general cutting down of wages. We find that a deputation representing employers, recently waited on the new Minister for Labour in Queensland, MrH . E. Sizer, and requests were made to him as follow:A reconstructed Board of Trade, with fair rein the memory of Senator Thompson. He presentation for all interests. Amending acts dealing with industrial matters to give the board discretion as to hours. The elimination of the four Saints' Day holidays and the substitution in their place of ANZAC Day. The amendment of the Industrial Arbitration Act to provide that payment by results on a fair basis shall not be prohibited. These requests were preferred with a view to whittling away the conditions enjoyed by the workers of Queensland. At some of the meetings of the Employers Pederation we find the arch priests of conservatism. Of course, there are exceptions, but there was an occasion in Queensland when the minutes of a big meeting of the Employers' Federation reached the hands of Mr Forgan Smith, who read them in the State Parliament, and their accuracy was never denied. That meeting was held at the Union Bank Chambers, Queen Street, Brisbane, on the 24th January, 1922, to determine what should be the future policy of the Employers' Federation in that State in opposition to the request of the workers for improved conditions. At that gathering Mr W. G. Thompson, from Rockhampton, now Senator Thompson-a n estimable gentleman personally, but a representative of the ""die hard"" conservative : interests-mad e the following contribution to the debate:There is another aspect of the strike matter, and that is this. Have we any machinery able to provide for armed forces? Is there any machinery to-day by which you can put your hand on some reliable force to put against the forces ofGeneral THOMPSON -If you have a few regulars, it is wonderful what they can resist. I have seen 500 men in the shearers' strike held up by 75 mounted infantry. Of course, he meant that armed forces would be used in opposition to the demand of the workers. In dealing with some of the points raised, Mr R. Bowen said:W it h regard to the question of an organized force, I say there is none, and I do not know that we would have.any chance of arranging any just now. No doubt they had in mind the fact that there was a Labour Government in Queensland at that time, and it would not tolerate the employment of armed forces against the workers, as happened in the 1891-1894 strike, which was green was probably one of the leaders of the 75 mounted infantrymen who, he said, had kept at bay 500 men during the shearers' strike. With the Employers' Federation at the elbow of the Nationalist Premier in Queensland, the workers will not get the fair deal that they have rereceived up to the present time. The Rockhamption Morning Bulletin, a Nationalist newspaper, commenting on the statement by Senator Thompson, saidGeneral Thompson evidently had in mind the formation of an irregular force-no t the ordinary force of the Crown which is at the",92,Bhuce
232,Mr E. Bowen,"Hooliganism .disposal of His Majesty's Government to maintain the authority of Government. They had in mind the formation of an irregular force which could be used to their own advantage. He wanted men of the type of the ""Pinkerton Thugs,"" who are a feature of industrial strife in America to-day. According to the minutes of the meeting of the Employers' Federation, the president ( Mr C. W. Campbell) showed the influence that that association could wield with the Tory party in power. saidOn many and many a night we have gone up to the House when the Liberal Government was in power and secured alterations in the legislation going through, which have all been for your benefit. (Addressing employers.) They were in touch with us all tbe time the tramway strike was on. How could organized workers in Queensland place any confidence in a re-constituted arbitration court that would hear their appeals in that Statei f the bill were passed by the Moore Government at the dictation of conservative employers? Mr Bowen at the meeting of the Employers' Federation, saidMTow we put through a Queensland Arbitration Act in 1916, which to-day is thrashing tis right and left because it was not thoroughly both Federal and State, and place the altered during the ""time when it went through the House, and because there was not a man in the House to closely watch it. . . We want to be in a postion to have money at our baok, and to keep a man to watch our interests, and to pay for it. Other evidence could be furnished of the hostility of the big employers to Arbitration Courts that have given the workers a f a i r deal. Mr (now Senator) W. G. Thompson, who at the time was the President of the Central Queensland Employers' Association, said in 1921I am personally not a believer in the Arbitration Court, certainly not as constituted in Queensland, and therefore regard our many defences put up here as simply efforts to prevent matters going worse with employers. To-day he is prepared vote in another place for the repeal of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, and to place the whole of the workers of Queensland at the mercy of a State court in which he said he did not believe. Tho Queensland Ur. Forde. representative of all the big pastoral companies of the State, also is opposed to arbitration. In one of its issues it saidTo institute successful immigration, we must first burn our arbitration acts and abolish the basic wage and price fixing. Doubtless some Tory pastoralists -would reduce the wages by one half. I have to which I have referred, shown what is thought of arbitration by the persons from whom the National parkin Queensland obtains funds to fight elections, and to whose representations any l i e is reported as having National government in that State must listen sympathetically. Eveni n his second reading speech, the Prime Minister saidThe obvious answer to our problems is to reduce our costs of production. I should like him to be more specific, and to have the courage to say, what he and every conservative leader in Australia to-day undoubtedly think, but fear to say, that is, that there should be a general reduction of wages. The honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) who was a Cabinet Ministerf o r some years, was very definite in a speech that he made on the 2nd A p r i l , 1924. He then saidI would remove the sugar embargo and do away with Arbitration Courts and high tariffs. He would abolish all arbitration courts defenceless worker at the mercy of an unscrupulous, sweating employer, who, when there was a surplus of labour, would have, a man who had to support a wife and children working for 30s. a week or even less. That is what honourable members opposite stand for, but they have not the courage to say so. Another big employer, MrA . A . Simpson, C.M.G., past-president of the Adelaide Chamber of Manufacturers, in a statement published in the Adelaide Register oh the 14th May, 1928, saidWe employers are sick of being cited to the Arbitration Court. They would prefer to be in a position to dictate what the workers should accept. It is not only manual workers who are to cast his appealing to the Government not to abolish the federal court. There are about 140 organizations registered in the court, including the Australian Journalists Association, the intelligentsia of unionism. Those gentlemen realize that it will be Pastoral Review, which is a very bad thing for them, and have sent a circular letter to every member of the Federal Parliament. One can see at a glance that it has been written by a trained journalist. They say of this proposalI t will penalize our Association and members just as efficiently as if we had been def r o m 6 in the morning t ill 6 at night, or registered by the Court for an illegal action. We shall be deprived of our character, and all our efforts for the last twenty years in building an Australian professional organization will be shattered by dividing our Associf a m i l y circle and have the companionship ation into separate and independent bodies.

It would be difficult to more adequately describe tbe principle of Federal conciliation and arbitration than it has been outlined by the Attorney-General. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), in speaking on an amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act on 17th May, 1928, said. . . . Another suggestion was that only two industries-the shipping and the shearing industries-were the affair of the Commonwealth. That, of course, is quite wrong. There members on this side of the House will are many other industries which are nationwide in their ramifications. The Attorney-General made these comments on 29th May of the same yearThe Arbitration Court, despite some defects in its machinery, which this bill endeavours to remedy, is to-day doing most useful and valuable work. The Minister for Markets and Transport ( Mr Paterson) said that, although Commonwealth arbitration legislation had been amended on twelve different occasions, the number of strikes was still increasing. But most of the amendments to which the Minister refers were made by the present Government, and the strikes which have occurred during recent years have been in consequence of the amendments which this Government has made. are due not to our arbitration system, but to the unsympathetic manner in which the act has been administered by this Government. Reference has been made to the duplication of awards, much of which could be avoided, under a system of unification. cation of awards by a system of coordination. Abolition of the federal arbitration system would mean industrial barbarism; its abolition is supported only by those who prefer all arbitration, systems and legally endorsed industrial agreements to be eliminated. The Prime Minister may assume the role of a purist and say that he is concerned not with low tactics but with high principles, but his object is to mislead this House and the people of Australia. His somersault is inexplicable. In 1926, the need for federal arbitration courts inspired the various Ministers to glowing eloquence. To-day not one of them is prepared to support the systemPolitical leaders with principles so elastic can scarcely expect to receive the support of a thoughtful public. Neither the Prime Minister nor his Government ean produce an atom of evidence that the Australian people, particularly trades unionists, are desirous that the Pederal Arbitration Act should be repealed. Its repeal was not mentioned during the election campaign ojf 1928. Por 25 years the federal arbitration system has operated with much success. Honourable readily grant that there has been an occasional failure, but on the whole it has done much very useful work. It has maintained working relations between labour and capital, and prevented grave industrial crises, which would certainly have arisen if there had not been a court to which an appeal could be made. The defence of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General has been riddled through and through with controverting facts. During a period of 25 years the number of unions under federal jurisdiction has increased sevenfold, and now represents 80 per cent, of the organized workers of Australia. One hunderd and fifty awards of the Federal Arbitration Court are operative, and practically one-third of these met with the common conMost of the strikes sent of parties. Is recurrence of strikes a reflection on the Court? A brief analysis will explode such a theory. During the first twelve years of the court's operations neither strike nor stoppage in industry occurred, and within the last eleven years only three We should avoid dupliinterstate disputes have arisen in manufacturing industries. Labour was in control of the Treasury bench from 1910 to 1916, and during that period, our Arbitration Act was administered in such a way that only three strikes occurred. The Attorney-General said two years ago that it was out of the question to consider that the federal industrial machinery could be scrapped, the result of twenty years' effort set aside, and industrial disputes left to the jurisdiction of some non-existent body. Is that the same Attorney-General who spoke in defence of the measure now before the House? One cannot expect any group of men to be intelligent at all times, but one can, and does, expect them to make an effort to be a little more consistent than this Government has been. Arbitration Court is to go because the Prime Minister and his colleagues, in the interests of somebodyI am not prepared to say whom-ha s decided that it must go. It seems to be part and parcel of a concerted attack on the wages and livin g conditions of the workers, not only in the Commonwealth, but throughout the whole civilized world. Another reason for the retention of arbitration is that if State were set against Statei n granting arbitration awards the unscrupulous employer would make the resultant confusion serve his sordid ends. who would make profit out of human beings still exists. There are some who would gladly get r i d of the FederalA r b i tration Court, solely as the stepping-stone to get r i d of all arbitration courts and in except in so far as trade union action has dustrial laws. safeguard were gone, it would then be much easier for these people to refute the State safeguards. argument in favour of abolishing State courts then would be the precedent laid down by this Government in the abolition of this Federal Arbitration Court. people are f u l l y aware of this peril. They have a right to demand, before the Federal Arbitration Court is abolished, that they should be consulted. on this side of the House are confident of the result. ""We acknowledge that there are drawbacks to the existent system of industrial legislation, but we know that these would be indescribably greater if we drifted under the Government's proposition back to industrial barbarism. There must be some sound reason for the opposition of the workers to this proposal when their representatives are prepared to fight it in this House even in the small hours of the morning. They do not wish to lose the protection which they have enjoyed for the last 25 years. What are the causes of the workers' present discontent which finds expression in wasteful strife, or in still more wasteful restriction of effort and output? The thinking worker makes five main complaints against the existing industrial system:1. For all his toil it does not supply hi in, in most cases, with an income sufficient to give Mr Long. a comfortable livelihood for himself and his dependants, together with a margin for enjoyment and saving. Apparently the Pederal 2. Industry has failed to give 'him security of livelihood, however eager and willing to work he may be; accident, a spell of sickness, or a shortage of work, due to no fault of his own, may at any moment throw him out of employment, use up his savings and inflict hardship' and humiliation upon his dependants. Of all these menaces, unemployment is the most feared, and it inspires the belief that there must be something wrong with a social order in which, amidst flaunting luxury, such insecurity haunts the life of the worker. 3. The existing industrial order denies him the status which seems proper for a free citizen. He may be dismissed at a week's or a day's notice, or even less, and thus deprived of his livelihood without redress or appeal, perhaps for no better reason than that he has offended The type of employer an autocratic foreman. While, as a citizen, he has an equal share in determining the most momentous issues about which he may know very little, in regard to his own work, on which he has knowledge, his opinion is seldom asked or considered and he has practically no voice in determining the conditions of his daily life If the larger industrial secured it. Indeed, where management is inefficient and autocratic he, the worker, is frequently compelled to watch waste and mistakes of which he is perfectly well aware withThe most powerful out any right of intervention whatever, and this despite the fact that when these errors issue in diminished business for the firm concerned he, the worker, and not the management, will be the first to suffer by short time workThe ing or complete loss of employment. 4. Knowledge of the financial results of industry and of the division of its proceeds is denied to the worker, and of this fact he is If they were, we becoming increasingly resentful. He has little means of judging to what extent he is in fact participating in the fruits of his own labors, or whether or no he is getting a square deal. Thus his dissatisfaction witli the existing order is proportionately intensified. 5. The worker believes that the products of industry are unfairly divided between capital and labour. That under the capitalist system society is divided into two parts; a small class of masters who own the means of production, or live luxuriously by owning them, and a huge class of workers who reeeive in return for their work only what they can force the owners by collective bargaining through arbitration channels and trade union movements to pay. He believes that under such a system there can be for his children no true equality of opportunity with the children of the more fortunate classes. This bill, if passed, is calculated to breed in Australia something which the Nationalist party professes to be opposed to, namely, communism. The only alternative to arbitration is what the Communist party believes in , and to which the Nationalist party has now apparently been converted, and that is direct action. The Labour party does not stand for it ; we belinve in arbitration, and particularly feasral arbitration. Anyone who has the welfare of his country at heart will fight against the introduction of a system which is bound to create discord in industry. During every election campaign in recent years the members of the Government, through the press and from the platform, have tried to discredit the Labour movement by connecting it with the Communist party. Not one act of the Labour party, however, can be pointed to as being consistent with any part of the preamble to the Communist party's platform, but the Government, in bringing forward this measure for the abolition of arbitration, is doing exactly what the Communist party would do if it were able. The only thing the Government is consistent in is the inconsistency of its attitude towards the workers. The Government supporters say one thing on the platform, but practise another thing in this House through the legislative enactments sponsored by the Government. We have reached the stage when we must ask ourselves whether arbitration is good or bad. I believe that arbitration, and particularly federal arbitration, can be proved to have done a great deal of good. Great stress has been laid upon the few strikes that have occurred under the federal system of arbitration, but not one word has been said about the many strikes that have been prevented as a result of the activities of the Arbitration Court. The Government must have some sinister motive in attacking the arbitration system. If arbitration is bad, why has it taken this Nationalist Government seven years to find it out? Whatever defects exist in onr present federal arbitration system have been added to it by the various amending acts for which this Government is responsible, and the worse of these are the penal provisions which"" the Government now admits to be ineffective. It is a peculiar thing that the ineffectiveness of tbese penal clauses was not discovered until they were directed against one of the employers. They were quite effective, apparently, when brought into operation against the waterside workers and the timber workers; but the employers, when they broke the law, were allowed to slip through the meshes in the legal net because it was said.'that there was no evidence to substantiate the charge of a lockout. Someone made the statement that this bill sounded the death knell of federal arbitration. It may, or it may not,' but I am more inclined to believe that it will sound the death knell of the present National Government. The paramount issue at the next Federal election will be the abolition of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. It is disgraceful that honourable members should be compelled to remain here all night to discuss this subject. We would not object to sitting in the House every day and night of the week to deal with such national problems as unemployment, the exploitation of foodstuffs and the manipulation of the money market. But to oblige us to debate this bill all night is unworthy of any government. This is class legislation in the worse sense of the word; yet honourable members opposite continually prate about the necessity for creating a better feeling between capital and labour, How can they expect anything but discord when such unjust laws are proposed? It appears to me that some honourable members opposite would deny the workers the right to live. To-day in practically every city of the Commonwealth there are workers and their wives and families on the verge of starvation. This adds to the iniquity of the Government in even suggesting the abolition of the Arbitration Court. We shall resist the passage of this bill to the last ditch. Honourable members opposite have argued that it is necessary to reduce the cost of production in Australia; but why should they adopt the cowardly policy of attacking the bottom dog? They should go after the proprietors of the great monopolies of Australia and the banking combine. orable member realizes that the price of money would be reduced if Russia would pay her debts to Great Britain. able member for Bass would devote a little more attention to Australia and a little less to Russia this country might be better off.

This bank saved the country from bankruptcy during the war years, and it is capable of rendering other great services to the nation. bill is, in my opinion, part of a. general offensive, the object of which is to reduce office. the Australian worker to the standard of the coolie. Our workers do not receive real wa.ges to-day. The small increases they secure from time to time are at once swallowed by the increased cost of living. The pound sterling of 1911 has a purchasing power of only lis. 3d. now. Everybody knows that if the worker loses Mr Long. a day during the week he is unable to pay his bills on the following Monday morning. This is a deplorable state of affairs. I was interested and amused to hear one honourable member opposite draw attention to the number of days and amount I suggest that the cost of of money lost by the workers annually through strikes. The honourable member did not say anything about the far greater As a matter of fact the losses incurred through unemployment. Many men are behind prison bars to-night In these circumnot because they are criminals, but because they have been denied the right to work, and so have been unable legitimately to The position of the Austraobtain food and clothing for themselves of working days lost last year through unemployment was 22.9; and the percentage lost through strikes was 1.5. There is every reason, therefore, why we should But unfortunately attack the unemployment problem. This Government is attacking the men who are unable to put up a fight for themselves, and yet Ministers would have us believe th,at they are statesmen. Bills of this description savour not of statesmanship, but of vindictive tactics towards those who are least able to protect themselves. That would Compulsory arbitration, as honourable members on this side have experienced it, has not failed. This Government, however, has failed most miserably to administer sympathetically a system that has tenths of the employees working under industrial awards in this country have loyally obeyed them, and should not be penalized if the remaining tenth cannot be disciplined. The Government has got the country into such a hopeless muddle financially, industrially, socially and in every other way that the people of Australia wonder why they were gulled into putting it into power at the last election. If the last policy speech of the Prime Minister had indicated that he intended The introduction of this to bring down a bill of this description, his party would have been deprived of By two of its actions-the withdrawal of the prosecution of John Brown and this attempt to repeal the Pederal Arbitration Act-the Government has displayed a complete disregard of the principles of responsible government. I warn Ministers and their supporters that by thus flouting the law they have created a dangerous precedent, and other citizens may feel justified in adopting a similar course at some future date. The Government prates abouit law and order and its desire for peace in industry; but twice, since this Parliament met in February last, it has flouted the law. When a worker is compelled to fight for his life, from an econofields of New South Wales could be mic stand-point, the Government pursues him, without giving him any opportunity to justify his action. If the bill is passed into law the Government will have great difficulty in satisfying the people on the next appeal to them that it has acted in their best interests. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) referred to union secretaries and other union officials as parasites on industry. He would have commanded more respect from honourable members on this side if he had completed the list of those who are not only parasites on industry but on society as a whole. The Government has attacked the only citadel that the workers have. It is necessary for them to employ organizers and secretaries to watch their interests, because they cannot themselves give the necessary time required to watch the repeated attacks made on them by the other parasites whom the honourable member for Warringah forgot to mention. I speak from experience. During the upheaval in the railway service of New South Wales in 1917, I tried repeatedly for a fortnight to prevent that strike; but when my colleagues left the work-shops I went with them, and I was denied the right to work in the industry for 3^ years. If the members of unions employ and pay organizers what has it to do with the honourable member for Warringah, who has also been a paid secretary of a much larger organization, and whose salary was a drain upon industry? There is considerable difference between, the salary he received and that paid to the average union organizer, who is expected to justify himself in his employment and must do so to retain his position. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis) made the fallacious statement that the mining industry in Australia had failed owing to the operations of arbitration courts. I suggest that the present condition of that industry is due tofluctuationsof the metal market, and the exploiting of high grade ores by grasping mining companies, which have left behind payable ores in large quantities. I was reared in a mining environment, and I assert with confidence that some of the coal mines on the northern worked to-day if it were not for the fact that the parasites, hungry for profits, > have taken the inside out of them, leaving behind a large percentage of payable ore. The town of Cobar is now ruined because that policy was adopted. Did arbitration cause the closing of Mount Boppy when it was the richest gold mine in Australia? Three men are to-day working the property on tribute, and have made hundreds of pounds there. Did arbitration courts cause the shutting down of Minmi and other collieries ? No. The cessation of work was due to the fact that the owners took advantage of the cheaper and quicker means of transport of the coal to the market by developing the mines nearer the railway line. So they closed down the other mines and left a large percentage of the nation's coal resources to go to ruin. The honourable member for Kennedy will perhaps tell us next that arbitration courts_ killed the iron and steel industry, and were responsible for the sale of the Commonwealth Line of steamers. We shall be told next that awards of the court have been responsible for the closing down of Cockatoo Island dockyard, and the loss of thousands of pounds of the nation's wealth by the throwing idle of machinery which is going to rack and ruin while this country is being flooded with goods made by Asiatics, but branded "" made in England"" for the purpose of securing an entry to Australia under the 10 per cent. British preferential tariff. We shall be told that those awards have been responsible for making the Senate chamber red and this chamber green. I do not know what next they will try to push down our throats. The Government would like to treat us as though we were children. But while they talk of the scientific aspect, we deal with the practical side. Every effort that we can make to prevent the abolition of the federal arbitration sysConfucius is unchallengeable, Parliament tem will be justified. Unquestionably the object of the bill is to attack the wages of the workers. I may not know a great deal about Parliamentary etiquette, but I speak from the bottom of my heart, because I candidly believe that the abolition of the federal arbitration system will be the forerunner of the repeal of State arbitration legislation. This Government is establishing a dangerous precedent, which the State Governments will follow. Honourable members opposite wish to revert to the "" get together "" system. Let me give a few examples of the way in which that system operates. I have participated in conferences with employers. The employees place all their cards on the table, but the employers, instead of exhibiting a reciprocal or even a conciliatory spirit, come along with a schedule of demands and lay them on the table with the ultimatum "" There are our conditions; take them or leave them "". It is a case of the survival of the fittest. The Government has deliberately brought into being an army of unemployed, and the man who is first on the scene and who is prepared to do the work most cheaply will be given the preference when any employment is offering. ley) -The honourable member's time has Addressing this Parliament two years ago expired.

If the dictum of is not a body that will ever reform the world; because we are not allowed by the standing orders to call either men or things by their right names. Fifteen months ago this Government gave a solemn and definite undertaking to 'preserve the system of federal control in the industrial field. Nowi t is decided that no fewer than 149 unions, representing 80 per cent, of the organized workers of the Commonwealth, shall be denied the right to have their wages and industrial conditions regulated on a uniform basis by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The electors have not given the slightest suggestion of a mandate to abolish the court. The action of the Government is a barefaced repudiation of declarations made from time to time by the Prime Minister and other members of the Government, who are now doing their level best to defend this act of political sabotage. As far back as 1926, during a referendum campaign, the Attorney-General told members of the Nationalist party in Sydney that they could not abolish this system of arbitration except at the risk of putting back the clock a century. He also said that the effect of abolishing the federal system would be to create indushe made the following emphatic statement :is out of all question to consider seriously that this' industrial machinery future to the adjudication of .some, at present, body.

Speaking on the motion for the second reading of that bill in this Parliament on the 17th May, 1928, the Prime Minister saidThis measure has been introduced with the sincere desire to enable compulsory arbitration to operate successfully in this country, and if possible to bring about the realization of our great .ideal to establish new and improved standards in industrial affairs. The Attorney-General was even more emphatic when introducing the bill on the 15th December, 1927. He then saidThe Government that the general abandonment of industrial legislation in Australia, which is sometimes suggested, would not solve any problem, but would open the way to a period of social and industrial unrest the Government is not prepared to accept the responsibility. Lateri n his speech he gave reasons why the Government could not scrap the Pederal Arbitration Court. He saidThe expressed opinion of some is that the whole system has serious defects which cannot be amended, and that, therefore, it should be ended. The Government does not at the present time subscribe to that view. The abolition of the court would not solve any problem. On the contrary it would create new problems without any satisfactory means at hand for solving them. Further, he is reported in Hansard, vida page 3283, as follows:The Government is not prepared to abandon compulsory arbitration. . . . We have constitutional power to utilize conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, and I have always beeu of the opinion that tlie power to prevent industrial, disputes by this means has not been sufficiently utilized. The law in the past has dwelt too much upon the subject of the settlement of disputes as distinct from their prevention. The Attorney-General is now doing his of Court, although he has admitted that such an act would result in continual industrial unrest. that the Government is abolishing the Commonwealth Court with the deliberate intention of bringing about a chaotic condition in industry. Other members of the Nationalist party were equally emphatic in their declaration that the Government had not the slightest idea of interfering with the present system of arbitration. They declared themselves to be the staunch supporters of the court. I have before me the opinions expressed by some other honourable members, including the honourable member for Warringah ( MrP a r k h ill ) , who saidI am not one of those who believe in the scrapping of compulsory arbitration. The Nationalist party stands for compulsory arbitration, and it is clearly wrong to lay the least charge against the Government that it is endeavouring to subvert or undermine the principles of compulsory arbitration. Mr Ley, the ex-member for Barton, when a member of this House, statedconsiders The Government stands four square for arbitration. No one who has heard the Attorney General can truthfully say there, was the slightest indication on his part that the Government intended to scrap the arbitration for which laws. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr. D . Cameron) is reported in Hansard of the 23rd May, 1928, vide page 5130, in this wayA system which for the past 24 years has been working satisfactorily from the point of view of tens of thousands of workers must be continued. . . . We believe arbitration is an effective instrument for maintaining the industrial peace of the country and for controlling industrial conditions. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, .Senator Sir George Pearce, in dealing, with the subject of arbitration on the 12th June, 1928, saidThe Government does not propose to abolish compulsory arbitration, but to attempt in so far as it is able under the Constitution as it now stands, to remove some of the difficulties that now exist. On the 12th June, 1928, Senator Foll expressed himself in this wayI am a firm believer in the principle of conciliation and arbitration. Senator Kingsmill, on the 13th"" June, 1928, saidI believe in the principle of arbitration -I utmost to secure the abolition tliink it has not fallen short of achieving its the Commonwealth Arbitration objective. I do not say that it has failed. What must the electors think of such gentlemen, who so strongly affirmed their It would appear f a it h in the federal arbitration system only fifteen months ago, and who now so brazenly pretend that they are justified in the action which they are about to take? Nine months ago the PrimeM in ister and his supporters sought the suffrages of the electors on the plea that if they were returned the present system of arbitration would be maintained and every effort would be made to ensure more peaceful conditions in industry. A. perusal of the speeches of every member of the Nationalist Country party during the election campaign will clearly show that there was not the slightest suggestion' that this act of political treachery or sabotage was to be perpetrated. The electors were told that the Arbitration Act was to be amended in such a way that industrial disputes would be prevented. Surely the abolition of the Pederal Arbitration Court is a matter of major importance; but, at the general election held nine months ago, the Government did not give the slightest indication of its intention to act in the manner now proposed. The Government cannot claim that it has received any mandate from the people for its high-handed action, nor can it justify its repudiation of the promises it made only a few months ago. I have before me a pamphlet issued during the election campaign, entitled "" The Claims of the Bruce-Page Government,"" from which I quote the followingThe measure most fiercely debated during last Parliament was tlie new Arbitration Act. It has been attacked on the ground that the motive of its authors was to undermine trade unions. It does nothing but give the control' of unions to unionists, improve opportunities for conciliation, and diminish friction Although the farmers of Russia in between State and Federal Courts Australia cannot maintain its high standard of living, pay high wages, and exclude coloured labour unless its producers are able to avail themselves of the most scientific methods and the most expert advice. It is interesting to note that during recent months the Commonwealth Government has had the advice of certain experts from Great Britain, known as the British Economic Mission. I have always been highly amused at the idea of gentlemen from Great Britain here to advise us, because I believe that the country from which they come should first place its own house in order before its representatives attempt to dictate to the people of Australia. Conservative and Liberal Governments of the old Tory type have been in office in Great Britain for several hundred years, but to-day that country is confronted with a national debt of eight thousand million pounds. According to a report of certain expert advisers the industries of Great Britain are sixteen years behind those in progressive countries, its steel industry is collapsing, the railway systems ilr. Tully. are losing £7,000,000 annually, its textile industries are slipping and the mining industry, according to Mr Baldwin, the ex-Prime Minister, is in such a parlous condition that it was unable to pay a living wage. That gentleman said that the miners had to accept work at less than a living wage, and that there were 250,000 miners in England and Wales who could not possibly hope to find employment in the mines. Notwithstanding these staggering facts certain gentlemen came from England to this country to tell us how to improve our economic conditions. If those who are so interested in the welfare of the Dominions spent in their own country some of the millions which they invest in foreign countries, at high rates of interest, in building decent homes for the workers and in improving their industrial conditions their opinions would be received with more respect than they are to-day. The simple remedy for unemployment is to increase wages. With poor wages a country cannot be progressive. I happen to know the conditions under which a number of poverty-stricken farmers in this country are carrying on. pre-war days were producing enough grain to feed the world those engaged in this production and the women who live with them were compelled to subsist on rye bread. The dairy farmers of Denmark, which country produces the finest butter in the world, use margarine, and the Japanese who produce the finest rice, import an inferior commodity with which to feed their workmen. On one occasion when the right honourable being brought the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) was addressing the House he referred to unemployment as a consequence of tbe awards of the Arbitration Court. There are no arbitration courts in America, where the worker does not receive the protection that he does in Australia. Although 42,500,000 men and women are remuneratively employed in the United States of America, less than 5,000,000 are members of trade unions. The financial history of America records a series of panics which occurred about every ten years, and when these crises occurred the bankers, as well as the rest of the people, suffered. The position became so intolerable that the bankers set their experts to work to suggest a means of avoiding panics. From a pamphlet issued in AmericaI quote the following: The financial history of America is a record of a series of great panics coming at intervals of from seven to ten years. In these crises the bankers used to suffer as well as the rest of us; but this was intolerable to tliem, and so they put their experts to work. To save yourself in a panic you must have moneya great deal of money in a hurry, and where can such money be got? Where, but from our good old Uncle Sam. So the bankers devised a wonderful new scheme, the Federal Revenue System; a chain of twelve regional banks, with a directing head, a banker-board, having for its function to watch over our money system in the interest of the bankers, to lend money freely when they want it to be cheap, and to so call in loans when they are ready for a killing; above everything else to watch out for panics, and when these come, to issue credit to the big insiders so that they can keep afloat while the rest of us drown. In the summer of 1920 there was a riot nf speculation, and the Bankers Board decided that somebody had to be ""deflated"". They picked out the farmers. Who cares anything about ""hicks "" out in the sticks ? "" Go home and slop the hogs "" was the word of a banker legislator iu North Dakota to a delegation of farmers. So the Federal Reserve Board"" advised "" the farmer banks to lend no more money to faruicrs, and one little hint was enough to bring farm prices crashing. Before the crisis was over a total of 603,000 farmers had either lost their farms or were keeping them on sufferance of their creditors; and those are Government figures, Judd! You know how it was with produce that year-the farmers in the middle west burned their corn for fuel, and out here in Southern California it didn't pay to gather the orange and lemon crops. But tlie prices of automobiles and hardware and lumber. and cement did not share this harsh fate; the big Wall-street banks had all the credit they needed, and they "" carried '* their friends, the big manufacturers, whose stocks and bonds repose in their vaults. They were "" sitting pretty"", and waited till the storm was over, and we were ready to buy their goods at the old fancy prices. I may be asked what that has t.o do with the subject under discussion. My answer is that financial panics bring about unemployment which it is the duty of this Government to prevent. The farmers were also mentioned during the course of this debate, and it was contended by honourable members opposite that the farmers were anxious to have arbitration scrapped. If I mistake not, the farmers of this country know exactly on what side their bread is buttered, and in that mighty nation of the United States of America, if there is one section more than another which has reason to take exception to the conditions under which it lives, it is the farming section. In the summer of 1920 there was a riot of speculation in United States of America, and the Bankers' Board decided that somebody ought to be deflated. Who cared about the hicks in the sticks ? "" Go home and slop your hogs "" was the advice given by one banker in North Dakota to a deputation of farmers which waited upon h i m . The bankers advised that no more money should be advanced to farmers and the hint was sufficient. Before the crisis was over 603,000 farmers had either lost their farms or were keeping them on sufferance. Those are the official government figures. The prices controlled by the combines, however, did not f a l l . Those engaged in the lumber and cement industry, for instance, did not suffer the harsh fate of the farmers. The big W a l lstreet banks saw that they had all the credit they needed. They carried their friends, the big manufacturers, whose stocks and bonds were in their vaults. Those manufacturers sat still u n t i l the people were ready to buy their goods again at fancy prices. The workers in this country, or any other, have_ very little chance of getting on, or very"" little hope of looking to anything better than the old-age pension, the workhouse, or the old men's home when their working days are over. I have here a table drafted by the National City Insurance Company of New York, the richest insurance company in America. It was trying to persuade the people to take out insurance, so that the money would come back into Wall-street, and allow the merry game' of speculation to go on. Those who prepared the table took as an example 100 people at the age of 21, and asked what would be their position when they were 65. One, it was said, would be independent, four would be well to do, five would be working for a meagre living, 36 would be dead, many of them for want of attention that money would have secured, and 54 would be dependent upon others. Out of the entire 100 only fivo would be in satisfactory circumstances. There you have a picture of what the richest nation in the world has been able to achieve in the way of promoting sound, human happiness. We have been asked to follow that example. More than twenty years ago Poster Eraser wrote a book called America at Work. In that book he tells how he visited many big factories in United States of America, such as boot factories, engineering shops, &c, and in one of them he said to the manager "" There is one thing I miss-Wher e are your old men V "" That is very easy to answer,"" said the manager. "" If you will get on this car, and light a cigar, I shall show you where the old men are."" They pulled up at the nearest cemetery, and the manager said "" There they are-to o old at 40."" We should be better off to remain where we are than to introduce into this country a system which puts men in their graves at the age of 40. I saw one example in Australia of industry conducted on the American pattern, ancl if the men working in that industrylive to be 40 they will be lucky. That was at Lysaght's iron foundry, Newcastle, where the men are working on piece rates. That is an example of American industry up to date. I have one more quotation to make, taken from the report of an investigation made recently into economic conditions by Professor E. F. Gale, of Harvard, and Professor Mitchell, of Columbia. This report* recently came into the possession of the Development and Migration Commission, and in it Professor Mitchell says:Belief in the economy of high wages has become prevalent among the abler business executives, much as belief in increasing productivity has become prevalent among the abler trade union leaders. To find a market for the wares turned out by mass production and urged on consumers by national advertising, it is patently necessary to have corresponding that we must turn our faces away purchasing power in the hands of the consumers. Since studies of the national income have demonstrated that wages constitute by far the largest stream of personal income, it follows that wages per man-or , rather, wages per family-mus t be increased as production is expanded. I hope that this bill will not pass its second reading, but that it will be defeated. results I , and the other honourable members on this side, will not be perturbed. We are not job conscious. a.m.] -It is not the fault of honourable members on the Opposition side of the House that this important subject is being discussed at this hour of the morning. I think it will be admitted by honourable members on both sides that a measure of such importance should have had more time allotted for its consideration. However, it is the dictum of the Government that the bill has to be rushed through, but no reason for this undue haste has been given by any honourable member who has spoken in support of this destructive piece of proposed legislation. No measure ever before introduced by a Federal Government into this Parliament has been received with such hostility as this, not only by honourable members on this side of the House, but by a number of honourable members on the other side. It is refreshing to note that when a government, as in this case, strays so far from its policy as propounded at the election campaign, some of its supporters at least have the courage and manhood to stand up and tell it so'. I thought that we had reached a stage when the work of Parliament could be done without these protracted sittings, and when free and open discussion might be allowed upon all measures, and certainly upon a measure such as this. As was stated by the last speaker, and by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), there seems to be some hidden reason for the introduction of this legislation, a reason not disclosed by the Prime Minister or by any of his supporters. The very men who stood for the regulation of industry by arbitration only a short while ago have suddenly, for some unknown reason, decreed from arbitration, and cease all interference with labour conditions except in the case of the maritime industries. Only a few weeks ago one member of the Ministry had the temerity .to speak, in favour of unification. I do not know whether he was caned by the Prime Minister, but he has certainly become very pliant since then and is to-day supporting Whether or not an election his leader in an endeavour to pass this the most anti-Federal measure ever introduced into this Parliament. This bill seeks to break down the power of the Commonwealth, ancl, therefore, it should be resisted by every honourable member who believes in Federation.",104,Bhuce

The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis) spoke of sitting round a table and settling disputes in Queensland by the ""get together"" method. It has also been my lot to assist in the settlement of industrial disputes by the round-table method in New South Wales and other States. But I can remember the time when the employers flatly refused to meet their employees to discuss wages and conditions. They said, "" There is your work and there has been closed for seven years, and are your wages; take them or leave them."" The first strike that I remember was not for an increase in wages, but for a conference to discuss working conditions. The employers met the men after a cessation of work which lasted for three months, and a voluntary authority was set up to deal with grievances. Subsequently the State Government established an industrial court of a kind. This was followed later by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. As the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) pointed out on Wednesday evening, industrial arbitration has been a live issue in FedA good deal of the money at present ineral politics ever since that time. The majority of our employers and employees have grown up with the system. I can remember only one case in which a serious deadlock occurred owing to the refusal of one of the parties to obey an award of the court. This is a good record. No law is obeyed perfectly. As for the repeal of the Industrial Peace Act. a matter of fact, people will not obey It is remarkable that the provisions of an unjust law. for bad laws. opinion the award which caused the refound to be ultra vires. When attention cent dislocation of the timber industry was drawn to this significant fact, some was bad in every respect. It was never little while ago, the Attorney-General really acceptable to either side. awards may be expected occasionally from not submit their case to the board men who are totally unacquainted of inquiry rather than cease work. with the details of an industry; but, on Although this bill is presumably brought the whole, the awards of the Commondown because the timber workers are wealth Court have been reasonable and supposed to have flouted an award of the practicable. It is only recently that a court, colliery proprietors in New South tendency has been shown by judges Wales are deliberately locking out 12,000 of the court to give undue consideration workmen and causing unemployment to the claim of one party to a dispute. The reasons given on behalf of the Government for the introduction of this I know something of the bill have not been satisfactory. I believe that the measure has been forced upon us by the influence of persons not resident in the Commonwealth. We have been visited recently by the British Economic Mission and other influential persons from overseas, who have exercised a big influence upon the Government. I do not desire to say anything detrimental to the gentlemen who are making the inquiry into the coal industry, but I point out that of the ten collieries into the affairs of which the commission will inquire one another, after paying 100 per cent, in dividends for a long while, is now working at only a quarter of its capacity. It is unfair to determine the degree of profit made in the Maitland coal-fields by inquiry into the affairs of such collieries as these. The colliery which paid 100 per cent, in dividends is operated by a company the capital of which was subscribed in £10 shares, but the shares were only paid up to £6 and then declared to be fully paid up. When the mine was making such huge profits the shares boomed and reached the astounding figure of £54. vested in the mine was invested on the basis of £54 for a £10 share, and the owners of those shares expect enough profit to be made to pay them a reasonable rate of interest on the shares for which they paid £54. {Quorum formed.] The bill provides, among other things, that measure were used for a long while it became necessary to use them to disSuch asked, by interjection, why the men did throughout the country.

But the present Government appears to favour retrogression rather than progress. No bill has been criticized more ably and fairly than has this measure, and the Government would be well advised if it withdrew from the position that it has taken up regarding it. I do not look upon the introduction of the measure as an error of judgment so much as a deliberate attempt to weaken industrial arbitration.

This House adjourned last March, and did not re-assemble until the 14th August.

Now, after a few weeks, they are forced to When they remain in this chamber hour after hour. The present sitting has already lasted for seventeen hours, and we have been considering one of the most momentous measures that could be discussed here. The bill provides for the repeal bf the No Arbitration Act, but one industry will remain under federal jurisdiction. As the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) remarked, this is a retrograde step, and one for which the Government has no mandate from the people. I claim that it has a mandate from them to continue the present arbitration laws, although the Prime Minister has expressed the opposite view. It has been said that, when the last appeal was made to the people, the Prime Minister proThe mised that this act would not be interfered with. I haye also heard honourable members opposite say by interjection that that statement is not true.

Dealing with industrial matters, the right honourable gentleman said:Continuity of any employment is essential if those results are to be obtained.

The 'Attorney-General does not like to hear the speech he made in 1027 quoted against him to-day, particularly as the views he expressed in 1927 are totally different from those which he holds today. I have often heard it jocularly . remarked that Hansard should be dispensed with, and if that course had been adopted some time ago the Attorney General would not appear so ridiculous as he does to-day. Although the awards of the A r b i tration Court have not always been obeyed in their entirety there are other laws of the land, which are at times disregarded by certain sections of the community. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) recalled the conditions which existed prior to the in traduction of an arbitration system and showed how strikes were sometimes prolonged for months because there was no court to intervene. During the election campaign the Prime Minister did not suggest to the people that the arbitration policy which he once so strongly supported would be abolished. On 17th May, vide Hansard page 5001, he saidWe should endeavor to define the industries over ' which the Commonwealth would havo control, and that those industries should be set out in the Constitution, the States having complete and strict jurisdiction over all others. to such an extent that it is now After many months of careful examination, it was found impossible to decide how industries should be classified. Another suggestion was that only two industries, the shipping and the shearing industry, were the affairs of the Commonwealth. That of course is quite wroug. What was "" quite wrong"" apparently quite right in 1929.

Mr Lacev. an amending Arbitration and Conciliation B ill was passed by Parliament in the exact for m which the Government desired, and the main proposals of that measure were set out by the Attorney General under the following main [Quorum formed.] headings :1. Prevention of overlapping between Federal and State tribunals. 2. The necessity for co-relating the awards of the court under economic realities. 3. Development of a system of voluntary arbitration as distinguished from compulsory arbitration. 4. The further application of the principle of conciliation. 5. Certain important improvements in procedure. 6. The responsibility of organizations for the conduct of tlieir officers and members and for the general observance of awards. 7. Provisions relating to the rules of an organization, the audit of its accounts and similnr matters. 8. The principle of the secret ballot in order to give members of organizations control over their officers and the affairs of the organizations. 9. Provisions designed to protect the court in the performance of its functions, and to secure the observance of awards, and the provisions of the Act. Surely that was sufficiently comprehensive to provide for overcoming the difficulties which were alleged to exist in connection with the system then in operation. The Prime Minister and his colleagues are novices in the matter of industrial legislation, and it is reasonable to assume that this measure is not likely to be more effective than the Arbitration B ill passed in 1928. The Government has been meddling with our industrial legislation, unworkable ancl it considers that its only means of escape is by scrapping the whole business. It has been said that the States w ill have to introduce legislation to control industrial arbitrain 1928 is tion w it h in their boundaries,, and one changed right honourable gentleman that the State After months of consideragovernments favour this proposal. As a impracticmatter of fact, if the States are compelled that if the views of the Premier of Queensland The Premier of Queensland, Mr A. B. Moore, Later before he left for Brisbane to-day, said that .he opposed the repeal of the federal arbitration legislation when it was under discussion at the Premier's conference at Canberra. "" I venture to predict,"" said Mr Moore, "" that within ten vears there will be a return to the federal syssphere. Many other judges have touched tem."" Probably some of tbe other Premiers have also had to swallow this proposal against their w ill . The Prime Minister has been able to whip his own followers into line on this matter, and force them to break their election pledges, so he has probably been able to induce the Premiers also to agree to the proposal against their better judgment. I be carried, and that we may have an opportunity of carrying on under the present system of arbitration after its defects have been remedied. Arbitration has been operating for twenty-five years, and it cannot be claimed that it has failed. It was clearly intended by the framers of the Federal Constitution that there should be a federal court of arbitration with jurisdiction over was intended, not that this jurisdiction should be limited, but that it should be extended over all disputes which are interstate in character. If this bill is passed we shall have more disputes than at present. The Government's proposal constitutes a breach of f a it h with those who have registered in the court, and who havo incurred heavy expenses in securing arbitration awards. Now they find that they have taken this trouble, and incurred these expenses, merely to have their agreements and awards abolished at the whim of the Government. The framers of the Constitution intended that when we pulled down the State barriers there should be at least uniformit y in wages and conditions in those industries of an interstate character. Mr Deputy President Webb, of the Federal Arbitration Court, dealing with this aspect of the matter, said:There are two outstanding considerations which induced the people of Australia to enter into the federal compact. The one was to enable Australia to take proper precautions for her defence, and the other to establish the proposition that the trade between the States should be free, and the Constitution is framed for the purpose of protecting freedom of trade between States. It is difficult for fair intertherefore desirable that all the mills should state competition in an industry to exist unless compete on equal terms. industrial conditions are reasonably uniform throughout the States. Mr Deputy President Webb is a mau who has had considerable experience in arbitration, not only in the federal arbitration courts, but also in the South Australian courts prior to entering the federal on this subject, and their remarks have always been to the same effect. They have all said that they cannot provide for uniform awards under State jurisdiction, and that interstate industries should be subject to the Federal Arbitration Court. Mr Justice Heydon, during the hearing of the clothing trades case, said:The evidence that has been submitted to me in this case proves beyond any doubt that hope that this bill w ill not there is room for improvement in the wages and conditions of the employees in this industry, but one is forced to take into consideration the wages and conditions obtaining in the same industry in the State of Victoria. In consequence, I hesitate to concede to the employees all that I might in other circumstances. In an industry such as this there should be some form of federal adjustment of the wages and conditions. He was not able to give the workers the wages and conditions to which he coninterstate disputes. It sidered they were entitled because of the competition from Victoria, and he suggested that the matter should be dealt w i th in the Federal Arbitration Court. When dealing with the printing trades case Mr Deputy President Webb said:Up to the present time this industry in each State has been dealt with by the tribunal of such State, and the result is that the wages and conditions of employment which are prescribed in the various States present strange difficulties and anomalies. The printing industry has been before State tribunals for many years. The anomalies which have existed have been commented upon by the State tribunals, but it has been impracticable for the State tribunals to rectify them. Now the Government proposes to in tensify those anomalies by forcing practically all industries back to the State courts. If this bill is passed we shall have not only the industrial unrest .which prevails now, but also that which w ill arise from the fact that the State tribunals w ill not be able to deal effectively w i th interstate disputes. Mr Justice Powers, discussing the subject' of State versus Federal Arbitration, said:There is interstate competition in the flourmilling industry, and especially in the export trade, on which the mills chiefly depend. It is The mill-owners in the other States (than New South Wales) must be in agreement with the Union on the necessity for one award dealing with the industry in the four States, because of interstate competition. Mr Justice Higgins, dealing with the building trades dispute, spoke along similar lines, and one could multiply instances in which judges have pronounced themselves in favour of federal control of interstate industry. Despite the limited power which the Commonwealth enjoys in legislating in industrial matters, the federal arbitration system has been a success in Australia. If complete power is handed back to the States the low-wage States will have an advantage over those in which higher wages and better conditions prevail. The consequence will be that wages and conditions in all States will be forced down to the level of those prevailing in the States with the worse labour conditions. Tbe Prime Minister said that because of Australia's unfavorable financial position something would have to be done to bring about a better tone in industry. In support of his contention he produced a table of figures to show the relative increases in production and taxation over a period of years. These figures will come in very useful to prove that during the life of the Bruce-Page Government there has been very little increase in production and an extraordinary increase in taxation. They will be useful to quote against the Prime Minister when he contends that our present troubles are entirely due to high production costs. What is the Government doing to reduce the cost of production ? Its only policy in that regard seems to be to abolish the Arbitration Court. But as this court deals only with the wages and conditions of the workers it is clear that the Government intends that the workers shall bear the whole burden of any reduction that may be achieved in the cost of production. Nothing has been said about calling upon the persons who are receiving high rates of interest on the money they have loaned or those who control the rings, trusts and monopolies which are operating in our midst, to also make a contribution towards the reduction of the cost of production. In season and out of season I have been an advocate of industrial arbitration. I recognize that there are some defects in the system, but they are not so serious as to warrant the abolition of the court. This means of settling industrial disputes Mr Laoey. is much to be preferred to direct action. Some organizations registered under the act have spent thousands of pounds in securing their awards; but to their credit it should be said that they have carried on their operations without a stoppage since they were first registered. If the court is abolished they will be obliged to begin afresh and spend thousands more pounds in securing awards from the State tribunals that may be set up. As they will have to submit their claims to probably six different authorities, there will be no possibility of securing uniformity in the awards. consider that a system which obliges the workers to spend thousands of pounds to secure an award is desirable? That, surely, is one of its grave defects. to spend £5,000 in obtaining an award from an arbitration court than to spend many more thousands of pounds on a strike, apart altogether from the privation and suffering which a strike would entail. The trouble is that under the Government's proposal a union might be obliged to spend six times £5,000 to achieve, in a less effective fashion, what U at present achieved through the Commonwealth Court. Still, it appears that the servile followers of the Government are willing, in order to please their leader, to force the workers to incur even that tremendous expenditure. A good deal has been said about the number of strikes which have occurred in Australia. The fact is that we have had fewer strikes in recent years than formerly; but every little dislocation has been published to the world. In some instances, a great deal has been made out of a very little. The Government has used the cry of industrial unrest to mislead the people. It has been returned to the Treasury bench on two occasions through this parrot cry, and it has also used it to overshadow its maladministration. We have no guarantee that the awards of the State tribunals will be observed to any greater extent than the awards of the Commonwealth court. A careful examination of our statistical returns shows that strikes have been less prevalent in recent years than formerly. In 1913, the average number of days lost per wage earner over twenty years of age was 0.5,",110,Bhuce
248,Mr Bell,Does the honourable member,114,Bhuce
249,,"Mr LACEY -It is better for a unionand per union member 1.6. Similar figures for 1919 are five days and ten days, and for 1923 0.8 days and 1.6 days. The average number of days lost per worker over twenty years of age, from 1913 to 1923 inclusive was 1.5, and per union member, 3. Comparative figures for 1925 are 0.6 and 1.4; and for 1927, 1.1 and 1.9. The average number of days lost per annum per worker over twenty years of age in the years 1923 to 1927 inclusive was 0.8, and per union member, 1.5. It will be seen, therefore, that only about half as much time was lost in the period 1923 to 1927 as in tbe period 1913 to 1923. Industrial unrest in Australia is not so extensive as formerly, so that cannot be the reason for the introduction of the bill. I believe that the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) gave the true reason why we are considering this measure when he said that the Government had found that it was impossible to compel the employers in the coal industry to obey the awards of the court. I move That the-debate be now adjourned. Groom) -It is not competent for the honourable member to move that motion. say, Mr Speaker. a.m.] -Any person who has listened to this debate and carefully studied the history of industrial arbitration in the federal sphere must admit that the system has had a fair trial. He must also agree that ah analysis of the records of the court justifies doubt as to the success of the system. It has certainly not succeeded in accomplishing all that was expected of it. This is shown by the record number of strikes and tbe great amount of unemployment that has occurred in Australia in recent years.

This bill is designed to overcome some of the basic causes of industrial trouble. Unfortunately, the present situation arises out of the limitations imposed by the Federal Constitution upon this Parliament. The federal court cannot function until a dispute has taken place, and a dispute may be either actual or artificial. The creation of artificial disputes for the purpose of getting a hearing before the court has been one of the great defects of federal arbitration, and a fruitf u l source of much industrial strife. fusal constitute a dispute. has been created a log has to be served on each individual whom the applicant wishes to be a party to the dispute. This process is costly and productive of friction and vexatious delay. Many of the troubles that have been experienced by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court are due to this weakness. Constitutional limitations have also led to the creation of two armed camps, the employers in one and the employees in the other, each organized to fight the other rather than to come together to arrange a system of co-operation in industry. They have also caused us to seek arbitration before a legally constituted court at the commencement of negotrations rather than have resort firstly to conciliation. The lack of co-operation and goodwill is one of the main causes of industrial trouble, and has contributed substantially to the present economic and financial difficulties of the Commonwealth. The powers of the States, on the other hand, are unlimited. They can have arbitration, conciliation boards, wages boards, round table conferences, shop committees, or any other system that can be devised for the prevention and settlement of disputes. In the federal realm for these reasons industrial troubles will continue unless and until this Parliament obtains full industrial powers from the people. The position has been made more difficult by the practice of applying for awards from both Federal and State Courts. The passage of this bill will remove many of the embarrassments under which industry labours. Dual",114,Bhuce

This is necessary, not only to ensure that the employees get a fair deal, but also to protect the decent employer against unscrupulous competitors. The repeal of the Pederal Arbitration Act will not remove any of the unions from industrial control or deprive them of the necessary protection. It will only do away with dual control and conflict of Federal and State awards. The complete jurisdiction of the State courts will still be available to enable ditions. Every judge who has sat in the the parties in industry to settle their troubles. Australia has too many parliaments, and I look forward to the day when the Commonwealth Parliament will have increased powers and the State Parliaments reduced powers and a smaller number of members. Rather than that the Commonwealth should completely evacuate the arbitration field, I would prefer that it should be given by the people more complete control to deal with industrial matters. But there has been no lack of effort on the part of the present and previous Governments to obtain an extension of Commonwealth powers. Appeals to the people by referendum were made in 1911, 1913, 1919 and, under the leadership of the present Prime Minister, in 1926. All efforts to obtain for the federal authority greater power to deal with industrial matters have failed, and I feel certain that another appeal to-day would be equally futile. Travelling through South Australia recently I discussed with many people this question, and I gathered from them that an appeal to the people by referendum for an extension of the federal power would not be entertained for a moment. opposition would be even greater, and there would certainly be no possibility of an affirmative vote in Victoria. State Premiers at the Canberra conference having rejected the Prime Minister's request for a reference of powers by the State Parliaments to the Commonwealth Parliament, must, to be consistent, oppose any appeal to the people by referendum. In opposition to Mr J. Francis. such an appeal would be the State Governments, the members of the Labour oppositions and their bosses, the union officials. In the circumstances it. would be impossible to carry such a proposal. The only other means by which this Parliament can obtain the necessary power is by a reference by the State Parliaments, and that has been refused. The only other alternative would be to leave matters as they are. No honourable member of either party if free to voice his own convictions, would support the continuance of the present chaotic conCommonwealth Arbitration Court has drawn attention to its helplessness under the present limited powers of the Commonwealth. The British Economic Mission which recently visited Australia also supported this contention. In its report we have the following:A frank and valuable criticism of Australia's arbitration system was made by the British Economic Mission in its report of 7th January, 1929, to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. The mission said:-""We have had frank and interesting discussions w it h the leaders of the movement (trade union), and we have found that practically on every occasion the subject of arbitration acts and of the courts established thereunder has come up during the course of these discussions. By workmen's representatives, not less emphatically than by representatives of the employers, it has been consistently represented to us that the arbitration courts are not achieving their purpose, and that a system designed to arrive by judicial decisions at fair and prompt settlement of industrial disputes, such as could be freely accepted by both sides, must be held to have failed. The most important of the reasons which have been advanced for this view are that experience has shown that there arises between the two parties who appear before the Arbitration Court judge or arbitrator the spirit of antagonism inseparable from litigation, and that the object of prompt settlement is defeated by the delay occasioned by the necessity for the collection and presentation of detailed evidence In Western Australia the in a form acceptable to a court. It is complained that the procedure of the court occasions the expenditure of such time and money by the litigants, and involves very long The absences from their ordinary occupations for a large number of persons whose time might be more profitably employed; that the subject matter of the questions which are brought before the courts is not of a nature with which judicial tribunals, necessarily unversed in the practical problems of industry or in the economic questions to which they give rise, are best fitted to deal; and that the overlapping jurisdictions of the Federal and State Arbitration Courts have led to an almost inextricable tangle of conflicting decisions so complicated that largo staffs have to be maintained to keep track of them, and to endeavour to' guard against involuntary contravention of any of them in the course of every-day business. system of the arbitration courts which we have heard is a heavy ono, and we feel that it is well founded on many grounds, and particularly on the ground that the system has tended to consolidate employers and employees into two opposing camps, and has lessened the inducement to either side to resort to round-table conferences for that frank and confidential discussion of difficulties in the light of mutual understanding and sympathy, which is the best means of arriving 'at fair and workable industrial agreements. prevalent in Australia of dealing with industrial disputes appears to us to be essential, and workers' case"":we hold that there should be a minimum of judicial and governmental interference in them, except in so fur as matters affecting the health and safety of persons engaged in industry may be concerned. This decision was arrived at after frequent discussions with trade unions oflicials."" Let me further support this contention by extracts from the judgments of onr Arbitration Court judges. hearing of the Carters and Drivers case in 1917, Mr Justice Powers said in the Arbitration Court:I have never had a case in which employers have had greater cause to complain of the effect of Federal and State arbitration awards operating on the same industry, fixing different sets of conditions of work and liours of labour, and wages awarded on different basic and other rates. It is for the State Parliaments (or the people if the Federal Parliament again submits the question) to say whether State or Federal courts are to regulate all industrial matters, or whether both courts are to continue to do so. The present position causes dissatisfaction to employers and employees, and renders the work of both Federal and State industrial courts most difficult. He made similar observations in 1921 in connection with an application under the Factories Acts of Victoria. Justice Higgins, when giving evidence before the Royal Commission on the Constitution on the 27th October, 1927, said:It was his decided opinion that employers and employees should not have two independent authorities-Federa l and State-hangin g over their heads and imposing different conditions, especially when those two powers were not co-ordinated. undertaking had had 125 different awards in operation within its works. It .was an intolerable burden; it promoted industrial disputes. opinion, promoted so much discontent as for the average workman to find that his proscribed wages and conditions were inferior to those enjoyed by another worker doing exactly similar work in the same industry. He found that some sections of workers treated the Federal and State courts like rival shops, and The indictment of the tried to play off one against the other. It was a most inexpedient position. Chief Judge Dethridge, on the 15th February, 1928, pointed out that "" the whole thing was a muddle,"" "" t h ey must make the best of a bad job,"" and "" t r y to wend their way through the morass and do as much good as possible"". The Deputy President of the South Australian Arbitration Court, Judge Hewitson, said A change in the method in 1924, during the hearing of the brassThere are two Commonwealth awards operating in the same field as the determination. The resulting complications are chaotic. If it were desired to design such a situation it might be conceived by the disordered mental efforts of a commission of lunatics. He went on to sayThe mischief is intensified when the men in the nominal classification, or doing the During the same kind of labour, work sometimes side by side for different rates of pay. The appellants ask in so many words that the court should vary the determination so that it will conform with the Commonwealth awards under which a number of employees in the industry work. He pointed out further how impossible it is to carry on under those conditions. One could quote numerous other cases in which the conflict of the Federal and State jurisdictions in arbitration matters has made it impossible to carry on without constant frictio n in industry. Let me give one other example of dual control, the overlapping of awards and the impossibility of carrying on smoothly in industry under the existing federal arbitration system. I quote from the Argus of 26th June of this year. Mr In my business (call it ""A"") we are under some 38 wages boards and arbitration awards. The result is endless confusion and enormous expense. We manufacture fancy boxes, plain boxes, lace paper, canned fruits, sweets, biscuits, grease-proof paper.

The Arbitration Court fixes a living wage which barely enables a man, his wife and children to exist, and the unions extract sums from him in order to maintain an army of officials to push claims before the Arbitration Court.

I leave it to the honourable member for Fremantle to disprove my statement. I am quite satisfied that he cannot do it. Unfortunately, there has never been uniformity in the State Sphere. Even the judges have laid down certain procedures to be followed until uniformity is established. If ever there was a prospect of bringing this about, Mr Lang, ex-Premier of New South Wales, by the introduction of the famous 44-hour week, made uniformity impossible. desired by Labour in tbe State sphere. The Queensland award for the shearers gavethe shearers in that State 5s. per 100 sheep more than the rate paid in other States. The Australian Workers Union is quite prepared to work under a federal award in five States, and under a State award in Queensland. It never desired the uniformity of hours that honourable members opposite are so keen about to-day. There is not even uniformity in our industrial laws, or in our taxation. In New South Wales there are 88 federal awards and 455 State awards; in Victoria there are 111 federal awards and 185 State awards; in Queensland, which has had a Labour government misruling it for the last fifteen years, there continuance of the federal conditions are 24 federal awards and 252 State awards; in South Australia there are 74 federal awards and 191 State awards; in Western Australia there are 30 federal awards and 120 State awards; and in Tasmania there are 58 federal awards and 51 State awards. The number of unionists working under federal awards is about 400,000, but under State awards there are between 500,000 and 600,000. There are only twelve federal awards which are operating in all the States. The attitude of organized lafalse propaganda that has emanated from bour to this bill may be gauged from a statement by Mr Rymer, the State president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Railways Union, as reported in the Daily Mail of the 31st May of this year:The change proposed by the Government would make little alteration in Queensland where most of the unions were operating under State awards. The problems of the remuneration of labour and the hours of such were inseparable from the problem of unemployment. The respective State parliaments should accept the responsibility of such matters as the basic wage, hours of labour, and unemployment, leaving the margin for skill and other details to State courts or boards. There was no more important issue facing the people's political representatives under existing society than the solution of these problems. He believed that the Prime Minister's proposals, if given effect to, would ultimately assist in that direction, by forcing recognition of the varying conditions and stages of development opcrating in the respective States, and which at present made Commonwealth-wide uniformity of hours, wages and conditions an impossibility. Mr Rymer, the leader of one of the Uniformity was never greatest unions in Queensland, entirely endorsed the proposal of the Prime Minister, and declared that it was impossible under the existing circumstances to obtain uniformity of hours, wages and conditions. That is an effective reply to the only charge that I feel the Government is called upon to answer, that lack of uniformity of conditions will result from the passing of this legislation. The bill makes full provision for the smooth transfer of unions from the existing to the State system of arbitration. Federal awards will operate until the 30th June, 1930, or until varied by the States. It will be within the province of each State to pass a measure providing for a until such time as it is deemed advisable to alter them by new awards of the State. Every precaution has been taken to avoid friction. I believe that the measure will bring about greater peace and harmony in industry, and that the friction and the overlapping of awards, the evil effects of which the country is now suffering, will be brushed aside, to usher in a new era of prosperity in our industries.

267,,"Mr J. FRANCIS I know Mr MoorePremier of Queensland, Mr A. E. Moore, on this subject. has been accused of being opposed to the proposals of the Prime Minister. Here is a statement by him which recently appeared in the Brisbane press:The Premier, Mr A. E. Moore, to-day made the following statement:It has come to my notice, said the Premier, that a circular over the signature of Mr their members is dependent upon profitable Lewis McDonald.(Secretary of the Queensland Central Executive of the Australian Labour Party) has been issued to union executives containing a misrepresentation of my attitude towards the proposed abolition of the federal arbitration court. The circular submits a draft resolution of protest against the abolition of that court and urges that it be carried and forwarded to Queensland members of the House of Eepresentatives and the Senate in the Federal Parliament. The proposed resolution contains the following incorrect statement: "" The Premier of Queensland ( Mr A. E. Moore) has publicly expressed his concurrence with the attitude of organized labour on this question."" Nothing could be further from the truth. I made my attitude on this question perfectly clear upon my return from the Premiers' conference on June3 last, when I stated: "" The outstanding achievement of the conference was the decision that the federal arbitration court should cease to function, except in relation to one or two special industries of an interstate character. sonally, I would have preferred increasing the industrial powers of the federal parliament in the interests of fair interstate competition and united control. None of the other States, however, would agree to this course. Therefore, rather than continue the present overlapping of State and federal awards, I agree that each State should accept full responsibility for the control of industrial affairs within its own borders. In the same statement, I added the remarks of Mr P. Collier, Labour Premier of Western Australia, on this subject. Collier said: "" I am not a unificationist. I believe Australia is too large to be controlled industrially from any one centre, and I prefer to take full responsibility for the control of industrial affairs in my State."" There was considerable divergence of opinion, said Mr Moore, as to whether industrial regulation should be controlled by the federal court or by State courts, but the Premiers of all States were unanimous that the existing pernicious duplication of federal and State tribunals should be ended. Mr Moore added: The Prime Minister( Mr S. M. Bruce) suggested an agreement by all States to hand over exclusive jurisdiction to the federal court. This met with strong opposition from several States, arid j t was then decided unanimously that the best course to pursue to end the present chaotic conditions would be the withdrawal of federal jurisdiction except to a few industries of a purely interstate character. Mr J. Francis. There was no ambiguity whatever about Mr Moore my attitude towards this question, and my statement of the case cannot possibly be twisted to mean that I supported the retention of the federal arbitration court with State courts also in existence. With State courts operating, I favour the abolition of the federal court, and I sincerely urge upon the union executives concerned to regard this matter from the industrial and not from tlie party political viewpoint. The welfare of and expanding industries, but the duplication of industrial tribunals has proved a very great obstacle to that achievement. With two tribunals operating in the same field, it is quite impossible to secure co-operative effort, stable conditions, or a restoration of confidence in those with money to invest in industrial development. It is equally impossible to attain those desirable ends if industrial affairs are permitted by the unions to be the football of party politics. I wholeheartedly endorse the opinion of Mr Moore. I feel that this should not be a party political matter. Our industries should be permitted to prosper unhampered as at present, and those engaged in them should have the right to work. If Australia is to prosper this continual harassing of employers and employees by the operations of conflicting awards and dual control must cease. We Perare a young nation, with our resources as yet almost untouched. We have greater opportunities than almost any nation in the world, but our prosperity is obviously being retarded by this perpetual conflict in our industrial jurisdiction. I feel confident that this bill w ill be passed and that if the new law and the State industrial laws are carefully and conscientiously administered, we shall have in industry that goodwill that is so necessary, and Mr that co-operation that is essential to industrial welfare and prosperity. I look forward to the measure coming speedily into operation, and to the early realization of my expectations. I realize that this is one of the most i m portant problems with which this chamber has had to deal. I have carefully followed the arguments advanced by honourable members opposite, and I give them credit for stating their opinions. They are fighting in defence of their leader and those whom they represent in this Parliament just as we, on this side, are fighting to support our deputy-leader and those whom we represent. The bill before the House seeks to repeal legislation which",119,Bhuce
268,Mr Culley (Denison) [10.8 A.m.],"was introduced as far back as 1904. Because of the conditions under which the workers then found themselves, and the resultant industrial unrest, it was deemed advisable to establish a federal arbitration court to clear the atmosphere and to usher in an era of industrial peace and prosperity. Sub-section VI . , section 2, of the original Act readsThe chie£ objects of this Act areVI. To facilitate and encourage the organjunction against the award they took the ization of representative bodies of employers and of employees and the submission of industrial disputes to were determined that, whatever the cost, the court by organizations, and to permit representative bodies of emtion meant that they had to send a legal ployers and of employees to be declared organizations for the purposes of this Act. The act was brought into being to give both employers and employees an opportunity to set up organizations, through the medium of which grievances could be discussed either at round-table conferences or before a judge of the Arbitration Court. The workers of the country seized the opportunity to organize so that they might secure to themselves some measure of justice. They realized that under the proposed scheme it would not be necessary for individual workers to have to face their employers when submitting grievances, a procedure which invariably brought the wrath of the employer upon the employee concerned. At this juncture I wish to state that I am aware that there are many decent employers-and I have had the pleasure of working under some of them-bu t there are also unscrupulous employers who would do anything to penalize a worker for having the effrontery to make an effort to have his wrongs redressed. Industrial organizations were inaugurated, aud the Federal Arbitration Court came into existence. The originators of this bill have been subjected to considerable abuse, justifiably in my opinion. Honourable members opposite have asked what is the use of having a federal conciliation and arbitration court if the workers refuse to accept its awards. I reply that the percentage of workers who have ignored such awards is small. And the practice is not peculiar only to the workers. The employers also have played their part in ignoring the awards of the court. I recall the fact that when the Australian builders' labourers first went before the Arbitration Court and secured an award, at very great monetary cost to the union, the employers, despite their assurance that they would observe any constitutionally granted award, failed to honour their obligations. What do we find? Althoughi t cost hundreds of pounds to secure that award, which the employees were willing to accept, the employers fought hard to evade it. When they failed to get an incase to the Privy Council. The workers the award should stand. That determinarepresentative to England to fight their case. After his arrival in the Old Country circumstances arose which necessitated the postponement of the case. Wheni t again came before the Privy Council, the award was upheld. The men were at last able to continue their work in peace. That is an example of the way in which the employers have attempted to flout the law. Increased living costs necessitated a further appeal by the workers to the court. The court was always prepared to give justice to the workers, and for that reason its President was ridiculed by many employers, and described as a man ""prepared to toady to the workers of this country."" That was how they described a man who believed in fair dealing between employer and employee, a man who always endeavoured to do the right and just thing When the case came before Mr Justice Higgins, he said that he would base his award on the cost of living figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician. In making his award he said thati f the organization had asked for Is. 9d. an hour he would have granted its application on the facts before him; but as only Is. 6d. an hour had been applied for, he incorporated that rate in his award. The employers were not prepared to accept that award. They endeavoured to strike a blow at the weakest link in the chain, and concentrated their attack on the workers in Tasmania, thereby locking them out. Had they been successful in that attack, it was their intention to continue the fight in South Australia, that State being considered the next weakest link in the chain. After a battle lasting for sixteen'weeks, the employees were successful. Again, the employers were forced to submit to an award made by a properly-constituted court. Tbese instances are given to show that it is not always the workers who attempt to evade the awards of the court. I am concerned with the effect which this bill, if agreed to, will have upon the workers of this country. A good deal has been said regarding overlapping awards. There may be some overlapping of awards, but there is not that overlapping that Government supporters would have us believe. For nineteen or twenty years Commonwealth awards have been in operation. They have affectedevery State. In making their awards judges have always taken into consideration thei r effect on interstate trade. New South Wales and Victoria are the two great manufacturing States of the Commonwealth. In the former the working hours are 44 per week; in Victoria there is a probability of a working week of 48 hours. What hope would the manufacturers of New South Wales have of competing against manufacturers in Victoria if, in addition to working shorter hours, they had to pay higher rates to their employees than their competitors in the southern State? Honourable members opposite claim that the passing of this measure will bring about industrial peace. will do nothing of the kind; its result will be industrial chaos. I predict that if this bill becomes law, we shall soon have the employers asking for some form of federal control. privileged to represent the workers on Sta.te wages boards, and I say unhesitatingly that this legislation will, in a short time, cause more industrial unrest than would have resulted in a lifetime from the awards of the Federal Arbitration Court. An award lately given by a State tribunal in Tasmania is typical .of what we might expect from other State industrial tribunals. On the 30th March last the Shipping Wages Board met in Hobart for the purpose of determining the wages and conditions which should operate in the shipping industry. Having heard evidence on both sides, the chairman decided on a wage of £4 for a week of 52 hours for men employed in the shipping trade in southern Tasmania, notwithMr Culley. standing that at that time the basic wage for that part of Tasmania was £4 6s. a week. ment's idea of justice. reasons which prompted the Government to introduce this bill. For two or three years there has been an agitation on the part of big English manufacturers to increase working hours and reduce wages. A committee was set up in London to discuss whether wages should be increased or decreased, and, if increased, whether industry could continue. A proposal was made at that conference that operatives in the cotton industry should accept a reduction of 25 per cent, in their wages, with an increase of four hours in the working week. Not long after that conference was held the "" Big Four"" visited Australia. The ability of those men cannot be questioned; they knew their job. But it is remarkable that following their visit and the publication of their report the Government introduced legislation to throw on the States the onus of regulating industry. It did so knowing full well the result of State industrial legisation in the past, and that similar results must be expected from State legislation in the future. This bill is a deliberate attack It upon the standard of living in this country, notwithstanding the assurance of the Prime Minister that he does not desire to see that standard lowered-that he believes in good wages and conditions for the workers. He has urged I have been that there must be either more production or that the cost of production must be reduced. Honourable members will recollect that a few years ago the cry was "" Produce, produce, produce."" What happened when heed was taken to that cry, and the operatives in the boot industry increased their production? More boots were made than could be disposed of, with the result that men and women in the industry were unemployed and starving. There was no possibility of their product being consumed so that they could be kept in employment. The trouble is due not to over production, but to under consumption. If wages were higher the workers could consume more. more to enable higher wages to be paid ?",120,Bhuce

This bill is an attack upon the workers and must be resisted to the last ditch. thinks that by removing from the Commonwealth Statute Book, legislation that has been there for the last 25 years, he will bring about peace in industry, he is sadly mistaken. AfterI had attended the Geneva Conference in 1922, 1 returned to London, and instead of indulging in joy jaunts, I took the opportunity to visit many industrial centres in order to learn first hand the conditions of the workers. I saw thousands of men unemployed, and I hope that we shall never have similar industrial conditions in Australia. But I foresee dire possibilities when the employers find themselves free from the restrictions imposed by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Even to-day, in spite of the awards of the court, (hey are taking advantage of the economic depression, and when they have "" an open go "" they will exploit the necessity of thousands of will compel to accept whatever conditions are offered. To-day we hear Government supporters complaining of the restrictive effect of the arbitration court upon industry, and they have criticized the declaration of Mr Justice Higgins that if an industry cannot pay the basic wage, it should go out of existence. Many times employers have said that if the award of the court involved the payment of more wages, they would not continue their industry. But how many industries have been closed down as the result of awards of the court? ""When I put that question by interjection to the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Grosvenor Francis) he quoted the mining industry. The court has not been responsible for the closing down of one mine in Australia. Honourable members must realise that the first ton of ore produced is the cheapest, and that the cost rises as the mine increases in depth. The honourable member for Kennedy referred -to Charters Towers. That field, like nearly every other in the Commonwealth, was worked out. A lode can be profitably worked only to a certain depth, and while the ore is of sufficient value. In the early nineties, Tasmania was lifted out of the slough of depression by the mineral wealth won from the soil, and I believe it has still mineral resources which will again make it prosperous. It is one of the richest States in the ComI f the Prime Minister monwealth, but has been badly governed and mismanaged. The Mathinnia field at one time produced a large quantity of gold and carried a population of between 1,500 and 2,000; to-day. there are not more than 30 persons left in the town. The population has diminished, not because of any award of the arbitration court, but because the lodes have petered out. The Beaconsfield mine was worked for nearly 40 years, and supported a population of between 3,000 and 4,000; to-day there are not more than 200 people there. Again the reason was that the lode had become too poor for profitable working. The Lefroy field yielded large quantities .of gold, but its population has dropped from nearly 2,000 to 30 or 40. Not one mine is working at Zeehan to-day. The Bendigo and Ballarat fields at one time supported large armies of miners, but today mining is dead because the lodes have unemployed, whom starvation either petered out or are too low-grade to be operated at a profit. Kalgoorlie, too, has slumped, but the workings are thousands of feet longer or deeper than when the arbitration court first made awards for the industry. Eveni f wages had not increased, every additional foot of sinking or driving would have added to the cost of production. In addition the value of the ore has decreased. Awards of the arbitration court have not affected the cost of mining in Western Australia, and the honourable members for Kennedy and Angas were hard-up for an argument when they had to quote the mining industry as an example of the effects of the arbitration court. Although honourable members opposite contend that the arbitration system has had the effect of retarding industry, the statistics in the year book show a steady increase in the number and size of factories throughout Australia. The manufacturers have been prepared to honour the awards of the court, but owing to the low protection given to them by the tariff, they have not",122,Bhuce
272,,"Mr CULLEY -The workers employed692 been able to withstand the competition from abroad. ""We hear a good deal about the patriotism of the Briton; the truth is that he is loyal to his pocket. Millions of pounds of British capital have been invested in the erection of mills in China, in order to exploit the cheap coolie labour to the detriment of the British worker. The products of those mills are sent to Great Britain, and thence re-exported to Australia as of British origin. If the present standard of living is to be maintained, what chance has the Australian worker to compete against Chinese men, women and children, who are working from 14 to 16 hours a day, at a daily wage of from lOd. to Is. 3d.? Much abuse has been hurled by honourable members opposite at the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and the trade union leaders.

Because of that we are accused on the one hand of supporting the continuation of the Arbitration Court and on the other hand, of desiring to abolish it. Much has been said about that, and about the attitude of Mr George Rymer of Queensland. No union representative associated with the Arbitration Court made any attempt to support the resolution of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. The very fact tliat we are here to-day advocating the retention of the court is sufficient answer to the honourable members behind the Government. It was not the intention under that resolution, to break away from the Arbitration Court altogether. It was an endeavour to try to alter unsatisfactory conditions.

The very fact that the State instrumentalities that were for a number of years under State boards are now desirous of coming under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court is evidence that the Court 13 doing valuable work and should be retained. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr J. Francis), referred to a statement that appeared in the Argus, that a certain employer operating in Melbourne was working under so many different Certain statements have awards that he really 'did not know whether his"" employees were coming or going. The hours operating in the factory were from 48 to 35 a week. The clerical staff would work 35 hours, and 44 and 48 hours would be worked by two different sections of the workers. The section working 48 hours would be under the State industrial law, and that working 44 hours would be under federal awards. At that particular factory every employee is working either under federal award or under federal agreement. When the employer does not know when his employees are coming or going, it is because his employees work the 48 hours in five days. Some of them have their luncheon inside, and others outside. The employer has been in business for 43 or 44 years and he has never had one industrial dispute in his factory. That should be a sufficient answer to those who are crying out against the disastrous effect that the overlapping of Federal and State awards has upon industry. To-day there are two big industries in New South Wales and Victoria known as the boot trade and the clothing trade.

281,Mr Bayley,"I shall read an exshould continue to exist and hand out awards, to be treated the same way, or worse. It is a purely Scullinary attitude. Bight here let me say that I do not approve of the writer using Mr Scullin's name in that manner. man conuected with the official Labour party to-day who has done something to maintain federal arbitration and to induce the workers to live up to it, it is Mr Scullin. The honourable member may have fallen by the way on one or two occasions, but speaking generally, he has manfully stood up to what he considers should be done. The extract continuesbut the Scullins have put the last nail in the coffin of federal arbitration. The Commonwealth cannot make its court's decisions respected unless it has power to interfere in disturbances, wherever they may arise, and has police and military forces with which to scatter insurrectionary mobs. There being no visible chance of getting the power, the obvious honourable member for Moreton( Mr course is for the Commonwealth to get out of the arbitration business. I am in agreement with the writer. I believe that the lack of action of the official Labour party is largely responsible for the attitude that the Government has been forced to adopt in connection with arbitration. You, Mr Speaker, will remember that line from The Ballad of Reading Gaol, "" Por each man kills the thing he loves."" declares that it has always beeu favourably inclined arbitration, claiming it more or less as its own child; but it has failed to support it as it sliould have been supported. It will be remembered that that party adopted a similar attitude towards the Commonwealth shipping line. That line no longer exists. It went out of existence because the leaders of the Labour party had not the courage to tell unionists to do the fair thing by the people of this country. During the last week or two, I, in common with other honourable members, have been deluged with circular letters from unions throughout Australia. letters contained a resolution dealing with the intention of the Government to depart also from the field of arbitration, and carried protest against that action. Those protests would have carried more weight with me, and I think with other honourable members, if they had been the spontaneous expression of the unions conMr Bayley. cerned, but in the main they were copies of resolutions passed by some central body and sent out with the request that' they should be despatched to all federal members, evidently in the hope that, as If there is one they were allegedly the views of the many unions, it would be believed that there was force behind the arguments advanced. No doubt honourable members have read and studied those resolutions and protests. I am satisfied that the unions concerned have cried out before they are hurt. That might be a very wise precaution under certain conditions, but I am confident that no danger will come to the workers of Australia as a result of the bill that is now before the House. They will be safeguarded under the State courts just as securely as they are to-day under the dual control of State and Federation. The J. Francis) quoted certain figures to show to how small ah extent federal awards are nation-wide in their application. If 3 remember rightly, the number of awards operating in each of the six States is twelve, out of a total of something like 154 gazetted federal awards. It will be competent for the unions to register existing awards under the State courts. Certain unions are purely federal in The Labour party character. One of the first letters that I received on the subject was from the towards federal Australian Journalists Association, pointing out that its members work at times in one State and at times in another, and that it would be very difficult for them to obtain justice if they worked under six separate awards. I am satisfied that an arrangement can be made whereby the existing conditions, which are entirely satisfactory to both parties, will be gazetted in each of the States, and that no hardship will result to the man engaged in that profession. A similar state ol affairs applies to members of the theatrical profession. Their case is even more difficult and complicated than that of the These journalists, because for every one journalist who travels from State to State there are scores of individuals following the theatrical profession who do so. But I am confident that if we and the authorities of the various States are in earnest about the matter, those.difficulties will be overcome. . It is not my intention to discuss the bill in detail. I shall not claim that it has been debated ad nauseam, because I agree with honourable members that it is one of the most important measures that has come up for discussion for a long time. I make it quite clear that I support the Government. I contend that no other course is open to it. The Government has been accused of having turned a political somersault. Member after member opposite has quoted extracts from the speeches of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and others, in an endeavour to show that what the Government stood for in 1926, when the amended bill was under discussion, is not on all fours with what it preaches to-day. It may not be possible for honourable members to find a definite statement in a speech made by either the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General to the effect that the proposed amendments were the last endeavour to make the Arbitration Court workable. But there is no honourable member on this side who was not fully convinced that that was the object of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. There were those who said, at the time, "" Away with the court. It is unworkable."" The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, in their greater wisdom, refused to accept that conclusion. They said "" Let us make a further attempt to render it workable."" They did so. As a result, a little order has come out of chaos, but not sufficient to warrant the continuance of the federal authority in the field of arbitration. No other course is now open to the Government. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) claimed that the Government and this party had no right to introduce the measure without a mandate from the people. I cannot accept that contention. If the leader of a party puts forward a programme in his policy speech and is returned to power on it, he is in duty bound to carry out the promises that he made. But he is not prevented from embarking, in addition, on a new line of action. would progress come if Parliament was always to follow and never to lead? That is one reason why I give my wholehearted support to the Government in this matter. I recognize in it a body of men who are prepared to lead, and to stake their political existence on what they consider to be in the best interests of Australia. I sincerely trust that the good sense of the members of this House will induce them to give their support to the measure now under discussion. I do not pay much attention to the remarks of the last speaker. One of his main reasons for supporting the bill is that some union secretaries have written to him urging that it is a dangerous thing for the Federal Government to vacate the field of industrial arbitration. I look on the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as the keystone to the edifice that has done so much to improve the social, moral, and financial standards of the industrial classes of Australia. Even though my remarks may not satisfy honourable members opposite, I hope that they will satisfy the people of Australia. I remember the time when in the early days of Federation the late Hon. C. C. Kingston visited me in my house in Sydney and accompanied me to the Trades Hall, where he put certain proposals before the Trades and Labour Council. Listening to him I felt that the introduction of a system of arbitration and conciliation in the settlement of industrial disputes would remedy many of the evils then afflicting humanity. In time arbitration as a means of ensuring industrial harmony became the watchword of numbers of public men in New South Wales, and an attempt was made to introduce legislation providing for it. As one who has taken an active part in arbitration matters, I am surprised that the Government does not realise the benefits which the system has conferred on the women of Australia. No measure passed by this Parliament has done more for the women of this country than has the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Wise counsels prevailed in the last British election, for no less than nine women were elected to the Mother of Parliaments. It would be well if we had a few women members in this Parliament, for then honourable members opposite might realise that How women are living creatures, worthy of respect and of better treatment than this bill metes out to them. As a sanitary engineer and plumber, it has been my duty to visit factories and",125,Bhuce

The conditions in many were a damnable disgrace to those concerned. In the boot trade a number of women were employed, but separate places of convenience were not provided for the sexes. I feel that in these matters, if I am to use my best endeavours for those whom I represent, I must call a spade a spade. When the question of providing separate and females was brought up in the courts, it was decided to refer it to the plumbers.

On such occasions, I prepared a report for h i m ; and whether he improved it later or not, I know that the report I prepared was always a good one.

Nature never made ask you to use your best endeavours to preventtlie abolition of Commonwealth conciliaBut seeing tion and arbitration as proposed hy the Prime industry, Minister. should The Australian Journalists' Association, which has always' advocated and adopted constitutional methods of adjusting industrial difin which ferences, has been registered under the Coma trained nurse monwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act But is it not since 1910. We have found the conciliatory provisions of tliat Act most effective in enabling us to disfor cuss our differences at round table conferences in the with newspaper proprietors, the result being that we have industrial agreements covering practically all the newspapers of the Commonwealth. The Conciliation and Our latest negotiation was in May last, Act was not placed on the when we met representatives of the proprietors of metropolitan daily newspapers in compulsory conference. An agreement was reached employment and Judge Lukin made it an award, by conhands, sent, to operate from 1st June last for a period of five years. We have been compelled to strongly oppose the proposal of the Prime Minister becauseIn my early days, (1) It will penalize our association and in offices were treated members just as efficiently as if Indians we had heen deregistered by the court for an illegal action. In 1881, and 1882. (2) We shall be deprived of our charter I was a young man, and all our efforts for the last journalists twenty years in building an Australian professional organization will be shattered by dividing our association into separate and independent State bodies. (3 Industrial discord will be created in newspaper offices, where harmony has hitherto prevailed, as the result of the operation of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, and where in the largest offices peace has just been re-assuveel for a further five years. (4) Our members will be compelled to submit their disputes to the conflicting industrial regulations of the States. This will bring about inequalities, and many will not receive industrial protection, as their permanent or temporary employment will be in a State beyond the jurisdiction of the award or agreement purporting to cover them. (5) We believe that most of the Federal Arbitration Court awards have had the eifect of allaying industrial unrest, and only in a few isolated instances have strikes occurred in which the court has had jurisdiction. (6) Nearly one-third of the 143 awards of the Federal Court were made by the consent of the parties, and they form the substances for determinations made by State tribunals, aud therefore we support the contention of other federated unions that the indirect, as well as the direct, result of the abolition of the Federal Court will be injurious. (7) If the States alone are left to carry out industrial experiments they will create a series of disassociated judgments which will have but little relation to one another, and will cause widespread discontent among employers und employees of the Commonwealth. (8) We are'strongly of the opinion that wages and conditions of employment should be regulated throughout the Commonwealth on the same basis, and not on the conflicting foundations laid down by the various State tribunals. (0) We feel that with each State determining wages and conditions at varying periods, industries throughditions in different parts of Australia. out the Commonwealth would be in a constant state of unrest and their development hampered. We ask you, therefore, to seriously consider these conclusions, which are based on the feelings of our members and our observations of the various organizations which have also used the Federal Arbitration Court, and have loyally abided by its decisions, upheld its prestige, and are highly appreciative of the standard of living it has ensured and the protection it has afforded them. [Quorum formed.] The writer of that letter is a man of literary ability, and he has shown that the Government is making a mistake in proposing to repeal the A r b i tration Act. He is expressing the view of men who follow an intellectual occupation ; they are not like the mere labourers for whose views the Prime Minister and his colleagues have such little regard. am always pleased to read a communication that shows literary capacity and a [20] knowledge of the subject w i th which it deals. I quote now from a letter sent by the Federated State School Teachers' AssociationAt a council meeting of this association held since the Premiers' Conference it was resolvedThat in view of the necessity for promoting an Australian national outlook through an Australian education system, this Federal Council of Australian Teachers stands by the principle of federal arbitration and will make all endeavours to overcome constitutional obstacles. I am delighted that the school teachers are not mere State righters whose vision does not extend beyond their vest pockets. The letter continuesI t will be seen from the resolution that we support measures that will retain arbitration, not necessarily in its present form, and which will place arbitration in the hands of the Federal Parliament in a form that will be effective. We are, by .decision of the High Court, placed outside federal arbitration constitutionally. We seek redress of that position, holding that State services should have the assistance of federal arbitration in determining their salaries and service values to the States that employ them. State servants should have full benefits of Australian privileges. We shall be pleased to have consideration of our viewpoint in the movement that will take place in arbitration in the approaching session of the Federal Parliament. The school teachers show by the resolution I have quoted a wise foresight. Once arbitration is removed from federal control there will be no uniformit y of conThat letter conveys more than all the oratory of honourable members. School teachers are not men who would commitoutrages; they cannot be designated communists or bolsheviks. They have stated an intelligent view of what is proper and essential to the progress of Australia. The State Instrumentalities Unions Committee is a most representative body. Some of the men for whom it speaks are receiving salaries higher than the basic wage; others, like myself, hold the diploma for plumbing or the degree of Bachelor of Science. These men do not soil their hands and wear hobnailed boots and dungarees, and for that reason their views should receive respect even from honourable members opposite. II n a letter to me the committee statesHaving spent a considerable sum of money in prosecuting awards, and having experienced the advantages of being able to approach the Federal Judiciary, it is unlikely that State servants will submit to a loss of those rights, and any attempt to filch them away must inevitably result in a united front on the political field, until such time as those rights are regained, and possibly turmoil amongst those unions representing workers more definitely of a manual character would be precipitated. We stand for the rectification of grievances by constitutional means, and believe that this can only be achieved with content to the great body of employees and satisfaction to the nation, by the continuance of access to federal tribunals. I bave also a communication from the Printing Trades Union. The printing industry has a fine system of apprenticeship which produces highly skilled tradesmen who take a pride in their occupation. The result is that their work is the finest of its kind that is done in any part of the world. The letter from the union reveals the progress which the industry has made in AustraliaPrinting is fourth highest in importance in the industries of Australia.

Honourable members behind the Government pitch a gloomy Mr West. and sorrowful tale about the financial position of Australia, and, unfortunately, their statements are broadcast overseas. Nothing is more injurious to this country. The following figures will show the progress that has been made in Australia. The production of the Commonwealth of Australia has increased in the last seven years from £379,382,000 to £442,000,000, an increase of £62,618,000, thefiguresfor the respective years being:-1922-1923 , £379,382,000; 1923-1924, £400,183,000; 1924-1925, £454,106,000; 1925-1926, £431,504,000; 1926-1927, £446,874,000 1927-1928, £453,311,000; and 1928-1929, approximately £442,000,000. Those figures should dissipate the gloom and pessimism of honourable members behind the Government. I cannot understand the attitude of the Prime Minister. His speech was painful to listen to. The question which occurred to me while he was speaking, was, how on earth the Government had been able to get into such a financial tangle. During the seven years that this Government has administered this country, it has embarked upon an orgy of extravagance. No provision has been made for the future, and it is high time that a change of government took Added Value, place. The cost of the Constitutional 1928-27.

To resort to such an argument is an act of sheer desperation, but let me assure them that that kind of talk is not likely to mislead the people. The following is taken from an authoritative document:Thet h r if t of our people is perhaps the most gratifying feature of our economic position. Savings Ibanks deposits have risen from £102,275,000 in 1922 to £215,188,000 in 1928; an increase of £52,913,000. From 1923 to 1927, life insurance policies have increased by 70,823 to a total of 866,710, while the sum insured in the latter year was £262,276,366, an increase of £52,226,421. In industrial insurance the figures are equally encouraging. The number of policies in 1927 totalled 1,481,044, an increase of 337,040 over 1923, whilst the sum insured increased by £20,723,750 to a total of £60,732,865. In life and industrial insurance combined the sum insured in 1927 was £323,009,231, an increase in' four years of £72,950,171. In view of those figures honourable members behind the Government surely cannot allow the impression to be broadcast throughout the world that Australia is an impoverished nation, making little or no progress. Is it any wonder that the moneylenders of Europe are chary of us? Isi t any wonder that our loans are floated at £93 17s. at high rates of interest, and that we have to provide £6 13s. to redeem loans raised at £5. In the interests of my electors I feel that it is my duty to place these things before this Parliament and the country generally. Here is another paragraph that should have some effect on the GovernmentThet h r if t of the people was also demonstrated restored, and this party will be able to in the ownership of their own homes. The 1911 census disclosed that 52.22 per cent, of private dwellings were either owned or were being purchased by the occupants. A t the 1921 census this percentage had increased to 56.32 per cent., and it may be confidently expected, with the additional financial accommodation being granted by house-building authorities, that the 1931 census, w ill disclose a further large increase in the percentage. That thrift has been brought about by the interest taken by the Labour party in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Before a people can become prosperous it must secure a standard of living that gives it something over and above the mere cost of subsistence. My statistics confound the dismal Jeremiahs opposite. I was considerably impressed with the reference that was made to the recent referendum. I hold very pronounced views on the subject-view s which have the approval of some of the most prominent business men in Sydney. Those views are based on long experience and a close study of the subject. When this Government submitted the last referendum to the people, it so condensed the questions that the average working man was quite unable to grasp their meaning. A friend of mine in Sydney, who owns and controls a large commercial establishment, told me that he did not understand the ramifications of the proposal; but that he had voted for it. He asked me for an explanation of the matter. I obliged, and be became convinced that he had done the right thing. I have voted for every referendum, with the exception of conscription, which I detested. When my constituents asked me to oppose the last referendum, I referred them to the platform of the Labour party, and I proved that my attitude was the right one. Curiously enough, many large oil companies, newspaper concerns, and other important commercial undertakings voted against that referendum, because, like many of my supporters, they were apprehensive of the Government in power. Because of that fear the Labour party lost thousands of votes on that referendum, and, if honourable members on this side desire to have the powers of the Eederal Government amplified, they must first effect a change of government. The confidence of the people will then be proceed unhindered to realize its humanitarian ideals. This Government has acted in a most objectionable manner in regard to the arbitration judiciary, which is now constituted of governmental appointees, who have not the approval bf that section of the community which comes under the operation of the act. T must express my indignation at the Prime Minister's reference to the case of the timber workers. I think that awards should be obeyed; but these unfortunate timber workers were so harassed by the action of their employers that they were goaded beyond endurance. The Prime Minister cannot comprehend the distress under which many workers labour. He is the..child of fortune, who moves only in the most exclusive circles, -nnd whose sympathies are naturally alienated from the under-dog. association with the coal-mining strike was also of a regrettable nature. The Prime Minister and Mr Bavin, the Premier of New South Wales, attended the oft-quoted conference merely as advocates for the mine-owners. How difRamsay MacDonald, the Labour Premier of Great Britain, during the recent dispute in the cotton industry in that country. cashire met in conference and decided to effect a very considerable cut in the wages of their employees. The employees concerned numbered about 200,000, and the employers only about 418. The Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain did not view the situation with a detached air of super refinement. He immediately visited the industrial centre concerned, and exhaustively investigated the matter, calling to his assistance the best brains of I submit that that is not so. I point out the country. Within a few hours they had arrived at an agreement by which the men were to return to work at a reduction not of 13 per cent., but of 6 per cent., in their wages, and the whole matter was to be referred to arbitration. Those employers were big men, not actuated by motives of animosity against those in tlieir employ. With these fine examples before it, one wonders why the Government could not rise above party. In our newspapers we read how Mr to do so. There is no foundation for Philip Snowden had not been long in office before he took the train to Dover and crossed the English Channel to the continent to inverview the statesmen of France and Germany and other nations concerned with reparations. The result of his visit was that the British nation was placed on a higher pedestal than it had occupied under the Baldwin regime, or any of the Tory governments that have cursed England for years. The Ramsay MacDonald Government contains some of the finest, brains in the Old Countrybrains which will be used to confer lasting benefits on the people. In its comparatively few hours of office, it has already restored the confidence of the people in the government of the country -a confidence such as does not -exist in Mr West. Australia to-day. There will be no settlement of the problems confronting Australia until there has been a change His of government. As surely as the sun will rise to-morrow, there will be a return to prosperity with a change of government in Australia. ber's time has expired. p.m.],I shall not speak at great length on this bill, for I realize that there are still many honourable members on both sides who desire to exThe cotton-spinners of Lanpress their views. But on an occasion like this I am not prepared to give a silent vote. I shall endeavour briefly to explain the reason why I intend to cast my vote in favour of the bill. It is not that the fate of the Government is at stake. Honourable members opposite have reiterated that the passing of this legislation means the abolition of arbitration. that the bill retains to the Commonwealth the control of the maritime industries; the existing awards of the court will be preserved in their entirety till the 30th June next, unless in the meantime State legislation of a conflicting character is enacted. [Quorum formed.'] The bill does not abolish arbitration; it merely paves the way for the establishment of one authority. It will give to the Statesf u ll power to act in circumstances in which the Commonwealth lacks power the charge that the Nationalist party has discarded arbitration as a principle, or that the passing of this measure will dislocate industry. It has been urged that the people should be consulted before this bill comes into operation. Surely, after four unsuccessf ul attempts to get the electors to agree to an alteration of the Constitution, another appeal to them is not justified at a time when the Commonwealth is experiencing serious financial and economic difficulties. It is said that the Prime Minister's outlook is altogether too doleful. I have read the report of the recent Premiers Conference, and noted with interest that the only Labour Premier present spoke in much the same strain. Indeed his remarks were even more emphatic than",130,Number Of Persons Employed

286,Mr Speaker,"The honourable mem(hose of the Prime Minister. He concluded hy saying that the industrial situation in the Commonwealth was largely responsible for the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. There is nothing inconsistent about the action of the Government in introducing, this bill. We must judge its views on arbitration not by this hill alone, but by its general attitude toneed for uniformity. wards industrial questions. Honourable members should not forget that when the primary producers of Australia, particularly those in Queensland and Western Australia, were faced with ruin, the passing of the Transport Workers Act, introduced by the Government, restored a reasonable measure of peace in industry, and secured to those primary producers a market for their produce. The Opposition has challenged the Government to appeal to the electors on the arbitration question; but it has not displayed a great deal of enthusiasm about the matter. When on a previous occasion tlie Opposition challenged the Government on an issue, the Nationalist party swept the poll; and I have no doubt that if the present challenge were accepted, and un appeal made to the country, the Government would have another decisive victory. Honourable members opposite should be chary about issuing challenges of this nature. One or two features of the bill appeal lo me-particularl y the provision for the abolition of penalties for strikes and lockthroughout the Commonwealth. Honorouts. Similar legislation in the sister doable members of the Opposition have minion of New Zealand has had good results. With this legislation on the statute-book we can expect more harmonious relations between employers and employees. Under existing conditions a dispute must spread to more than one State before the Federal Arbitration Oourt can deal with it. The very atmosphere caused by the present legislation tends to the spreading of disputes. This bill will remedy that state of affairs by creating an entirely different atmosphere -on e in which more conciliatory methods will be possible. I am very glad that the proposed maritime committees will be expected to pay regard to the possible economic effect of any determination they may make. The people approve of the protection of the workers by insuring to tliem a fair wage and decent working conditions, but for some time they have realized that those who pay the piper must also be considered. The Government is wise, therefore, in proposing that the consumers who will be affected by the determinations of the maritime committees must be studied. A great deal has been said about the That argument would bave some weight if uniformity were possible in all respects, but the States have varying climates, assets, liabilities, and productive capabilities. It has been impossible to bring about uniformity even in taxation. Therefore, any lack of uniformity that may result from the system proposed by the Government will not be very serious. In any case, I cannot see that uniformity will be seriously prejudiced by the bill. Of the 155 industrial Commonwealth awards operating in Australia only twelve are applicable to all the States, and the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers Union .has deliberately elected to be under the jurisdiction of the State Arbitration Court, although all other branches are registered in the Commonwealth Court. Mr Lang's introduction of the 44-hour working week and the child endowment legislation in New South Wales did more than anything else in it3 political history to bring about unemployment in that State, and to defeat the ideal of uniformity of industrial conditions declared that duplication of awards is not a serious detriment to industry, but I am told that seventeen industries in Victoria alone are adversely affected by the overlapping of Federal and State awards. As an example of this vexatious anomaly, I mention the implement manufacturing business of H . V. McKay and Company; it is subject to fifteen Federal awards and 23 State awards or determinations, the provisions of which in regard to hours, overtime, holidays, and other conditions vary. There are Federal and State awards applying to men doing the same work. That is the case with the carters and drivers. Another anomaly is that non-unionists can have no rights under a federal award. The industrial powers of ..the Commonwealth do not permit the court to make a common rule, and it can function only when an interstate dispute is brought about by interested parties. The State courts on the other hand have complete power to make their awards applicable to all persons engaged in an industry. There has been much talk of errors of trial and financial realms, I . a m happy judgment, and we have been told that to support the Government, and I wish the Nationalist platform is slipping from it luck in dealing with this measure. under our feet.

For good or ill the That Commonwealth to exercise others. The dual jurisdiction there is no uniformity, and in illustration of that they mention that the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers Union prefers the jurisdiction of the State Arbitration Court, while other branches of the same organization consider that they are best served by the Commonwealth court. Australia, with an area 25 times as great as that of Great Britain and Ireland, with industries separated by immense distances, a wide distribution of population, and great variations of climate and resources, is not yet an economic unity. Different localities may have no community of interest, but certain portions of the country undoubtedly have; and in the same way a commercial firm may think it a sound policy to establish a business in Melbourne and Sydney, but not in Perth and Darwin, a body of workers, bound together by a sense of mutual interests and independence, may discover the wisdom of not putting all their eggs in one basket. For instance, I draw attention to the variations of the pastoral industry, due to the different sizes and character of the runs and the fact that some of the areas are divided by enormous distances and are dependent on differing means of communication. the argument that there can be no industrial order without uniformity, and that it is unsound to have two authorities functioning within the same limit, I say that that is of the essence of the economic structure of Australia. It is a reality to which we must adapt ourselves, and I resent any government being so unsportsmanlike as to quarrel with the state of the wicket. It should play the game. Sitting suspended from 12.^5 to 2.15 p.m. (Friday). dustries of Australia widely scattered, with differing characteristics exhibitiug themselves even in the same industry in different parts of Australia, but ""there are also certaiu points of resemblance. For example, a coach builder working, say, in the town of Northam, in Western Australia, or Longreach in Northern Queensland, with, perhaps, one assistant to help him in his work, could not be expected to agree that the determination of his wages, hours and conditions of employment should be the result of a decision arrived at in Melbourne or in Sydney, where the predominant conditions of the industry in those two cities would naturally have an important influence in the making of the decision. Just as it would be absurd to apply to the coachbuilder of Northam, a federal award for all Australia, so it would be equally absurd to apply to the coachbuilders of Melbourne and Sydney -wher e the conditions are almost identical, where they live in a metropolis exhibiting all the manifestations of modern progress in a variety of forms-a n award that applied, to the Northam man. And so it seems to me to be quite reasonable that there should be. these two forms of authority available; one to meet the differences that distinguish the coachbuilder at Northam from the coachbuilder at either Sydney or Melbourne, and also an instrumentality to effect some reasonable approximation on the basis of equity as between the coachbuilder at Melbourne and the coachbuilder at Sydney. by a co-ordination of authorities in the various States? number of ways. It is not at all essential to repeal one of the important powers which the Constitution has allocated to this Parliament to enable these industrial arrangements to be effected. The bill, in essence, involves but one proposal, the repeal of the whole arbitral authority which has been exercised by this Parliament for 25 years. That is its purpose. Although the present economic conditions have been used as a sort of fortification for this change, the real argument is that of duality. The Government says that that is inherently wrong, yet, all over the world, these dual systems of regulating industry are operating. In the United States of America, the transportation workers, the locomotive brotherhood of enginemen and men engaged in industries of that description, are under continent-wide agreements; but at the same time, it is quite understandable that all the workers of that country would not be subject to a continent-wide agreement, and in America, without any arbitral law, a sensible recognition of economic realities has",132,Number Of Persons Employed

289,To Mr Curtin,"It can be done in agiven that variation in industrial conditions which, it is said, is bad in the case of Australia, because it has been brought about under dual control. system, the Government contends, is bad for Australia. The real answer is that it is not the law that has created these differentiations. They have developed in consequence of the progress of our economic life, and whether we have an arbitral law or not, we cannot put the whole of the workers into one pool, any more than one State can pool the whole of its workers. Why then the insistence on the part of honourable members on this side that this Parliament shall retain authority to deal with certain aspects of industrial conditions in this country? Pifty years ago, I-think it was, Thomas Carlyle said that the problem of labour was the supreme vital problem of the world. It was the problem, so he said, of the whole future for those who, in the future, would seek to govern men. Where stands this federation, symbol of the unity which, broadly speaking, characterizes the Australian people, this legislative agency which time and our own good sense has given to us? What part is it going to play in the future in connection with this supreme, vital problem of the world? The Prime Minister says that he will vacate the field of arbitration, except for a few men who are engaged in the maritime service in Australia, and even there there is -a distinction. He will deal with wages and conditions of employment of the maritime workers, but he will not deal with the conditions of their employers. He will not have authority exercised over the controllers and owners of the requisites of the maritime industry. He is agreeable that John Brown's coal shall not be produced until John Brown so wishes, and that there shall be no interthe light of a sort of continental unity ference on the part of this Government or of this Parliament. But once John Brown opens his mines, produces coal, and places one ton of it upon the wharfs at Newcastle for shipment to Adelaide, then the terrific power of this Parliament and of this Government will be brought to bear to ensure that no one interferes with it. But, so that John Brown may have his own way, there must be no interMr Curtin. ference until he says it has become a matter of great profit to himself to carry on the operation of coal production. with which to describe the Government's action. It is stupid for this Parliament to say to the great mass of the working people of Australia, "" There is no hope for you in the legislation that we may pass. You may go to election after election, but this chamber, which, for 25 years has been the repository of possibilities for you-whic h has passed humanitarian laws exercising authority for the protection of your wages, hours and conditions of employment-wil l do nothing for you. Now the chapter of hope is ended, and this Parliament in future will be the bulwark for only the hopes and aspirations of the employers."" The workers may not look to the Comthis monwealth Parliament, with its panoply of purpose of government, for anything for their own good. "" It is not because the law is helpless "", Benjamin Disraeli once said, "" Tell me not that you cannot do it ; if you wish it to be done, there are ways and means open to you to do it. "" What is tht' history of the arbitration system of Australia? As time went on, various alterations took place in the orientation of trade unionism. Small craft unions in a State became organized more or less upon an industrial basis. Then they began to stretch out to their brothers in the other States, and gradually the organizations were joined together. The Arbitration Act became one of the means whereby unionism in Australia developed. It enabled men, not only to meet upon the broad field of this continent to discuss their conditions in and agreement, but also to discover how, by contact and amalgamation, they could, perhaps, make better use of the instrumentalities of the Commonwealth and the States. It is true, to some extent, that the working men, through their leaders and executives, were able to make a choice of State or Federal courts. Apparently, that has been an awful thing in the eyes of the Government, simply",135,Number Of Persons Employed

293,Mr Curtin,"Wicked is a poor wordbecause it has made it. possible for a man to do a little better here than he is doing there Wby should not the working man in Australia have the choice of one or other of these tribunals? To tlie mind of the Government for any great group of workers to be able to choose between or the possibility of going to one specified tribunal anathema, because it opens up a wider possibility of improving their conditions. I contend that that is not wrong. It seems to me to be quite reasonable that the onus of proving the propriety of the jurisdiction before which men may go should certainly rest with the party which takes the initiative. What is wrong with that? These men hope to make things a little better for themselves. No one else attempts to improve their wages, lessen their hours, or to make better their conditions of employment, so they go to the union meetings and examine the alternatives before them. There is always the alternative of the strike, and of starving upon the boss's door-step until he surrenders. behind the Government glibly quoted statistics which, for the most part, they did not themselves understand, to show that working men had, time after time, resorted to strikes. The facts are that nine-tenths of the workers of Australia, given the choice between a competent tribunal and the.strike weapon, would prefer to allow their claims to be subjected to a reasonable examination, with a possibility of improvement, by the tribunal. And so they have gone to one or other of these tribunals. The Australian Journalists Association has been mentioned by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West). What is its position? There are a number of great newspapers in Australia. For the most part they are centred in the capital cities. Those great organizations of capital are becoming increasingly powerful every day, and increasingly necessary, from the point of view of the Government, if it is to remain in power. Australian journalists, the employees of these newspapers, recognize that they should have a federal jurisdiction, and they have never had any difficulty in demonstrating that that is the right and proper procedure. Everybody knows the resemblance between the Melbourne Argus, a capitalist organization, and the Sydney Morning Herald. From the stand-point of the forms of employment they offer, and the number of men they require to produce their newspapers, it one award and another does not matter whether it is the Argus or the Sydney Morning Herald, because as against another is they are identical industrial propositions. They are counterparts of each other, and it would be ridiculous for the journalists, printers, or typographers of the Argus to have an award different from that appertaining to the staff of the Sydney Morning Herald. But there are small weekly and fortnightly papers scattered throughout, the countryside. There are job printers who never print newspapers at all, but who employ men in vocations almost identical with those followed by employees-suc h as compositors and linotypers-of the Age, Argus, and other great newspaper offices. Do honourable members opposite contend that, in order to have a sound rational industrial policy for Australia, all these men Honourable members must be put under either one of six separate awards and that the employees of small newspaper offices, say, at Orange or at Broken Hill, must be under the same award as employees of the Sydney Morning Herald' . The State can no more 1 guarantee that that will not happen than honourable members opposite can guarantee what the Federal Court will do in pursuance of the awards it makes under the acts which this Government passes. Is it to be urged that because a sound case has been established for an interstate jurisdiction, an intra-state jurisdiction should not be contemporaneously operative for employees in similar establishments engaged in the production of what, in many respects, is the same kind of article? Before lunch, I gave as an example the case of the shearers of Queensland. Is it reasonable that those shearers should be pushed into an award with the shearers in the Midlands of Tasmania? The climatic conditions of the two States are radically different; the wool grown is altogether different; the average weight of the wool in the fleece, of course, different, because of the differentiation of pastures. Yet is it not reasonable that shearers in the Riverina should have a similar award to that of men engaged in the northern parts of Victoria, where it is merely a case of . doing a hop, step and a jump to cross the river Murray? Is it wrong that they should have a federal award in which their conditions would be bulked together? After all it is not the river Murray that determines the region of economic identity. defines the economic domain. No one can define the word "" industry "" and, with all respect to the Attorney-General, I say that no one can define exactly the words "" trade and commerce "". For years the Federal Court could not define the word "" industry "" and I have no doubt that in the future, when that crop of litigation, which this exercise of the trade and commerce power is going to bring forth, comes before the court, it will declare again its incapacity to determine the precise definition of the term. In ascertaining the meaning of a word one must always have regard to its application and context. "" Trade and commerce"" in reference to coal, will mean coal in transit from Newcastle to Adelaide, but not coal in ""transit from ""Wallstrial power to the Commonwealth. end to Newcastle. What an absurdity. Take a boot manufacturer. Is he engaged in trade or manufacture? If this bill becomes law a manufacturer in Victoria will have to subject himself to a State award in whatever way that award is elaborated. tered in the State courts now. cause there is no registration there. The honourable member's publicity officer has not served him too well. Take the case of a manufacturer of boots. He, it may be contended, is engaged in industry, but if he does nothing else, what happens to the boots? Has he not to sell them? And having sold them, is he not engaged in trade? Is it not conceivable that there will come down amendments of this very procedure extending the application of the term ""trade and commerce""? It may be that under this power that is expressed without limiting words such as limit the arbitration powers with a government in the future that believes that John Brown's employees should not be subject to it to a greater extent than John Brown thinks fit, a spanner will be thrown into the machinery of constitutional practice in Australia and will probably bring forth more difficulty than the present arrangement. Who are the federalists in this Parliament? Eeference was made to the report No geographical boundary of the conference of premiers which was held in Canberra, early this year, in consultation with the Prime Minister. Certain honourable members have quoted the opinion of the Premier of Western Australia ( Mr Collier) on the point. This is really what he saidI admit that there are some industrial questions over which the Commonwealth should have control, and they would be questions of common interest and concern to the States. I would not advocate that the Commonwealth Parliament should vacate altogether the field of industrial legislation. That was in reply to a proposition advanced by the Prime Minister, in these wordsI now invite the Premiers to state definitely whether they are prepared to recommend to tlieir parliaments the reference of full indusThat meant the very opposite from the proposition now before the House. It meant the evacuation by the States of authority in industrial matters. I submit, that that would be no more reasonable than the present proposal. I make that contention having regard to the economic condition of this continent, and to the fact that there are important definite local areas in Australia that are remote from all the others, where the ties of relationships are difficult to decipher in that connection. Western Australia may be cited as a sort of larger area. There is, as it were, a large sea of sand dividing that State from the main life of the Commonwealth. There is only a 4 f t . 8£in. gauge railway, apart from the sea-borne trade, connecting Western Australia with the rest of the Commonwealth in the matter of material ties. It is very difficult to discover actual contact in the sense of absolute close relationship between the industries of Western Australia and those of Eastern Australia. I recognize that, and refuse to agree to the proposition of the Prime Minister as also did Mr Collier, that Western Australia should",136,Number Of Persons Employed

It is quite possible that in the fulness of time, when there is a devolution of governing agencies in Australia, when the States have changed their precise character, and there is a development of some form of provincial administrative agencies, that sovereignty, in its entirety, will pass from the States to the Commonwealth. But that time has not yet arrived. The Prime Minister went to the Premiers' Conference with two propositions, both of which, I believe to be a disservice in their application to the people of the nation. One was that no other Government than his own should have this power. that unless the Government absolute power he would refuse to exercise any power. view are not in conformity with the essential principles of federalism which this nation has developed and applied through the two arms of its legislative agencies, and when all is said and done, are supposed to be handed on to this Parliament to carry out and administer. I know that honourable members who sit behind the Prime Minister make a great deal, particularly in connection with Western Australia, of the so-called evil effects of unification, which, allegedly, would ensue if a Labour party got into power. I ask the Western Australian representatives in this chamber, what would have been the position if the Prime Minister had got his way at the Premiers' Conference, and the States had agreed to give him absolute industrial power? Would that not have been a unification of the control of industry? Industry is the most important thing in the life of this nation. Upon its development, the manner in which it is carried out, the changes that come to it, and upon its healthy future really depends the development of the material prosperity of the country. And we shall have a chance of a prosperous industry if this Government takes from 900,000 workmen the protection of the statutes that have been built up over a generation of experience in this Commonwealth. It is all very well to say, ""Whati f those privileges had not been granted?"" That which men have never known, they never miss. But, at present, there are over 400,000 workmen operating under federal awards. Honourable members opposite have said, "" They will be all right; we have given them the right to continue under the present system up to the 30th June, ,1930. In the meantime the States will carry out the requisite changes to enable the awards to be effective in v practice "". Who can accept that as being a true picture of the practicalities of State politics in Australia. Some honourable members oppositehave claimed that matters could be righted by a simple two-line bill. In all the previous important The other was negotiations between the States and the had Commonwealth in which radical changes have been effected in the policy of the Those points of Commonwealth, definite agreements have been made with the States. That was the case in connection with the Financial Agreement, the Main Roads Agreement, and the agreement affecting the development of the joint health policy of the States and of the Commonwealth. Conference after conference was held between the Commonwealth and the State Health Departments, and eventually a definite agreement was arrived at dealing with maternal hygiene and infant protection, with a view to improving the health of our children. But here there is no agreement with the States. This bill is to be passed, and the whole of the awards simply cast upon the States to do the best they can. Unlike the State Parliaments, the Commonwealth Parliament is elected on the votes of all the people. One State has a nominee Upper House which is an anachronism in this country, and an age like this. The rest of the State Upper Houses are elected on a restricted property franchise, and are the citadels of reactionary conservatism in this continent. The Commonwealth Government should be active in the field of industrial legislation because of the pernicious influence which the Upper Houses of the States have exercised in the shaping of State instrumentalities in connection with industrial legislation. Until 1907 Tasmania made no attempt to regulate in any way, industrially, while the State of Victoria was for years saturated with old world iniquities. The clothing trade instance in Victoria was mentioned this morning. The State Parliament had sovereign powers then, as it is assumed to have now, and a Parliament with a background like that cannot be trusted to do the fair thing by the workers of Victoria. It is true that, with is that this bill is one to reduce the centwo exceptions, the States have something iu the way of an industrial code and the* registration of unions. If all that has been said by ministerialists in support of this measure is correct, the same duplication of awards will continue. Reference has been made to the establishment of H . V. McKay Limited. majority of the workers in that establishpowers of the unions, so that their memment worked for years under determinations made in compliance with the Victorian wages board system. There were probably a dozen different awards in operation. I have had experience in Victoria of working under a number of different awards. In the timber industry there were four awards-on e for the city, another for certain towns, another for country wood-workers, and a fourth foi"" bushmen. Honourable members contrasting the large list of State awards with the two States will no longer be obtainable. Commonwealth awards said that because the number of awards under the States is greater than the awards of the Commonwealth, the former must be more popular. That is not so; it merely shows the limitation of State awards when four awards are necessary to do the work of one. The question of the sovereignty of the States has arisen. Awai'ds made in pursuance of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act are absolute in their sovereignty over those which are subject to them. There can be no question about that, in view of the decision of the High Court regarding the supremacy of the Commonwealth awards. What is wrong with Commonwealth awards? Commonwealth award in any industry contributed to the present economic diffilong hours, and poor conditions, culties of Australia ? Why did the Prime Minister bring forward that argument in the discussion of this subject? If dupliin Tasmania to succeed. What will hapcation is an evil; if the two systems of arbitration should come to an end; let them come to an end on their own merits as intrinsic factors in the regulation of industrial conditions, and not merely because some person is unable to make a Mr Curtin. profit. Do honourable members opposite suggest that arbitration awards have caused all the mischief that has occurred in industry; that they underlie the present period of depression? If they suggest that, the only possible deduction tralized authority over federal industries, so that those industries may be split up into State segments. It is hoped that the trade unions now operating upon an interstate scale will be dissolved into six small bodies, each with comparatively few members and limited resources. It is The great introduced in order to reduce the fighting bers may be at the mercy of the State with the lowest standard of living. The standard of that State will become tbe standard for Australia. This bill invites the workmen of Australia to chase one another down the pit of misery. It means that the comparatively high rates of wages which they can now command because of highly-organized industries in The trade unions will be rent asunder and the comradeship of trade unionists broken. The Government knows that every blow struck at the unity of labour is a factor towards its demoralization. This bill, if agreed to, will bring about those results whether or not it is aimed at doing so. and conquer."" members supporting the Government say that this measure does not involve the overthrow of arbitration. Let us consider the industrial position in the several States. In Western Australia there are comparatively few highly-organized secHas a ondary industries. Tasmania has behind it a history of low wages, largely due to its competitive disabilities. It is almost impossible for manufacturers pen if this measure is placed on the statute-book?

HonorableTasmania are not so good as they are in Victoria and New South Wales, the result will be that Tasmanian workmen will be placed under a greater disability than if they were permitted to link up with their big brothers on the mainland. There is now a possibility of Tasmanian workmen being given conditions which approximate to the mean Australian standard, whereas this bill would regulate their conditions on a purely Tasmanian standard. The Federal Arbitration Court has not proclaimed uniform wages throughout Australia, but has agreed to a certain flexibility. By a process of averaging, and having regard to a number of factors, it has arrived at what economists recognize as an Australian standard. That standard has been, as it were, a spiritlevel to guide State instrumentalities in fixing rates and conditions of employment. The remarks of Mr Justice Heydon, in the boot case quoted by the honordie great peak periods of industry demand able member for Macquarie ( Mr more labour they are ready to be dragged Chifley), are a complete answer to the contention of the Attorney-General that this bill will not affect the standard of living.

If it does not mean that we shall have more work done for less pay, what have economic problems to do with the bill, as such? That the two things are related is obvious. The Prime Minister recently addressed the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney. Before he did so I doubted whether all the arguments in support of this bill had been presented to Parliament. I felt that some still remained in the background. The Prime Minister does not wear his heart on his sleeve; he expresses one idea here and another idea somewhere else. Before one can get the philosophy of the right honourable gentleman, one must go on a collecting tour and gather what he has said here, and there and somewhere else. try at any time have ' the conWhen they had all been pieced together, trollers of great industries volunone might know what the right honourable tarily asked the workers to a conference gentleman is after.

Not one improvement things would have to be given up; that has been made in the conditions of the amalgamation of capital in such combines would be more evident in the future. He pointed to Germany and the United States as countries in which enormously powerful trusts and combines had largely overcome waste, and increased efficiency. That is true. Those are the economic results of the formation of these huge concerns. But what of the human results? Do honourable members opposite present tlie United States of America as a country where civilization is a real thing; where efficiency produces social justice; where humanity has a fair chance; where life is regarded as a precious asset? The lowest average percentage of unemployment for the whole of the workers in the United States of America is higher than the highest average rate in Australia. There is always in the United States of America a great army of unemployedthe hoboes of civilization, the Lazaruses who wait upon the Dives-so that when in and paid by the hour, or the minute.

This bill will reduce the standard of livpervading, and the old human relationing of which honourable members opposite boast so much, but to which they have contributed nothing. There were three main points iu the Prime Minister's speech. With two of those points-the economic position awardsI have already dealt. The third point is contained in the question"" Why do not the unionists observe the awards ?"" The Attorney-General said that the Labour movement is unable to guarantee that an unpopular award will be observed, and that, therefore, the Commonwealth should vacate the field of arbitration legislation. Is that the reason for the introduction of this bill? why arbitration should be destroyed. If it is, those who say so mu3t prove their indictment. So far they have not done so. In no country in which modern industrial conditions obtain is the time lost by the workers, as a result of industrial disputes, as little as in Australia. Accordof unionism, or the Australian staning to reports submitted to the International Labour Office, the two countries which lead the world in respect of the absence of industrial disputes, are the only two in which a legalized system of compulsory arbitration is in operation, New Zealand and Australia. The reason for this is obvious. As the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) pointed out, of all the unions operating under industrial awards in Australia, only one particular group has been associated with frequent industrial disputes, and the Government does not suggest that the Commonwealth should surrender its powers to control that insurgent group of unions. The coal-miners, the seamen, and the waterside-workers, are not mere malcontents who are always ready to fight about nothing. What is the impelling force behind their incessant disputations? A ll three groups are working under those forms of industrial control which the Prime Minister recently urged the Chamber of Manufactures to adopt. They are serving huge aggregations of capital, controlling industries in which competition is dead, the individualism of employers at an end, the joint-stock idea allship between employer and employee, non-existent. The wharf labourers, the seamen, and the coal-miners perceive thai their employers have amassed great fortunes which they never use to improve their industry or raise the standards of their employees, and that is the secret of and the duplication of the great difference between the peaceful groups of unions engaged in the manufacturing industries, and those working for the Newcastle Coal Vend and the shipping combine. For twenty years the coal-miners at Collie have not had a dispute with their employers. The owners of the mines pay a higher hewing rate and sell for a lower price per ton than the Newcastle firms; yet they can make their industry pay, and the Newcastle coal magnates cannot. There must be some explanation of this, and as usual, when things go wrong, honourable members opposite blame the workers and the Arbitration Court. The economic condition of Australia to-day is not attributable to the Arbitration Act, or the policy dard of living. The real causes are the twin burdens of cost of capital and cost of government. These, operating and reacting on each other, are sapping the lifeblood out of the productive industries. Many are trying ,to pay interest on watered stock, and we hear of new flotations in which of £500,000 subscribed, only £300,000 is to be used in the business, the balance being absorbed in watered stock, brokerage, and promoters' shares. In a hundred and one ways the enormous interest bill of the nation is imposing an increasingly heavy burden on industry. If all that honourable members have said about this bill be true, it can have but one purpose, and that is to divide Australian unionism so that it will be represented by so many scattered and shattered fractions instead of an army, mobilized and on the march.

301,Mr Cuetin,"That is not the reasoncapable of presenting its case to a central tribunal. Tbe Federal Arbitration Court has been naked to tbe gaze of all men. One of the great influences that has operated to overthrow the sweaters and exploiters, has been the exposure of their practices at the open hearings before the court. Is it not significant and sinister that the bill proposes star-chamber hearings; that there shall be no public statement of the facts or the reasons why an application is granted or refused, and that everything associated with the work of the committees shall be screened from public scrutiny? public of the facts of industry is indispensable to a sound and proper public judgment. The bill does not propose to make that information available to the public, for various reasons, which successive speakers on the Government's side have put forward, each explanation cancelling the other. On the one hand we are told that the hearing should not be in public; because the parties know their own industry and require no evidence, they should be allowed to arrive at an amicable settlement. On the other hand, other champions of the bill say that such an arrangement is dangerous to „ the public, and that there must be a legal superstructure superimposed on these committees, lest the employers and employees, meeting in secret conclave, should arrive at decisions which make them joint partners in exploiting the public. Both arguments cannot be right. If it is necessary for the Chief State ascendancies, and by persisting with Judge of the Maritime Court to this legislation, the Government is not oversee the findings of the comonly striking a vital blow at the workers, mittees, why can he not continue to but is stabbing at the very soul of the do so as Chief Judge of the Arbitration Australian nation.

There can be no private or wholly self-regarding act in a modern industrial community. No one man or group of men, whether of employers or employees, manufacturers or traders, is engaged in an industrial activity that concerns only himself or themselves. Individualism in industry is dead. These matters are of live public concern, and serious importance to the whole of the community. Revelation to the This bill does more than repeal one of the finest chapters in the industrial history of Australia-it opens up a black and dismal prospect. It makes the workers weak in the presence of the enemy, and the enemy strong to impose his own will. This Parliament was regarded by every Australian statesman during the years in which the federal enabling bills were being discussed, as the hope of Australian nationhood, and as an instrument to bring tbe great masses of this country, separated by enormous distance, into elemental bonds of unity and kinship. The industrial workers of the nation, have responded to the hope of the founders of federation. They have united in Australian-wide federations, and they take an active part in the prosecution of the business of the Commonwealth in this national legislature. But for the future, this Parliament will have nothing to offer them. There will be a revival of the old extent legal. I am afraid that' we have",142,Number Of Persons Employed
302,Mr Graham Pratten (Martin),"been inclined to attach too much importance to the latter aspect. Overlapping industrial legislation has produced nothing but conflict. I do not helieve that industrial regulation should be abolished for it is instrumental in maintaining proper wage standards and working conditions, but the present system of dual control is the cause of endless irritation to both parties and much economic waste. Therefore, either the Commonwealth or the States, must withdraw from the field of industrial arbitration. On four occasions the people bave seen fit to disapprove of an extension of Commonwealth powers, and this Parliament has no option but to withdraw and leave the field entirely to the States. The last referendum was taken as late as i926, when the people in no uncertain terms,, gave their verdict against the appeal made by this Government. heartily endorse the refusal of the Government to commit the country to an expenditure of £100,000, and the interested parties to a similar expense, in holding another referendum. We have had a definite answer from the people, and the State Premiers have declined to withdraw from the field of arbitration, or even to submit the matter to their Parliaments. We cannot possibly carry on under present conditions, and the only course open to the Government is that represented by this bill. I propose to deal with the subject from two aspects. all, from the point of view of the untold harm dual control system is doing to industry in Australia to-day, and, secondly, of the huge expense incurred, not only by the Commonwealth, but also by both sides in industry. When there is a dispute in industry a conference is held; but it invariably breaks down and there is a further appeal to the Arbitration Court. The union feels that, by taking the case to the court, people of the world. not only will it not have to give something away, but there will be a chance of gaining something. So the case is taken to the court. Suppose that it is heard in Sydney, and then; because of interstate interests, adjourned in. turn to Melbourne, Adelaide, and, perhaps, to every other capital city of Australia. In that way, Mr Graham Pratten. the representatives of both sides would journey to the various capitals. An adjournment may then be secured from one State capital to another which it not the capital of the State in which most of the parties to the dispute reside. What is . the position, then, of those who conduct the industries of this country while this skirmishing is going on from one city to another? How can they hope to arrive at costs of production, and to make estimates for contracts in competition with outside manufacturers ? They are more or less in a continual state of uncertainty. They know perfectly well that, when an award is made, it may not be accepted and that a movement for a further dispute may be started at any time, resulting in a further appeal to the court and many more months of litigation. So long as that opportunity exists, and so long as we In those circumstances I have a system of arbitration which excludes conciliatory methods available to the States, but prohibited to the Commonwealth, there is bound to be endless industrial trouble. One of the greatest difficulties that the federal court is faced with is that it is unable to enforce its decisions, and, as a result, the unions practically control the alteration of awards. An award is given, after litigation has been going on for, perhaps, two or three years, the union objects to it, and uses its most powerful weapon, the strike, on the pretext of claiming higher wages. BargainPirst of ing then commences between the union officials and the court. The union officials say that they are agreeable to recommend to their men that they return to work on condition that the case is re-opened. That takes place, and invariably the award is altered in favour of the unions. That has been going on for many years, and our Arbitration Court is now the laughing stock of the people of Australia, and Australia the laughing-stock of the Honourable members opposite and their supporters have not failed on everyoccasion to incite the men to disobey the law and to ridicule to the utmost the judges of the Arbitration Court when awards are not to their liking; but they praise the same judges to the skies when the awards are in their favour. Look at the disgraceful performance of the timber workers in Sydney only a few months ago, when they stooped so low as to actually burn the effigy of an Arbitration Court judge who gave a decision unfavourable to them. We can understand them burning ballot-papers, their union leaders would see to that, knowing that it would be as much as their jobs were worth to allow the men to take a ballot. The timber workers were not alone in their action. They were supported by their parliamentary representatives. I do not believe that every honourable member opposite, in his own heart, approved of what took place in Sydney, but he dared not voice his disapproval. I pay a tribute to tbe work of the New South Wales police in upholding the law, but at the same time we could not expect them to enforce the federal law as effectively as they would the law of their own State. To continue the system of federal arbitration we should need an efficient police force, and all honourable members will agree that that is quite out of the question at present. How many times lately have we read of the attempts of Messrs. Garden, Ryan and company to intimidate the New South Wales police? Have we not heard of the famous "" black-book"" which is kept in a "" safe place"" at the Trades Hall and in which is entered the names and numbers of policemen, so that action can be taken against them in the event of a Labour Government gaining office in New South Wales? If ever the people of that State are foolish time they must be prepared to earn those enough to hand the reins of government to Mr Lang aud his followers, God help them. Because of the resrictions imposed upon the Australian shipping 'industry under the Arbitration Act and the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act, we have had strike after strike on the waterfront, and at every port in the Commonwealth there are numerous idle vessels; the reason given being that the court is quite unable to accede to the extravagant demands of the union. An interruption to our interstate and oversea shipping, and the cutting qff of our coal supplies, has paralysed industry. Thousands of men have been out of work, and women and children are on the verge of starvation. What has the dual control system done towards preventing strikes? It has done nothing. In fact, it has been an obstacle in the way of the settlement of strikes. Let us consider for a moment the extraordinarily powerful position of an Arbitration Court Judge, and how easy it is for him to make a mistake which might have a most disastrous effect on the community as a whole. It must follow that an Arbitration Court Judge has only a superficial knowledge of the trades with which he is dealing. His knowledge, perhaps, of that trade can be compared with the layman's knowledge of law. The community, through its parliamentary representatives, vests this * power in a judge to enable him to give decisions that might be totally out of keeping with the ability of the community to pay, and totally regardless of the seven Governments and seven Treasurers who are endeavouring to live within their means. Consequently, they are committed to endless expense over which they have no control, and . they can square their ledgers only by imposing extra taxation and by the wholesale dismissal of employees. [Quorum formed.] How then can we possibly reduce our cost of production, and so compete with other manufacturers of the world? Wp are, indeed, proud of our high standard of living, and I am sure that we are all unanimous in our desire that our workers should continue to receive, good wages. But at the same wages. We are repeatedly told by honorahle members opposite that when we speak of reducing costs of production, we mean a reduction in the wages of the workers. Here is an opportunity to reduce the cost ofproduction in industry by some millions of pounds, yet the proposal is receiving the most bitter opposition from the Labour members. Most union officials are against the measure, but, at the same time, are completely devoid of any remedy for our industrial evils. I realize that we shall never be absolutely free of industrial trouble, but at all events we can reduce it to a minimum. To-day the opposing sides to industry are spending far too much time in fighting one another instead of devoting their efforts to the production pf goods, and so enhancing the national wealth of Australia. The lengthy procedure of securing awards and its cost are undoubtedly not taken into consideration by the advocates before the court, because they are entirely dependent upon industrial disputes for their very existence. As one honourable member truly said, they are mere parasites on industry. Our workers, unfortunately, have no more control over their unions than honourable members opposite have over the policy that they are compelled to adopt. SinceI have been in this HouseI have never witnessed an honourable member opposite speaking or voting other than as dictated by his party bosses. Honourable members opposite depend for their very existence on dancing to the tune of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions or of the Pan-Pacific Secretariat, and so, also, the unfortunate worker has to depend for his job on taking the advice of his union officials. The country would be saved enormous expense if these officials devoted their time to promoting peace in industry instead of disputes. Similarly, on the other side of industry, it is necessary to bad feature about federal arbitration. incur tremendous expense. In some cases a single industry has as many as 30 awards to obey, which means that the conductor of a big business is compelled to employ the services of a special officer, the contention of the Federal Arbitration Or even to establish a secretarial department especially to administer awards. The result is that there is so much regulation of each employee's work that the employers will not give a man a job unless it is absolutely necessary. We must not overlook the cost to the Government of providing inspectors and departmental officials to see that awards are properly carried out. It is clearly seen that this dual control of arbitration complicates matters industrially to such an extent that an award-making industry is actually created, at the expense of the employer, the employee and the country. The industrial manager suffers loss, and union funds are continually drained, and become a tax upon the workers' wages. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) indicated what a wonderful thing it would be for Australia if we could divert into industry 75 per cent, of the money, brains and energy Ur. Graham Pratten. now taken up in industrial litigation. .1 do not suppose that the combined Federal and State tax has anything like the depressing effect on industry that this dual system of control has. We are struggling hard enough with our industries, in competition with overseas manufacturers in countries which have the very lowest living conditions, which have enormous capital, and unlimited mechanical power at their command. Yet we have to carry this huge unnecessary burden, which cripples our industries and precludes our national expansion. There is a good deal to be said on the score of expense, but it would be impossible to estimate the approximate cost to Australia. It must be enormous. In addition to the expenses of the parties concerned, we have to take into consideration the wages costs of the errors made by the court. In view of the thousands of awards that have to be considered, no one would suggest that the legal mind does not make errors, or is infallible. The rigidity of the system of wage regulation by the court is another Many of its findings are based on false premises. The first one is that when a man turns 21 he immediately acquires a wife and three children-a t least that is Court. According to the State Court of New South Wales he has a wife and two children. At present he has only a wife, and if he is not in receipt of more than £5 a week he has to prove the possession of children. The Federal Statistician, on the other hand., says that the average family unit is a man. his wife, and one and a third children or, to be more logical, every three families has four children. It does not, however, credit a man of 21 with a wife and a ready-made family. What is more extraordinary about the two courts is that while they are not in agreement as to the average size of a family, they are often in agreement as to the cost of supporting a family. Again, there are always three grades of workers in any industry, good, medium, and indifferent. The majority of calculations are based on the medium worker, which indicates that the indifferent worker is overpaid and the good, worker underpaid. If a business has the misfortune to have more indifferent than good workers, its cost of production must necessarily be high. Further, the good workers soon slow down in practice, having no inducement to do more work than the indifferent worker. Where the court fails is that while it can fix wages, it cannot determine the amount of work to be done for that wage, which makes it quite impossible to determine accurately the cost of production. It is interesting to note the methods employed by the court in arriving at awards. Its conclusions are based on three factors, food, groceries and house rent. Other necessary items, such as clothing, are left out of the calculation, as they are considered too uncertain. The three items which I have specified are supposed to rise and fall contemporaneously, but in actual practice that is not so. Recently, owing to the floods in Tasmania, the price of potatoes increased considerably, and in the last variation in the cost of living of 4s., as much as 3s. 4d. was attributed to the rise in the price of potatoes. Potatoes necessarily became a luxury and . were discontinued, so that for two months that expensive item was still continued in the cost of living, without any corresponding increase in the amount of money to pay for it. Consequently, unemployment must necessarily follow. Compulsory industrial arbitration is based upon the theory that if two parties cannot agree they should be made to agree by the decision of a third party, which is the public, represented by a governmental authority. But when either of the two disputing parties is not agreeable to this method, and the third party cannot enforce its decisions on the others, what purpose can be served by continuing it? That argument may be cited against the general principle of comwarmly. pulsory arbitration, both Federal and State; but it is particularly applicable to the federal system, because the effect of its constitutional limitations has been such as to confine its operations to a kind of cold legal formula that has had the effect of congealing the very life-blood of they were about whenthey inserted in industry instead of causing it to circulate freely. The total lost in wages by strikes during the period 1917 to 1926 inclusive was £14,487,891-a n average of £1,448,789 per year. £1,676,696 was lost in this way. As compulsory arbitration with its expense and trouble cannot after 25 years' trial, show a better result than this, it would be better for the parties to industry to settle their own differences rather than keep up an expensive complicated system which has failed to do its job. Of what effect is compulsory arbitration in the settlement of disputes that occur ? During 1927, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, there were 435 industrial disputes recorded. Arbitration authorities, either Commonwealth or State, took part in the settlement of only 32 of the disputes; but by direct negotiation between employers and employees or by the intervention of parties not connected with compulsory arbitration 229 were settled; while the remaining 184 were composed by other methods of conference and conciliation not connected with the governmental arbitration machinery. The arbitration system seems to be fruitfu l in causing strikes, but practically impotent in settling them. Labour members may say that this or that authority proves that disputes are more prevalent elsewhere than in Australia. But .they overlook the fact that industrial conditions elsewhere are not as good, generally speaking, as they are in Australia. Which ever way one looks at it, £1,676,696'is a substantial amount for Australian workers to lose. Let honourable members compare it with what they w ill; let them dig out what statistics they like from this or that overseas publication; the fact still remains that there has been a direct loss of £1,676,696 to the workers. The Commonwealth Constitution, as it was framed in 1899, was a really brilliant achievement. Lord Bryce praised it ""Compared with the Australian Constitution, the American is old fashioned and the Swiss a r c h a i c h e said. Honourable members will, I think, agree that Lord Bryce needs no recommendation as a constitutional authority. The framers of the Constitution knew what the draft the power which the Commonwealth was to have in regard to industry. It was only to have power to "" Conciliate and arbitrate for the settlement of inDuring 1927, dustrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State "". That is, an emergency power only. said of a system of judicial regulation of wages and conditions of labour by the Commonwealth, because all those matters were reserved to the States. The framers of the Constitution knew that the States and the people would not accept any proposition that the Commonwealth should become the arbiter in industrial regulation. In fact, the plain reasoning was that industrial regulation within and by the individual States was presupposed and inevitable. What they had in mind in regard to the emergency power that was to be exercised by the Commonwealth was such widespread disputes as the maritime strike of 1890, and the strike of British and Australian seamen in the big upheaval of 1925. The idea that a costly Federal Court would grow up to deal with the general subject of wage regulation in the States, and to be called into action by fictitious disputes caused by unions amalgamating in different States to approach the Federal Court would, no doubt, have been laughed at in the Federal Convention. Since the federal arbitration system limited. degree it would at least have was founded in 1904 successive Governsome justification for existence.

Mr Willis, M.L.C., Mr Lang's right Nothing was hand man, also expressed himself strongly. Mr George Black, M.L.C., in his book, Compulsory Arbitration a Failure-and Why! quotes Mr Willis's views as followsWhen a decision is arrived at, even by means of voluntary arbitration, it should be given legal effect to, and become binding ou the parties. I never did agree with compulsory arbitration. He was still more definite at the Metropolitan Conference of the New South Wales Australian Labour Party at Sydney, on February 11, last. Mi-.

In the same journal the following statement appearsWo have a conference with the union every twelve months and fix things up. We don't go to the court at all. We went once, years ago. Our wages are fixed automatically, by the rise and fall in the Federal Statistician's cost of living figures. The round table conference is the best way to conduct conciliation. boot trade. employers arc satisfied. We do not always get all we want, for in conciliation there must be give and take. That statement, which I understand was & Company Limited, is elaborated in a further paragraph in the same j o u r n a l : Boot and shoe manufacturers point out that they have not been much of a worry to the Federal Arbitration Court, and little or no difference would be occasioned to the industry if the court were put out of existence. When wages matters need to be dealt with, it has always been found possible to arrange alterations by means of conferences between employers' and employees' representatives direct. The findings of that conference are accepted without demur, and result in what might be described as a federal award without reference to the court at all. The agreement in force continues until it comes to he denounced by either one side or the other after duo notice having 'been given. Every half year a conference takes place between the parties as to the variations necessitated by the variation in the cost of living figures, based on the Commonwealth Statistician's report, and history has shown how successfully this matter has been adjusted in the past. It is generally claimed that the relations between employer and employee in the boot and shoe manufacturing industry are such that whether the Federal Arbitration Court was in existence or not, an amicable arrangement in connection with wages and liours questions could always be arrived at without much difficulty. As one manufacturer put it, the employers are out to reduce costsj naturally, but as a whole they do not believe that cutting wages should be the first step in that direction. The lack of power to make a common, rule makes the Federal Court a laughing stock. It simply means that federal awards apply only to the parties to disputes, and, instead of creating uniformity the Federal Court merely makes one more award to be obeyed or disobeyed. Giving parties an award simply because they have caused an interstate dispute is like giving a stick of candy to two boys for fighting-ever y time they want another lolly they start another fight. An instance of the futility of the Federal Court was the strike of the New South Wales engineers in Sydney in 1926. The Lang Government legislated for a 44-hour week in all New South Wales industries. For those engineers working under the federal court the award was 48 hours. Strictly speaking, they should have continued working under the 48-hour week, because, in It has proved very successful in the theory, the federal award over-rode the If bhe union is satisfied, the conflicting State legislation. But they struck work, and lost thousands of pounds in wages during a period of some weeks. Finally, they went back to work, having compromised on a week of 44 hours with a reduction of wages. Later, a decision of the federal court made the working week 44 hours for these men. They were then over their difficulties; but they might just as well have been under the State jurisdiction in the first place, for they would have had their 44hour week without striking for it, and losing their wages for about two months. In another instance of this confusion the New South Wales railway staffs were concerned. Some of the employees came under federal awards which gave them a 48-hour week. Naturally, they did not want to work 48 hours when many of their colleagues were working only 44 hours each week. The Labour Government therefore agreed that they should collect the higher wage for the federal award, and that they should enjoy the 44hour week. That decision costs the Government of New South Wales £100,000 a year in reimbursing the Commissioners. The men may be worth that extra £100,000; but the point is that, had there been no federal court, there would have been none of this trouble.

My c o n c l u d in g q u o t a t i o n w ill be exPresident Coolidge's final message to the Congress AmericaI n its economic life our country has rejected tlic long accepted law of a limitation of the wage fund, which led to pessimism and despair because it was the doctrine of perpetual poverty, and has substituted for it the American conception that the only l i m it to profits and wages is production, which is the doctrine of optimism and hope, because it leads to prosperity. Here and there the councils of labour are still darkened by the theory that only by limiting individual production can there be any assurance of permanent employment for increasing numbers, but in general, management and wage-earner alike have entered a new era in industrial thought which has unleashed the productive capacity of the individual worker with an increasing scale of wages and profits, the end of which is not yet. The application of this theory accounts for our widening distribution of wealth. No discovery ever did more to increase the happiness and prosperity of the people. Since 1922, increasing production has increased wages in general 12.9 per cent., while in certain selected trades they have run as high as 34.9 per cent, and 38 per cent. Eveni n the boot and shoe shops the increase is over 5 per cent., and in woollen mills 8-4 per cent., although these industries have not prospered like others. As the rise in living costs in this period is -negligible, these figures represent real wage increases.

Therefore, the other 504,000, who constitute the majority, prefer the State arbitration authorities. The Government is taking the only stand consistent with a desire to bring about more amicable relations in industry. Therefore, I give the bill my hearty support. This seems to be a bill of destruction, the far-reaching effects of which cannot be foretold. But as a member of this chamber when every measure dealing of the U n it e d States of with arbitration has been under consideration by this House, I have always considered that this legislation has beeu characterized by too much force and too little conciliation. Speaking on the present bill, the title of which is a misnomer, because it ought to be called "" a bill for the destruction of conciliation and arbitration,"" the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), saidThis is a measure to give effect to the policy of the Government which already has been announced, to withdraw from the field of industrial regulation save in respect of the maritime and waterside industries, which will continue to be controlled by the Commonwealth, not under its arbitration powers, but under the trade and commerce powers of the Constitution. The bill provides for the repeal of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the Industrial Peace Act. . . . The bill is a real contribution towards the solution of the economic problems confronting us. The passing of this legislation w ill free industry from many of the embarrassments from which it has suffered in the past, and enable real progress to be made in the development of our primary and secondary industries. The Government's proposals should be considered, as they affect the welfare of the people as a whole, and the progress and prosperity of this portion of the Empire. Therefore, I appeal to honourable members to approach the consideration of the bill in no party spirit, but a .new era in Australian induswith a sincere desire to do the best for the nation. relationships.

304,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4.3],"recorded in the select bibliography on industrial conciliation and arbitration published by our worthy Parliamentary Librarian, Mr Kenneth Binns, assisted by Messrs. H . L. White and L. C. Key. In New South Wales, no less than nineteen measures have been placed on the statute-book in connection with arbitration, and another measure which could be regarded as an alteration of that legislation, brings the total number of amendments in that State to 20. I agree with the honourable member who represented Fremantle before the present member for that electorate was returned. He retired from politics a good deal disappointed with our arbitration legislation, because he thought that it savoured too much of law nnd too little of conciliation. Let me draw an analogy from the life ot' the great Bruce of Scotland. It will lie recalled that, having been defeated, and being a fugitive, he saw a spider one windy day. It spun a web and the wind broke it ; but the spider replaced it with be crowded to the roof, granaries full, and another web, and tried to attach it to tbe branch of a tree, and, after repeated failures, it at last succeeded. That stimulack of proper organization, men, women, lated the great Bruce to go forward to success. But his modern namesake, the Prime Minister, has decided to give up the task of trying to perfect our arbitration system, because, on referring the matter to the people by means of a referendum, he has obtained an adverse decision. I do not by any means accuse him of lack of courage; in fact I have sometimes admired him. When he has considered it necessary to "" gag"" honourable members, he has never called upon one of his followers to do the "" dirty work""; he has always done it himself. But I do charge him with a lack of courage in his attitude to the subject of compulsory arbitration. I suggest to honourable members as a whole, that, if the people were asked by referendum to endorse a unanimous wish of this Parliament to provide for the settlement of industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration, their answer would be favorable. What is the history of the referendum ? For an answer we need only go to Switzerland, where Germans, Italians Dr. Maloney. and French live in amity. They continued to dwell together in peace even during the late horrible war, owing to the fact that their laws are just. Party government has characterized the proceedings of this Parliament too much in the past. Our deliberations should have been conducted solely for the benefit of the people as a whole. God never created anything to be His equal, or allowed any created thing to make itself His superior. Therefore, I ask honourable members, and through them the citizens of Australia, why a created thing called Parliament which is elected once every three years, is permitted by its creators to make itself more powerful than the people. I had hoped that the Prime Minister would be able to deal successfully with the problem of unemployment which, next to the horror of war, is the worse curse of civilization. Neither in the nest of the ant, nor in the hive of the bee, do the workers or the young suffer want and privation; but, although warehouses may the growth of foodstuffs abundant, through the course of unemployment and and little children are in need at the present moment in this community. Surely the brain of man, that designed the magnificent steamship that plies the Atlantic night and day at a phenomenal speed and provides its passengers with every comfort, or that planned the mighty bridge that is being constructed across the Sydney Harbour, could devise means of wiping out the curse of unemployment. I have no enmity towards any man. I am not like the old Fijian chief, who Was asked on his deathbed by the minister, who was anxious to save his soul, to forgive his enemies. . The chief declared that he had none, and when the minister asked, "" What did you do with them"", he replied, "" I ate them."" AlthoughI regard no one as an enemy, any person who will willingly do an injury to a man, woman, or child, is my political enemy. The honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) who is honoured by being named after the glorious American orator Garfield, has questioned the courage of honourable members on this side. I question his courage and that of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. If the Government will not incur the cost of taking another referendum on the subject of industrial powers, I issue this challenge to the Prime Minister, that I will resign my seat if he will contest it against me on believe the election would, be the liveliest held in Melbourne since I .was opposed by Sir Malcolm McEacharn. Had the Government tried honestly and earnestly to deal with unemployment every honourable member on this side of the House would have supported it heart and soul. The deplorable conditions existing in Melbourne and suburbs are revealed by an Argus report of a conference of branch representatives of ladies' benevolent societies in the Melbourne Town Hall. I quote this passageA woman, who applied to the acting president of the Melbourne branch, Mrs. W. A. Hall, had spent her last 3d. on a stick of chewing gum from which she had staved off the pangs of hunger for two days. Women with infants in arms coming to her for assistance had fainted on the doorstep from starvation and exhaustion. "" Last £veek I called at the house and found a woman in bed at the point of death from starvation,"" said the secretary of the Hawthorn branch, Mrs. F. L . Baker. "" Only the most generous financial assistance from every available source can prevent the deaths from starvation of many children in the winter we arc now facing."" Mrs. E . D a r e , of Y a r r a v ill e , saidNo Christian seeing things as they are could resist the appeal for assistance. Women come to us to help them to save their sick babies. The Lord Mayor, Councillor Luxton, who presided at the meeting, saidUnemployment is the most serious problem we have to face at present. The position of Lord Mayor would be very pleasant if it were solved satisfactorily. I cannot believe that the Ladies Benevolent Societies will close. The Ministry and the municipalities w ill have to come to their rescue. Much as I condemn the present Government in Victoria for many things, I honour it for not having allowed the Ladies Benevolent Societies to die. I accuse this Government and every supporter of the proposal to abolish the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, of helping to increase unemployment and its attendant miseries. Ministerial members have said that the Arbitration Court has been a failure. It has, in some matters, but only because there has been too much law, compulsion, and expense, and too little conciliation and justice. I recollect that when the tramway employees federated they had to this bill of destruction. I spend more than £15,000 to get an award from the Arbitration Court. If it were possible for me to hate anybody I would hate the profession of lawyers, although there have been glorious exceptions-Si r George Grey, Higinbotham, Kingston. Higgins, Deakin, and Sir Bobert Stout. I believe that history will add the name of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) whose legal knowledge and abilities have been devoted to minimizing industrial disputes. The most valuable factor in the community is a happy home in which the mother knows that her husband has a good billet and that on each Saturday he will bring home sumcient wages to meet the domestic requirements for the week ahead. ""When a strike occurs it is the women who suffer most. Well do I remember the hardships that attended the great maritime strike. The man may leave his home for a few hours, smoke a pipe, and temporarily forget his worries, but they are with the mother always. If the children are without clothes or require their boots mended, if the landlord knocks at the door, if the tradesman's bill is overdue, she has to face those troubles. The Suffering of the women and children is one of the greatest curses of strikes and unemployment. We are doing our best to improve the conditions of the workers, but we are limited by the caprice of lawyers. The word "" Parliament"" is derived from "" parler"" which means to speak. Every honourable member is sent here to voice what he thinks is right and to denounce what he thinks is wrong. The department over which the Attorney General presides may he a department of law, but it is not a department of justice. Adapting a sentence from Dante's In ferno, I suggest that above the portals of the Attorney-General's Department, should be inscribed these words ""To Lawbreakers. Abandon hope all ye who enter here unless ye own great wealth"". Is it not a fact that two men who escaped from the law are millionaires? Is it uot true that a malefactor, who is living abroad to escape the consequences of his crimes could be brought back to Australia if the Government would threaten to confiscate the immense properties he owns in this country? On one occasion the head officers of the Attorneyto reflect on the judiciary. General's Department were permitted to accept £1,000 from a private source. When the Labour party exposed that abomination in this chamber the Prime Minister lost his temper, and I remember my leader saying that if Labour had been in power those officers might have been suspended or even dismissed. Throughout the history of the judiciary, from the days of Judge Jeffreys, I doubt if a greater infamy has been committed than the increase of hours and decrease of wages awarded by the president of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. For many decades noble men belonging to the Liberal and Conservative parties in Great Britain-I Lord Shaftesbury-have improve the wages and living conditions of the workers. Reform progressed steadily until now, when a judge has increased hours and decreased pay by a legal direction. That infamy may well be the epitaph of the man responsible for it. I well remember the sense of triumph I enjoyed when I was able to insert into the bill introduced by Sir Thomas Bent for the construction of a tramway from St. Kilda to Brighton, a clause providing for a working week of six days of eight hours each, and a wage of 7s. a day. At that time the value of money was greater than it is to-day and the proposal was considered almost revolutionary. after I entered the Pederal Parliament, the Conservatives eliminated that provision from the act. I remember the Mayor of Brighton stating in evidence before the Railways Committee that the provision in the act relating to the working hours and wages was responsible for the financial failure of the line. Lord Leverhulme, one of the greatest organizers of labour that the British people have produced, and a multi-millionaire, was humane enough to reduce the hours of his male employees to 48 and female employees to 44, and in his book, The SixHours Hay, he advocates a working week of 36 hours. Yet Judge Lukin says that the working week should be increased to Dr. Maloney. 48 hours! Will any honourable member say that he knows as much of industry as Lord Leverhulme? ley) I ask the honourable member not paring a man of purely legal training with a great captain of industry who has built up an organization second only to that controlled by Henry Ford. While Lord Leverhulme is advocating a working week of 36 hours a member of the Australian Judiciary is trying to increase the present working week to 48 hours. Would any man who was well acquainted with the organization of labour do such a thing? Is it not a fact that that mighty man, Henry Ford, is advocating a fiveday week? Yet, in this beloved Australia, that we used to say was in the have in mind particularly vanguard of the world's progress, we are endeavoured to going backwards. That judgment will stand to the discredit of this Government and of the men, whatever positiou they may occupy, who carry it into effect. I do not believe that the Prime Minister, in the light of the experience he nas had with the firm of which he is a distinguished member, would have felt inclined to take this action had it not been for the prompting of the Attorney-General. Over the entrance to the law courts there should be the inscription, "" Abandon hope all ye who enter here, unless you own great wealth."" Let us see what wealth has done for the Attorney-General in his constituency. Some time ago a list Indeed, was published by Smith's Weekly showing the amounts made available out of the funds of the National Union to various constituencies. It shows that the sum of £2,300 was paid to a Mr Russell, the secretary of the campaign committee in the Kooyong electorate. Smith's Weekly has never been prosecuted for libel on account of the publication of these figures. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Attorney-General dare prosecute them. I challenge them to do so. I have been responsible for the reprinting of this list and its circulation in my electorate. If these members do not care to prosecute Smith's Weekly, they can prosecute me. We know that the men who have received these sums dare not take that action,",151,Number Of Persons Employed

306,Dr. Maloney,"I am merely combecause in the witness-box they would not commit perjury by denying their correctness. These monies are subscribed by the hidden hand which is controlling this Government, and has made it bring forward this measure. Every National candidate in Victoria had an amount ranging up to £3,500 spent in his electorate. extended to include the sums made available in New South Wales and Queensland? The reason is that no officer betrayed the secret. This bill is an abomination. When a similar measure was introduced on a former occasion, I quoted from a work written by Henry Demarest Lloyd, and edited by John A. Hobson, entitled A Sovereign People. It is so splendidly written that I shall make a further quotation from it. At page 155 we have the statementThe employers and employed in each group of trades elect their representatives, fifteen for each side, to form a conseil. The numbers choose by ballot a committee consisting of a president, vice-president, secretary, and vice-secretary, the presidency and the other offices being held alternately by an employer and a workman, with the further proviso that, when the president or the secretary is an employer, the vice-officer must be a workman, and vice versa. The work of the conseil is divided as follows. First comes the conciliation hoard, consisting of an employer and a workman, who preside by turns. This board has summary powers of decision in cases involving sums not exceeding twenty francs. In case of disagreement between the members, or where sufficient evidence for a summary judgment is lacking, the case is referred to the second board, the tribunal. The Tribunal de Prud'hommes consists of a president, three employers, and three workmen, hears evidence and, where necessary, summons experts and gives final decisions in cases not involving more than 500 francs. Cases involving larger sums are carried to the third court, a chamber of appeal, which consists of a president, five employers, five workers, and a secretary (without a vote). Finally, certain cases where competence of jurisdiction is disputed are referred for decision to a mixed court composed of two judges of the court of justice (nominated by this court) and three prud'hommes chosen from among themselves by the chamber of appeal. That is the only place to which legal men are admitted. There are two judges, but they are out-voted by the three members of the Court of Wise Men. The passage continuesThe proceedings of the tribunal and the chamber of appeal are public, and careful rules are provided to secure that no member of a court shall have any interest direct or indirect that is prejudicial to the impartiality of his judgment in the case he is called upon Why has this list not been to try. The conseils have also other functions of a more general order. They are summoned by the cantonal government to deliberate upon questions affecting industry and commerce. A special committee of prud'hommes determines questions regarding the execution of contracts, and constitutes a sanitary authority regarding the conditions of trades. Finally, a central committee, consisting of two elected delegates, forms a reporting and mediating committee between the Conseils de Prud'hommes and the Council of State and governmental departments, and is also entrusted with general powers of investigation into industrial conditions, hygienic, technical, and educational. Such is the system in force in Geneva and Vaud. Two other cantons, Neufchatel and Solothurm, which had adopted the same method, exchanged it later on for what is commonly known as the method of arbitration courts. The distinctive feature of this method is the appointment of the president of the Industrial Court from outside the trade the disputes of which he has to arbitrate, thus securing a presiding officer of guaranteed impartiality and usually of higher experience and general competency. With the exception of the Court of Conciliation, all these courts are open to the public. The Court of Conciliation comprises one employer and one employee, who endeavour to maintain peace between the workmen and the owners. Judgment is given publicly,. either orally or in writing, and is enforceable by the ordinary processes of law. A further passage readsTen courts of arbitration deal with disputes in these groups of trades:1. Textiles. 2. Earth and building works. 3. Woodwork. 4. Metals. 5. Foodstuffs and liquors. 0. Clothing trades. 7. Paper-making and polygraphic industry. 8. Chemicals. 9. Transport. 10. Retail trade and other callings (banks, insurance, employments connected with literature, art and science).

I quote the following from Survey of Industrial Relations, 1926, page 388:In France, bodies known as Conseils de Prud'hommes, organized in groups of trades and composed of employers and workpeople in equal numbers, have existed since 1806 for the settlement of disputes affecting individual workers. The first law for the settlement of collective disputes was the Voluntary Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 27th December, 1892. This act is still in operation, and it forms part of Hook IV of the Labour code, having been incorporated in the code as recently as June, 1923. Under this law, either party to a dispute, or both parties conjointly, may apply to the local magistrate (judge de paix) for the appointment of a conciliation committee; but the magistrate may himself take the initiative in the case of a strike or lockout. If the conciliation committee f a i l to agree, an arbitration court may be set up at the request of either of the parties, each side naming one or more up to five arbitrators. The magistrate must give an answer within 24 hours. Claims before the Federal Arbitration Court have been delayed for years before they could be heard. That is because too little use is made of conciliation in this country. In. Dr. Maloney. Cases with Amonnt Complaints. In Dispute. Settled. Number Unsettled. Workers.

The employer's sentence in the case of a lockout is a fine of from 10,000 to 100,000 liras and imprisonment for six months to one year. Fancy sending John Brown to prison in Australia! Why, the inhabitants of the tabernacles i of wealth would shriek with horror at the idea. When the workers of Italy go on strike the fine is from 100 to 1,000 liras and the punishment is from one month to six months' imprisonment. It is a pity that this Government does not follow the splendid example set by Mussolini. Since his dictatorship Italy has progressed by leaps and bounds. According to the writer of the Survey of In dustrial Relations, conciliation and arbitration in Switzerland has a history dating back to 1S82, when the Government of the Canton of Geneva established industrial courts on the model of the French Conseils de 'Prud'hommes. Other Cantons followed this example. The whole question of conciliation and arbitration. was dealt with by federal enactment in sections 30-35 of the Federal Factory Act of 18th June, 1914, which read30. For the amicable settlement of collective court decided that the employer should disputes between factory-owners and work pay 36 francs, and, for the two letters of people and also in regard to the interpretation the court, 60 centimes. That is equivaand execution of collective agreements, the Cantons shall establish permanent conciliation lent to 6d.

LawGazette would have been quite sufficient rence Gronlund, in his book, The Co-opnotice. The remaining section read:32. Should a dispute extend beyond the limits of the Canton, the Federal Council shall nominate the Conciliation Board. The Federal Council shall also be entitled to appoint a Cantonal Board to arbitrate. 33. Should a number of factory-owners and tlieir work people, belonging to the same industry, unanimously appoint a conciliation board"", the latter shall, as far as they are concerned, replace the public board. 34. The parties shall have the right in every case to empower the Conciliation Board to settle their difference by means of an arbitral award. Should the board have been established by mutual consent, the parties may extend such power to all their differences. 35. The Canton shall have the right to confer more extensive powers on their Conciliation Board than those provided for in the present act. These clauses were implemented by federal resolution of 1st February, 1918, concerning the establishment of conciliation offices. The date 1st A p r i l, 1918, was then fixed as that on which the clauses in question should come into operation. I'raxis for 4th September, 1924, that Conciliation Offices have been set up in all except 4 of the Cantons.

B e for e these courts, cases were conducted with perfect courtesy. One case concerned an employee who was dismissed, and the that nowhere in England could justice be laws. The great Gladstone said that a law to be willingly obeyed should be just ancl merciful, that it should be easier for Any to break it. I agree with the principle too much law. Too many lawyers take part in arbitration. In France, Italy, Unions had to despatch of the court's wise men. The conciliaerative Commonwealth lays down this codeI f a lawyer wins a case by superior vigilance he has done just what his duty requires of him even if he knows he is on the wrong side. A lawyer must steer around, must dodge the law against him. A lawyer should see to it , if he may not surprise his adversary, or even the judge, into some action which w i ll render a new tria l probable to the verdict against him; for instance .make the judge overrule an objection by stating a flimsy ground, while he conceals the true one. Indeed, our shining lights of the bar do daily acts of a comprehensive rule, that thoy may do anything to gain a victory except suborning witnesses and forging precedents. This is what Lawrence Gronlund -writes about judge-made laws:-'One more instance is too interesting to omit. Do you know why Christianity is a part of the common law of our country? Because an English judge, Lord Mansfield, mistranslating two words of a dictum of somebody in the 15th century called aneien scripture (NormanI t was reported in Soziale French meaning: ancient writing) ""holy scripture""! !! That leads me to the following statement shal l now d r a w the a t t e n t i o n of of this great writer:Just as little Switzerland w i ll furnish us a model of really popular democratic administhat little Denmark wil l furnish us a model ot' popular administration of justice in her so-called "" Courts of Conciliation"", which have been in existence in that country since 1823, and, during that period, have given immense satisfaction, so much so, indeed, that similar courts have, to a certain extent, been, adopted by other countries in Europe. The distinguishing feature of those courts is that no lawyers are allowed there. All suits, whatsoever, without regard to the amounts involved, must, in tlie first place, be brought before the courts. The judge takes down the oral complaint of the plaintiff, and the oral defence of the defendant, and renders judgment accordingly. If , however, either of the parties is dissatisfied with the judgment, the judge refers the case to the regular courts, in which case, however, no other evidence is allowed 10 be introduced but that which was laid beforo the judge sitting in the Court of Conciliation. When the late Mr Justice Higgins was examining the law pertaining to Victoria, I introduced to him a worthy citizen of Denmark who wished to give evidence before the commission. It was explained to me that, in Denmark, the magistratethe Pacificator-woul d be sworn to make peace between citizen and citizen, but if the parties failed to agree he would appoint a day to hear the case and give his decision in writing. No lawyers were admitted. The magistrate would hear the case, and give his decision together with reasons. In the event of the magistrate's decision being unacceptable to either of the parties, the case would be heard in a higher court, at which both parties could be represented by lawyers. The lawyers, however, could not introduce fresh evidence, and had to argue the. case on the written decision of the .magistrate. now wish to quote the following extract from Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration, by Douglas Knoop, vide page 119With regard to the work done by councils, it is worth noticing that the great majority of the disputes dealt with are directly concerned with wages, e.g., questions concerning the exact amount agreed upon, the time and mode of payment, the amount of fines, hours of labour, absence from work, defective workmanship, apprenticeship, valuation of piece-work, and delay in completing task work. The most striking feature about the councils is the preponderance of conciliation. average annual number of cases dealt with during the "" eighties"" slightly exceeded 40,000 Compare that number with the figures In every instance the Senate was the quoted by the honourable member for Wide stumbling block. Since the publication of and of these two-thirds were settled by conof the lower House have been carried into ciliation or withdrawal. At the present time effect, notwithstanding the attitude of the Dr. Maloney. more than 50,000 cases come before the Committees of Conciliation. Some 60 per cent, of the cases are settled by the committees, or withdrawn, and only in about 15 per cent, is final judgment passed. On several occasions the Chamber of Deputies have passed bills to alter the existing law with regard to Councils of Prud'hommes, but in each instance the Senate has rejected them. .The second chambers are always opposed to humane legislation. In this instance the Government proposes to hand over the control of hundreds of thousands of working men who have wives and children dependent upon them, to the Legislative Councils in the States, which will have the power to veto any arbitration legislation passed by the lower chambers. The second chambers in Australia have always been noted for this infamous conduct. When a member of the Victorian Legislative AssemblyI had the honour of introducing two private bills, whicli had been drafted for the protection of women, and which were passed by that chamber the same evening; but the infamous Legislative Council refused to pass one. The government of the day had supported them. One could not be considered by the Legislative Council until the following year, when, however, it became law. The late Sir George Turner, who was then Premier, congratulated me upon the success I had achieved, and I am sure that he regretted the attitude adopted by the Legislative Council. I have always been strongly opposed to second chambers. I The quotation from Knoop's Industrial' Conciliation and Arbitration continue*)The chief changes proposed are: that experts should be elected for commerce, agriculture and mining, that the minimum age of electors should be reduced to 21, and that of members to 25, that foremen and chiefs of workshops should be counted as employers, that employers and workmen should remain electors and eligible for membership on the councils for ten years after retirement, that the franchise should be extended to women over 21 and that judgment should be final when the amount involved does not exceed The 2,000 francs. The only suggestions which the Senate countenances are the extension of the jurisdiction of the councils to mining, and the raising of the limit under which judgment is to be final from 200 to 300 francs. this volume in 1905, all the suggestions",154,Number Of Persons Employed

With a fewexceptions, Legislative Councils consist of members representing only one class, namely, land-holders and anyone who is not directly or indirectly a land-holder, is not eligible for membership. Honourable members opposite supporting this bill are placing the interests of 900,000 workmen and their dependants under the control of the Legislative Councils in the various States. ley) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. This measure is divided into two parts in one of which provision is made for the removal of a certain legislative structure, and in the other, for a new edifice. When a substantial structure is to be erected it is necessary tp remove the old building and to ensure that the foundations arc secure. In this measure, provision is made for the demolition of the old edifice by the repeal of fifteen acts and the amendments of fourteen others. I hold a somewhat unique position in this chamber in that, prior to my election in 1922, I made the abolition of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court a main plank in my platform. That was the attitude I adopted towards arbitration in 1925, and again in 1928, and 1 was delighted when I was informed that it was the intention of the Government to abolish the Federal Arbitration Court. The policy I have advocated for years has on three different occasions been endorsed by my electors. I told my constituents that our arbitration ship was leaking so badly that although it would put to sea, it would undoubtedly meet with heavy weather and have to be docked or perhaps scrapped. I was willing that the vessel should be patched, but I was afraid that it was in such a condition that it would be unable to weather the storms it was sure to encounter. the trouble is with the crew. I have advocated the total abolition of the Arbitration Court for seven years, it cannot be said that I have not received a mandate from the electors. The platform of the Country party does not go quite so far, and paragraph 4 (k) provides that conflict in industry should be avoided by making general arbitration awards in relation to interstate shipping and the pastoral industry. Under this measure, the Commonwealth will retain control over the maritime industry. AlthoughI have always been aware that many major difficulties were likely to arise under the policy I advocated, it was not until the Transport Workers Bill was under consideration that I learned that the Commonwealth had authority to deal with the maritime industry under its trade and commerce powers, instead of under its conciliation and arbitration powers which are being exercised at present. I commend the Government for now introducing a policy which I first advocated in 1922. Is it not illogical to reason that, because an important matter was, or was not, mentioned in a policy speech, the Government is forbidden to place legislation dealing with the subject on the statute-book? Whether the Prime Minister has or has not a mandate does not make the least difference to the introduction of such a measure.as this. I claim that it is unnecessary to have a mandate. The right honourable member for North. Sydney( Mr Hughes) proposes to move an amendment providing that the people shall be consulted by way of referendum before the measure becomes law. We have had many referendums, and I have still to learn that a government is forced to go to the people when it wishes to repeal an act. That is introducing a new theory into onr Australian policies. Honourable members have been elected by the people to represent certain views. [Quorum formed.] It is their duty faithfully to maintain those views. We have to make our own decisions. If certain legislation is a brake on the progress of the nation we should be recreant in our duty if we failed to repeal it . I still desire to know how, and when, the theory was originated that it is necessary to go to the people before repealing an act. Many acts have been repealed and the fact that this measure now affects fifteen other acts makes no difference. There is no need to conduct a referendum on the matter.

AsThis afternoon I asked a pertinent question of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) when he was pointing out that the Federal Arbitration Court had done much for the wage earners of Australia. I asked why, if it has been of such benefit to our wage earners, employees have assisted to repudiate its awards. I received no answer. MrA . GKEEN -Oh, yes, the honourable member did. no answer. Honourable members opposite deliberately shirk the issue. matter was brought to a head by a strike in the timber industry. enough, although we knew that there were exceptionally militant associations, such as the waterside workers organization and the coal-miners organizations-the latter being responsible, in 1927, for 59 per cent, of the strikes in New South Waleswe believed that the timber workers union was of a very mild disposition. That leads me to put forward this aspect of the case. For a number of years, certain privileges were granted to various unions, but the first time that the court failed to grant the request of a union-in this case the hitherto docile timber workers union -that organization went on strike. In other words, the court created a militant union and a strike by refusing to grant what was sought from it . Is' it seriously claimed that the court can continue to be of benefit to Australia? I contend that that union, by going on strike when its claims were refused,' effectively killed the federal system of arbitration. cipal cause of the Federal Government conimnity,"" because the court, as the comwithdrawing from the field of arbitration. munity's representative, is the duly appointed a contributory factor.

The Labour party is not united in its opposition to the bill, as I shall show by a quotation from an article which appeared in the Pan-Pacific Worker of the 2nd April, 1928, by Senator Arthur Rae, who was elected as a Labour representative at the last election. Honourable members opposite may snort derisively, but Senator Eae is a fuily accredited Labour man. His article was headed "" The curse of compulsory arbitration "" and it contained the following paragraph:It is impossible to estimate the moral harm which has been done to the Australian working class by its hasty and ill-considered acceptance of arbitration as a solution of labour's problems. On the loth May, 1928, the Australasian Council of Trade Unions passed a resolution in which it expressed its "" f u l l satisfaction"" with the character of the issue of the Pan-Pacific Worker in which' the article by Senator Eae appeared. Here again the Labour party is found to be speaking with two voices. Which voice are we to believe? We have heard a good deal about the mandate which the Government received at tbe last election. I contend that at least some honourable members of the Labour party received a mandate from the people to support this bill. Among these are the Leader of the Opposition of Commonwealth arbitration ( Mr Scullin), the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). These honourable members advocated an affirmative vote on the referendum proposal, but the negative vote on the subject in their electorates showed a majority, in each case, of more than 20,000. Consequently, I cannot see from where the kick of the Opposition is coming. The people refused to give additional industrial power to the Commonwealth in 1926, and it would be useless for us to take another referendum on the",164,Number Of Persons Employed

I have a definite mandate to support this bill, for my electors returned me on a platform which provided for the abolition of the court. As a matter of fact, the Government is seeking to do exactly what the people directed it to do, namely, evacuate the field of industrial arbitration. The High Court has indicated clearly that the awards of the court cannot be enforced. This ought to be a sufficient justification for the action of tbe Government. I sincerely trust that we shall make it possible for the States to manage their own industrial affairs. This will lead to the workers of Australia being paid all that they can earn. If a man can earn £15 or £20 a week he should be paid it. Sitting (Friday.) I protest against the procedure adopted by the Government in endeavouring to force the bill through this House. We have been sitting continuously for two days and a night, although by no stretch of imagination can the measure be regarded as urgent. No evidence has been adduced in support of the claim for urgency advanced by the Government. The bill is designed to repeal some fifteen statutes and to amend almost as many more. It has never been submitted to the people. The Government had given no indication whatever of its intention to introduce the measure until it was mentioned in the press, following the conference of Federal and State Ministers. At the last election, not the slightest hint was dropped that such legislation was contemplated. No member of this House, and nobody outside it, thought that such a bill would be considered during the life of the present Parliament. On the contrary, there was a statement in the policy speech of the Government that it would support the present arbitration system. As indicated by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), no legislation of that description was suggested by the Government after the election. When Parliament went into recess prior to Easter, no member, apart from the Ministry, at any rate, thought that before we met again such a bill would be brought before us. of the Cabinet. the rank and file of the Ministerial party, who, we are assured, are not caucusridden, but free to express their individual opinions. The Government's consultation with the rank and file of its loyal supporters, who follow it so slavishly, consisted in sending them telegrams-urgen t telegrams, I believeinforming them that it had decided to do this thing. In the words of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), the announcement came to him, as it must have come to the other members of the party, as a bolt from the blue. Then, a further consultation, if I may describe it suspended from 6.IS to S p.m. by that term, occurred in the party rooms. The Ministerialists were told what the Government intended to do. The Prime Minister brought the measure forward, and he now seriously appeals to the House to discuss it in a non-party spirit! After sitting for many hours continuously, honourable members are still discussing it, although it has never been submitted to the people, and not a scintilla of evidence has been produced in justification of the claim that it is urgent. The conditions in the industrial arena .are the same now as they were twelve months ago, except that in the last year the Government has continued to blunder in that sphere, as it has done for the last four or five years. The whole history of the legislation and administration of this Government in industrial matters has been one of bungling. I rather think that a recapitulation of its record in that respect would not be relished by honourable members opposite. The Government said it did not believe in agitators and other undesirable persons, and it brought forward a deportation bill to enable it to send two men out of the country. These persons were seized and placed on Garden Island; but eventually the Government had to compensate them for wrongful arrest. Then it declared, "" We are going",165,Number Of Persons Employed

Consider the position of the wheat-growing industry throughout Australia; I refer particularly to South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. The growers in my own constituency and in northern Victoria have never been in a ""worse predicament than that in which they now fhid themselves. Last year the Victorian Parliament was compelled to pass a Postponement of Payments Act in order to relieve the settlers who were in financial difficulties on account of the drought. The position i u that State to-day is worse than it was last year, owing to the continuance of the drought. That may be said also of South Australia, where the wheat-growers, with the exception of those in the southern and more favoured parts, are in a desperate position, and a moratorium or some other form of relief alone will save hundreds from being driven off the land. The New South Wales Cabinet is considering a proposal for the consolidation of the settlers' debts in order to prevent many in the western parts of their State from being forced to abandon their holdings. We may be told that these things are due to seasonal conditions, and not to legislation. But seasonal conditions are an integral part of the economic problem of primary production. In any case, the distress does not obtain only in the drought-stricken areas. settlers and others engaged in the canned fruits industry are in difficulties, and the report of the Development and Migration Commission shows that those people are confronted . with a hopeless economic prospect. dustry is worse. in a position to speak with authority upon that industry. fruits industry also is in difficulties. The dairying industry, owing to legislation and organization, is, for the The wool industry is faced with declining profits and a stationary or increasing cost of production. This is a serious national problem, having regard to the fact that the exports of wool, wheat, meat, wealth solvent. No means can be devised by this or any other Government that will solve the problem of keeping the national finances in a sound state unless we export about £30,000,000 worth of goods more than we import in order to pay our indebtedness overseas. So in considering the economic problems of the country the first and vital factor is the position of the primary industries. Last week several members of the Victorian Parliament journeyed into the new Mallee district to study the conditions of the settlers. Many of them were representatives of city constituencies, and had no practical knowledge of the conditions of the man on the land. I quote this letter, which was published in the Argus above the signature of ten representatives of different parties in the Victorian legislatureSir,-As the result of a special invitation we have visited the new Malleei n the electorate of Mr Allnutt, M.L.A., during the last live days, and gained an intimate insight into the conditions prevailing in that area. While realizing that the weather, especially the terrible duststorms, was exceptional even in this part of the State, we feel that the circumstances thoroughly warrant the request that we are making in this letter. The new Mallee is now experiencing its third successive year of drought. Many settlers and their families are living in bag humpies, and others in tin huts under conditions which would be considered serious in other parts of the State, but are appalling in the Mallee. The soldier Four children in one family in a two-roomed shack had to be taken away to hospital in the midst of the great duststorin on Saturday. Despite hard work in clearing tlie land and sowing crops the rain has failed the settlers. Still battling cheerfully against adversity, they are continuing bravely with their task, but they have been unable in most cases to do anything to improve the living conditions' of their families. For the last two years the majority of the women and children have been living on Government sustenance. They have not been able to leave their Mallee huts even for a night.

All the rain in the world could not save this year's crops. The writers concluded by appealing for funds to get the women and children out of that area for a few weeks in order that they might recuperate. The drab picture they painted is unfortunately only too true, and I draw to it the attention of members of the Opposition, who battle so loyally-rightl y so-to improve the conditions of those whom they represent. The wage-earners in the secondary industries are not the worse remunerated. Much lip loyalty is paid to the pioneers, but their reward is to work long hours under the worse conditions for a less return than is paid to those engaged in any other industry. And the people who approaching starvation read in the newspapers this sort of thingSydney, Thursday. Tbe Lustre Hosiery Company was fined £3 by the Chief Industrial Magistrate for having one industry. neglected to provide Mary Nolan, an employee, with morning tea. I have no objection to the workers having morning tea, but the circumstances indicated by that paragraph are in striking contrast to those of the primary producers. The colossal losses in connection, with soldier settlement are due, not alone to Government bungling, but also to the fact that men were directed into an industry in which the conditions are worse than in any other. As a farmer, I have often thought how strange it is that when the Government wants to settle migrants or soldiers it places them on the land. Why does it not create factories and find employment for them there? Always it puts them on the land, as tens of thousands of soldiers who fought and suffered for this country have been settled. The reward of their sacrifice is a raw block of scrub. I met a neighbour on a sandhill one clay who, after three or four years of drought, had nothing to show for his hard, work ancl privations but Soldier Settlement Board stating that his indebtedness far exceeded the value of his block. Looking about him he said, "" Sometimes I wonder who won the war:"" men been put into other industries? Department did not put as many men into secondary industries as were placed on the land. member making out a wonderfully good case for the repeal of the Arbitration Act? vernment's reasons for proposing that step? The Attorney-General stated the most important when he said that the purpose of the bill was to abolish dual control'of industry, from which nearly all our industrial evils result. How can he say that the abolition of the Arbitration Court will abolish dual control? The inference from his statement is that there will be only one controlling body in industry. That may be true of an industry are slaving under conditions peculiar to one State, but it is absurd to say that there will be only one control of industry throughout ' Australia. There will be six different bodies, and sometimes they will be attempting to control the able member claims is, that whereas there are now seven controlling authorities, if this bill is passed there will be only six. But the Attorney-General says there will be only one. been produced in support of that extraordinary statement. The champ'ions of the bill say that the abolition of the Federal Court will benefit the producers, the workers, and the manufacturers, and will reduce the cost of production. But how ? What will be reduced ? pensive overhead. ever it may mean, is surely not sufficiently great to permit of a substantial reduction of the cost of living and production throughout Australia. The Government states that wages will not be reduced, a letter from the and that there will be no chaos in industry, because regulation by a State authority will continue.

If the Government had said that all sections of the community must make sacrifices, and had brought forward a proposal for a general tariff reduction, the workers would have been less suspicious than they are; but with the record that the Government has in regard to industrial matters, what else can it expect, when it does not propose to touch even one stone in the temple of the tariff, but on the contrary intends to add one or two more, and in addition to wipe away the particular tribunal which safeguards the workers of this country? There is not one gentleman on the front Government bench who knows anything about industrial matters. through the hard school of experience in which I and other honourable members were trained. They do not understand the psychology of the workers of this country. They overlook the fact that the sweeping away of this structure will not have the effect of destroying the federal character of the unions. The tendency throughout industry is to merge into larger bodies. The federal character of the labour unions has been developed and strengthened within recent years, and that development will continue in the years to come. If this measure becomes law, chaotic conditions will result from State tribunals endeavouring individually to regulate federal industries in opposition to federal industrial organizations. There will be-six different authorities. General says that there will be only one, but now one of his supporters admits that there will be six. The primary producers, as well as the Labour organizations, believe in industry being federally controlled. member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) also holds that belief. He has upon the notice paper the following motion:That in the opinion of this House steps should be taken to induce the States to-agree to an amendment of the Constitution, which would permit of an Australian organization, with complete sectional control of internal and will not give them a reasonable return external marketing of each rural product by the producers of such commodity. It is not often that the honprable member and I are in agreement, but we agree in this matter, and I propose to support that motion. The wheat-growers of Australia are to-day clamouring for a federal organization. What is the objection that is raised by those who oppose the organization of the wheat-growing industry? It is that a compulsory pool in one State will be ineffective because of competition from other States. That is what the Labour unions say. In the dried fruits industry there is now before the courts a case concerning the seizure of fruit under the authority of certain State acts. The basis of the recommendation made by the Development and Migration Commission in regard to that industry was that there should be federal control and amalgamation of packing sheds. That commission They have not been inquired also into the canned fruits industry, and the basis of its recommendation was that it should be organized on a federal basis, and that there should be an amalgamation of the canning factories at Shepparton, Kyabram, Mooroopna, and Leeton. Wherever one turns, one finds that State control of primary industries is ineffective, and that almost to a man the primary producers are federalists. Let it not be thought for one moment that I am in favour of the maintenance of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as it exists at present. In the past I have .criticized that court and the tariff policy of the Government. The real issue before this House is, not the existence of the court in its present form, but Federal versus State control of industry. When a choice has to be made between State and Federal control, I unhesitatingly choose the latter. The regulation of industry is admittedly a difficult problem, which is puzzling the best brains in. the civilized world to-day. Human nature being what it is, it is difficult to say whether any really satisfactory solution My friend, the honourable of the problem is possible under our present social system. While we have production for profit, it seems to me that we must have difficulties. In the last analysis we cannot compel a body of men to sell their labour, which is the only article they have to sell, at a rate that and ensure decent living conditions for those who are dependent upon them. On the other hand, can we rightly compel a man to keep his business open if it does not pay him to do so? It appears to me",169,Number Of Persons Employed

412,Mr Stewart,"The Attorneythat our best course would be to have conciliation rather than arbitration legislation, and to provide machinery whereby both sides could endeavour to settle their problems in an amicable, peaceful way. I would give to any Government the necessary powers to maintain law and order, so that in the event of any serious conflict it could take steps to protect the interests of the community. It is wrong to wrangle and abuse each other, because we cannot make things perfect. We can only do our best. My sympathies have always been with the workmen of this country. I am and always have been one of them. I represent a primary producing constituency, if anything a conservative, not a radical, constituency. I believe in organization, and have been in the thick of every fight to organize the primary producers. I came into this House as a representative of organized farmers, who considered that they were not getting fair treatment from either of the two big parties. I still think that no political party will look after the interests of the farmers so well as one of their own making. I advised the farmers to send their own men to Parliament to safeguard their interests, to support measures rather than men, and not to identify themselves with any other party. Some honourable members who sit on the Government side of the House were elected on that policy. It is still my policy, Some £170,000 or £180,000 of the but it has ceased to be theirs. There are some farmers who say, "" If you can only keep the dreadful Labour party off the Government benches, peace and prosperity will reign."" I can honestly say that whenever the primary producers have organized with the object of shaking the middlemen off their backs or of improving their conditions economically, it has been not the workers, but those who represent the big business interests in this country, who have opposed them. We have said that, if there is to be pricefixation in respect of what we use in production, if others are to fix prices for us, we will fix the price of wheat. We therefore set out to organize the wheat pool. Who fought us? Not the Labour unions, but those who believe in maintaining the usual trade channels. if the honourable member mentioned "" running sores "" and "" f angless snakes "" the word "" arbitration "" now and again. and similar nauseous expressions I leave an important aspect of arbitration. The economic aspect is very pertinent to the issue before the House. Eor years past the representatives of the manure companies have sat round a table and fixed the price of manure. The farmers decided to form their own co-operative manure company, and they set out to do it. Who fought them? Not workers' unions or the trades hall; but the manure combine. The chairman of the Phosphate Co-operative Company, the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) is not in the chamber. I pay him a tribute for the good work that he has done as the. chairman of that company; but he could tell those on the Government side a rather embarrassing story of the efforts of vested interests to prevent the co-operative company from starting in Victoria. When that company was established the price of superphosphate was immediately reduced by over £1 a ton. To-day the manure interests have amalgamated, and it will now be a fight to the death between the organization of capital and the farmers' co-operative company. We have always had to fight when we have set out to emancipate ourselves economically. I give, still another illustration; as we failed to receive a fair deal from the press, we started a paper of our own. farmers' hard-earned money was used in establishing the Morning Post in Melbourne. We said, "" This will be our organ, and in it we shall give expression to our opinions."" The other day I received a letter from a liquidator returning me 3s. or 4s. for £1 shares. Who boycotted and eventually killed that newspaper? Not the workers' unions or the trades hall, but the Nationalist organizations in combination.

I hope that this measure will not be passed; but, if it is, I hope that the House will agree to the amendment which the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) proposes to move in committee. The people should be consulted. The Government has no mandate for the abolition of the federa? arbitration system. It is rather extraordinary that a government that is usually so strong on mandates should do a thing like this without a mandate. How often has the Government in the past endeavoured to justify its actions by declaring that it has a mandate. The very fact that it had a mandate seemed to justify it in expecting the Opposition to raise no objection to any legislation that had been mentioned by Nationalists on the hustings. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that the Government's action in withdrawing the prosecution against John Brown would lose the Nationalist party tens of thousands of votes. The passage of this measure will have the same effect. Government members proudly proclaim the fact that they receive the vote of a large section of the workers of this country. That is true. They would not be on the treasury bench to-day had they not, during the last election, received the votes of thousands of organized workers, who not only voted for them, but also worked for the Nationalist cause. What will those men, and women, too, say when they find that their representatives in this chamber are assisting to pass legislation the operation of which will affect them adversely? The people of this country never for one moment dreamt that the Government, which claimed their support under the plea of the maintenance of law and order, would set about abolishing the federal arbitration system, thus dealing a deadly blow to the organizations to which they belong and to the industries from which their bread and butter is won. I suggest that the Government would be well advised, before passing this far-reaching legislation, to consult the people of Australia. have listened with great patience to a long debate, in tbe course of which the leaders of both sides fully supported by the rank and file of their parties have presented their views to this House. It is my lot to follow the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart). That honourable member and myself represent adjoining constituencies. For the most part he, like myself, is returned by the aid of the farming community. He takes his stand on this measure alongside the Labour Opposition. I take my stand alongside the Government, because I consider that this measure is a justification of the action that I took, together with the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), three years ago when it was almost political heresy to talk of the abolition of the central compulsory arbitration system. The honourable member for Swan and myself, during a sitting in Melbourne, fought a strenuous and prolonged fight against the combined parties in this House, and we succeeded finally in defeating the proposals in the country. I may say that my constituency was the only one in Victoria that recorded a majority vote for the proposals advocated by its representative in Parliament. I have listened conscientiously to this debate, endeavouring to find the main points of difference. I find that the compass has been boxed in the course of the debate. What members of the Labour party can explain away the vote cast at the referendum to grant full industrial powers to the Commonwealth when down they went like skittles in front of their constituents? The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) had at the former election a majority of over 20,000, yet at the referendum he had a deficit of 10,000, which made him 30,000 votes to the bad. The Prime Minister had a similar unfortunate experience. But the honourable member for Swan and myself were at least supported in our constituencies, for* the votes we cast and the views we expressed on that occasion. I have been a keen observer of the effect of the central compulsory system of arbitration on the economic and public life of Australia.

We have had 25 years experience of federal arbitration, yet, to-day, tbe financial and economic position of Australia is deplorable. Honourable members opposite talk of the high social standard of the people. Who enjoys it? It is not the tens of thousands of returned men, especially those on the land. We have more unemployment in our midst thanever before in the history of Australia. The men who are workless cannot enjoy our high social standard. There is no clear money in industry now. The man on the land to-day is confronted with heavy production costs but little clear money. The man in business has little clear money to-day. The wage-earners are receiving high wages but they have no clear money. The purchasing power of money is not what it used to be. Our boys and girls who are reaching maturity have little opportunity to launch out on careers. Never before has it been so difficult to obtain employment. We are to-day suffering a severe depression, notwithstanding the past run of good seasons that we have had ancl the enormous sums that we have borrowed. To-day the economic and industrial life of this country has reached its worse stage. During the last fourteen years Australia has borrowed and expended £800,000,000. Fourteen years ago the Commonwealth had no public debt, but the State debts amounted to £320,000,000, borrowed over the whole period of responsible government, ancl the average rate of interest on them was £3 32s. 6d. To-day the aggregate public debt of the Commonwealth and the States is £1,115,000,000, on which interest at an average rate of 5 per cent, is being paid, the annual interest bill being £55,000,000, or an amount greater than the value of our annual wool clip. In 1924 our pension bill was £3,200,000, but to-day it is in the region of £19,000,000. Wool prices are approximately 33 per cent, lower than they were last year; the wheat harvest promises to be poor, and in the district represented by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) the outlook is anything but promising; indeed, there is no certainty of a good harvest in any portion of the agricultural belt in Australia. In these circumstances, the time has arrived for the Government to examine, completely and fearlessly, our financial and economic position. While we are here debating the manner in which industrial disputes should be settled, and the means by which rates of wages and living conditions can be adjusted, we are touching only one phase of the economic conditions of our country. It is necessary that we should engage in a much closer scrutiny, to ascertain the direction in which our general national policy should be amended. We are not in a position to maintain false standards which now exist on borrowed money. I do not care what honourable members opposite may say, I am not afraid to assert that, while seeking to maintain these standards, we send representatives to the Mother Country, where there are 1,250,000 people unemployed. We tell the people there, in effect that they should adopt our standards, and pay the wages which our workers are receiving and at the same time we coolly ask if we can borrow another £50,000,000 to maintain our conditions. This cannot continue. We had a severe rebuff a few days ago in connection with the issue of Treasury bills in London for a period of twelve months, when we could borrow only at £6 3s. per cent. The Commonwealth is reaching the limit of its borrowing capacity, and I am glad that the Government has at last realized that a Commonwealth compulsory arbitration policy is economically unsound. "" Our federal arbitration policy has been in operation for 25 years, and has failed -even the workers. The Australian wage earner has a perfect right, in return for honest service, to enjoy sound economic conditions, and to receive a fair margin in the matter of remuneration to enable him to maintain his wife and family in comfort. I do not advocate the reduction of wages as the first necessity in a general economic overhaul. With the good times we all went up together and we must all come down together. In 1914, when this nation undertook heavy war activities, we incurred an enormous war debt. The conditions which prevailed at that time were responsible for the heavy expenditure of loan money. Huge contracts were entered into, almost regardless of the consequences. After the first year or two of the war, we experienced wonderful seasons, with high prices for our primary produce. Extensive borrowing of money caused an inflation of prices, the effect of which is still being felt, and whilst other countries have ' been writing down we have declined to . do so. Like the ostrich, we are seeking to hide our head in the sand, while the rest of our body is still exposed. We cannot carry on our national work on a false basis, and the sooner we face the actual facts, the better it will be for the people. I am glad this measure has been introduced, as it may be the means of improving our economic position. Some honourable members have said that, when the measure becomes operative, there will be six authorities controlling arbitration. authority in each State but one. But these authorities will not be in conflict. The State authorities will have sovereign powers within the State boundaries. It may be necessary to establish a co-ordinating authority in order to ensure fairly uniform anomalies, but that is a matter for the States. I do not think there will be any overlapping. Who can be a more jealous custodian and guardian of the States' rights than the States themselves? Can a central authority be more solicitous for the interests of the people within a State than a State authority? The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) said he wished the Commonwealth and State arbitration systems to prevail. I can only surmise that he knows that the State of which he is one of the representatives is anxious that the control of-its industrial affairs should be in its own hands. Tasmania, which does not possess the resources of the mainland States, was once a happy and contented, if not altogether prosperous, community. For years, Tasmania controlled her own industrial situation in a satisfactory way. It was not until the Commonwealth's Conciliation and Arbitration Act came into operation, that she began to feel thud after thud, and eventually found that she oould not stand up to the burden. This forced the Government of that State to come, cap in hand, to the Commonwealth for a financial Ur. Rodgers. grant of £300,000 or £400,000, in order to maintain her position under the new system. getting back money to which she is entitled. had to carry the burden of developing the State under federal arbitration awards without federal assistance. Western Australia and South Australia have been compelled to approach the central authority in the same way. The conditions experienced by the StatesI have mentioned have, they claim, been imposed upon them by the legislation of the federal authority. A federal industrial authority is too costly, too cumbersome, and too slow, and many workers are tired of the Commonwealth arbitration system. Some honorindustrial able members opposite say that the There will be a separate workers will rise in open revolt when the industrial machinery is in the hands of a State authority, but in Queensland and . New South Wales the industrialists have been taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the State tribunals. I am not opposed .to rivalry and competiconditions and to remove tion. I do not want Australia to be controlled under a system of unification. We have a diversity of ideals, of climate, and of soils, and there should also be diversity of control; with the States legislating in their own interests and working out their own economic life. I do not believe that a National Parliament in Canberra is the best informed body to deal with the industrial life of the whole of Australia. On the contrary, I find that the system, under which we are operating is too cumbersome and too costly, and that we are too far removed from the people of the States. The State authorities can exercise better control and supervision over those things, which are dominating factors in our national life. I do not wish to traverse the arguments which have been adduced by honourable members on both sides of the chamber, but I welcome the opportunity to try out a new system under which, I hope, every industry in Australia will receive a fair deal, and every workman will be able to receive a fair wage, so that they and those dependent upon them will feel that there is a prospect of a bright and prosperous future.",172,Number Of Persons Employed

419,Mr Rodgers,"Fo r years Tasmaniabe evident to a majority of tbe. Australian people that this measure, which is undoubtedly the most important that has ever been placed before this Parliament, has been introducedat the instigation of the big financial interests; not only in Australia, but overseas. I have listened with a great deal of interest to the speeches of honourable members, and particularly to that of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers), who has not spoken in this chamber since the 22nd March. Prior to that date, the honourable member had something to say on almost every subject which came before the House for discussion The honourable member for Wannon, who said that there had been a good deal of "" sob-stuff"" used by honourable members on this side of the chamber, also referred to the question of unemployment; but I should like to ask the honourable member what he or the Government which he is supporting has done to solve the unemployment problem. The Government has aggravated the situation by allowing immigrants to come into this country when there is a large army of unemployed, many of whom are starving. When the position of the coal industry was under consideration, on the 22nd March of this year, the honourable member for Wannon said that any one possessing a spark of humanity could not disregard the earnest appeal which had been made by the honourable member for Hunter. He saidI appeal to the Prime Afinister to set his inquiry afoot. We, in this chamber, stand for the people of the nation and not for a privileged few. If the coal-owners have closed their mines merely to put their business on a better profit-earning basis, they arc doing an injustice to the nation, for coal is an essential daily commodity. This is not a chamber to be moved merely by sentiment. We must weigh the facts and hold the scales of justice evenly. I appeal to the Prime Minister to take action to have this matter cleared up. What action has the honourable member for Wannon taken to assist in that direction? When the motion of want of confidence was launched by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore), he was absent; but when a division was taken at 7.30 a.m. after an all-night sitting he did not assist those for whom he had previously pleaded, but supported the Government in its action in withdrawing the prosecution against John Brown. Such men should not speak of sob-stuff, because when the ""hard word"" is put on them, they are like snails and crawl into their dugouts. There is another individual to whom I have listened with considerable interest and amusement, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green). He said that he never heard anybody from this side of the House, although we advocate the retention of the Arbitration Court, state why we supported the timber workers when they broke an award. I personally support the timber workers' refusal to comply with that pernicious award. It was meted out to them by an old-age pensioner, a fossil from Queensland, who was, and still is, receiving a pension of £1,000 a year from the Queensland Government. able member is entitled to criticize the principles embodied in judgments; but must not use terms which in any way reflect upon the judiciary. judgment was an unjust one. It was founded upon an amendment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and ArbitrationAct which this party strenuously opposed. A conference was held between the representatives of the timber workers and the timber merchants in Melbourne, and it was agreed by the parties that an inquiry into prevailing conditions was necessary; that it would last at least six months. Judge Lukin conducted an inquiry-and he promulgated his decision within two weeks. Putting it very mildly, I contend that it was indecently unfair for a man receiving a pension of £1,000, and a salary of £2,500 per annum, which works out at approximately £70 a week, to determine that workers in the timber industry should receive only from £3 10s: to £4 10s. a week. . 1 fail to see that justice was done, and, so far as the Lukin award is concerned, I shall support the action of the timber workers every time an opportunity presents itself for me to do so.

It is further into Australia determined that the condifluenced in its decision by the attitude of this Government in standing by and allowing the coal barons of Australia to continue to break that award and to go scot free. If the workers break an award there is a different story to tell. I rewomen. Those stalwarts founded an orfresh the memory of honourable members by recalling the history of the early miners' leaders, some of whom were jailed for periods of from six months to two years for infringing the laws of the country, and refer particularly to the Peter Bowling strike. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr And it would have continued to progress Hughes) knows something about that. . Those men were taken away from their homes in leg irons, and put into gaol because they were mine union leaders. Yet John Brown and the rest of the coal-owners go scot free. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) mentioned the incidence of strikes iii the coal industry, and declared that the coal miners do not obey awards. ask him to give me an instance. thing about awards. bunkum. That is not to be wondered at, as he appears to come from a place where they have plenty of sheep-and goats. The coal-miners are always prepared fo work under their awards, but they have not been allowed to do so. I have tender recollections of my father and my elder brother, with their fellow-workers in and around old Lambton, being confronted with Gatling guns. The New South Wales Government under the instructions of Sir Henry Parkes, was responsible for that callous action. which honourable members opposite desire .to return? Is that the open economic ring? Is it the desire of honourable members opposite to go back to the practices of 1888? If it is, they may rest assured that they will get what they are looking for. I am convinced that the granting of arbitration awards by the Federal or State Courts is governed by the Particularly is it influenced economic strength of the unions concerned. The coal-miners' organization is peculiar in this respect. It was inaugurated by men who migrated tions which prevailed in the mines in Great Britain should not prevail here; that there should be no exploitation and sweating of child labour in mines, or the employment on the mine surface of ganization composed of the best elements of the incipient trade union movement in Australia. That union gathered to itself a tremendous economic strength, which gave it the capacity to fight for what it considered to be equitable wages and conditions. in that direction had it not been for the callous action of this Government and the Government of New South Wales, who deliberately ranged themselves behind the coal barons. The coal-miners were carrying on their fight strictly within the law of the country, and, although harassed and baited by the coal-owners, for eighteen months they refused to break I the law. Then the coal-owners, becoming desperate, took matters into their own hands and broke the award. That is now history, and I do not propose further to dilate upon the facts. I am convinced that in supporting those coal barons in an illegal action this Government provided another nail for its coffin and this fact .would be demonstrated if they faced an election on this issue. History has shown that nothing tangible can be accomplished by the workers unless backed up by strong organization. That applies particularly in the industrial field, and it has always been found by the unions that the industrial tribunals set up by parliaments will grant Is that the system to no more than the applicants",175,Number Of Persons Employed

This ning to realize that only in effective organization does their salvation lie. The miners do not expect me to adopt a selfish attitude on this matter; they realize that they have comrades who are not in a position to win concessions from the employers by their own efforts through lack of organization. Arbitration Court has provided safeguards for them, and I cannot be a. party to removing those safeguards. If they were removed, the workers would be thrown upon the tender mercies of six different* governments, which would be competing one against another in an endeavour to keep production costs at the lowest possible level. ""What has already happened in the coal-mining industry would happen in every industry throughout Australia, particularly if this bill is scarce around Newcastle at the present passed. The country's oversea coal trade, has suffered as the result of competition from cheap labour countries. To win back that trade, the miners would have to accept conditions equal to those of coolie labourers in other parts of the world. If the court were abolished the conditions prevailing in Australia in pre-federation days would be restored. Even the wages boards, and other industrial tribunals operating in the States, have been won only as a result of agitation by organized labour, political and industrial.

"" You cannot win a battle,"" he added, "" without killing a lot of men."" There has been much talk about ."" basher gangs""; but honourable members on the other side of the House have more in common with "" basher gangs"" than have the members of any working-class organization. Eecently Mr J. N . Grace, speaking on behalf of the council of the Retailers Association, said that he was very pleased that the Prime Minister strong enough to demand. had decided to abolish the Federal Arbitration Court, and he would like to was no time for increases of wages, or for a 44-hour week. In his judgment 48 hours a week were few enough. Moreover, he strongly objected to the shops closing at a quarter to six at night, and at twelve on Saturdays. Evidently he would like to see the shops opened for The trade during church services, so that people might buy his wares during the interval when the collection was being taken up. Those who are supporting the Government in its determination to abolish the Arbitration Court would like to see a return to the open economic ring. Only last week, when I was in my constituency, I was told of the method adopted by one business man, of the "" Johnnie-all-sorts type"" to add to his income. Recognizing that coal is very time, he started to sell it. There are numerous falls in abandoned workings where coal may be obtained and this person employed little children, from eight years of age up to fourteen, to go clown these falls, and carry out coal in their little arms under dangerous roofs, and through other dangers. It was placed in corn-sacks, for which he paid them 6d. a sack, and then sold this coal to the public at from 5s. to 7s. a sack. There we have exploitation of child labour going on even in my own constituency. This is the type of person who wants arbitration abolished so that owners want the wage-for-age scale abolished in the mines for boys, so that they can pay them by results or in other words, sweat child labour. It is He admitted that a great absurd to say that it will be of any advantage economically to Australia to abolish the Arbitration Court. The Prime Minister said that the abolition of the court would effect a saving of some thousands of pounds a year. If it is necessary to save money, why does not the Government take its courage in its hands and ask the people for power to abolish the State governments, and to vest supreme power in this Parliament, as was promised when federation was agreed to. If this were done i i would effect a saving, not of £10,000 only, but of millions of pounds, through the abolition and all the paraphernalia of State departments. that it is necessary to economize; but no member of the Government has ever said that the time has arrived when capital should be placed in the witness-box and made to divulge its profits; when it should be made to tell what it is getting out of the great national industries which are as vital to the country's progress as water and air are to human beings. I have never heard any one suggest that, in order to help the country out of the financial morass in which it is struggling at present, those who invested money in war loans at 6 per cent., and who are still receiving that interest on their investments, should be asked to make some sacrifice. It is grotesquely unfair that the workers should be asked to accept reduced wages when those who have invested their capital at high called upon to sacrifice a penny, either in dividends, rent or interest. It is not fair. Their only cry is that the wages of the workers must be reduced. There is no reference to those who, for business reasons, said they could not go to the war, or to those who refused to subscribe to the war loans until the rate of interest was raised to 6 per cent. If those investors had been half as patriotic as the men who enlisted, they would have lent their country their money free of interest. If it is right that returned soldiers employed in the mines in my constituency should be turned out of war service homes, together with their wives and children, because, owing to the lockout, they cannot pay their instalments, it is right also, The employers in industry are asking for that those who exploited the country should receive no more interest on the money they put into the war loans. Action along that line would assist in getting the country out of its present difficulties. The Prime Minister extols piece-work, as does also the honourable -member for Eichmond( Mr E. Green). The miners have always worked piecework; they have always been paid by results. Mention has been made of the strikes and lockouts in the coal industry. Piece-work metyns competition between workers; it breeds discontent, dissatisfacMr Speaker shall be satisfied that a Mr James. tion and turmoil. The troubles in the of costly State parliaments, coal industry have been caused by the continual pin pricks to which the workers We have been told have been subjected by the owners and managers of the mines, who seem always to be trying to filch something from their employees. In a dangerous occupation such as coal-mining, piece-work causes many casualties. Men are forced into workings that are dangerous. If they refuse to work in such places, they have to go home, as in many instances no other jobs are found for them. The result is that many of them are taken from the mines, not to their homes, but to the cemeteries. The proportion of casualties to the number of workers employed is greater in the coal mining industry than in any other industry. Yet we hear the coal-miners described by the honourable member for Eichmond( Mr E. Green) as ""men who will not work."" These men who have always endeavoured to do the best for the rates of interest are not development and protection of the country want to work to-day, but they are not allowed to do so. From among the miners in my constituency and in Newcastle, two battalions of infantry and one mining battalion were sent from Australia to take part in the Great War. To-day, those of them 1 who returned are having their pensions reduced and their homes taken from them. This is their reward. They have been taught a bitter lesson which which will not be forgotten by them or by their children.

That is also the established practice in several of the State Parliaments; I know it to be so in South Australia and Queensland. You, Mr Speaker, are, of course, well acquainted with what May says regarding the duties and powers of the occupant of your office in relation to the formation of a quorum. In the House of Commons, when the Speaker was satisfied of the existence of a quorum in the building, he has declined to count the House. I point out, too, that although an Opposition member was addressing the House when attention was drawn to the lack of a quorum, only two members of the Labour party were in the chamber. The others are sleeping in various portions of the building, and Government supporters are expected to keep a House together. You will realize, Mr Speaker, that it is difficult to retain a quorum in the chamber if members on one side only attend. I trust that in this matter you, sir, will be guided by the practice of the Mother of Parliaments, and set out in May at page 224; allowing the debate to continue without interruption so long as you are satisfied that a quorum exists within the precincts of the House. Mr Speaker must be satisfied that the number of members required to form a quorum is present in the House. Before you call upon the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) to continue his speech you .will, I assume, satisfy yourself that a quorum is actually present in this chamber. If honourable members are walking in the gardens, or are in other portions of the building, taking no interest in the business under discussion, and some one, considering that in courtesy to the member addressing the House they should attend to hear his remarks, calls attention to the state of the House, they, I take it, must be actually in the chamber to be counted as part of the quorum.

I claim that I am in order in pointing out the circumstances of the case, for they are important. In the present circumstances it is the duty of the Government to maintain a quorum. The Government has called the tune, and it must dance to it. The Government has said that the sitting will be continued until the second reading has been disposed of, notwithstanding the fatigue occasioned by so long a sitting. raised on a number of occasions, as you, Mr Speaker, are doubtless aware. When, in the past, attention has been called to the state of the House, Speakers have ruled that they would not allow au incessant calling together of members, and it has been the practice to allow a quarter of an hour to elapse after the calling of a quorum before the bells will be rung again. honourable members, irrespective of party, to assist in maintaining a quorum for the conduct of public business,""and only those whom the Speaker can see actually within the bar of the House are counted by him.

[Quorum formed.] fostered the agitation for the abandonment of arbitration in the Commonwealth sphere, because it has interfered to some extent with their business. But they have not been the only agitators. The Pastoral Review-the squatter's journal of the 16th September, 1921, contained an article, in which the following sentence appeared:To institute successful immigration, we must first burn our Arbitration Acts and abolish tlie basic wage. The Government arid its supporters hope, that by evacuating the field of industrial arbitration, they will be able to force the workers into subjection. They anticipate that competition between the States will bring about a reduction in wages. The bill has also been introduced because the Government has been made to look utterly stupid because of its refusal to enforce the law against the employers, notably, Mr John Brown, the coal baron. As the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) pointed out, the people have given no mandate for the taking of this step. Otherwise, we should have heard something about it in the Governor General's speech. The Government has stolen a march on the people. It has been consorting too much of late with men of the John Brown type. Not only the Prime Minister, but also the State Premiers, have been bluffed by this gentleman. I predicted that in March last. The result has been that the coal mines are still inactive, and 36,000 people have been reduced to a state of destitution. The National Government is in very truth in a sorry plight over it. The bill is part of a determined effort to smash the federated organizations of the workers. The employers hope that by this means they will be able to attack the trade unionists first of all in the weakest State. If they can secure a reduction of wages in one State, they will make similar efforts in other States. Thus they hope to force down the standard of living in Australia. The introduction of this bill is one of the most callous and cold-blooded acts that any Commonwealth Government has committed. We have been told repeatedly that the cost of production must be reduced. We are now able to see that the Government intends that the only sacrifice to be made to achieve this end shall come from the workers. There is no suggestion that interest rates should be reduced or that profits should be limited. The workers alone are to be called upon to bear the burden. The Government would not, of course, dream of demanding a sacrifice from its wealthy supporters. It hopes that by forcing the workers to speed up their activities, production costs will be reduced and profits increased. I worked in the coal-mines of ', Western Australia for five years on a daily wage, and work was carried on without cessation. We had only five days' stoppage in the whole period. I know that the contract system is now in vogue in those mines, but the Western Australian mine-owners do not seem to be as avaricious as those of the northern coal-fields. ley) -The honourable member's time has expired. fifteen minutes of my time was taken up in the discussion of a point of order, I should like an extension of time. allowance can be made for time occupied in the discussion of points of order. was responsible for the call for a quorum, which was decided on a point of order, and resulted in a debate which curtailed % the time available to the honourable member for Hunter, would I be in order in asking for leave to move that he be granted an extension of time? ley) -Yes. cordingly.

439,Mr D. Cameron (Brisbane) [10.16].,"of this morning, quoted from the speeches of a number of honourable members on the subject of Commonwealth conciliation and arbitration. He endeavoured to show that, in supporting this bill, a number of those honourable gentleman were recanting views previously expressed by or two from some remarks that I made during the second-reading debate on the amending Conciliation and Arbitration B ill , which was before us on the 23rd May, 1928. to fairness to myself, continue it for another sentence or two. Throughout this debate, many of the qu'otations used, if begun a sentence or two earlier or continued a little further would have assumed a somewhat different complexion from that suggested. On that occasion, I followed the honourable member for ""Wannon( MrI again submitted myself to the suffrages Rodgers), who said he believed that the central system of compulsory arbitration was an absolute failure. He also maintained that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court had not succeeded in bringing about industrial peace, and he apparently agreed with those who have stated that the court really tended to promote industrial unrest. A f t e r referring to the honourable member's remarks, I saidHowever, there are to-day tens of thousands of workers in Australia who are satisfied with the existing system, and are abiding by the awards of the court. After all, only a few unions-importan t ones, undoubtedly-com e into conflict with those awards. I certainly tliink-and I am sure the honourable member for Wannon will agree with me-that a system which for the last 24 .years has been working satisfactorily from the point of view of tens of thousands of workers must be continued, That is where the honourable member's quotation of my remarks ended; but I went onAnd that the main duty of tliose who believe in arbitration is to try to improve it wherever that can be done. I have no knowledge of the intentions of the Government, but I personally think that this should be regarded as the last attempt to place that system on a sound basis; and should it fail I do not think that any one would cavil at the Government if it endeavoured to find some other means of ' obtaining industrial peace in this country. I certainly think that the honourable member for Barton might have completed my statement. I remember the occasion well. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) who followed, took me to task for expressing the opinion that I did. Shortly after that, I wrote to the secretary of the Trades and Labour Councili n Brisbane, and requested that I should be permitted to address the members of that body in regard to this parthem.

I shall always retain the happiest recollections of that meeting. I have never been present at a better-conducted gathering. I reiterated the statement that I had made in this House, and not long afterwards of the people of Brisbane, who did me the honour of returning me with a majority of 5,000 votes. I have no hesitation in supporting the bill before the house. Much has been said about the lack of a mandate for the introduction of this legislation. Once again, I would remind honourable members that the Prime Minister, on the 3rd J u ly last year, stated in Perth that unless we got away from the spectacle of strikes proceeding concurrently with awards of the court, the whole system of arbitration would have to go. ""When he delivered his policy speech in October, 1928, he made it plain that the Government was prepared to consider any alternative to our present industrial arbitration laws, which would enable the ends they were designed to secure to be more satisfactory achieved. During the debate upon the Transport WorkersB ill in February this year, he repeated the warning, and, lastly, on the 17th May, with special reference to the strike that was proceeding in the timber industry, he issued a final and most definite warning. On other occasions, also, he indicated to the people the action the Government would consider it necessary to take, should the industrial conditions remain as they were. Surely that was definite enough. Honourable members who argue that the Government had no mandate for its action have sot seriously attempted to support their contention. I have listened most carefully to the speeches delivered on this bill. I was struck by the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley). From his point of view, it was a most able speech, and well delivered. It was free from exaggeration. But I cannot agree with many of the views he expressed, particularly in his contention that this legislation would in any way reduce the dignity of the Federal Parliament; in fact, I think it will raise it. Not long ago, certain honourable members opposite complained that, by bringing down the Financial Agreement Bill, the Government was doing all it possibly could to diminish the powers of the States. Soi t appears that, whatever action the Government takes, some honourable members on the Opposition side must oppose it. I was impressed by the speech delivered by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin). follow his arguments. I think that he is the only member who has spoken on this bill who definitely favours a dual control of industry. The honourable gentleman pointed out that the Commonwealth is a very large area; that some men might be engaged in a certain industry, say, at Longreach, in Western Queensland, while other men might be employed in the same industry at Normanton. It is quite possible, and probable, he said, that federal awards made in Melbourne or Sydney in that industry would not be suitable for those distant localities, and would not be acceptto make amendments of the law that able. I quite agree with that; but it supports the legislation that the Government has brought down. were, other industries that required uniform legislation throughout the Commonwealth. that reference was made to that fact by the Attorney-General in his speech in this chamber. members of the Western Australian Branch of the Timber Works Association have broken up the union and formed a new one, with the object of applying to the State court for an award. Whether it can do so or not is, I believe, a matter that has not yet been decided by the High Court. The Prime Minister, and also the Attorney-General, indicated very clearly to the House and the country the reasons why this measure was brought down. Honourable members on both sides have constantly referred to and quoted the late Mr Justice Higgins' awards and writings. The Attorney-General, in his speech, said that the fundamental principle underlying the bill was found in the words of Mr Justice Higgins, in his book A New Province for Law and OrderIf there is to be regulation, and there must be, it should come from one authority. I think that it . will be admitted, if a review is made of the history of Commonwealth conciliation and arbitration, that the Government led by the Prime Minister has made the greatest possible effort to insure its effective working. That is my opinion, and I am sure But I could hot it is shared by the majority of the people of this country. Three years ago the Government, recognizing the chaotic conditions that have been brought about by overlapping arbitration awards, took a referendum of the people, and invited them to grant further powers to the Commonwealth ; but that request was refused. I shall not say more about that, because constant reference has been made to the referendum, and the reasons for its failure. Then there followed a comprehensive overhaul of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. . I maintain that everything possible was done would be acceptable .to those engaged in industry. The Government consulted organizations of employers and employees, inviting their assistance and co-operation; suggestions were asked for, and everyeffort made to make the whole scheme of compulsory arbitration more acceptable to those engaged in industry. Particular effort was made in the amending bill to ensure the observance of awards. But since it was passed, little more than twelve At 'the present time the months ago, the waterside workers and the timber workers have struck against awards of the court. Both strikes were definite refusals to obey the industrial laws of the country.

The present state of affairs cannot continue, and there remains no alternative but to evacuate the field of industrial arbitration in favour of would usher in an. unbroken era of the States. That is the course which the Government is proposing. It is misleading to say that the Commonwealth's retirement from this field will leave the worker and the fair employer without protection. grave reflection on the parliaments of workers are operating under' the awards and determinations of State authorities to-day than under the awards of the Commonwealth Court, and the Attorney-General has clearly indicated that there is no legal limit to the power of a State authority to deal with disputes, so far as they affect employers and employees within the boundaries of that State. The people have been assured by the Prime Minister that it is not the intention of the asian Council of Trade Unions, which Government to allow industrial relationships to come again under what has been termed the law of the jungle. templated for a moment by the Government. All honourable members recognize that a return to conditions which would enable the unscrupulous employer to take an unfair advantage of his employees would be a retrograde and unthinkable step. The bill makes definite provision for all awards and agreements registered in the Commonwealth Court to remain in force for a period sufficient to enable those interested to transfer to the industrial jurisdiction of the States. It is unnecestration have done untold damage during sary at this stage to say that the Government, and those who support it, stand definitely for an adequate basic wage, approved working conditions, and as high a standard of living as is economically possible. If the workers have a grievance against this legislation -and their representatives nrofess that they have-the y must place the blame upon those of their own leaders and members who for a considerable time have held the Commonwealth Court up to ridicule, and wilfully and deliberately undermined the principle of federal compulsory arbitration. Thereby they have done untold damage. Twenty-five years ago, the people were urged to accept a system of compulsory arbitration, and were led to believe that it industrial peace, based upon judge-made industrial law; that all decisions of the court would be obeyed, and that if breaches occurred penalties would be enforced. But to-day we have reached To say that is to cast a a state of almost hopeless industrial confusion, and industry is wellthe States. After all, more nigh paralysed by clashing awards. One of the most serious disabilities under which the Pederal Court labours is its inability to enforce its jurisdiction. The majority of the people are sick of existing conditions, and tired of a law under which one factory alone is subject to 38 different awards and wages boards determinations. The campaign against the principle of compulsory arbitration has been proceeding since 1927, and it has been organized by the Australclaims to represent a large number of the unions. How many it does represent not even the Attorney-General has been able Such a step is not conto ascertain. During this debate frequent reference has been made to the PanPacific Worker, which is issued by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and the Pacific Relations Committee, and claims to represent the views of a large number of unions throughout the Commonwealth. Worker is the official organ of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, and its astounding views on compulsory arbithe last couple of years.

Opponents of the bill have said that the object of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General is to reduce wages and lower the standard of living. I repudiate that absolutely. There are other burdens that can be removed from industry, and amongst the heaviest are the tremendous expenditure in connection with arbitration, and the uncertainty arising out of dual control. These have done more than anything else to retard the further investment of capital in this country. There is plenty of money available for investment in industry if a feelUnion shows that in six years the costs of ing of certainty in regard to the future can be established. To overcome the existing evil of dual control three courses are open. The first is an appeal by referendum to the people for a grant of increased power suggestion has been made inside and outside this House that, notwithstanding previous refusals, the Government should have again appealed to the people. Possibly the real attitude of labour generally not conceive how they can base their opto the 1926 referendum proposals was expressed by a union secretary, who said that an extension of the Commonwealth power was desirable, but should only be supported by the workers when a Labour government was in power. That contention had a lot to do with the failure of that appeal. We must realize that the determination of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court will enable the States to set up whatever machinery is required by the various industries. Many of them will be able to devise their own machinery for the settlement of grievances and the fixation of wages and working conditions. The repeal of the federal legislation will also relieve organizations of employers and employees of the cost inseparable from the present system, will result in more expeditious settlements, and will enable matters which are at issue to be dealt with without necessitating the artiweapon to secure political control. ficial creation of disputes. The fact that the existence of a dispute was a condition precedent to the functioning of the court has been one of the most prolific causes because I honestly believe that it will do Mr D. Cameron. of trouble. Furthermore, industrial relationship will be entirely removed from the atmosphere of litigation, and employers and employees will be encouraged ' tb come closer together for the settlement of their differences. That will be perhaps the greatest advantage that will accrue from this legislation. There is also absent now a sense of finality, and that must tend to uncertainty. It, to a greater extent than any other factor, is responsible for the condition in which industry finds itself to-day. A return which has been issued by the court shows that eight industrial organizations were involved in an expenditure of over £26,000 in connection with their representations to the court; while a financial statement of the Australian Railways that organization in connection with arbitration proceedings exceeded £9,000. Over £6,500 was spent by employers in the building trade to obtain a determination as to whether the builders' labourers' case should have been adjudicated upon by a Federal or a State tribunal.

Members of the Labour party have urged that there should be a further development of the Industrial Peace Act, which they opposed at every stage, and which labours under exactly the same constitutional difficulties as those that beset our Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Any system of industrial arbitration or regulation must be doomed unless it is supported by those who are engaged in industry. The whole of the industrial legislation that has been introduced by this Government has been misrepresented repeatedly, and that misrepresentation has gone a long way towards preventing it from operating successfully.

447,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [10.50]. Millers And M I L L Employees Associa,"formed.] Its total return amounts to just on £12,000,000 per annum. I could cite instance after instance of members of unions having endeavoured to obtain recognition under State jurisdiction. The communication readsDuring the hearing of applications for State awards by State unions within the printing industry, employers invariably gave evidence before the State tribunal to show that interstate competition existed, and that if the conditions of the States were not approximated, one set of employers would have an advantage against another. In certain States, legislation within the field of industry which was beyond the jurisdiction of State industrial tribunals resulted in giving one State an advantage over another, and this was always the subject of complaint by representative employers. When the Federal Court heard and adjudicated upon the printing industry claim, it was recognized by both employers' and employees' organizations that uniform conditions would obtain for the first time in the history of the industry. Nearly all the industries in Australia have first tried to obtain State awards, but ultimately have been driven to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. State arbitration uniform, and because of that, an industry in one State is sometimes given an advantage over a similar industry in another State. The late Mr Justice Higgins said that nothing caused more irritation in industry than varying conditions of labour and employment in the different States. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that there is less irritation, and more satisfaction, and harmony existing under Federal awards than under State awards. The time is long over-due for the granting of wider powers to the Commonwealth Parliament, and the establishment in the States of what might be termed provincial parliaments. That, I believe, is the -consensus of opinion throughout Australia. I had a very striking illustration of that on Saturday evening last at a large public gathering in my constituency. This subject was mentioned by the proposer of the toast of the Federal Parliament, and he complained bitterly that we have in Australia too many parliaments, which were costing the taxpayers enormous sums of money. I am also of that opinion. It is time that we gave this National Parliament the powers that we thought it Mr Fenton. would have, when federation first took place. Those who took some part in persuading the people of Australia to adopt the Constitution Bill did not, for one moment, believe that the State Parliaments would continue to function for any considerable period in their present form. I , myself, would have"" opposed federation had I not thought that the Federal Parliament would be the supreme Parliament of Australia. The great leaders of that day were favorable to an extension of the powers of the Federal Parliament; but the present proposal of the Government to transfer the Commonwealth powers of arbitration to the States is belittling this Parliament and the Federation of which we all should be stout defenders. The speeches on both sides of the House have been couched in somewhat bitter language, but the lead was given from the Government benches. When the Prime Minister was introducing the bill, he made use of personalities which might very well have been left unsaid. The Attorney-GenThe eral attacked trade unionists, and others legislation is not who are really excellent citizens. Although the Prime Minister indulged in strong language, he made one plea to which I have no objection. He saidI appeal to honourable members to approach the consideration of the bill in no party spirit, but witli a sincere desire to do the best for the nation. Had that spirit animated honourable members during the debate, there would have been a better atmosphere in this chamber. As so much criticism has been indulged in, it will not be amiss if I follow the example of other honourable members. For some considerable time the Federal Government has been seeking to alter the industrial system of Australia. The Industrial Mission that was sent to the United States of America was composed of representatives of both industrial parties. At the time. I thought that the mission was justified as an indication that we were reaching out to the other countries to try to obtain some knowledge of their methods. Not satisfied with that, however, the Government invited the "" Big Four"" here, and they made certain recommendations. Then this Parliament passed the Crimes Act and the Transport Workers Act, and amended the Arbitration Act. All these things have to drastically alter the industrial .conditions of Australia. Mr Hugh Grant Adam, associate editor of the Melbourne Herald, accompanied the Industrial Mission to the United States of America; but he did not keep close to the arranged itinerary. He stepped into the by-paths of American industry, and saw how industries were conducted, and how workmen were treated. He kept apart altogether from the plan mapped out by those who were conducting the delegation through the various industries of the -United States of America. He said that the Australian delegation was about the fifth delegation that had paid a visit to the United States of America to investigate its methods of conducting industry, that every one of the delegations .saw the same institutions and industries, and travelled the same route. taken to the show places, and, consequently, did not get a true indication of American industrial methods. quote a few paragraphs from Mr Hugh Grant Adam's book, An Australian Looks at America, since it contains some valuable information that might be of interest to honourable members. He saidThe argument I heard was, "" Co-operation between labour and capital makes a country industrially prosperous. dustrially prosperous. Therefore America has co-operation between labour and capital."" America is enjoying many of the conditions that might be expected to result from the enthusiastic co-operation of labour in the busimatter what his political colour may be. In ness of profit-making. Labour works hard, at great speed, and for long hours. It does so because the pace is set by the employers, and it has no alternative but to keep up that pace or get out. That is the extent to which labour co-operates with capital in America. This co-operation has been brought about by the weak position of the individual worker, in the absence of labour organization. The demand for skill has been reduced to a minimum, and there is the constant menace of a surplus of unskilled workers, drawn mostly from low-standard countries, to whom the wages paid in America represent great wealth. This situation, like many others in American industry, is bound to be profoundly effected when the results of restricted immigration make themselves felt upon the quality and quantity of the labour supply. In another place he saysI do not believe that America has reached any more intelligent, any more democratic, partnership between labour and capital than Australia has, despite all our records of inbeen done with a view dustrial disputes. If labour in America must attain at least the recognition that it already receives in Australia before there can be such a partnership, America will be very lucky indeed if its revolution is a peaceful one. Again he saidOne conclusion that I formed early,, and iu which I remain unshaken, is that I would not like to see the Australian worker in the position of the American worker. IfI had to believe that it was necessary for the Australian worker to accept the conditions that exist in America before Australia could become a prosperous industrial nation, I would have very grave doubts of the wisdom of pursuing prosperity. I have heard the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) say in this House that, if we followed American principles more, indulged in piece-work, and adopted their methods, Australia would be in a much better position than it is at present. They were I have heard the ex-member for Wakefield, when dealing with this very subject, telling us how necessary it is for us to Let me adopt the methods of America. Mr Hugh Grant Adam has seen the industries of America, and from what I can gather from his book and other publications, I do not think that it would be desirable for Australia to adopt the American methods of conducting industry. The greatest asset of any country is its human America is inbeings, and anything that will tend to make our people happier and to improve their conditions of living should haye the support of every honourable member, no America elderly persons are seldom seen in factories or workshops. The managers of such institutions, when asked the reason for that, will point to the grave-yards, and say, "" They have gone there-me n of 40 and 45 years-the y are old men."" We do not want such conditions to exist in Australia. The representatives of different political parties in this chamber have, at times, perhaps inadvertently, been responsible for utterances which may have had a damaging effect upon the country; but I resent the remarks of honourable members, opposite, who repeatedly say that Australia is a land of strikes. The two most progressive countries industrially are the Commonwealth and New Zealand, in each of which a compulsory arbitration system is in operation and they have fewer strikes than any other country. A conference was held in New Zealand last year consisting of employers, employees, university professors, students of economics and others, which considered five subjects, which the conference reached a unanimous decision. The conference discussed at lenglli the arbitration system of New Zealand, which has been in operation since 1894, but did not come to any definite conclusions. member of the conference, in dealing with the prevention of sweating, and the prevention of strikes, saidThis, one of the original objects of the court, has apparently been attained.

Provision was made in the amending act of last year for the appointment of these committees and commissioners, but so far only one conciliation commissioner has been appointed throughout Australia. That is the Ministry's contribution to the work of conciliation. those conciliation commissioners depends upon the parties. claims of the Government, only one conciliation commissioner has been appointed. The feeling is fairly general throughout the community that the Government's appointments to the Federal Arbitration Court have been, to put it mildly, unfortunate. the biased mind of the honourable member. mention a number of honourable members opposite who hold similar views. [Quorum formed.""] I know that the legal fraternity in Selborne Chambers and elsewhere were astounded when this bombshell fell and the Government made its appointments. The Bruce-Page Ministry has never lent its' aid to the promotion of harmony between the partners in industry. When the Australian seamen's dispute occurred in 1925 representatives of the trade union movement interviewed the Prime Minister with a request that he should intervene. Mr Bruce referred the delegation to the Commonwealth Shipping Board, in whose hands, he declared, the matter rested so far as it concerned the Commonwealth Line. Finally, Mr Lang, then Premier of New South Wales, arranged an interview with Sir William Clarkson, of the Commonwealth Shipping Board. Sir William acted on his own initiative and the Commonwealth Line, notwithstanding the fact that the Government had refused to intervene, made a satisfactory agreement with the Australian Seamen's Union. Despite the opposition of the Government, representatives of the trade union movement were Council of Trade Unions thus able to bring about peace in industry I shall not enter into a general dispute of 1927, but I may mention that the Attorney-General, who acted on behalf of the Ministryi n the matter, absolutely refused to lend any assistance. When interviewed by Mr Crofts, the secretary of the Australasian Council df Trade Unions, and urged to bring the parties together, Mr Latham said "" The waterside workers are not going to get away with all that they think they can."" If that was the attitude of the Attorney General in that case, one must conclude that he is another of those who threw a spanner into our industrial machinery. The occasion was an important one, and the possible consequences so serious that the Attorney-General should have mediated in the matter. And when the Australasian Council of Trade Unions was on the eve of settling the waterside workers' dispute in 1928, the Government introduced its reactionary and obnoxious Transport Workers Act, so aggravating the trouble. During his second-reading speech on this bill the Attorney-General, becoming irritated by interjections, intimated that the. timber workers had been humiliated and defeated. He gloried in their defeat, and demonstrated his undoubted bias. The facts indicate clearly that the timber workers of Victoria were fully justified",185,Number Of Persons Employed

The terms of that settlement were effected by the present chairman of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Sir Eobert Gibson, who presided over the conference and conducted it in such a gentlemanly fashion that results were achieved that are a credit to all concerned. They further provided that the accountant was to inquire into the ability of the industry to work under a 44-hour week. Until the inquiry was completed the employers, were to put into a trust fund wages equivalent to the difference between a 44 and 48-hour week. This sum will go to the workers if the decision is finally in their favour. The timberworkers came out of that trouble very well. The results achieved show conclusively that if any prominent public man, whatever may be his political views, makes an endeavour to bring about a peaceful solution of industrial difficulties, being bitterly antagonised by its action. the probability is that his efforts will be successful. But the Prime Minister refused to render assistance. It is generally known that the Government found the money for the expenses of the Commonwealth Industrial Conference, which is generally known as the Industrial Peace Conference. That conference unanimously carried a resolution intimating to the Bruce-Page Government that the penal sections of our industrial legislation were not conducive to peace and harmony in industry The Government has used those sections to harass and humiliate the workers. Brown, the coal baron, has been allowed to go scot free. And he is still flouting the laws of the Commonwealth. The Government, taking refuge in its coward's castle, is too weak-kneed to bring John Brown and the other offending coal barons to heel. The Prime Minister intimated that the Government would see that'the law was obeyed. Why has it failed in this instance? We know that the withdrawal of the John Brown prosectition Mr Fenton. and the abandonment of federal arbitration have caused differences in the Ministry, and very serious differences between two prominent honourable gentlemen opposite. The Attorney-General told the Prime Minister that if the Government withdrew the John Brown prosecution it would have to abandon the field of federal Prime Minister intimated that he desired some proposals to be submitted to him, he did not give any indication that he had in his mind the abandonment of federal conciliation and arbitration. His apparent desire was that the existing Arbitration Act should be made more effective. His announcement to the Premiers' Conference in May last, therefore, came as a shock to representatives of both the employers and employees on the Industrial Peace Conference. That conference needed a little more Commonwealth money to complete its labours. That was denied. Now this bill comes as a bolt from the blue. The facts show conclusively that the Government has not behaved in a manner conducive to peace in industry. It is held suspect in regard to industrial matters, and I do not blame any individual or union for The withdrawal of the prosecution against John Brown dissipated the trade unionists' last shred of confidence in the sincerity ancl good intentions of this Government. When I think of such men as the late Mr Justice Higgins, Mr Alfred Deakin and Sir Edmund Barton, and compare them with those who are supporting the Government in the action in which it is now proposing to take, it makes me wonder whether there is any one on that side of the House who has remained true to the great principles of federation. Mr Justice Higgins took a Yet John prominent part in the conventions which assisted in drawing up our Commonwealth Constitution, and he was one of the earliest memhers of the Commonwealth Parliament. The Constitution which he helped to draw up was not perfect; it was permeated too much by the spirit of State rights, and not enough by that of National rights. Yet, very early in the life of the Pederal Parliament, Mr Justice Higgins, then Mr Higgins, indicated his readiness to do what he could to obtain for this Parliament a larger keep to ourselves the power to regulate measure of control over industrial affairs. the conditions of employment of those Speaking on 28th June, 1901, he saidWe feel that these problems, especially the problems of the tariff, are so inextricably insomething of the hopes which lay nearest tertwined with legislative attempts to regu-.

Sitting suspended from 11.55 to 12.80 a.m. Saturday, 7 September, 1929. I listened for many hours to the speeches delivered on this important subject, and, unquestionably, some of them were of very high merit. Perhaps the most meandering, as well as the least constructive speech, was that delivered by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). I was greatly surprised that a gentleman of his experience did not have some assistance to offer the House with which he professed to be in sympathy. Almost every sentence of his speech revealed his vindictive jealousy of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce). Mr Hughes remarked that, at the recent Premiers' Conference, the Prime Minister referred to the high cost of living in Australia; he continued, "" The Prime Minister has been in power for six years, and only now has he found that out."" That remark took my mind back to a time a few months after the right honourable member for North Sydney had run his course in the public esteem, and was replaced by the present Prime Minister. It may be well to recall that Mr Hughes was the gentleman who advised the Governor General, the King's representative in this country, to send for Mr Bruce. I cannot forget the occasions when, in this chamber, the ex-Prime Minister has revealed the jealous spirit within him. Honourable members who were in the House in 1923 will remember the introduction by the Bruce-Page Government of a bill to amend the Old-age Pensions Act, by which the weekly payment to pensioners Maritime [EEPEESE: STTATIVES.] Industries BiU. was increased from 15s. to 17s. 6d. per week. Certain anomalies in the then existing act were also to be removed, making the weekly pension equivalent to £1. The then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Charlton, moved that, instead of 17s. 6d. a week, the pension should be £1 a week. That amendment was supported by the right honourable member for North Sydney, notwithstanding that it was a motion of want of confidence in the Government. Had any other honourable member on this side of the House delivered a similar speech and voted as he did, I should not (Saturday). have taken any notice of it, and should probably have forgotten, it long before this, but I could not forget that Mr Hughes had been in office for six years, during which time he could have made the pension £2 a week had he so desired. Yet he was prepared to put out of office a government which did not do something which he himself had failed to do when he had the opportunity. A little later certain ordinances relating to land policy in the Northern Territory were under consideration in the House. Again the Leader of the Opposition objected, and urged that that land should be controlled by an act of Parliament. The Opposition made out a very strong case. The ex-Prime Minister, still f u ll of jealousy, agreed with the Opposition, nowithstanding that the ordinances to which he objected were drafted by a member of his own Cabinet, and that, during his regime, similar matters were governed by ordinances, and none by act of Parliament. Eemembering those occasions, and the jealousy of the right honourable member for North Sydney, I was not impressed by his speech on this bill. It contained nothing constructive. I heartily support the bill, on the ground that the Prime Minister submitted it to the State Premiers at a recent Premiers' Conference. It is designed to effect economy. The vexed question of the cost of living does arise; it is, indeed, a potent factor in this connection. Yet the right honourable member for North Sydney sneered when it was mentioned, and wanted to know what the cost of living had to do with the bill. He inquired whether the bill would insure to",189,Interstate Competition

The British regarded that matter as fundamental. Again, on page 20 of its report, the commission statedMost vexed aud most important of all Australian questions is that of the cost of production with its effect upon export industries and of the combined effects of the Tariff and the arbitration acts. There is ground for the common complaint of a vicious circle of increased prices due to mentals, as did also the honourable the tariff, and of increased costs of labour due to arbitration awards, and it is urgently necessary to break the vicious circle without lowering the standard of living, i.e., real wages. I remind honourable members opposite that tbe Labour Premier of Western Australia regards this question in the same light as does the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) should heed the remarks of Mr Collier. [28] The position in Australia to-day was serious, literally living on its primary industrieswheat and wool.

454,Mr Pbowse,"In the West Ausirrespective of whether they are economic and necessary to our well-being or not, has placed an intolerable load upon our primary industries. ""We speak that we do know."" The report of Mr Collier's speech continued as follows:When the fall in wheat prices took place, many people believed that it would be unwise for the growers to cultivate or crop as much land this year, and, in some quarters, it was suggested that there should be a decrease. But that would be a very retrograde step. The State would never surmount its difficulties by decreasing the area under wheat merely because the price fell, but it should endeavour to enable the farmer to compete in the overseas markets by reducing the cost of production. An increase in the area under crop and a reduction in the cost of production would make tlie position to-day, with a lower price, what it was. two years ago, with a higher price. a lower price this year. It was difficult to see what was the cause of the high cost of production. cause. The high tariff was the chief cause. The tariff piled up year by year, and the primary producer, unlike' the manufacturer, was unable to pass it on. Honourable members opposite are doing everything in their power to increase the tariff, and this is making conditions extremely difficult. I congratulate the Government upon the open-minded attitude it has taken upon this subject. It is at least trying to educate the people of Australia along economic lines. The report from which I have already quoted continuesHe hoped that the Federal Parliament would not continue to pile burdens on to the primary producers through the customs. Another contributory factor to the high cost of production was that many people engaged in manufacturing had not kept abreast of the world's progress with regard to up-todate machinery. In the old world all pre-war methods of production had been scrapped in favour of move economical methods. This waB a question that Australia would have seriously to consider. He agreed with the contention of tlie Leader of the Opposition that high taxation diminished the amount of employment, decreased production, and affected the whole community. So far as Western Australia was concerned, however, the prospects were very bright, and indicated that the State would enjoy one of the best seasons it had experienced for many years. It is apparent, therefore, that the Labour Premier of Western Australia Mr Prowse. that a serious situation confronts Australia. He must thoroughly agree with the Prime Minister that some action is necessary to overcome our difficulties. In addressing the recent Premiers' Conference on this subject the Prime Minister saidA critical examination of our present position leads inevitably to the conclusion that the basic cause of all economic troubles of Australia to-day is the high cost of production, and that a reduction of our costs of production is the first step that we must take to bring about a solution of our problems. A nation-wide reduction in our costs of production would effect such a transformation in our industrial and financial position as would enable us not only to absorb our unemployed in useful occupations, but also to pave the way for a progressive increase in our population. Having laid further emphasis on this aspect of the subject the Prime Minister referred to the overlapping of Commonwealth and State arbitration awards. He said that this would have to be prevented if we were to advance to a better economic position. He proceeded as follows:However, I now invite the Premiers to state definitely whether they are prepared to recommend to their Parliaments the reference of full industrial powers to the Commonwealth. In theabsence of such concerted action on the part of the States the Commonwealth Government feels that it will be its' duty-becaus e of its deep conviction that the present dual system of industrial regulation is retarding our national progress and preventing industrial peace-to propose to the Commonwealth Parliament the repeal of the existing Federal Arbitration legislation subject to transitional provisions, which will preserve existing awards and agreements. for a period, sufficient to enable the States to assume complete control. The Premiers' Conference quite definitely refused to agree to the surrender of additional industrial powers to the Commonwealth, and I do not blame it for doing so. The States ought to have complete authority over their own industrial affairs. A good deal has been said during this debate about the necessity for uniformity in industrial matters; but it must be remembered that the standard of living in the less developed States is necessarily not so high as the standard in the well developed States. Each State must work out its own salvation. A court operating within a State is far more likely to give satisfactory awards than a court operating in some far distant place.

I said that it was costly and unnecessary to have two industrial machines running side by side. The population of Australia is not large enough to bear the burden of so much legal machinery. If we had one industrial authority in each State we should secure a more satisfactory result and inr dustry would be able to develop along peaceful lines. It seems absurd to me that honourable members opposite should desire to duplicate our industrial machinery. I believe that the rank and file of trade unionists would be content to have State courts to fix their conditions. The Bulletin of the 28th August puts the position in a nutshell in the following words:The Federal Parliamentary Labour party that is proposed, and the Attorneyhas met and resolved that the timber strikers General spoke of the estimated savings; are acting nobly in their insurrection against but he did not take into consideration the the federal award. At the same time it demands that the Federal Arbitration Court shall enormous loss that would be incurred continue to exist and hand out awards, to be owing to the chaos that would result. It treated the same way, or worse. The Comwill still be necessary to have six industrial monwealth can't make its court's decisions tribunals throughout the Commonwealth, respected unless it has power to interfere in disturbances, wherever they may arise, and and I believe that the new system, if has police and military forces with which to adopted, will eventually prove more costly scatter insurrectionary mobs.

It was made quite clear during the election campaign that the Commonwealth was not able to enforce the decisions of. the Arbitration Court. It , therefore, seems to me to be unreasonable to retain this ineffective instrument .of industrial control. I know that the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) would like all power to be reposed in the National Parliament; but the people are not favorable to an alteration of the Constitution in that respect. The States are at present administering our police, education and health laws and there is no reason why we should interfere with their operations. I heartily support the bill, for I think that it is a step in the direction of better government. If the bill is passed, I fear that it will do irreparable harm to the industries of Australia, and to the workers engaged in them. It is the most retrograde proposal that has been made since the inauguration of federation. One would have expected the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister to advance substantial arguments in support of it, but their speeches were lamentably weak, and lacked conviction. The Prime Minister referred to the economic effect of the drastic change is largely due to the extravagance of this composite government in the last six or Not for a moment do I accept the view that, we have had difficulties, we should",194,Interstate Competition

L i the widest.sphere, that of international affairs, efforts are being directed towards the ideal of having disputes arbitrated upon by an arbitration tribunal. If that can be attempted, even in the international sphere, it is obvious that it can be achieved in the much smaller sphere embraced by flic industrial affairs of one nation. If the Commonwealth Government scrapped Arbitration Court, our. troubles industrially would merely be accentuated. I agree with that view, and consider that the reasons advanced by the right honourable gentleman hold good to-day. The Attorney-General, in the debate on the same bill, on the 21st May, 1926, after referring to the work of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, remarkedI t is out of all question to consider seriously ariti the uniformity of working conditions the suggestion that this industrial machinery should be scrapped, and all the court's awards, the result of 20 years' work, set aside, interstate disputes being left for the future to the adjudication of some at present non-existent body. It must be remembered that no single State is able to deal effectively with an interstate dispute merely by the service of a printed claim. If we wish to secure industrial peace through the medium of the law, there must be some means of dealing with these disputes on a federal basis. Therefore, tlie Government is of opinion that it is necessary to continue the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and to make certain improvements to it . Those utterances cannot be lightly dismissed by honourable members. The Government annually expends large sums of public money on various delegations, such as those sent to theInternational Labour Conference at Geneva. despatching delegations to such conferences the Government concerns itself with matters relating to international labour problems and conditions of employment. Yet it fails to exercise its industrial powers for the protection of Australian labour conditions. Judging by their utterances, one would expect the Attorney General and the Prime Minister to be the last to suggest tlie evacuation of the field of arbitration by the Commonwealth. In the last 25 years, Australian industries have forged ahead by leaps and bounds. The number of factories "" has increased from 11,945 in 1905, to 22,775 in 1927, and the number of employees from 214,589 to 464,196 during the same period. A huge industrial fabric has been built up since the inception of federal arbitration, and the industries established either on a State, or an interstate basis, would be seriously affected if this Mr 0. Riley. machinery were swept away. In my opinion, the proposed change would result in fierce interstate competition. That is not desirable. In those industries where a business has been established in one State, and is economically supplying the requirements of the whole of Australia, the there will be a temptation on the part of others to establish branches of those industries in adjoining States, largely on account of inferior conditions of employmentthat may be brought about as the result of the change. This will stir up interstate jealousy, which, happily, has now diminished to a negligible quantity, owing to the disappearance of interstate customs barriers that prevails in many federal industries. If the bill is passed, there will be an entire lack of uniformity; the conditions will be ever changing owing to the varying industrial laws of the States, and the varying duration of those awards. The Prime Minister referred to the fact that the Australian Workers Union does not avail itself of the awards of the Federal Arbitration Court in Queensland. He mentioned this matter with a view to suggesting that too much importance should not be attached to the desire for uniformity. But there is no comparison between the work of members of the Australian Workers Union and employees in manufacturing industries. The product By of the shearers, that is, the greasy wool, is not subjected to interstate competition, most of it being exported overseas, only 5 per cent, to 6 per cent, of it being manufactured in Australia. On the other hand, however, the output of our factories is for local consumption and subject to interstate competition. From time to time, the Government has said a good deal as to the necessity for law and order, but, when one examines its proposals in regard to arbitration, one is inclined to the view that, after an election, that cry ceases. It is proposed to retain the industrial machinery in order to control the maritime industries; but that change would enable the Government to deal with merely the remnant of an industry. This Government sacrificed the Commonwealth Shipping Line, and that had the effect of robbing the 1,200 employees of the benefit of Australian conditions of labour. repeal the coastal provisions of the Navi gation Act, and so to administer a severe blow to the maritime industries. Once the Commonwealth evacuates the field of arbitration, this country w ill be confronted with the same difficulties as those experienced in the early days of federation prior to the passing of the Act of 1904-5. Mr Justice Heydon, during the hearing of the clothing trades case in the New South Wales Arbitration Court said:The evidence tliat has been submitted to me in this case proves beyond any doubt that there is room for improvement in the wages and conditions of the employees in this industry, but one is forced to take into consideration the wages and conditions obtaining in the same industry in the State of Victoria. In consequence, I hesitate to concede to the employees all that I might in other circumstances. In an industry such as this there should be some form of federal adjustment of the wages and conditions. If those difficulties existed in 1905 they are bound to be accentuated by the tremendous development in the manufacturing industries, particularly the boot trade if the Government's proposals are carried. Mr Justice Heydon, dealing with the case of the boot trade employees saidWe are of the opinion that journeymen in the boot trade are skilled workers, and should receive the wage of skilled workers, and that £2 8s. is not the wage to which they are fairly entitled. . . . we should have given most of the boot trade journeymen 9s. a day, or £2 14s. a week, with a little less to the assistant stuff cutters and the lining cutters. We have wished to see our way to do this, but we have come to the conclusion that, in common fairness to the employers (that is the New South Wales employers), we cannot do it. The workers w ill be confronted with those conditions immediately they are obliged to seek awards from State tribunals. In both tbe clothing and boot trades there are unscrupulous employers. In the former particularly, sweating may return and the conditions now enjoyed by the workers w ill be broken down. The Government's proposal is extraordinary, and one is forced to seek the motive for it , in the same way the withdrawal of the prosecution of John Brown. the Government side have been at considerable pains to defame the f a i r name of Australia by exaggerating the number The Government intends to and extent of industrial disturbances. But the Attorney-General, speaking on the Arbitration B ill on the 21st May, 1926, saidWe have strikes, and some of them are serious-mor e particularly transport strikes, the effects of which are far-reaching, because they extend considerably beyond the persons immediately involved in the dispute. But other countries have their strikes and lockouts, too, and it is unfair to represent Australia as being particularly and specially afflicted by strikes. I am in accord with that statement. Those who exaggerate these troubles in order to justify their support of the bill are not good Australians. Many strikes have been more or less justified. The Attorney-General stated that the average time for which unions desiring to approach the court had to wait, had been eight months. Delays of that sort are sufficient to cause dissatisfaction and restiveness on the part of the workers. Although they have to wait the greater part of a year to have their plaints heard by the court, the employers, the rackrenters, and the sellers of the daily necessaries of life, are able to get an increased price for their commodity without any delay and without recourse to any authority such as the workers have to submit to. Those increases have to be paid by the workers, and men who are receiving the bare means of subsistence are aggravated and goaded into revolt when If our hands had been free, they have to wait a considerable time for redress from the Arbitration Court. These delays could have been minimised if the Government had seriously addressed itself to the removal of many anomalies that hinder the functioning of the court. When this measure is stripped of all pretence and veneer, one is forced to the conclusion that it is part of a well thought out plan, which has been developing since the end of the war, to break down the conditions of the workers. The Employers Federation and the Single Purpose League have openly expressed their determination to do everything within their power to destroy the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. In that endeavour they have been supported by the as we sought the motive for wealthy interests, and the Government has consistently aided them by appointing Honourable members on various investigatory bodies whose opinions would be likely to coincide w it h those of the opponents of federal arbitration. The British Economic Mission was a body of independent British business men who, on the initiative of the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference in 1926, were nominated by the British Government to report upon economic and industrial conditions in Australia. Dealing with the tariff and the Arbitration Court, the "" B i g Four"" saidWo have been strongly disposed to the view that the combined operation of the tariff and of the arbitration acts has raised costs to a level which has laid an excessive and possibly even a dangerous load upon the unsheltered primary industries much force in the oft-repeated complaint that successive increases in the tariff which affect prices and the cost of living, following upon, or being followed by, successive advances in the cost of'labour as the result of decisions under the arbitration acts have involved Australia in a vicious circle of ever ascending costs and prices, and that this condition of affairs is crippling Australia's progress and her power of supporting increased population. There lies no task before tlie Australian people more urgent than that of in some way breaking the vicious circle and of bringing down costs of production, as is being done in the other industrial countries of the world. . . . Those gentlemen gave a lead to the Prime Minister, who is disposed to take more notice of the opinion of imported experts than of the judgment of captains of industry within the Commonwealth. The report of the mission referred to the Tariff Board's annual report for the year 1925-26 :Our views have merely been strengthened by our study of the reports of . the Oommonwealth Tariff Board, who, we observe, in their report for the year 1925-26, say that they arestrongly of tlie opinion that the industrial unions of the Commonwealth should be induced to realize the critical position into which the Commonwealth is d r if t in g and the absolute necessity for preventing the wages gap from becoming still wider between the United Kingdom, the Continent of Europe and the Commonwealth. It is obvious that the minds of the Government appointees on the Tariff Board and the members of the Economic Mission were running on parallel lines. The report of the mission continuedA change in the method prevalent in Australia of dealing with industrial disputes appears to us to be essential, and we hold that there should be a minimum of judicial and governmental interference in them except in so far as matters affecting the health and safety of persons engaged in industry may be concerned. ilr. 0. Riley. Honourable members will see that these gentlemen gave a direct lead to the Prime Minister to propose the legislative changes that are contained in the bill. They urged a reduction in the cost of production, and I interpret that to mean a drastic cut in wages. It has been said ' during the debate that had the industrial proposals of 1926 been carried the Government would not be proceeding with this measure. The honourable member for WarWe have felt ringah ( Mr Parkhill) and other ministerialists have charged the Labour party with having been responsible for the defeat of the industrial powers referendum in 1926. When that honourable member and the Prime Minister were speaking, I reminded them that the opposition to the referendum proposals came not only from certain sections of the Labour movement, but also from the wealthy interests, particularly those represented by Sir Arthur Eobinson and Sir Owen Cox. Had the people conceded to this Parliament power to regulate and control corporations, it would have been possible to pass a general company law to control private companies which represent over 70 per cent, of the capital invested in Australia. During the referendum campaign, the Federal Union -that being the name of the organization, formed by the wealthy interests to oppose the Government's proposals-state d that, in an effort to get at the possibilities behind the referendum proposals, it had obtained an opinion from a very prominent Melbourne barrister, now on the Supreme Court bench. The questions asked were as to the powers of Parliament over ordinary trading companies should the trade and industry amendment be carried. Among the questions and replies were the following:(o) Could tlie Federal Parliament legislate in regard to the ordinary daily activities of all companies and corporations other than those specially excluded ?-Yes. (6) As to their methods of buying and selling?-Yes. (e) As to the percentage of rate of dividend ?-Yes. (d) As to capitalization of profits, provision of reserve funds, &c. ?-Yes.

There are 9,000 State public servants involved. From what I have read, it will be seen how difficult it is to induce the State Parliaments, with their reactionary upper houses, to provide machinery for the efficient and speedy handling of industrial matters. We should hesitate to give the State Parliaments this power, because there is the grave danger of different workers being excluded from the schedule to industrial acts. In the days when there was a wages board system in New South Wales; the clerical workers were excluded from the act, and men who were engaged in clerical occupations could not obtain redress from either the State Arbitration Court or the wages board. During the last few months the Premier of Queensland, Mr Moore, and the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bavin, have stated that either the rural worker's award will be repealed or the rural workers will be excluded from the operations of the State award. That is a very unsatisfactory position. How does the Government propose to protect the workers 'excluded from the benefits of the State Industrial Acts? I believe iu an extension of the powers of the Commonwealth, and I sincerely trust that this proposal of the Government will be defeated. I confidently believe that at the first available opportunity the electors will dismiss from office this blundering and incompetent Government. I greatly resent the methods that have been adopted by the Government to break down the opposition to the bill by compelling honourable members to remain here continuously for so long a period. I hope that honourable members opposite will display their independence and instead of being influenced by party considerations will do what is iu the best interests of the country. I trust that the motion for the second reading of the bill will be negatived and that thus the interests of the Australian workers will be protected. a.m.] I again protest emphatically against the manner in which the business of this House is being conducted. If a snap-shot could be taken of this Parliato the people it certainly would not have its powers extended. To compel honourable members to remain here continuously for 48 hours is a cruel act, the responsibility for which lies at the door of one who would appear to be drunk with power. There is no necessity for it. The House could have adjourned at 11 o'clock last night, and could have completed its business to-day in time to allow honourable members to catch their trains. I have not been able to discern any stonewalling during this debate. I sincerely hope that there will be an amendment of the Standing Orders, and that the time allowed honourable members for second-reading and other speeches will be considerably curtailed. I regard this as one of the most important measures that have been before this Parliament, mainly because it affects the greater portion of our industrial life. For that reason it deserves our grave and earnest consideration. We want industrial peace. If there is one State in Australia that has been gruelled and crucified by strikes, it is Tasmania. I listened attentively to the speech of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), and was considerably moved by his description of the sufferings of the miners who are locked out. My State is locked out for about four out of every six years. Once the cooks, the stewards, the firemen, the engineers or the waterside workers go on strike Tasmania is cut off from the mainland. bill prevent that? when passed, is put into operation immediately, I am afraid that a strike will occur and again isolate Tasmania from the mainland. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin), in his able speech, pointed out the disabilities under which Western Australia was suffering. He said that its only connection with the eastern States consisted of railway and water carriage. Tasmania has no railway to connect it with the mainland, but is dependent entirely upon water carriage. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) was also",195,Interstate Competition

I contend that that act is a millstone round the neck of Tasmania and is doing more to injure that Statethan anything else. The Navigation Act has built up the biggest monopoly in Australia, because the greater portion of its mercantile marine is owned and controlled by the Inchcape combine. Tasmania is suffering severely from lack of transport facilities to the mainland, and her semiisolated position has been brought about largely by the operation of the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act. heard the late Mr Kingston say that the United States of America protected its mercantile marine right round its coast. of the Sherman Act absolutely killed the mercantile marine of the United States of America. During the war 75 per cent, of the American troops had to be carried overseas in British vessels. We have now practically driven the Australian mercantile marine off our coast. Tasmania has had a bad spin lately. We have had a poor crop of fruit The berry fruit that has been grown is so small that it is practically unsaleable. The potato crop is rather poor and on top of that we have had the most devastating flood that has Tasmania is staggering under this load, and I believe that if a maritime strike occurs during the coming tourist season it will be a knock-out blow to that State. The introduction of this bill is exceedingly important at this time. It is a drastic and far-reaching action. If this legislation is passed and proclaimed immediately it will cause, I fear, serious industrial trouble. In any case this measure should not be put into operation until it has met with the approval of the people. A certain period should be given to allow State courts to be established, and some of them must necessarily have a semi-federal control. They must be vested with certain federal jurisdiction. I cannot see any objection to the bill being suspended until it has received the approval of the electors. I am taking this stand -solely in the interests of Tasmania. I may be called parochial or provincial, but I believe that Tasmania will prosper if industrial peace is ensured for some time to come. I blame the Government for the present industrial position. If John Brown and Holloway had been imprisoned for defying the federal law, the coal-miners lockout and the timber workers' strike would have ended in less than a week. A few months ago I helped the Attorney-General to caulk the leaks in the Arbitration Act so that the law might be administered fairly in respect of all sections of the community affected by it. Now we are suddenly asked to wipe out the Arbitration Act, and to throw the onus of arbitration on the States. I have no objection to that. I have never favoured extension of federal powers at the expense of the States. I am a federalist, but not a unificationist. . The only way that we can secure a strong national federation in Australia is by retaining the sovereign States each complete in itself, each operating within its own circuit, without transgressing or intruding upon the rights or functions of the other. I join . issue immediately with those who say that Australia can be governed better from Canberra than from the different capital cities. At one time Australia was governed from Sydney, and State after State was formed, because of the people's desire for independence. It ever occurred in Australia. would be a retrograde step to have one central authority with power to govern the whole of Australia. Tasmania is in a serious position. I frankly admit that I view with great apprehension the possibility of this measure suddenly becoming operative. I attended the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Canberra in May. I heard the Prime Minister's proposal concerning the Commonwealth Government's suggested arbitration policy, and also the reply of the State Premiers. The gentleman most emphatic in his refusal to accede to the request of the Prime Minister was the Premier of Victoria( Sir William McPherson), who even before this measure has passed its second reading stage is asking that even if it is passed it shall not become operative"" until the 30th December, 1930.",200,Interstate Competition

Under our arbitration system we have been building up fornearly a quarter of a century two big armed camps-organize d labour on one side and the employers on the other. When we consider the Government's action in this connection I am reminded of an able article written by a German military officer who had toured India, and who, after describing the racial hatred which existed in that country, said that Great Britain had acted as umpire so long between the conflicting interests there that if her influence were suddenly removed, Moslems and Hindoos would, be at each others throats within a week. Although two great armed camps have been built up in Australia during the period I have mentioned, we are now asked without the slightest warning to sweep away the authority which has controlled them. It is not safe -to follow the course proposed by . the gentleman. It is exceedingly dangerous to the State which I represent. The section of industrialists who are to remain under federal jurisdiction is responsible for 95 per cent, of the strikes which have led to Tasmania's isolation. If any of the maritime organizations object to this measure coming into force they will take immediate action. If only 16 marine cooks-suc h as those who refused to work some months ago-decid e to disregard the award of the MaritimeI n dustries Court, Tasmania will again be isolated from the mainland. As a representative of TasmaniaI cannot incur that risk. While I intend to support the second reading of. the bill to enable it to reach the committee stage, I shall assist those who are endeavouring to postpone its proclamation until it has been fully considered and by doing so to avert the danger of an industrial upheaval. This is not a party question, but it is one in which the political, industrial, and even the social interests are vitally involved.

The object of the bill may be as the honourable member suggests, but the circumstances in which it has been introduced do not support that view. I know nothing that would tend more to ensure a period of industrial peace than the withholding of the proclamation of this measure until it has been referred to the electors for their decision. Such a course would give Tasmania practically two and a half years of exemption from industrial disputes, and I would willingly do almost anything politically to give Tasmania such an exemption.

That is all right in theory, but is unfortunate in practice. The system of semi-mass production in Sydney and Melbourne has the means of practically smashing Tasmanian industries. customers of the big Melbourne manufacturers are the Tasmanians, and particularly those in that portion of the State represented by the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell). We have been told that it would be of great advantage if men, say in the boot trade, in all parts of Australia were paid the same wage. But there is a reverse side to the picture. The larger States, such as New South Wales and Victoria, with the aid of a high protective tariff, have built up large and important industries on a mass production basis, and their methods have made it practically impossible for smaller manufactories in other States to compete with them. ber suggest that the workers of the smaller tent, some may say: States should accept lower wages ? from the smaller States are drifting more wholly from that of my own State. and more into the already overcrowded cities of Melbourne and Sydney.

One of the worse things that could happen to Australia, and to its industry, is the creation of these so-called mergers, which are simply combines. Assisted by the protective walls of a high tariff, they are able to kill competition and to have the public and the worker alike at their mercy.

The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) made a passionate plea on behalf of his miners, and I am greatly in sympathy with him. He has pleaded eloquently on behalf of men who have been two or three months out of work. But I have seen men who have worked for twelve months, gather their harvest, and then have to cast it into the sea because the State of Tasmania has been deprived of its sea transport. No sugar has been available in Tasmania, although, on the Sydney wharf, thousands of tons awaited transport. Surely there is not an employer, an employee or a member of Parliament, either State cr Pederal, who is not prepared to do something to prevent that, happening again. I believe that the best way to secure industrial peace, pending the time when the measure can be put into complete operation, is to suspend its activities until it has received exhaustive consideration.

The questions placed before the electors at the referendum should be simply whether they favour, on the one hand, a purified Pederal Arbitration Act, or, on the other, the State courts. I notice that the Premier of Queensland ( Mr A. E. Moore) has initiated an intensely practical idea: that all the State Premiers should meet and formulate a common rule to govern the courts which are to be established by the States. Let us have those amalgamated State courts, and let us submit the proposal to the people. I am prepared to abide by the result. I did in the matter of the State debts.

We are now within a few months of the time when, by some devilish device, the usual strike will occur to disrupt Tasmania's tourist traffic, and to interfere with the marketing of her fruit crop. I am not prepared to risk an industrial upheaval merely for the sake of rushing this bill through Parliament, before full time has been allowed for its consideration. To me, industrial peace in my State means more than any political party. Let us take counsel together on this matter. There has never been any industrial question before any Parliament, State or Pederal, which has caused such .uneasiness in the minds of trade unionists as this one has. I have never been able to subscribe to the view that the rank and file in the Labour movement are opposed to the wishes of their leaders. those leaders would not be in office very long. but iu order to secure two or two and a half years immunity from industrial trouble in my StateI am prepared to go a long way in the taking .of political risks. This subject has heen discussed from every angle, and there is little left for me to add. I shall endeavour, however, in the course of my remarks to throw some new light upon the motives which, I think, have actuated the Government in bringing this measure forward. Before embarking upon that phase of the subject, however, I wish to make some reference to the last speaker, and particularly to the suggestion that the States should be afforded an opportunity of putting into operation machinery to take the place of the existing federal industrial legislation. time to put it into motion. member asked for time in which the States might get the necessary legislation ready. That sounds very well, but if the honourable member possesses the political acumen with which his long experience should have provided him, he must have been talking with his tongue in his cheek. He must know that in five States out of the six comprising the Commonwealth there is a leg-rope upon the popular branch of the legislature-namely , a legislative council. He must know that those legislative councils will oppose any proposed legislation designed to give the workers an opportunity of justifying their claims to be treated as human beings, as they have been under the present system of federal arbitration. It is true that if arbitration is scrapped now it will be restored by a future Labour government, and it is inevitable that, in the course of time, a Labour government will again bo in power in the federal sphere. The system of federal arbitration is no new thing. It is a natural development of our social and industrial life. After 25 years' experience, however, there are still in this country, and in the House, some who would wish tOi see Australia back to pre-Pederation conditions. The honourable If they were, Call it cowardice if you will, spoke of the doings of conferences of State Premiers. I remember that at such a conference, held many years ago, it was decided by the Premiers of the six States that uniform action should be taken regarding six different matters, but such action was never taken. By means of these conferences they sought to achieve something which only a supreme federal parliament can properly achieve. Throughout Australia to-day conferences are being held between the heads of different institutions for the purpose of achieving uniformity of action throughout the whole Commonwealth. Yet, there is no one on the Government side with sufficient courage to tell the people that the natural corollary of such events is to invest this Federal Parliament with supreme legislative power throughout the whole of Australia. It is a case of "" pull devil, pull baker "" between the six States in an endeavour to determine I did not ask for which shall fare best at the expense of the others. Every year there takes place a transference of high Government officers from the administration of one State to that of another. Some time ago we in South Australia took Mr Bellamy, an hydraulic engineer* from Tasmania. We, in our turn, lost a civil engineer, Mr Veale, to Victoria or New South Wales, I forget which.

The honourable member for Eranklin knows very well that what be advocates would put back the clock a long way. In pre-arbitration days sweating conditions prevailed in many of the industries in South Australia under the old go-as-you-please system. I could tell stories of the heartless exploitation of men and women who received no protection under the law. I was a part of the system then, and I know what it was like. When the Labour party grew powerful enough in South Australia to be reckoned with, and to press for the introduction of ameliorative legislation, there was still the opposition of the Legisanother meeting, and decided to submit a lative Council to overcome. The Labour party was faced with the opposition of the Liberal party, the same party that, in the federal sphere, is now called the Nationalist party. Why it is so called, I do not know, except that the name was bestowed upon it by its founder, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr chairman of the board had been appointed Hughes). It would more fittingly be called the Conservative party. As a result of -the pressure brought to bear by the Labour party in South Australia, a system of wages boards was eventually established there. I have had experience of them, having sat upon one for some time. When the legislation providing for the establishment of these boards was introduced, the Legislative Council insisted that they should only be appointed to deal with such industries as Parliament agreed they should apply to. This meant agreement by both Houses. It was further stipulated that the provisions should have force only within a radius of ten miles of the city of Adelaide, the only exception being that Gawler was included. A long time elapsed before the system was extended throughout the whole State. Another provision was that the boards should not fix any wage, no matter what the workers' ability, higher than that paid by "" a reputable employer "" in South Australia. The word ""reputable"" was torn to shreds. Wages boards.were not allowed to make awards which prescribed higher rates of pay than those operating in Victoria. It was also provided that a man appointed a member of a wages board had to be actively engaged in the indusMr Yates. try for at least three months prior to his appointment. That meant that no one but an active worker in the industry could be appointed to the board. In other words, the man had to face his boss across the table. I had that experience. The representatives of the employees submitted a log of wages which they considered reasonable. The increases sought were not staggering; but we knew that they would not be accepted without question. The employers also submitted a log. The chairman said that he would not split differences; either one log or the other would be accepted in its entirety. The employees' representatives held new log which embodied the Victorian rates for the industry. The case concerned hardware assistants, the nature of whose work was the same in South Australia as in Victoria. The bosses asked for a rate 2s. 6d. a week lower. The by the Government because the parties to the dispute could not agree on the appointment of a chairman. The decision of the chairman was in favour of the log submitted by the bosses. When I asked him by what process of reasoning he had arrived at that decision, he replied that he had given his judgment as a man of the world. I do not know what he intended to convey; but he gave no reasons for his decision. I mention this experience particularly for the benefit of the honorliams) who said that the States should get ready for the transition period. We shall get very little from the States; and what we do get will not bring about uniformity. There will still be overlapping, and variations in the margin for skill, if the control of industry is to be left to State tribunals, in which the influence of the Legislative Councils will predominate, then all I can say is "" God help the workers."" Another effort should be made to obtain for the Commonwealth the power that it should have, and I feel sure that if an appeal were made for that power the people would grant it. It is time that we owned up that the. logical result of federation is unification. The remarks on this bill have been many and varied. By some speakers the Government has been roundly condemned,",205,Interstate Competition
498,Able Member For Eranklin ( Mr Mcwil,"but so far, it has not answered the charges made against it. Although the speech of the right honourable gentleman for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) did not contain the sound reasoning of some of the other speeches that had been delivered, it contained one great truth. The right honourable gentleman said that the Government's proposals so staggered the electors, that they would reject them if given the opporwithdrawal of the prosecution. tunity. I am convinced that the right honourable member was right in that statement. Another great truth was expressed by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) who said that the Government's proposal came as a bolt from the blue, not only to the Nationalist Party, but also to the people of. the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) stripped the Government naked in regard to this bill. We are told that its passing will reduce the cost of production. If the honourable member for Fawkner was cross-examining a witness who made a statement like that, his next interrogation would be"" How will it reduce costs?"" I ask how this bill will reduce costs if wages are not to come down ? The onus of showing how production costs can be decreased without a reduction of wages rests on the Government. The Prime Minister, addressing the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney, said that overhead costs should be reduced. He urged greater standardization and more mergers. There is nothing illogical in what he said. He was really recommending something along the lines of the One Big Union. If unification is good for industry, it is good for the Commonwealth; but, in adopting it, we should not isolate ourselves from the heart of the Commonwealth and try to govern this country from a spot in the wilderness. Dealing with the withdrawal of the prosecution against Mr John Brown, the honourable member for Fawkner said that, while he could not justify the Government's action, he would not vote for the motion of censure because he was satisfied that the Prime Minister's motive was pure. The honourable member also condemned the Government in respect of the measure now before us; but he did not say one word about the motive underlying its introduction. the gravamen of the charge was that the Prime Minister's motive was dishonourable. I could not endorse that. justified his action in supporting the Government by saying that he believed it was actuated by right motives. I merely said that I could not support the Opposition in alleging a dishonourable motive for the act. for Fawkner will agree that, when a case in the court has to be determined, not on known facts, but on the circumstances connected with it, one of the first things is to seek the motive. In the absence of a motive, and where the facts are not known, it is difficult to get a conviction on a serious charge. I expected the honourable member to seek the motive underlying the introduction of this measure. He said that the Government had no mandate to bring forward such legislation; that the Nationalist party's platform provided for arbitration; that""neither prior to nor dui'ing the election campaign had any intimation been given to the electors that such a proposal would be brought forward. He stripped the Government bare of everything, and yet he did not pursue his reasoning to the point of asking for the motive. this case what the motive is. to the people of this country. propose to vote against the Government because I think it has acted wrongly.

But that is very poor reasoning; it certainly does not justify removing from 750,000 people the protection which they now enjoy. The Prime Minister showed clearly, though he did not actually declare, the real object of the Government in introducing this bill. Nearly half of his speech had to do with financial affairs, and it might have been delivered more appropriately in a budget debate than in a debate on arbitration. The right honourable gentleman saidThe Government believes that the existing financial and economic position of Australia renders necessary a measure of this kind, and that the bill is a real contribution towards the solution of the economic problems confronting us.

In the opinion of the Government, industry is embarrassed because the worker of to-day is not in quite the same position as the slave of yesterday. The employers desire to revive the old policy of piece-work, which enabled them to press every ounce of energy out of their young, strong and vigorous employees. Some of the men with whom I worked 40 years ago under the piece-work system are to-day in a pitiful plight now that they are old men. get back to. the old policy of "" Eafferty rules.""

I shall quote Mr Wickens merchandise. The Prime Minister went on to sayIn 1013, the year before the Great War, Australia's production was valued at f221,000,000. Taxation that year amounted only to £23,000,000 or 10.4 per cent, of the value of for 1926-27 production. In 1927-28 the value of production had inindustries.

Let us take first the value of their production. The total already produce too much. I tion combined was estimated at £114,600,000, compared with £446,900,000, or £73 per head population, in 1920-27.

This ratio, of course, differs in different for 1901. In dairying and in forestry and fisheries the ratio approached five, and in it exceeded five. In mining, The those returns manufacturing value represents the value added in process of manufacture; was that is to say, it is the value of output less the the various branches of industry has increased manufacturing the largest. pastoral industry occupied the position of chief producing agency, and was usually responsible for some 30 per eent. of the total value of Australia's primary and manufacturing production. From 1921 onwards, however, the manufacturing industry has assumed the lead, and now represents more than a third of the total. That is an absolute contradiction of most of the arguments advanced by the section represented by honourable members opposite, which always complains that the workers "" go slow"" and that production costs are too high. The facts that I have adduced lead me to ask what justification can be found for the bill. Mr Wickens also dealt with the agricultural industry, and I shall quote sufficient to show that the Prime Minister's remarks were not in accord with the facts regarding activities in our primary and secondary industries. Speaking of wheat, Mr Wickens saidIn the last eight years of the last century the average production' of wheat per annum was 31,000,000 bushels, and the maximum for any one year 41,000,000 bushels. In the last eight years of the present century the average yield per annum was 133,000,000 bushels and the maximum 105,000,000, approximately a fourfold increase in quantity in each case. The records of this country read like a fairy tale; but, when the party opposite sets out to attack the working classes, statements are made that are not borne out by the facts. Mr Wickens referred to sheep in these termsDuring the ten years from the season 1916-17 to the season 1926-27 the total quantity of wool produced per annum increased from 630,000,000 lb. of greasy wool to 924,000,000, but slipped back in 1927-28 to about 900,000,000. A tentative estimate for tire season 1928-29 is 950,000,000, which, if correct, is the record wool production for Australia. The Prime Minister has made specious misrepresentations of the facts in an attempt to justify the scrapping of our arbitration machinery. Regarding cattle, Mr Wickens statedA peak of over 12,500,000 cattle had been reached in 1894, followed by a persistent decline to 7,000,000 in 1902, a rise to 11,750,000 in 1911, a decline to 1.0,000,000 in 1915, succeeded by a rise in 1921 to 14,500,000, the highest cattle figures ever recorded. Since this latter date there has been a continuous decline until the latest figures indicate a total of no more than 11,500,000. This latter decline is due to a large extent to tlie relatively character of cattle raising in some .pastoral areas in recent times, owing to the unsatisfactory state of the oversea market. Mr Yates. Unti l 1019 the Again, I say that any unsatisfactory conditions that may give cause for comment are not due to any "" go slow "" movement, to short hours, or to high wages. The Statistician goes on to sayI n what may be termed the dairy and farm.yard group of industries we have again a predominant item. This time it is butter, and the position whicli it occupies is an important one, representing as it does some 40 per cent, of the total value of the output of the group, and amounting in 1926-27 to nearly £20,000,000. Eggs and poultry have a wholesale value of upwards of £10,000,000 per annum, and milk consumed as such of upwards of £7,000,000. In 1901 the total production of ibutter in Australia was 103,750,000 lb., and for the year 1927-28 it has increased to 280,000,000 lb. Cheese, concentrated milk, bacon, ham, and pork are other increasingly prominent items in the dairying branch of production. The production of cheese increased during the period under review from 11,000,000 Ib. to 26,000,000, and ham and bacon from 32,000,000 lb. to 73,000,000. Mr Wickens proceeded to deal with the manufacturing industries. He went over the whole gamut of production before delegates who would understand the significance of the figures he quoted, and in the face of those statistics I cannot understand why the Prime Minister should be such a dismal Jeremiah. The right honourable gentleman said that "" the passing of this legislation will free industry from many of the embarrassments it has suffered in the past."" Mr Wickens, to the Peace in Industry Conference saidComing next, to tlie manufacturing industries, we have a much more pleasing story of growth. D e a l in g w it h the wages in the secondary industries he s a i d In the matter of salaries and wages of employees, the total paid in 1907 was £18,300,000, and in 1926-27, £90,600,000, representing about £78 each in 1907 per annum and £202 each in 1920-27. Tliose wages represented on the average about 55 per cent, of the value added to raw materials in the process of manufacture. In other words nearly half the added value was available to pay the cost of rent, fuel, light, and miscellaneous expenses, and profit. Mr Wickens continuedThis added value increased from £33,000,000 in 1907 to £162,000,000 in 1926-27, or allowing for change in prico levels, by about 180 unprofitable per cent. We have thus, on all hands, evidence Australian of a remarkable increase in manufacturing industry during the twenty years for which comparable data are available. I turn now to an important passage in this illuminating lectureComparing from different dates the esing his slaves he is more than justified, timates of Australian private wealth referred to earlier, it is of interest to note that the because he is driven to do so by desperaestimate of 1903 gave an average per head of tion while the ruthless employer acts in population of £252, that of 1915, £327, that of cold blood.

512,Mr Yates,"I quite understand thatThe honourable member's time has expired. During the 44 hours of debate on this measure the industrial position of the Commonwealth has been considered from every angle. Whilst the case for and against the bill has been stated with a good deal of eloquence and occasionally with vehemence, the debate has been conducted with remarkable good temper, having regard to the circumstances of this sitting. One cannot deal with the matter as he would wish to do without repeating what has been said by other debaters. I have no desire to occupy a great deal of -time at this hour of the morning, but my constitutents will expect from me a statement of my reasons for supporting the measure. The Commonwealth system of conciliation aud arbitration has been in operation for about 25 years and nobody can deny that it has had a fair trial. Because the Government and honourable members supporting it spoke in favour of the amending, arbitration act last year, and are now about to vote for the abolition of the federal arbitration system, it is unfair to charge them with inconsistency. Circumstances have arisen during this year which compel us to realize that this Parliament has no alternative but to repeal the Arbitration Act which has given satisfaction to neither employers nor employees and has been defied openly by one side and to a lesser extent by the other. Those honourable members on the ministerial side who have declared that the Government has no mandate for the introduction of this bill overlook what has happened during the last twelve months and the attitude of the unions and their leaders towards the arbitration court. Prior to the award in the timber workers' case the court had never reduced wages or increased the working hours. When that occurred the prophecies of many, who claimed to understand the attitude of the workers, that as soon as the court refused them what they demanded they would flout its awards, were verified. First, the union went on strike in defiance of the court; next, other unions rallied to the support of the strikers, and then the labour leaders throughout Australia endorsed that attitude of oppostion to and defiance of the court. In fact a general boycott of the court was established. The leaders of unionism in Australia have advised their followers tb defy the court. Many instances of this have been given by other speakers during the debate, but I will confine myself to one. On the 9th February this year 30 of tbe federated unions after the three days' conference at Melbourne unanimously passed the following resolution:. That all unions now before the Federal Arbitration Court bo urged not to proceed with their plaints or to appear before the court officially. Herein we have a deliberate boycott of the court organized by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions with the avowed intention of compelling the judiciary to enforce a 44-hours' week. It was frankly claimed by the union leaders responsible for the resolution that if all the unions agreed to the course a death-blow would be dealt to arbitration. No Government who allowed such a position to continue would be entitled to the respect and confidence of the country. In addition to the open defiance of the court, men who are willing to work under the award of the court were maltreated. The Stateswere either unable or unwilling to protect them. When a law is made specifically to protect certain people, and they defy it, if we are powerless to enforce it we should abolish the law. member suggest that, under this bill, the Commonwealth will be in a position to enforce an award of the proposed committees ? the present arbitration law the Government proposes to set up what are called industrial committees, to deal with maritime industries. According to the Attorney-General, the Commonwealth has full powers with regard to trade and commerce. Some honourable members have asked why other industries cannot be similarly dealt with. The reason advanced by the Attorney-General is that they cannot be dealt with under the trade and commerce powers."" Under the trade and commerce powers which the Commonwealth now possesses, it can enforce the awards made by these maritime industrial committees. The honourable member for Fawkner suggests that the Commonwealth is powerless to enforce awards. I draw",211,Interstate Competition

516,Mr Bell,"In addition to repealingattention to what happened during the last strike in the maritime industry. The Commonwealth then took action which settled that strike in a majority of the ports of the Commonwealth within a fortnight. I have never been satisfied that the present system is a good one. It is cumbersome, slow in operation, and costly, and has promoted strife rather than peace. Some honourable members opposite have said that it costs unions many thousands of pounds to have their cases heard, and they complain that it will cost them many more thousands if they have to approach a State tribunal. Court should not be so costly. We want a simplified procedure. If the system has -become unworkable, ancl we are powerless to institute a better one because of our constitutional limitations, the Commonwealth should vacate this field. Having reached the stage that neither side wants it and both sides defy it, the Government would not deserve the support of any section of the people if it did not take action such as that now proposed. During the course of the debate the hon-' liams) made certain statements with respect to the effect of strikes on Tasmania. I regret that I feel impelled to correct him in certain respects, because Tasmanian members have the reputation of speaking with one voice regarding matters that affect' their State. agree that Tasmania has suffered tremendously as a result of strikes on the mainland, because it is dependent entirely on transport by sea; but I remind my honourable friend that for years we have not had a strike which affected Tasmania to any great extent, because of the firm action taken by this Government against those who were holding up the transport service between the mainland and Tasmania. The honourable member for Franklin that although he intends to vote for the second reading of this measure he will support any amendment to postpone its operation until"" the people have an opportunity of being consulted either by referendum or election. It is his right and privilege to vote as he thinks fit,' but I cannot see eye to eye with him. He says that he will do anything to help Tasmania. I represent a Tasmanian constituency and I would go as far as the honourable member in helping to assist that State to progress by improving the transport facilities to the mainland, but I fail to see how Tasmania is to be assisted or strikes prevented by deferring the operation of this legislation for two years. Every strike that has occurred has been in defiance of an Arbitration Court award. I , therefore, cannot understand the argument of the honourable member for Franklin that we The Commonwealth shall assist Tasmania by continuing the present system of arbitration. The honourable member said that the' industries on the mainland benefit to the detriment of industries of Tasmania. He made a statement that I am bound to contradict. He is unfair to Tasmania when he says that there is practically no industry operating to-day in the State because of the operation of awards and the luring of its workers to the mainland. It is not often that I quote figures, but under the circumstances, let me say, that in 1902, there were 420 factories in Tasmania employing 7,466 hands; in 1909, 544 factories, employing 9,322 hands; and in 1927, 767 factories employing 11,694 hands. According to those figures the position of Tasmania in regard to its industrial activities, is not, as the honourable member for Franklin has stated, gradually I becoming worse. As a matter of fact there has been a steady increase iu both the number of factories and employees. During the last two years the position of Tasmania has improved tremendously. Our exports, both primary products and manufactories, have increased. I do not. give the figures showing the progress of our primary and mining industries, for I take it that the honourable member for said that practically every factory of importance had closed down, excluded the mining industry. We have in Tasmania -a wonderful industry in the Electrolytic Zinc Works, which employs some thousands of hands in Hobart' and on the west coast of Tasmania. The industry has progressed steadily for years. In my own electorate there is, as well as the Electrolytic Zinc mining fields, the Mount Lyell Company, the only",212,Interstate Competition

The enterprise has been a success only because of its efficient management and the fine type of employee at the mines. It was able to continue its operations even when the price of copper fell to £60 a ton. The only valid argument in support of a Federal arbitration system is the necessity for uniformity of awards. ""We know now that that is practically impossible of achievement, because the Federal Arbitration Court has no power to insist upon it. One serious difficulty is that only those who are cited before the court come within the ambit of its awards. I should like to' see Australia return to the conditions when a certain amount of collective bargaining took place between those engaged in industry. were .then more satisfied with' their wages and conditions of employment, but unfortunately compelled by the union to which they belonged to go on strike because of some little dissatisfaction in one of the other States. That happened in the case of a strike of the waterside workers. The dispute arose over a trivial question concerning the pick-up, and as a result an attempt was made to hold up the whole of the shipping of Australia. In that case, fortunately, the dispute did not extend to Tasmania. continued on the wharves in Tasmania, and when the men were called out they refused to cease work and continued to handle the products of Tasmania. Because of that strike on the mainland, thousands of men were thrown out of employment in other industries, though satisfied with their conditions. If the effect of the establishment of a common rule is to compel men who are willing to work, to throw down their tools and bring about chaos in industry, then I prefer control of industry by the States instead of by the Commonwealth. ago there was a strike of timber workers on the mainland. workers in Tasmania were perfectly satisfied with their conditions and they continued to work until such time as the labourers on the mainland refused to handle Tasmanian timber. consequence, the mills had to close down. Isolation is sometimes a good thing for a Mr Bell. country. The isolation of Tasmania prevents the poison that is manufactured on the mainland from being instilled into the minds of the workers. I am a great believer in the law of compensation, and the compensation for the isolation of the workers on the West Coast is that they are separated from the influence of labour leaders on the mainland. During this.debate much has been said about the number of strikes that have taken place in Australia and the number of working days lost as a result. I do not intend to compare the position of Australia with that of Canada or any other country as has been done by other speakers because that does not affect my argument. Strikes have taken place' The workmen in Australia despite the favorable conditions of employment and the existence of tribunals established for the settlethey have been ment of disputes. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was speaking on this bill I interjected that unemployexisting, ment in Australia was mainly caused by strikes. Unemployment is the direct result of strikes, which cause a lack of confidence on the part of those who control capital. As the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) has truly said, there would be plenty of capital available for enterprise in this Work country if those who control it had a reasonable assurance that conditions of employment would remain unaltered. Unfortunately there is no such assurance. There is no guarantee of any security; those wishing to invest capital in industry are always faced with the possibility of operations being suddenly suspended. If they were perfectly Australia is to prosper and our people are to be successful, the investment of capital to enable our industries to be developed should be facilitated. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) referred to the prevalence of unemployment which he inferred was Not long largely due to the maladministration of the Government. The unemployment has The timber been caused mainly by a succession of strikes which have affected employment in not only the industry particularly concerned, but also those dependent upon it for supplies. It is true that we will As a always have unemployment in varying degrees; that must be expected as our prosperity is governed largely by seasonal and other conditions. A l though production has not been satisfactory during the last year or two, the general conditions are such that the number of unemployed in Australia at present should be considerably less than it is. I admit that some employers adopt an unreasonable attitude which has the effect of disturbing the industrial balance, but the main cause of a good deal of the unemployment which prevails must rest with the representatives of organized labour, who very unwisely direct the men to disregard the award of a tribunal which was brought into existence for their protection. It is idle to repeat that when wages are inflated the cost of living increases in many cases out of proportion to the higher rates. No one is foolish enough to think that industry will produce more than is put into it. What is needed in Australia to-day is that a little more of the sweet spirit of reasonableness should be displayed by all engaged in industry. The employers' interests have to be protected and the rights and privileges of the employees, without whose assistance industry cannot prosper, should be safeguarded. If the employers will provide reasonable working conditions and the employees will give an honest day's work for the money the court awards, production will increase and peace in industry will be assured. It is the selfishness of both the employer and the employee that causes many of the difficulties with which we are confronted to-day. I support the proposal which the Government has somewhat unexpectedly submitted, but which I am sure will meet with the approval of not only its supporters in Parliament, but the people generally. In the ordinary course of events, it will be a little over two years before we drastic step without consulting the elechave to again face the electors, and when that period has elapsed I believe that the conditions in industry in Australia will be such that the action of those who are supporting the Government will be fully justified. sire to associate myself with the protest uttered by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) against the action of the Government in compelling honourable members to work unreasonable hours to discuss a measure of great national importance. It has been claimed by many honourable members opposite that the Government has received a mandate for the bill now before the chamber, but I am convinced that whatever interpretation is placed upon the remarks of the Prime Minister in opening the political campaign prior to the last elections, it cannot Be suggested that he even hinted at the abolition of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The Prime Minister has said that the cost of production must be reduced, but he has not given the slightest indication of how that can be done. Apparently the only way to achieve his objective is to lower wages. Last night the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) practically apologized for the present high standard of living in Australia. I am proud that our standard is higher than it is in many other civilized countries, and I shall use every power at my disposal to prevent the workers in this country from being compelled to work under conditions less favorable than those which now prevail. During the debate statesmen such as Barton, Deakin, Kingston and Higgins. have been mentioned, all of whom studied the question of the Commonwealth powers and responsibilities from every viewpoint. The utterances of these and other eminent men which have been quoted, suggest that, in their day, it was never contemplated that any Government would legislate in this way. The honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) strongly criticized the Government for taking this tors, and said -that the Prime Minister had "" stolen a march"" upon the people. In my opinion, the Government and the Prime Minister are synonymous terms. The right honourable member for North Sydney, who has seen our arbitration system develop to its present stage, has said that the Prime Minister had been recreant to his trust; that he had betrayed the people and that he was now submitting a reactionary and craven policy. I regard the measure as a pusillanimous piece of political perfidy. On",213,Interstate Competition

Shortly afterwards a bait labelled "" Commonwealth Minister hoped that honourable members Treasurer "" was dangled before him, and, would consider the matter in a non-party metaphorically speaking, he swallowed spirit; from a national point of view. hook, line, bait and sinker. I admire Until quite recently he was a believer in . Mr Jones. ( Mr Stewart) for relinquishing office Then the honourable memHe, too, was taken into the fold. The Now let us examine the courage of the When the waterside workers broke the law, they were gloriously when John Brown, the coal baron, broke The honourable member for Wimvernment, gave a resume of the bungling In his second-reading speech the Prime coercion in industrial matters. But he made the statement in connection with this proposal, thatWe have come to the conclusion, as a result agree to a conference under threat of of recent experience, that we cannot prevent strikes and lockouts hy the provision and infliction of penalties. And immediately his followers changed step and fell in behind him. The Prime Minister used coercion on his followers. He told them, in effect, that if this measure is not carried, the only alternative is the holding of a general election. He is neither consistent nor courageous. Now let me examine the so-called cowardice of honourable members on this side of the chamber. They, urge the prosecution of John Brown, and even censure the Government for withdrawing it. They stand for human rights, the rights of the miners working in the mines, and of their wives and children. Oan that be classified as cowardice? Honourable members on this side are opposed to the reduction of existing awards and to an increase of hours. moral degradation and economic degeneration. So that the Treasurer is unable to substantiate his charges of cowardice. The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) stated that federal arbitration should be abolished because its awards were totally ignored by one side, and partly disobeyed by the other. That is not a fair, statement of the position. I can remember, some years ago, that when there was trouble in the mines owned by John Brown, that individual said, in effect, to the miners, "" Very well, I can close down the mines and sit back. I know who will starve first."" Should a man who adopts such a truculent and unworthy attitude be allowed to continue the ownership of those mines ? Should he be allowed to continue arrogantly and flagrantly defying the law? A strong, courageous leader would not countenance the continuance of such a state of affairs. When I spoke on the censure motion dealing with the withdrawal of the prosecution against John Brown, I instanced the strong action that was taken by the late President Boosevelt, of the United States of America, when he satisfactorily settled the great coal strike which occurred in that country in 1902. After a great deal of trouble, President Roosevelt got the parties together. The men were out on strike for higher wages, but he induced both parties to carrying into effect some drastic proposals if they refused. The arbitration commission was formed, and both sides to the dispute were bound to abide by its decision. In the meantime the men went back to work. Contrast that with the situation existing during the present lockout on the New South Wales coal-fields. There is a commission sitting, it is true, but neither side is bound to accept its decision. In fact, the miners have already said that they will not hold themselves bound by any decision arrived at, and they are, I think, justified in adopting that attitude. Here is a report of the proceedings of the commission when the parties were discussing whether or not the owners' books should be produced. Mr Justice Davidson said: ""Nobody has the right to know how much it costs a colliery company to mine coal or how much profit a They stand against company is making."" Seeing that the miners' rates of pay are based upon the profits derived from the coal mines, it is of vital importance that they should know what those profits are. John Brown is still flagrantly defying the law, the miners are still out of work, and their wives and families are suffering. If we had a man here with the resolution and ability of President Roosevelt, such a condition of affairs would not be allowed. If the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) were at the helm this trouble would have been settled long ago. Exception was taken to his actions while he was in oflice, but at least he obtained results, and that is more than can be said of the present administration. As the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) truly said this afternoon, industrial legislation in Australia has been bungled. Not long ago we were told by members of the Government that the rank and file of the unions were bossed by the union officials, and that legislation was necessary to give the rank and file control of their organizations. Amendments were made in the Arbitration Act to ensure this being done. Further industrial trouble occurred shortly afterwards. The union officials gave instructions to the men tliat they were to go back to work, but tbe men refused. Then the Government said that the union officials did not have proper control over the rank and file, and that it was necessary to pass legislation which would give them that control. Workers Act was passed. That is a glaring instance of the legislative bungling perpetrated by this Government in connection with arbitration. only bungled arbitration, but has failed in every other sphere of activity as well. Customs was right when he said that the present Treasurer was the most tragic Australia had ever had. When this Government took office there was a surplus of £7,400,000; to-day there is a deficit of £5,000,000. It has been truly said of the Treasurer that he may be a good surgeon, but that, as a Treasurer, he would bleed Australia white. In the Pederal Arbitration Court there are registered 143 unions with a membership of 764,000, and of these 407,000 are working under awards. Twenty-eight employers' organizations are registered in the court, and there are 16,400 employees of these organizatons. No one on either side of the House contends that our arbitration system is free from defects. It remains true, however, that the great mass of workers registered in the Court are working amicably in accordance with the terms of their awards. Yeti t is proposed to scrap this tribunal in favour of something that may be set up by the States. If this is done those unions which are now organized on a federal basis will be disintegrated. At the same time that the Government proposes to do this, it is encouraging the formation of big business mergers. If the working classes are to meet these mergers on a basis of equality, they must be organized on a federal basis. Some of these mergers are not only federal but international in character. The honourable member who preceded me referred to the timber workers' dispute. He admitted that he did not know a great deal about it. At any rate, when I asked percentage him a question relating to the dispute he did not answer it and I assumed that he did not know very much about the subject. -It is true that the timber workers did in a small town are engaged in Sir. Jones. disobey an award of the Eederal Arbitration Court because they considered that award unjust. How was that award arrived at ? When the Arbitration Act was last amended a clause was inserted to the Accordingly the Transport effect that before any new award was made, or existing award varied, the economic effect of such new award or such variation of an existing award should be taken into account. An effort was made The Government has not to give effect to this clause when considering the timber workers' award, and an inquiry was alleged to have been made The Minister for into the books of firms engaged in the timber industry. We were told that the books of only ten firms were examined by an accountant, although there are over 1,000 firms engaged .in the industry. On the strength of that examination it was alleged that a profit of only 2.2 per cent, was being made by the employers, and as a result the working week was lengthened, and wages in some cases reduced. city workers. Most of the mills are in the country. Judge Lukin provided a wage' of £3 a week for bush boys of 19 years of age. If the honourable member has had any experience of the bush he must know that the average bush boy of 19 years of age is a big, hefty fellow, physically as good as he will ever be. Yet his wage is fixed at £3 a week. What would the average employer do if he received an application for a job from such a bush boy, and from a middle-aged married man with a wife and family to support. He would have to pay much more than £3 a week to the married applicant, so it is only natural that he would give the job to the boy. The workers allege that the inquiry into the profits of the timber industry was not a fair one because the books of only ten firms were examined, and the names of those firms were kept secret. Does any honourable member contend that a fair estimate of the average profits of an industry can be arrived at by examining the books of ten firms out of a total of 1,000? of the total turn-over represented by the business of those ten firms. cut-throat competition to secure trade, and",215,Interstate Competition

During 1928-29 only 17,000 come. In the Victorian Parliament recently a question was asked regarding the cost of providing police protection on the water-front. The answer was such as to make one think. Peace will not be secured by such means. As soon as the police protection has been removed the eruption will come. The Prime Minister said that his Government had come to the conclusion, as a result of recent experience, that it could not prevent strikes and lockouts by the provision and infliction of penalties. learned the lesson which history teaches -namely , that coercion has never been conducive to industrial peace. It never will be. The way in which the minds of honourable members supporting the Government change with every change of the Prime Minister's mind leads me to adapt the well-known lines of Shakespeare to make them readWhy, man, he doth bestride the Commonwealth wanting. Like a Colossus; and they, petty men, Walk under his huge legs, and peep about To find themselves dishonourable graves. I speak, of course, in a political sense only Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our P.M. feed, That he is grown so great? Honourable members opposite say that peace and prosperity in industry can only be maintained by keeping the Labour party off the Treasury bench. Let me contrast the position of Australia under a Labour Government with its state to-day under a so-called Nationalist Government. In an interview recently Mr Wickens, the Commonwealth Statistician, said that in all countries during periods of depression the natural birth-rate decreases and the death-rate increases. He added that that had been the position in Australia for some time. He also said that the number of migrants entering a country was an index to its prosperity. Statistics show that the record year for migrants entering the Commonwealth was during the regime of a Labour Government. In one year over 90,000 migrants came to Australia. The next best I liken the position on year in this connection was also during the term of office of the Fisher Government when about 63,000 migrants migrants came to Australia. If the statement of Mr Wickens is correct those figures go to show that there was greater prosperity in Australia when a Labour Government was in oflice than exists today under a Nationalist Government. bers opposite still say that toomany migrants are entering this country.' while there is so much unemployment here. During the regime of the Labour At least he has Government to which I have referred migrants came to Australia of their own accord and at their own expense. There was no need for the Government to offer inducements to bring them here. Nevertheless, it was blamed for not chartering special ships for that purpose. Such was the prosperity of Australia under a Labour Government than exists now.

I was pleased at the stand taken by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) in connection with this bill. Both he and the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mi-. Hughes) learned the dignity of labour in a hard school. One criticism of the Pederal Arbitration Court is that it operates in a legal atmosphere,but a study of this measure shows that it, too, will flourish in a legal atmosphere. It is true that it provides for the establishment of committees; but every determination made by a committee whose chairman is not a judge must be referred to the Chief Judge, who may, or may not, allow it. If the chairman of the committee is a. judge the determination need not be sent on to the Chief Judge. A judicial atmosphere pervades the bill. for North Sydney suggested that industrial disputes should be settled by men with practical industrial experience. This legislation does not do that. I am sorry that the honourable member for Eawkner did not have time to complete his speech. He said that if time had permitted he intended to refer to the moral and spiritual aspects of this industrial question. Autogbiography by Theodore Roosevelt, an ex-President of the United States of America, might supply that which the honourable member for Eawkner would have given us. The following extract is from page 512 of the autobiographyA democracy can be such in fact only if thero is some rough approximation stature among the men composing it simple and poor society can exist as a democracy on a basis of sheer individualism. a rich and complex. industrial society cannot so exist; for some individuals, and especially those artificial individuals called become so big that the ordinary individual is utterly dwarfed beside them, and cannot deal with them on terms of equality. becomes, necessary for these ordinary uals to combine in their turn, first in order to act in their collective capacity through biggest of all combinations called the government, and second to act also in their own self defence, through private combinations, such as farmers' associations and trade unions. the great coal operators did not see. They did not see that their property rights, which they so stoutly defended, were of the same texture as were the human rights, which they so blindly and hotly denied. They did not see that the power which they exercised of Mr Jones. their stock-holders was of the same texture as the power which the union leaders demanded of representing the workmen, who had democratically elected them. They did not see that the riglit to use one's property as one w i ll can be maintained only so long as it is consistent with the maintenance of certain fundamental human rights, of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, or as we may restate tliem in these later days, of the rights of the worker to a living wage, to reasonable hours of labour, to decent working and living conditions, to freedom of thought and speech and industrial representation-in ' short to a measure of industrial democracy and, in return for his arduous toil, to a worthy and decent life according to American standards. Still another thing these business leaders did not see. They did not see that both their interests and the interests of the workers must be accommodated, and if need be, subordinated, to the fundamental permanent interests of the whole community. No man and no group of men may so exercise their rights as to deprive the nation of the things which are. necessary and vital to the common life.

Tlie main object of the supporters of the Government seems to be to aid those who are fighting for ""larger profits and an autocratic control of big business."" The great majority of our workmen are law abiding, peaceful and honourable citizens who have done nothing to deserve the treatment which the Government is meting out to them. The final quotation that I shall make from the book begins on page 520 and readsI believe that the' overwhelming majority, both of workmen and employers, are law-abiding, peaceful aud honourable citizens, and I do not think that it is just to lay up the errors and wrongs of individuals to the entire group to which thoy belong. I also think-and this is a belief which has been borne upon me through many years of practical experiencethat the trade union is growing constantly in wisdom as well as in power, and is becoming one of the most efficient agencies toward the solution of our industrial problems, the elimination of poverty and industrial disease and accidents, the lessening of unemployment, the achievement of industrial democracy, and tlie attainment of a larger measure of social and industrial justice. In his second-reading speech on the bill the Prime Minister suggested that it was necessary to discourage employees from forming big organizations; but the late President Eoosevelt held quite a different view. member suggest that the trade unions wish the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to be retained? ployers and employees alike admit that there are certain defects in the system, but these could be remedied. If this bill is passed it will bring chaos into industries that are at present being conducted harmoniously. Let us not make the mistake of throwing away the substance for the shadow. -S o much has been said on this bill by the many speakers who have preceded me that I cannot hope to break new ground. As a humble new member, I shall not pretend that I can pour out half as much wisdom as has been released during this long debate; but it appears to me that honourable members opposite and even some distinguished members on this side of the chamber have indulged in many irrelevancies and inexactitudes in the course of their speeches. It has been said that this necessary reform is a deplorable and reactionary attempt on the part of the Government to force the workers of* Australia back to the sweating conditions of the dark old days. Let us strip the 7 debate of this "" sob stuff "" and hysteria, and look at the subject frankly. The object of the bill is to remedy the overlapping and duplication of the present system of industrial control. The Government is proposing to set up what will be practically federal wages boards for interstate disputes, and to leave to the State authorities the settlement of lesser disputes. Every one who knows anything about the industrial life of Victoria is aware that the wages board system of that State has been remarkably successful. Its one serious defect is being corrected in the scheme laid down in this bill. As the Attorney-General eloquently explained, the judges who will be chairmen of the boards constituted under this measure will be able, if they think that any decision of a board would have the effect of exploiting the public, to refer the matter back to the board. then ? fidence in human nature to believe that the defects would be remedied. The representatives who will constitute these boards will not require to talk to the gallery or the press, for the deliberations will be conducted in camera.

537,Mr White,"It is well known that,one State before it can come before the Commonwealth Court. That method of dealing with industrial troubles is expensive. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) quoted some enlightening figures with the object of showing how expensive the Commonwealtih Court has been to industrial organizations. Mr Crofts recently said that it cost something like £30,000 a year. I think that he referred particularly to the salaries paid and to other expenditure of that sort, but the system involves almost incalculable expense that has to be borne by industry. Thus enterprise is stifled by the charges that have to be met by the employer, who at any time has a difficult task, and is not encouraged to remain in industry. The fact that the amount at fixed deposit in the banks of Australia is £33,000,000 greater than it was two years ago shows that people have not sufficient confidence in secondary industries to invest their money in them. If any man in this chamber suddenly acquired wealth, would he invest it in a secondary industry? I think not. If Labour were sincere in its statement that it is out to help the working man, what a chance there would be to make him really interested in his industry. He could even become a shareholder in the United States of America where labour is not political, but where its chief concern is to make the men contented and industrious in their employment. Howi t would help Australia to progress if the Labour party could induce the members of the unions to take genuine interest in the industries from which they obtain their employment. Ma. STEWABT -What does the honor1 able member mean when he refers to Federal wages boards? labour boards similar to wages boards were to be established in big industries. along those lines in the bill. putes that have an interstate significance. cally provided for, it would bring more support to the measure. McKay Ltd. devotes a whole department to the study of arbitration awards, and that is an overhead expense to industry. One honourable member wanted to know where that expense occurred. The cost of the salaries of the officers employed in that work is, of course, passed on to industry, and the benefits of the tariff are to that extent nullified. I agree with the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers), who pointed out that the economic position of the country was not all that could be desired. He said there was no certainty that wages would remain at the present level. Who could promise that they would? Wages are decided by the economic position of the country. They rise to a certain level, and ultimately they must recede. says they will not go back. anteed; they may either go up or down. If the wealth of a country is £5 per head of the population, it is ridiculous to assert that each inhabitant can take £6. What is wrong with Labour's policy is that it pays no regard to economics. It desires artificial standards irrespective of whether the industries can afford them. Governments cannot do everything. Much depends upon the people themselves. As Carlyle saysit, as is the practice in Political reform can, indeed, root out tlie weeds, but it leaves the ground empty, ready either for noble fruits or for new worse tares. We ought to have more faith in our own country and patronise our industries. How many honourable members opposite are entirely Australian in their purchases ? That is one way in which unemployment can be reduced. If all sections pull together, we shall eventually see Australia marching to her destiny with success similar to that achieved in America. It seems to me that honourable members opposite, I said that Federal as federal members, fear that their sphere of influence in the Commonwealth will wane considerably if this bill is carried. So long as Labour as a party advocates nationalisation, its objection to the evacuI was referring to disation by the Commonwealth of the field of compulsory arbitration is understandable. They believe in the nationalisation of all the services of production and in that respect they are consistent in opposing the bill. But that they should suddenly become the champions of the Arbitration Court is rather ludicrous. As",221,Interstate Competition

So long as its awards were favorable toi Labour, they were accepted by the unions ; but when the economic situation, resulted in awards being less favorable to the workers, they declined to accept them. When they have defied the law, have any representatives of Labour told them to go back to work? Does anybody imagine that industrial disaster will result from this very necessary reform contemplated by the Government? Much has been said by Labour about the Ministry having no mandate for the bill. With loud voices, honourable members opposite have been keeping up their courage, and declaring they would welcome an election. I can say emphatically that I at least have a mandate. It is the result of the Balaclava by-election at which I received a large majority in every subdivision. This is the only election in the federal sphere that has been fought siuce the arbitration proposals of the Government have been brought forward. Labour did not care to put up. a candidate. Although there are from 18,000 to 20,000 Labour voters in the electorate, the independent Nationalist did not succeed in polling three-fourths of the Labour votes, let alone obtain any of the votes of the independents. This action of the Government was brought well to the fore at the election. The Prime Minister explained his intentions regarding federal arbitration, and he also referred to the John Brown case. My opponent, who fought very fairly, took the opposing side in the matter of arbitration, and his speeches were almost as well reported in the press as mine were, but he obtained only about 16,000 votes. So a bigger majority was gained under these circumstances by the Ministerial candidate than at the last fedto me inexplicable. eral election, when so worthy and illustrious a man as the Bight Honourable W.

Biley) referred to my advent to this chamber as an accident. The Balaclava figures should be an eloquent enough reply. The only accident is the presence of the honourable member for Indi( Mr Jones) who will be one of the first of the Opposition to lose his seat. The attitude of Labour is naturally one of opposition to everything that the Government does. It will embarrass capital in any way it can.

In the same boat is the honourable member for Wimmera, a man whose political complexion before I entered this chamber I had great difficulty in deciding. He makes most inaccurate remarks. He said that the Government put ex-soldiers on the land, and not into factories; but he must know that hundreds of them have been placed in factories through the Repatriation Department. There is yet time for his enlightenment, and for him to decide definitely to move into one political camp or the other.

We cannot have throughout this great continent the economic uniformity to which honourable members opposite attach so much importance. When the abolition of the Eederal Arbitration Court makes interstate competition more active, industries will migrate to their right geographical positions. genius of that great soldier, Sir John Monash, is engaged in the harnessing of electricity, and if , as a result of the adof all efforts to frustrate it, it will mark vantages thus created, industry in that State is stimulated, that will be to the adadmire the courage of my leader and his vantage of all Australia. Similarly, if Queensland can offer exceptional facilities for other special industries it should be allowed to have them and other States similarly. If honourable members will take the trouble to investigate the industries which are peculiar to the different States, they will certainly approve of this policy. I have been surprised at the manner in which the names of great men have been dragged into this debate as champions of this, that, and the other policy. Has the House forgotten the vitriolic criticism and political cruciduce interstate competition, border duties, fixion of some of those men when they first brought forward the measures for which to-day they are enthusiastically commended? Arbitration, we are told by members of the Opposition, was one of the reasons for the federation of the States. It was only one of 39 reasons for federation, and the framers of the Constitution realized that it was only an experiment, although a great ideal lay behind it. That experiment is 25 years old; and the arbitration system is now rather patched and worn. Because the Government has the courage to say that the industrial mess should be cleared up, that men should not be kept in subsidized idleness by the unions, encouraged by members of the Opposition, and that the burden of overhead costs should be lifted from industry, it is bitterly assailed by the Opposition and by some of its own supporters. If time permitted, I could show that the present federal system of regulating industry does not operate uniformly. Other speakers have pointed out that there are only twelve awards of the Arbitration Court which have a Commonwealth-wide application, that more Mr White. State than Eederal awards are in existence, and that more employees are under the jurisdiction of State tribunals than are under federal jurisdiction. Many of the specious arguments that have been advanced in opposition to the bill will not bear investigation. I hope that this debate will not prove to have been merely idle talk. The dawn is now breaking. Soon the In Victoria, the engineering division on the second reading of the bill will be taken, and I hope that when the measure is adopted, as it will be in spite tbe dawn of a new industrial era.

The honourable member would do away with the federal ideal and reintroand all the jealous and selfish conditions that characterized the bad old days which we had hoped were gone for ever. The honourable member was more candid than some of his colleagues and verified the suspicions of honourable members on this side of the House. Although his leader has said that wages will not be reduced as the result of this legislation, the honourable member for Balaclava says that they must be reduced. they might go up or down. system a reduction of wages is inevitable. The honourable member religiously refrained from endeavouring to explain the merits of the bill. I sympathize with him aud the other members of his party who are in the invidious position of not being able to explain the legislation they are thrusting on the people.

Would the honourable member contest the electorate of Melbourne Ports as a supporter of this legislation? the poverty of the arguments advanced to justify it. The statement that the a Government has a mandate for it is the height of absurdity. It is well known that the Government went to the country pledged to the system of arbitration and gave no indication that it intended to wreck an industrial jurisdiction which had been built up gradually over a period of 25 years. On the contrary the Government assured the people that the Arbitration Act was to be tightened up and that it would compel obedience to the awards of the court. The Attorney General brought his legal knowledge to bear, and as has always happened when he has dabbled in industrial affairs, the existing arbitration system degenerated from bad to worse. The Government posed on the hustings as the champion of law and order; and if it received any mandate it was to make the industrialists obey the arbitration law. Having secured a further tenure of office, itproceeded to introduce a scheme of vindictive penalties which were put into operation against the worker immediately he offended against the arbitration law; but this legislation recoiled on the Government when it was faced with the necesssity for prosecuting one of its own friends, Mr John Brown. He had undoubtedly committed a breach of the industrial law, and the Government had either to make a pretence of prosecuting him or withdraw the prosecution against the trade unionists. The Ministers have fallen down on their job, and this bill is a frank admission of their inability to regulate the industrial affairs of the counThe States are not ready for this legistry. ling demonstration of weakness on the part of any one. Ministers have said, in effect, ""We cannot legislate industrially its operation for some considerable time. for the people of Australia, the job is beHe has admitted that his State has no yond us; therefore we shall surrender it to the States "". If that is stable Governthe Government proposes to abandon. ment, God save Australia from a continuation of it. We are told that one reason for the abolition of the Arbitration Court is the need to remove dual control of industry. There is no dual control, because if a Commonwealth law or award is in conflict with a law or-award of the [29] State, automatically the former prevails. If the Government is so anxious to abolish overlapping, why does it not address The bill is condemned by itself to the income tax laws? They represent duplication of the worse type, but there is no proposal to abolish Commonwealth income taxation because it overlaps the State taxes. Despite what has been said to the contrary by the honourable member for Balaclava, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has established commercial equality throughout Australia. That is the object of the federal arbitration law. We have no need for parochial vendors of stinking fish; we want a united peopio animated hy a national patriotism. The arbitration law is one means of giving effect to that ideal. The court should enable industry to find its level in all the States. It is not desirable that an industry enjoying especially favorable conditions in one State should be able to compete unfairly against similar industries in other States. The Constitution provides that there shall be no discrimination between States in respect of trade and commerce, but if the wages in one State are reduced by 10 or 20 per cent, its industries must have an unfair advantage over all competitors. The Government said that this bill will establish one authority in industrial affairs. By no stretch of the imagination can industries throughout the Commonwealth be brought under one authority because no State, notwithstanding its sovereign rights, can. extend its jurisdiction beyond its own boundaries. As industry develops and becomes more federal in character the State courts will become powerless to interfere in any dispute of interstate extent. We have never seen a more appallation. The Premier of Victoria, Sir William McPherson, has requested the Commonwealth Government to withhold machinery to carry on the work which The Premier of New South Wales has said that he will do away with arbitration. In a work entitled, A New Province for Law and Order,"" the late Mr Justice Higgins told us that it was the intention not to confine this law to any particular trade or calling, but to make it national in character. intended to benefit not only the workers, but also the producers. Here is an illustration of the benefits of the Commonwealth Court. It was not until 1913 that the Carters and Drivers Union commenced to function federally. Prior to that there were several serious strikes in the carting industry, but during the last thirteen years the court has prevented disputes from developing into strikes. Where is there a more striking testimony to the benefits of the court? There are transport workers all over Australia, but this bill makes no provision for them, nor for workers in the territories of the Commonwealth. I know that there are seven or eight federal awards which are operating in the territories of the Commonwealth. wipe all of those out of existence, and does not intend to provide any machinery to take their place. A federal award has never been broken in the Northern Territory. intend to take to protect the men there? The Government, in its eagerness to do something rash, will destroy the whole edifice of arbitration, and the States are not ready to meet the situation which must inevitably arise. I propose to make a few quotations to show what was in the minds of those who were responsible for the creation of this court. Mr W. B. S. C. Sawers, speaking in the House of Eepresentatives on the 28th June, 1901, saidI have always regarded it as a misfortune 13th December, 1907, said that the Constitution Act did not provide that the question of conciliation and arbitration, and the regulation of wages and conditions of labour generally, should be left as matters for the sole control of the Federal Parliament. Those views were expressed during a speech delivered on the following motion moved by MrH . B. Higgins:That in the opinion of this Housei t is expedient for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to accept (if the State Parliaments see fit to grant it, under section 51, sub-section 37 Australia. of the Constitution Act) full power to make laws for Australia ns to wages, hours and conditions of labour. In moving that motion Mr Higgins saidWith free trade between the States it will not work well to let one State have one set of laws regulating wages, hours and conditions of labour in that State, and to allow another' State to have another set of laws dealing with those subjects within its boundaries. ilr. Nelson. The court was Senator Drake, who was Postmaster General at the time, saidI am sure we all desire that, with regard to the laws relating to wages and the hours and conditions of labour, there should be uniformity amongst all tlie States. We can see very clearly that it will be necessarily to the disadvantage of some State or other if there is any considerable difference in the laws governing these important subjects. They realized that if we were to progress as a nation we must have uniform laws, so that traders and industrialists would be placed on an equal footing. Senator Sir Josiah Symon, of South Australia, saidI am entirely in sympathy with the principle underlying this motion. It is exceedingly desirable in the interests of trade, and in the interests of the Commonwealth, that we should This Government proposes to have absolute uniformity, as far as possible, where the conditions are uniform, in relation to everything that affects the material welfare of each of the States composing the Commonwealth. It was soon after the first Federal ParliaWhat action does the Ministry ment met that the late Mr Justice Higgins (then MrH . B. Higgins), who was one of the first members, submitted the motion which I have just read providing that the Commonwealth Parliament should have f u l l power to make laws dealing with wages, hours and conditions of labour. The procedure then proposed was that the State Parliaments should grant the power to the Commonwealth. The late Honourable A. Deakin, then Prime Minister, in a memorandum presented to Parliament on the To restrict the powers of the Commonwealth to the mere imposition of duties, while conditions under which the manufacture of protected articles is carried on differ so widely in the different States, would ;bc to permit discrimination and discord. . . . . Effective and useful as State industrial laws have in many cases proved, their operation is circumscribed by State boundaries, and it can hardly be claimed for tliem that they either do, or can, secure uniformity in the conditions of manufacture throughout No authority but the Commonwealth Parliament can do this. In a further memorandum presented on the 28th October, 1908, he saidAs the power to protect the manufacturer is national, it follows that unless the Parliament of the Commonwealth also acquires power to secure fair and reasonable conditions of employment to wage-earners, the policy of protection must remain incomplete.

I rose to associate myself definitely with the Opposition in its protest against the scrapping of the federal arbitration law, which has been built up as a result of a quarter of a century's hard work on the part of the best brains of Australia. I trust that good sense will prevail, and that honourable members will not pass this legislation, unless it is amended to meet the requirements of the industrial situation as it exists to-day. I hope that the hill will meet the fate that it justly declose quarters with the leaders of the serves, particularly in view of the impetuous manner in which it was introduced by its framers. a.m.] I do not propose to offer any apology to honourable members for speaking at this hour of the morning. It has been my misfortune to sit up the whole night to listen to the views of honourable members on the bill. Last week I also listened with attention to a number of other speakers, so that I feel that, in the closing hours of this debate, I have absorbed the essence of the discussion on arbitration. I am, therefore, somewhat pleased that it has fallen to my lot to address the House at such a late stage ot the debate, because it will enable me to speak with assurance. I trust that my remarks will not be misconstrued by honourable members, and will not be received by them in any hostile spirit. I claim the privilege which I have, as a member of the Country party, to act as I think fit party for the attitude that they have taken in the interests of the electors whom T represent. I do not take the view of those who decline to criticize important legislasors of arbitration legislation, which has tion if it is sponsored by the Government. So long as I am in this House, I shall protest think is wrong, even though my party is against me. This legislation is not an ordinary party issue. I well remember, when I was a boy, that arbitration was the subject of widespread discussion. It was part and parcel of the political and constitutional system of Australia. The decision on this important issue may affect the lives of generations of Australians. This bill is far above ordinary party considerations,' and the ordinary standard of party conduct should not be followed. have sternly rebuked its critics are exceeding their duties as members of this House. Their remarks have bordered close on impertinence. The decision on this bill may affect the whole of our political life, therefore it should not be hastily arrived at. I have spent weeks on its consideration. I began with my mind opposed to the action of the Government; but, realizing that a serious political position might arise, I decided not to say anything until I could come to parties which I support, and hear their views and those of the other members of my party. At the outset I resolved that, before finally making up my mind on the bill, I ""should consider the subject from all angles. This proposal is almost as important as federation itself. We must recognize that the federal arbitration system, however lightly honourable members may treat this subject, is apparently to be seriously changed in its character. It is rooted in the very economic and industrial standards of Australia, and it is doubtful whether any legislation can alter it in a day or a fortnight. I doubt whether it may ever be uprooted considering that the workers of Australia, who comprise 90 per cent, of the people of this country, have been operating under it for 27 years. I am surprised that that aspect did not receive greater consideration at the hands of honourable members on this side. I do not blame the members of the Labour up, because that is their political business. The Labour party was actually the sponplayed an important part in our political, industrial, and economic life. Although against anything that I the members of that party have not supported compulsory arbitration during recent years to the extent they did some time ago, it is only natural when such a serious change as this is threatened that they should stand up to the principles which",224,Interstate Competition
556,Mr Thompson (New England) [6.23,"many of them have so strongly advocated. I listened very closely to many of the speeches delivered by honourable members opposite and their presentation of the case against the bill has influenced inc to support its second reading. I have analysed their objections to the measure and studied the printed matter prepared by exponents of a federal arbitration system. I have always been a believer in federal arbitration and will continue to be even if this measure is Premiers in Canberra where the subject passed. I am satisfied, however, that the members of the Opposition entered this political contest without properly preparing their case. They have been merely on the defensive and quite unable to stand up to the arguments brought forward by the supporters of the Government. In the first place I should like to deal impression I formed was that the State with the suggestion that the Government has not received a mandate from the people to abolish federal arbitration. My view is that federal arbitration will not be abolished even if this measure becomes operative. But I was somewhat puzzled in determining the action I should take in connection with this measure, because there is not the slightest doubt that the Prime Minister did not receive a mandate from the people at the last election to intaken by the Government came as a surtroduce legislation involving such a drastic change of policy. I have been a supporter of the Government for six and a-half years, but I cannot recall one instance during the last election campaign when it was mentioned that there was a possibility of the Arbitration Oourt being abolished or the Commonwealth relinquishing certain of its powers in this regard. If that had been the issue I , .as a strong advocate of the system of arbitration, particularly under federal control, would have studied the situation very closely.. I understood that tlie industrial policy of the Governin en t involved the strengthening of the federal industrial system in operation at the time of the 1925 election. In these circumstances I cannot agree with my colleagues that it was even suggested to the electors that such a change would be made. The absence of a mandate from the people caused some perturbation in my mind, and I naturally asked why the Government had so suddenly decided to adopt what I regarded as a most unusual course. The telegram which the Prime Minister despatched to the members of the Nationalist and Country parties came, as the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) said, as a bolt from the blue. I fully believed that something of a very unexpected character had arisen which the right honourable gentleman could not mention in his telegraphic communication. I read in the newspapers that he had been in conference with the State of federal arbitration had been discussed and that the Government had made an offer to practically withdraw from the field of arbitration. I did not read anything in the report of the proceedings of the conference that suggested that the State representatives had presented an ultimatum to the Commonwealth; the Premiers were rather surprised at the right honourable gentleman's offer. It seemed to me that the State Premiers had no authority to accept the Prime Minister's offer, and they, as creatures of political circumstances, were, I suppose, in a somewhat difficult position in that they had not submitted such a proposal to their electors for their approval. It was apparent to every one that the action prise, not only to the Government's supporters, but to the general public. The Prime Minister stated that expense and inconvenience were being caused by the overlapping of federal and State awards, and that if his proposals were adopted the cost of production would be reduced. The Government does not appear to have any cogent reasons for acting in this way and will eventually have to justify its action before the people. AlthoughI do not represent an industrial constituency, I felt that I was under an obligation to protect not the interests of only the supporters of the Country party, but also a number of workers in my electorate.

It must be remembered that no constitutional change is involved. I favour a constitutional change.

That aspect of the bers that the results have been revolumatter has not been properly impressed upon the public, and especially upon the employers, who are taking a rather haphazard view of the future. They are under the impression that this is to be a permanent change, but there is no guarantee that it will be permanent. That is the risk they are taking, and it is ""their funeral."" There are 400,000 employees working under federal awards, and it is a very serious thing for a parliament to withdraw them from federal jurisdiction when they do not desire that withdrawal. Here again the Government has assumed responsibility for the action and has advanced its reasons, the principal reason advanced being that the change will prevent duplication. No evidence has been forthcoming from either side of the House that this change will lower the cost of production. Many honourable members are fond of using catch phrases which would sound very well, but which, when analysed, mean very little. It was stated by the Prime Minister, the Attorney General and many honourable members on this side that 90 per cent, of the reason for this change is the desire to avoid duplication. Are the facts as to duplication so serious that they justify this great couple of days for a few shillings, and change? I listened very attentively to the debate and I have heard nothing to indicate to me how that duplication can be injurious to the country. Even the controllers of industry who favour the change have not advanced any proof that duplication exists to such an extent that the action of the Government in surrendering 95 per cent of its federal powers is justified. I do not, like the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) and others, claim to be a captain of industry. However, I have seen various phases of industry operating under both federal and State awards. ledge may have led me to a wrong conclusion, but I have not seen any evidence of duplication of awards to suggest that dual control exercises a disastrous influence on industry, and warcommittee. I am confident that the Gorants this drastic change. I have been closely associated with the great newspaper industry of Australia, which for fifteen years has worked satisfactorily under the federal arbitration jurisdiction, and I assure honourable memtionary. I -personally have enjoyed the benefits that have accrued, and many present-day journalists, who in their youth toiled for little recompense, have also enjoyed tliose benefits. I trust that when the bill is in committee the Attorney General will take care that the great bene fits conferred on that industry by federal arbitration will not be sacrificed, and that honourable members will take the greatest care to see that nothing slips through the committee stage by oversight. The profession of a journalist has been converted from practical slavery, with little recompense, to one of decency, competency, and fair pay. I believe that to be the opinion of 99 per cent, of the journalists of Australia. There is another point that has not been stressed in this debate. When we talk about overhead costs, and the necessity to reduce the cost of production, we do not sufficiently consider the waste in industry caused by incompetent employees. Journalism affords an instance. Before its members came under the Federal Arbitration Court the industry was overloaded with derelicts; boozers who would work for a then go on the drunk for a fortnight. Those men were really not fitted for the task of moulding the public opinion of the country. Even on the big city dailies the conditions were anything but good, and some of our finest journalists of today eked out a very precarious livelihood in those earlier times. All that has changed, and now many bright lads enter the profession because it affords an adequately remunerated livelihood. I shall deal only briefly with the theatrical industry.

Queensland than in some of the other States. been prescribed under the authority of a Labour government. When Labour governments are established in the other StatesI have no doubt that they will sweep away the various industrial tribunals which previous governments established. InNew South Wales, for instance, a Labour government would probably constitute an arbitration court which would control industry in a manner objectionable to the majority of the employers. That is another risk that employers are running in supporting this measure, but that, of course, is the employer's own funeral. No doubt the employees will benefit in the long run under State control of industry as they have done in Queensland. In view of that, I cannot understand why the Labour party is s„o strongly opposed to this bill. If the people of Australia do not like, the system which it is now proposed to set up, a future Labour government will have an opportunity of altering it. Even the Sydney Morning Herald, in yesterday's issue, had this to sayNo change whatever in the constitutional position is to he brought about. Tlie people as Commonwealth electors will possess the power to rectify any mistake which by majority they think has been made. If they are dissatisfied when next they are appealed to they will give warrant for a complete re-entry of the vacated field. Manifestly they would do so by showing confidence in the Labour party, the policy of which provides for a change in industrial arbitration methods so drastic that the cleared ground would be an aid rather than a hindrance to its plans. Thus, by not submitting this question for decision at a referendum, we are possibly involving the employers and controllers of industry in greater risks than they themselves are aware. I do not feel any sympathy with them because they themselves have endorsed the proposal. They had every opportunity for months past to study the question, and make their protests to the Government. Therefore, unless their objection has been suppressed by the newspapers, it is evident that the great majority of the employers, and associations of employers, favour the proposal. dorsed it because they think wages will come down. but it has not been proved, during the course of this debate, that wages will come down as a result of the passage of the bill. On the other hand, it has been shown that in those States in which Federal Arbitration Court awards have not been accepted, wages are higher than elsewhere. This applies in the case of the pastoral award in New South Wales, and also in that of Queensland. that wages will come down. that the employers may be making the mistake of their lives. That, however, is their own affair; they are not fools. The honourable member for Balaclava is, T think, an employer, and he is no fool, though he expresses himself as satisfied with this proposal. If it does not work out right he will have to suffer with the others. I have a shrewd suspicion that when Labour governments get back into power in the various States the employers will again seek to have their industries brought under federal jurisdiction. It is, however, with the constitutional aspect of the matter that I am most concerned. I am convinced that the Government, even without the mandate given to it at the last election, would be justified in dealing with this issue, because it is staking its existence, and that of its supporters, upon it. There remains, however, the great constitutional question as to whether the Commonwealth is to be greater or lesser than the States. I have always been a constitutionalist as honourable members know. I have played a leading part in the new state movement, which I am still hopeful will become an important issue before Parliament. If I thought that the passage of this bill would result in preventing the.report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution being considered in this House with a view to constitutional amendments being decided upon, I would have no hesitation in voting against it. I am confident, however, that that will not be the result. I am confident that the appointment of this commission which has been sitting for two years, and which has cost",232,Interstate Competition

This Parliament will be the final authority, but the commission will adyise Parliament of the results of its investiga tions, and if Parliament does not approve of the recommendations it will not submit them to the people for endorsement. I do not think that the matter is of vital importance at this stage, because some future'Parliament can always alter what is being done now if it does not meet with the wishes of the people. In 1926 we asked the people to approve, by referendum, of the proposal to widen the industrial powers of the Commonwealth, and honourable members on both sides of the House enthusiastically supported, the proposal. There was not a man on the Opposition side who did not throw up his hat and say that it was the very thing which he had always wanted, yet the proposal was not agreed to. Last year we asked the people to agree to an amendment of the Constitution enabling the Commonwealth to enter into financial agreements with the States. The necessary power was given, showing that if we are united we can get the people to agree to any necessary constitutional amendment. The trouble in 1926 was that the executives controlling the Labour movements in the States opposed the proposal for granting wider industrial powers to the Commonwealth.

The representaappeals in relation to the coal-mining tives of these workers waited upon me a fortnight ago to place before me their views upon this bill. In the course of our discussion I learned that the textile workers very rarely submit a plaint to the Arbitration Court. They meet their employers in conference, reach an agreement, and use the arbitration machinery merely to ratify their joint decision. That system could be adopted in very many other industries with great advantage to the nation. But unfortunately there are some persons in the community who batten The aim of men in every upon industrial trouble. They are never happy unless they are stirring up strife. If these individuals are allowed a free hand, the nation will never become prosperous. We must solve the problems which industry is at present encountering and the best way to do it is to bring the parties closer together.

No one would think of suggesting that £3 Ss. 3d. is anything like a living wage for a man. The wages are low, because there are many more thousand workers on the coal-field than the output warrants.

My object in drawing attention to this situation is to show that the industry cannot be continued under existing conditions. No government can bolster up an industry indefinitely.

I have analysed the position for the last five years, and I say that all large disputes have been occasioned by the boliberations of the Arbitration Court. It is no use shutting our eyes to the facts. I could enumerate case after case-wher u judges who have no knowledge at all of industry, have given awards that have created friction where there should have been no friction at all. The employers w ill use every means in order to obtain a victory. Both sides w ill do so. I do not blame the employers any more than I blame ourselves. We do exactly the same thing as they do, but if we were to meet around the table regarding matters as to which there was likely to be a dispute, no disputes would take place. He advocates conciliation rather than the present arbitration system. Mr D. J. Davies, Vice-President of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, in New South Wales, statesRegarding the arbitration machinery, the miners all along have been opposed to compulsory arbitration, but they have from time to time adopted voluntary methods of arbitration in the shape of conciliation courts, and probably they have changed tlieir ideas and systems more than any other industry iu this country. They have had conciliation boards, the State arbitration court, boards presided over by Judge Edmonds and established under the War Precautions Act, and, lastly, the coal tribunal; but they have all along refrained from utilizing the system of arbitration which has heen applied to other industries. The miners have always had a dislike for th* legal fraternity entering into discussions on Industrial questions in regard to which they know practically nothing, and in regard to which they introduce legal technicalities and legal interpretations of the law.

623,Mr Lister,"I realize that thero areunion for arbitration has been nothing compared with the cost entailed by other unions, yet the mining industry probably is one of the most intricate to govern, and one which is more prone to industrial unrest than any other. What do we find with arbitration? We find that a judge goes on to the bencli after being legally trained, and comes to a decision after weighing the evidence presented. He is hardly in a position to help the litigants to come together, as he listens to barristers and lawyers whose interests depend on making the case last as long as possible by creating as much matter as possible to fight over. We must get away from that method. MrH . C. Gibson, a prominent trade unionist, was President of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council when he made the following statement as to the desirability of peace in industryIt might be time well spent if 1 took a few moments to delve into some of the causes, because when all is said and done, the question arises what is cause, and what is effect? some quarters our arbitration registration has been blamed for the prese/it situation, and in that connection I want to make a confession, although it may appear strange coming from me. I am inclined to the view that legislation has been a contributing the problem. of twenty-one years standing. up to look upon the British something which, like Ca^sar's wife, is above suspicion. to the conclusion that judges, like the rest of us, are human. attributes, and cases have been brought under my notice where something more than bias has been indulged in. Self-interest has entered into the matter. experience of the arbitration system led us? It has placed the parties in industry in opposite camps: that is undisputed. not by its phraseology, but by its tion, to push them further apart. It might be asked what evidence we have of that. the organization that I primarily represent in the industrial About the middle of 1914 my organization had registered, under our Commonwealth tion Act, 037 agreements, mutually arrived at round the table, which bound the members of my organization employers on the other hand, to observe certain rates, and certain conditions of labour. we have not 30. Now that is not because we have not tried in the meantime. have been more concentrated in the last three years in an effort to bring about because our common sense has proved to us that if we can get the parties to agree, and get an agreement drawn up in black and white, and signed, it is more likely to be bided by, than anything which is enforced by an independent third party. But we have failed, and I place the responsibility marily at the door of the Arbitration and the present Arbitration Mr Lister. I have another quotation from a leading trade unionist, whose name has been mentioned freely in the discussion on the bill. I refer to Mr E. J. Holloway, late secretary to the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. He declaresWhen the Arbitration Act came into existence, conditions all round were improved, the status of the workers became better, industry was placed on its feet, and every one profited, but, like the things I have started to talk about in the first place, the changing methods of doing the work of the world, the increase in organization, and the more perfect organization, matters have reached such a stage in connection with arbitration that new machinery is necessary to meet the changes. That is the only difference. The Arbitration Act has served its day and generation. It did remarkably good work; it saved the situation so far as Australian industry was concerned. It has now become cumbersome, costly, and clumsy, unti l to-day it is not such a useful machine. InI w ill not suggest that it could not be made useful. If the act had heen amended by experts, or if a conference like this could have made it f it for the requirements of the day, instead of leaving it where it was when inarbitration troduced 27 years ago, things might have been factor to different. It should be quite possible to make I say that as an arbitrationist the Arbitration Act a useful, simple, smoothI was brought working, modern machine, to cope with modern Judiciary as requirements. I have always favoured some really flexible modern machinery as simple as After twenty-one years I have come possible. The administration, the duty of experts only, could be quickly changed from They have no superlative time to time to meet changing circumstances. My final word is that if we can evolve some easy, simple machinery, which can be quickly assembled to handle potential disputes, before Where has the twenty-one years' stoppages take place, without any long-drawn arguments, it would be something worthwhile. I have in mind some sort of machinery necesIt had a tendency sitating perfect organization, discipline, and administraauthority on both sides, so that everybody the employers' side represents, and everybody we Take represent, would obey its decisions. If we could erect some machinery of that kind, very world of the Commonwealth. useful work could be done. The reason the industrial legislation of this country has failed Arbitrais because of its slow, cumbersome, expensive, and unsympathetic methods caused by ignorance.

Sitting suspended from 8 a.m. to 9.S0 a.m. (Saturday). secretary of the Adelaide Trades and Labour Council, said1 have followed tlie trend of arbitration ever Tile and Pottery, Bottle Blowers, United since the days of Charles Cameron Kingston, who created the first wages board in South Australia. I consider that the present arbitration system has served its purpose, and I quite agree with Mr Holloway in that regard. There is room for improvement, and we ought to get down to the fundamental basis of the arbitration system, and to see what improvements can be effected. Personally, I think a board should be created on the lines which exist in South Australia, where representatives of employers and employees sit together, with an independent chairman, or, if necessary, a judge appointed by both sides in the industry. Those are matters whicli have to be considered. That board would be charged with tlie duty of scheduling industry, not on the lines of the courts, but on the lines of industry. I know that the opinion on the other side of the table is to have conciliation boards of a voluntary character, but we on this side of the House have a lot to contend with in that regard. I quote those leaders of the Labour movement because they should know something of the subject upon which they are speaking. Situated as I am, I cannot do better than be guided by the views of men who have had extensive experience of the difficulties which confront unions in trying to get decisions from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. During this debate a good deal has been said about the flouting of the court and deliberate breaches of the industrial law. A serious aspect of the timber workers' strike was that a large number of federal unions were assisting the strike by compelling their members to pay levies and other contributions to make its continuance possible. strike, the waterside workers' strike, was against an award of the Federal Arbitration Court, and I ask those unionists who believe in the principle of arbitration to consider the full significance of their action. The result of it must be to discredit the principle of arbitration and to imperil the existence of the federal arbitration system. For the information of honourable members. I place on record this list of unions which have been voluntarily or compulsorily contributing to the timber workers' strike fundAustralasian Council of Trade Unions, Iron Workers, Liquor Trades, Tramway, Amalgamated Boad Transport, Boilermakers, Australian Engineers, Moulders, Sheet Metal Workers, Amalgamated Printing Trades, Stovemakers, Federated Engine-drivers, Municipal Employees, Tobacco Workers, Rubber Workers, Shop Assistants, Australian Meat Industry, Amalgamated Carpenters, Builders' Labourers, Shipwrights, Storemen and Packers, Bricklayers, Water and Sewerage Union, Brick and Labourers, Wire Workers, Timber Workers, Gas Employees, Textile Workers, Building Trades, Hospital Employees, Ship Painters and Dockers, ' Australian Railway Union,"" Wool and Basil Workers, Saddlers, Stonemasons, Operative Painters, Wicker Workers, Gramophone Record Workers, Blacksmiths, Bedstead Makers, Fire Brigades, Shop Assistants, Bridge and Wharf Carpenters, Hairdressers, Bakers, Clothing Trades, Undertakers, Amalgamated Postal Workers, Electrical Trades, Food Preserving, Breadcarters, Boilermakers' Assistants, Sugar Workers, Carters and Drivers, Coachbuilders, Stoveinakers, Australian Workers Union, Manufacturing Grocers Union, Merchant Service Guild. Those unions must represent thousands of members, who, willingly or unwillingly, are contributing towards the support of men who are violating the law of the land. Can honourable members of the Opposition justify such an action ? Do they consider it in the best interests of Australia that the law should be openly flouted in this way? I invite them to answer that question. [9.37 a.m.] I am fully convinced of the wisdom of the proposal that the Commonwealth shall retire from the field of industrial arbitration. I am an ardent supporter of the principle of Commonwealth control, and because the arbitration system is of such importance to the hopes and aspirations of our people, we cannot view lightly any proposed change. For many years it has That been apparent that certain agencies have been militating against the success of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. It has not failed, but adverse influences have made it impossible for its f u l l value to be reaped by the community. Unfortunately, it is impossible to overcome those difficulties by amending the law, because on several occasions the people have, by referendum, refused to the Commonwealth the additional powers that are necessary to enable the court to function effectively and enforce its awards. That lack of power would operate against the success of any system of conciliation and arbitration. If and when the States accept f u l l responsibility for industrial jurisdiction, their courts will be confronted with the same troubles as the federal court has experienced. Honourable members opposite",237,Interstate Competition

625,"Mr Bernard Corser (""Wide Bay)","will admit that, and the reason is that there is in our midst a section of people who are determined to prevent, by any and every means, peace in industry, and will go to any lengths to break down a system that would ensure to workers in industry an adequate return. It is not that these bodies do not wish the workers to enjoy higher wages, but they are determined to effect a change in the social order by abolishing the capitalistic system of private ownership. It is their belief that there can be no peace in industry until the workers own the fields, the factories, and the workshops, and they openly confess that they will do all in their power to prevent the possibility of peace between the employer and the worker. backing of the political Labour party, to which the support of the industrial unions is essential for political purposes. This debate has emphasized the fact that the ' Labour party is not very much concerned with the value which the worker is to get for his labour under any system of conciliation or arbitration; its members are determined to follow the lead given by the revolutionary elements. lived and thrived on the false assumption that all other sections are opposed to the desires of the workers. This bill is evidence that the Government wishes to do its utmost to bring about peace in industry, and ensure the observance of the conditions that some tribunal may prescribe. The people in Queensland voted strongly in favour of the Commonwealth having ful l powers in the industrial field. proposes to set up a tribunal which will They realize that the present state of affairs cannot continue, and that they are suffering because of the industrial chaos that reigns. alteration is necessary, and I support this bill, because it would be impossible to secure from the people, even by another referendum, the powers which the Commonwealth needs. ment stone-wall this bill ? gentleman been leader of the Government the "" gag "" would have been applied long ago. I speak from experience in another sphere. 'Desirous of terminating the present unsatisfactory position, the Prime Minister met in conference the Premiers of the States, and suggested that all the power necessary for a successful arbitration system should be referred by the State Parliaments to the Commonwealth Parliament. ""With one exception, the Premiers flatly refused to grant that power. So jealous were they of the rights of the States that the Prime Minister realized that it would be futile to consult the people by another referendum. The Premiers accepted full responsibility for the regulation of industry by arbitration or conciliation within their own boundaries. Another referendum would probably be no more satisfactory than the last one. Even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore), while asking Unfortunately, they have the that another referendum should be taken, carefully refrained from stating whether he would support the appeal to the people. He said that his attitude would depend upon what powers were to be sought by the Commonwealth. In other words, whatever form the application fox increased powers might take, the honourable member would find some excuse for opposing it. It is clear, therefore, that They have the powers that are essential for the effective regulation of industry throughout Australia could not be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament by either the people or the State Parliaments. The control of industrial affairs by the State authorities will bring about greater competition. This might operate against the best interests of a section of the community, were it not that the Government have power to co-ordinate the determinations in the various States, and so bring about some degree of uniformity. If that It is evident that some be realized, we shall have gone a long way towards securing that control of industry which has been denied to the federal authority by referendum, because the various State tribunals will have an opportunity to enforce their determinations. We know that it will be necessary for them to enforce them. Honourable members opposite have stated that there will not be a cessation of industrial trouble. We are aware of that. There never will be so long as .we have in Australia a certaiu section that is determined to break down any system of arbitration that may be in operation, and prevent employers and employees from working peaceably together.",239,Interstate Competition
626,Mr Theodore,"""Why does the Govern",240,Interstate Competition
627,Mr Corser,"Had the honorableThe administration of the Labour party iu both the State and Commonwealth spheres has not been such that we can look to that party to improve the condition of our industries or increase the value of production. So long as the members of that section do not offend the in dustrialists they are content. Their object is to foster turmoil so that they may pose as the friends and supporters of the workers. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) is a supporter of industrial arbitration, if we can judge by his actions while Premier of Queensland and his expressions of opinion on the hustings. Before he entered this Parliament he always claimed that the awards of the Arbitration Court should be obeyed and must be upheld. It would appear, however, that in the last couple of years he has departed from that principle and is prepared to speak and act at the behest of the extreme section of the industrialists. The Government proposes a change in method, not-in principle. We shall still have arbitration courts, and no obstacle will be placed in the way of conciliation. Those honourable members who sit on this side support the principle of having one authority to deal with industrial affairs. We are justified in permitting the States to operate, seeing that f u l l powers have been denied to the Commonwealth. In Queensland the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has been the subject of much unfair political criticism. Whenever there is industrial turmoil there is a disposition to blame that court; yet only 26 of the 141 federal awards operate in that State. The pastoral employees' organization has written to members of this Parliament protesting against this proposal; yet during the last election it feared that its members in Queensland were to be brought under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court and that they would thereby be detrimentally affected. I quote tbe following from tbe Longreach Leader of the 30th August, 1929-During tbe last Federal and the more lecent State election campaigns, the Labour party in Queensland in particular visualized attacks on the -workers' wages and conditions if candidates with their brand on were not elected. Did they not submit propaganda to the electors in the electorates interested in the pastoral inship shall exist between him and his emdustry that station hands' wages would be reduced by 15s. 4d. per week if the Bruce-Page party were returned to power, and proportionate reductions to shearers and shed hands by bringing the industry under the ambit of the federal court? And, during the State campaign the same propaganda was disseminated. The Australian Workers Union asked its members to support the Labour party and thus obviate the possibility of their being brought under an award of the federal court. This journal further statesIn the federal campaign the Australian Workers Union Secretary, Mr W. J. Kiordan, who was defeated by Mr Grosvenor Francis for Kennedy, was the originator of the 15s. 4d. per week reduction bogey. An honourable member of this House, who has spoken against this proposal of the Government, was to some extent responsible for that bogey, because at the time he was president of the Australian Workers Union'. The articles goes on to sayPerhaps Mr Martens in his inconsistency may conveniently forget that at the time he was State president of the same organization. I could give further examples of abuse of the federal court by labour organizations and attempts to prevent the spread of its influence in the hope that ultimately it would be abolished. If honourable members w ill consult the files of labour journals prior to the announcement that the Government proposed to retire from the industrial field they w ill find that those journals were enthusiastic in their determination to upset the court and its awards. It is not so long ago that tbe effigy of a judge of the Arbitration Court was burnt in Sydney and insulting references were made to the court with the idea of destroying the respect which the people held for it and creating turmoil. If the powers that wore sought by the Government in 1926 had been granted action could have been taken to prevent much of the turmoil that has since existed. This is an honest effort by the Government to improve the conditions of the people of Australia, not only industrially but in every other direction. Until there is peace in industry we shall not have an adequate return from either' employers or employees. The Government desires that the worker shall receive the f u l l return for his labour and that a better relationployer. The following is an extract from an article published in the Trade and Production Supplement of Australian Goal, Shipping, Steel and the HarbourThe Trades Union Conference held in Melbourne has decided on a ""campaign of resistance"" to the proposals of the Federal Government to curtail the power of the Federal Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. A long string of resolutions beginning with ""a"" and ending with "" j "" were passed by tlie conference. The A.C.T.U. ""are out to resist the Government proposals."" The A.C.T.U. are champion ""resisters."" of the Bruce Government, they resisted the passage of the Arbitration Bill, they resisted the personnel of the court, they resisted the awards made by the court, and now they are resisting the limiting power of the court which they say is rotten. on this side finished hours ago; why this stone-walling. debate does not conclude until the right honourable the Prime Minister has replied. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) is always restless when reference is made to the Australasiati Council of Trade Unions. The honourable member was once regarded as a person who adhered to the principles which he strongly advocated; but since he has been a representative of New South ""Wales in this Parliament, he has been in close association with the extremists, and the lofty ideals which he once cherished have sunk into oblivion. When the honourable member came to the State in which he was once so favourably known, to assist in an election campaign, he found to his disappointment that those whom he once regarded as his friends were not willing even to listen to him on a public platform. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions which has opposed the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which it says is rotten, seems to be the controlling influence in the Labour party which bows to its behests irrespective of the welfare of the people which it is supposed to represent. I confidently assert that the vast majority of the electors of Queenslanda State possessing enormous potential wealth-wil l welcome this proposal as they are confident that it will be the means of improving the industrial conditions existing not only in Queensland, but in every State. Under the present system the Arbitration Court is being used in a way that was never intended, and under a State system of arbitration as outlined by the Prime Minister there is every prospect of the industrial situation improving. I make no apology for supporting this measure, because I believe it will be the means of ending much of the industrial turmoil that now exists. It will be of inestimable benefit to the primary producers who under the present system have been handicapped in the marketing of their produce The A.C.T.U. resisted the election by frequent and unnecessary disputes on the waterfront. With more stable conditions in industry, a larger amount of capital will be available for investment, and it should not be long before every section of the community will feel the benefit of the Arbitration system which the Government has decided to introduce. In addressing myself to the subject of arbitration which is agitating the minds of practically every person in Australia who takes an interest in this country's progress, I shall endeavour to keep my mind free from bias and from using any expressions likely to increase ill-feeling, which, unfortunately, is so prevalent in our industrial life. I was impressed with the remarks of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) who quoted some very interesting figures showing how the votes in certain electorates were recorded on the. referendum submitted to the people in 1926. I took the trouble to obtain tbe figures for the district of Angas, and found that on the question of granting increased industrial powers to the Commonwealth the electors turned down the proposal by 29,764 votes to 11,545 votes. In placing these figures against those recorded at the last federal election it will be seen that about 5,500 electors who voted for the Labour candidate must have also voted against granting additional powers to the Commonwealth. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) endeavoured to show that we are experiencing a period of industrial peace; but unfortunately the Opposition team work was not altogether satisfactory, as the honourable kins), who has been a member of the Federal Parliament continuously since its inception and who is",240,Interstate Competition

Court, which has been extolled as the means of preventing industrial unrest, cannot have been the success which honourable members opposite suggest. I listened with interest when the right honourable member for JNorth Sydney( Mr Hughes) was speaking on the bill now before the House. The right honourable gentleman is regarded with admiration and respect for the wonderful service he performed in the nation's interests during the Great War; deal of his speech on the bill consisted of personal abuse. His best friends must admit that he has not forgotten what occurred several years ago, when, after outliving his usefulness, he was superseded by the present Prime Minister. During his speech he referred to the fact that the Prime Minister had been the leader of the Government for over six years, when I interjected, "" That is the trouble."" The right honourable gentleman reminds me of a small boy who is not a good loser, playing marbles for is losing goes to a corner of the playground and sulks. The right honourable member should not forget that, with his undoubted ability, he is still able to render great service to his country, but he will never be able to do so while he continues to ventilate petty personal grievances. I remind the right honourable member of tbe biblical phrase, "" I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness "". In this connection I am also reminded of these words in the 3rd chapter of St. James, verse 6And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity, to sayso is the tongue among,our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. And as things are we can do nothing effective. He also introduced into his speech a limerick concerning the young lady of Riga. The right honourable gentleman reminds me of the nursery rhyme which runsHumpty dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty dumpty had a great fall; All the king's horses and all the king's men Could not put humpty dumpty together again. There were a few references in the right honourable gentleman's speech to the subject-matter of the bill to which I should like to briefly refer. He went to great pains to support the Pederal Arbitration Court, and to show that the Government should not relinquish the powers which it is at present exercising. Yet, in speaking on the Crimes Bill on the 10th February, 1926, the right honourable gentleman saidThis is the national Parliament of Australia. We have been given a mandate to deal with industrial turmoil, to use our utmost endeavours to insure industrial peace. But when all is said and done, we have to make the humiliating confession that we have not the but, unfortunately, a good power to deal effectively with this great question. We cannot make an industrial law; we cannot make a law relating to corporations, or trusts, or combines; we cannot deal with the inatter directly, or get to close grips with it. These industrial disputes arise out of the conflicting interests between organized labour and organized capital. We have no power whatever to deal with organized labour directly. We cannot make a law relating to labour and industry. We cannot make a law dealing with corporations as they ought to be dealt with. We have no power over organized labour, nor organized capital. We cannot make a law securing uniform hours of labour throughout this country, and at this juncture nothing is more necessary than just such a law. In New South Wales there is a law prescribing a 44""keeps,"" and who when he hours' working week, but its operation is confined to the territory of that State. In Victoria and in the other States the working week is one of 48 hours. This difference will create endless difficulties, and will be most prolific of those very disputes that we are trying to prevent. We should be able to pass an industrial law to secure uniformity of labour conditions and to clothe the arbitration court with power to make a common rule. We have no such power. The statement continuesBy this bill we shall be able to deal only with some kinds of transport, and not with all kinds. We cannot deal, for instance, with a strike on State railways. The right honourable gentleman went on The people sent us here to do something. We are now at the beginning of a new Parliament. The Government, returned by an overwhelming majority, has a mandate if any Goernment ever had, to go to the root of this matter. But we can only play with it unless we amend the Constitution, and give this national Government the power to deal with these things which every other Government has. We talk about dealing with industrial questions, and I do not care what measures the Government introduces its power is so limited that its choice of methods is not very wide. When industrial unrest arises out of a dispute between organized labour and organized capital, whether corporation, combine or trust, we have no power to deal with either party. A Parliament so constituted is national only in name. It might be claimed that the right honourable gentleman slipped a bit that day, and did not realize what he was saying. disprove that, I shall quote what he said when speaking on the Constitutional Alteration (Industries and Commerce) B ill on the 3rd of June, 1927. My extract is to be found at page 2595 of Wansard, volume 133, and it readsThe situation imposes upon us the solemn duty of looking at these proposals most carefully, in order that the Parliament may be lifted out of its present humiliating position. As things are now, it can deal with neither labour nor capital. control any union or any company in this country. It cannot protect a union, nor can it prosecute one. It cannot even make a uniform company law. And then he repeated what he had said on the second reading of the CrimesB ill , whicli I have already read.. being so, what are we to think of when he now contends that the federal authority should handle industrial problems? Four different referendums have been taken, asking the people if they were prepared to extend the powers of tbe Commonwealth Government, and in each case the verdict was in the negative. a referendum it is necessary to obtain a majority of the electors and a two-thirds majority of the States. ""Western Australia, Tasmania, and South Australia are very, hard hit as a result of federation, and, although Western Australia and Tasmania are receiving grants, and South Australia is claiming a grant from this Parliament because of the disabilities' under which they are suffering, they are not prepared to clothe this Parliament with any additional powers. were held to-morrow it is probable that the result would be a greater majority than the last against handing over further power to the Commonwealth Government. Honourable members opposite have had a real good innings at the expense of the State Parliaments. They claim that this Government is throwing the workers to the wolves. Apparently their assumpMr Parsons tion is that when John Jones is a federal elector he is an angel, but when he is a State elector he is a wolf. W it h the exception of Queensland, whicli for political purposes stands aloof and at each election reproduces its 30,000 electoral ""ghosts,"" the States of the Commonwealth and the Federal Government To have joint electoral rolls. Apparently, honourable members opposite think that when those whose names are on these rolls are voting as federal electors all is well, but if it is a State election the same electors, according to honourable membersopposite, are wolves. From this it must be concluded that the persons whom the wolves elect to the State Parliament are super-wolves. It is a great, reflection upon our British parliaI t cannot legislate to mentary institutions to contend that the six State Parliaments are nothing but the dens of vicious wolves. In all the States there are hundreds of thousands of electors who are members of unions. I suppose that, on the reasoning of honourable members opposite, they, too, arc wolves. That NowI have a very high regard for the the right honourable gentleman, honourable member for South Sydney( Mr. E. Riley). He is au old industrialist who has spent a lifetime in tbe service of the workers of the country: a man who is obviously sincere in his opinions. This is what he had to say at page 1053 of Hansard, volume 113, on the 19th FebruTo.win ary, 1926, when dealing with the Crimes BillI remember when Mr B. R. Wise, the A t present Attorney-General of a Liberal administration in New South Wales, introduced the first arbitration legislation passed by an Australian Parliament. As a result of that legislation there were no strikes in New South Wales for some time. But that legislation was entirely different from the existing arbitration legislation of the Commonwealth, and for that reason strikes are now more frequent than they were then. Under the legislation of New South Wales, to which I have referred, the employers and the employees had direct representation on the bench. Their representatives If a referendum appointed a chairman. That was real arbitration. I have no doubt that the honourable member still holds that opinion. was referring to industrial machinery that was in operation about 21 years ago. ber is unable to explain the metamorphosis that has taken place.

633,Mr Parsons,"The honourable memdirect my attention to what the Australasian Council of Trade Unions has to say on this subject. This statement cannot be too frequently repeated. Everybody who .reads the newspapers will remember that until the proposal of the Commonwealth Government to relinquish federal arbitration was put before the Premiers' Conference, there had beeu bitter and vile attacks in the press upon the federal arbitration system. The workers had been instructed by their "" misleaders "" to resist the award of the Federal Arbitration Court, and it is interesting to find the following statement in the Pan-Pacific Worker on the 2nd April, 1928:It is impossible to estimate the moral harm which has been done to the Australian working class by its hasty and ill-considered acceptance of arbitration as the solution of Labour's problems. The vehement opinions of the Pan-Pacific Worker were endorsed by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, which passed a resolution on 15th May, 1028, expressing f u l l satisfaction with the character and. tone of the publication. On the 14th July, 1927, the Council of the Australian Eailways Union passed a resolution declaring that "" the perpetuation of arbitration is to the detriment of the organized workers of the Commonwealth, and the Australian Eailways Union in particular."" A second resolution called for collective action on the part of the working class in opposition to what it called the ""chloroforming effects of arbitration courts."" Those resolutions were again affirmed in May last. been endorsed by the Australian Eailways Union. able members the facts.

The following is from a report published in the Sydney Morning Herald on the 11th February of this year:As a means of resisting future awards of the Arbitration Court which may determine upon, the 48-hour week being worked in other industries, the conference of unions convened by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions decided, on Saturday, 1)th February, 1929, to institute a boycott against the court. The following resolution was passed:"" T h a t all unions now ibeforc the Federal Arbitration Court be urged not to proceed with their claims or to appear before the court officially."" Arbitration at that time was supposed to have outlived its usefulness; it should be cut out; unionists should have nothing more to do with it. Now the Government proposes to do the very thing the unions were then asking and the unions are opposing it. Why? For the simple reason that it is being done by this Government. If the union leaders express themselves as being in favour of the Government's proposal it would be tantamount to admitting that somebody other than themselves was able to take an interest in the "" poor unfortunate workman."" That is why, in 1926, although the proposal for wider Commonwealth power was supported by every member in this House, with the exception of two, when it was discussed here, the Labour organizations outside opposed it when it was submitted to the people at the referendum, and during the campaign itself Opposition members were mostly either silent or took the negative side. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) took part in a meeting in the Sydney Town Hall on the 18th February, 1929, in support of the timber workers' strike. Consider what it means that a member of our National Parliament, sworn te give true allegiance to the King, should take an active part in a meeting in support of the timber workers' strike. As a lawmaker of this country the honourable member is expected to support the laws. An award of the Arbitration Court is made under the law, and if members of Parliament break that law how can we hope that it will be respected by any one else. When a minister of religion of any sect whatever breaks the moral law, it gives greater scandal in the community than when a layman does and honourable memthe same thing, and his action reflects upon tbe dignity and prestige of his",244,Interstate Competition

639,Mr Pabsons,"No w that the Goreligious organization. In this case the Deputy Leader deliberately ""went to a meeting and supported the breaking of the law by the timber workers. He is reported to have spoken as follows:That the timber worker had been singled out as the first group in a general onslaught on the wages and conditions of the Australian workers. It was not a mere accidental outcome of a casual consideration by the Arbitration Court, but part of a well-devised scheme on expect the efforts of the States to be when behalf of the employers of the Commonwealth, acting in conjunction with the Government of Australia and the Governments of the States. He says that he is a believer in arbitration, yet he urged the timber workers to break an award made by the Arbitration Court. He added that he had no belief in arbitration as it was perverted by the Bruce-Page Government. What did he mean by that? Mr Bruee was not on the Arbitration Court bench. The timber workers were not striking against an award made by the Government, not even against one made by that wicked man, Mr Latham. It was an award of the Arbitration Court. Mr Theodore proceededI agree heartily with the action taken by the jurisdictions also differ. The State Industrial timber workers of Australia in resisting this attempt on their conditions. I am a believer in arbitration, and so is the Labour party-of whose platform it is a plank-bu t not arbitraof another or others. tion as it is perverted by the Bruce Government. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not content with inciting unionists to disobey the awards of the court, but he cast reflections upon the court itself. His statement continues ber is not in order in quoting passages which reflect upon the court. protest against that criticism. honourable member must not quote such passages because that would result in the inclusion in Hansard of matter reflecting on the court. Speaker, that you allowed me sufficient latitude to voice my indignation against such statements. Mr Theodore concluded his remarks with the following words:It is not arbitration as it has been adminin Melbourne. The formal proceedings are also istered by the prejudiced court, which makes crimes of those claims that are only the workers' due. The honourable member for Dalley is very much a slave of the wild element of the Labour movement. At one time he was opposed to that element, but since he came south he seems to have been disciplined by it. I propose to show why the federal attempt to control industrial matters has not been so effective as we may reasonably they take up the work. I shall also show how costs of production may be reduced, and how industry may avoid the present waste of effort involved in the administration of industrial awards. The existing conflict between State and Federal control of industry is tersely summed up in the following statement of Dr. Hewittson, President of the South Australian Industrial Court, in the following words:There are two Commonwealth awards operating in the same field as the (State) determination. The resulting' complications arc chaotic. If it were desired to design such a situation it might be conceived by the disordered mental efforts of a commission of lunatics. Not only are there two living wage rates arrived at by different methods and different authorities-the very basis of the two Board regulates the whole industry as scheduled. Some of the employees in the industry are members of one general union, some Each union may go to the Commonwealth court and get an award on classifications and on rates which conflict with the determination rates, if not with each other. These incongruous regulations are intruded into the indust r i a l machinery of the board, machinery which has been adjusted to work in co-ordination and unison with the local industrial scheme. The consequences arc the very opposite of those intended or desired. There is confusion, harassment and unrest, instead of industrial order and peace. The mischief is intensified when men in the same nominal classification or doing the same kind of labour, work sometimes side by side for different rates of pay. Dealing with the inconvenience and expense caused to parties appearing before the Federal Arbitration Court, Dr. Jethro Brown, who was then President of the South Australian Industrial Court, said As proceedings in the federal court have been conducted in the past, great inconvenience anil expense have been caused to the parties. As a general rule, compulsory conferences (which precede the formal litigation) are held generally opened there, and as much as possible of the formal hearing conducted there.

643,Mr Parsons,"I am glad, Mr thirteen years agoin cases, it is customary for the court to sit there after proceedings in Melbourne are completed. The court then sometimes sits in other places, though the tendency of the court has been to avoid this wherever possible. mode of procedure has proved very inconvenient and expensive to South Australian parties. Apart from the actual time spent in attendance at the hearing, proceedings are seldom continuous, and time is wasted in awaiting a resumption of the hearing, and in travelling to and from the place of hearing. This applies not only to the advocates for parties, but also to the parties themselves who must be in attendance to instruct their advocate us well as to give formal evidence. Under this system high salaried officers and representatives of the workers in an industry have to leave the job and often waste time for long periods in the capital city of another State waiting for their case to come before the court. The managing heads of industrial units, instead of concentrating on the job of making a better article for a lower price, have to spend their time arguing cases before ""the court, and all this adds to the cost of production. The artificial creation of disputes has been one of the most disastrous developments of the federal arbitration system. It was characterized by Mr Justice Griffith as "" a fraud on the Constitution."" The practice of creating industrial disputes by the service of logs of claims, and the refusal of those claims by employers, has been held by the High Court to be legal. Yet no one has ever pretended that it -was within the comtemplation of those in whose minds the Constitution had its birth. Nor Avas it held to be legal without a spirited opposition from Sir Samuel Griffith who protested that "" mere mischief makers cannot by the expenditure of a few shillings in paper, ink and postage stamps, create such a dispute."" Dr. Jethro Brown, an ex-President of the Industrial' Court of South Australia said:By the irony of fate, this sub-section of the Commonwealth Constitution which was designed to prevent, and if possible, settle, industrial disputes of an interstate character, has been the means of increasing them. One of the greatest difficulties of our federal awards is that the right atmosphere cannot be created in a court sitting at a great distance from the seat of the dispute. State courts, because of their knowledge of the local conditions, would be in a much better position to deal effectively with disputes, because they would be guided by first hand knowledge, and would not have to call so much formal evidence. Climatic, geographical, and This geophysical conditions are so diverse in Australia, and economic conditions and social customs so different in various localities, that no federal tribunal can hope so to frame its awards that justice will be done to all who must obey them. Last Christmas time. I visited Western Australia, where I could not but feel that although I was in Australia, the atmosphere was entirely different from that of the eastern States. The people there did not know their fellow citizens of the other portions of Australia as those citizens know one another. The long stretch of railway separating Western Australia from the eastern States makes that State different from the rest of Australia. The aspirations of its people are different; their fiscal views are different; even the political Labour party in Western Australia holds entirely different views from those held by the Pederal Labour party. The Labour Premier of Western Australia, Mr Collier, welcomed with open arms the suggestion that the State should take over the control of its industrial affairs. If honourable members have any doubt as to the opinion in Western Australia about industrial matters, I advise them to visit that State during its centenary celebrations, and learn for themselves the feeling there. What we want in industrial affairs is less politics, less angling for votes, less looking to a next election. I am proud of the Prime Minister and those members supporting him in connection with this bill because of the criticism to which they have been subjected. What has been the chief argument of those who have endeavoured to persuade honourable members to oppose this measure? They have said, in effect, "" we have so many hundreds, or thousands, of members iu our unions. If you vote for this bill, you will go out at the next election."" That is equivalent to saying "" Do not do what you think is right; but think of the next election."" Par too often political considerations have overridden the best interests of the country. I may be wrong, but I hold the view that if members' political actions were always to the better to close the doors of Parliament. I am reminded of the story of the candidate for political honors who after having delivered an address to the electors, said. "" Ladies and gentlemen, those are my views; if you do not like them tell me what you want me to say, and I w ill amend my views to suit your desires."" That is entirely wrong. The attitude of a candidate for Parliament should be rather-""Electors, those are iny views, my honest convictions. I may be wrong, but though the heavens f a l l , though you throw me into utter darkness, I. would rather go down fighting and holding those views, than prostitute myself by suiting my views to your desires."" There would be more peace in industry Commission. Fortunately, that inquiry if it were not for men known as has ended.

There would be greater prosperity, and life would be much more worth living, if the pin-pricking which exists in industry to-day were to cease. A little more of the milk of human kindness in our dealings one with the other, a little more harmony and good w ill among those engaged in industry would usher in a new and better industrial era.

I congratulate the Government upon having introduced the bill. My opinions on the subject with which it deals are too well known to the House to need reiteration now. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) and myself put our position quite clearly to honourable members three years ago when we found ourselves standing against every other honourable member. I am glad that, at last, the Government has realized the necessity of giving the States complete control of their own domestic legislation. Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) remarked that the darkest hour was always just before the dawn. I hope that we are now passing through the darkest hour of our industrial history. With the passage of this measure I trust that we shall forget the spirit of enmity and antagonism which at present exists in the field of industry, and that the people of Australia will come to realize the necessity of producing more wealth if they wish to enjoy substantial prosperity. This is one of the best moves that the Government has yet made, and I hope that it will mark the end of the wretched political interference with the industries of the country. Like the honourable member for Barker( Mr M. Cameron) I shall vote for the second reading of the bill. amendment of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) is moved L shall vote against it. and Minister for External Affairs) [11-5 a.m.] -This measure has been exhaustively debated, and everything that could be said against the proposals of the Government must surely have been saidSome honourable members have complained that they waited in vain to hear from me any reasons for supporting the bill. may reply that I have waited in vain to hear any substantial reasons why the measure should not be supported. The few reasons that have been repeated so Consequently, I was often in the debate have not changed my opinion that the measure is a wise one, and will be of the greatest possible benefit to Australia.. It is remarkable I that so few reasons could be urged against the Government's proposals. Most of the speeches in opposition to the bill followed the same lines, no new adverse argument having been advanced since early in the discussion. I shall, therefore, have no difficulty in showing that there is no substance in the criticism to which the bill has been subjected, and that the arguments on which the criticism was based are weak in the extreme. I shall not deal at any length with the insinuation of some honourable members that the Government was actuated by improper motives in introducing the bill. That insinuation is much to be regretted, for it has lowered the tone of one of the The honourable member for most important debates that has occurred in this House. orable gentleman's attitude in every debate whenever he is opposed. to be so, because of the honourable gentleman's methods. I am certain that this insinuation will carry no weight either in this Parliament or in the country. Many may believe the arbitration policy of the Government to be unwise, but few will dream of attributing the introduction of the bill to impropermotives, and those who do will have been misled by untrue statements as to the object and intention of the Government respecting arbitration. If the proposed The most sinister suggestions, the most poisonous and offensive charges, were made by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). It is a tragedy that a gentleman who held the high and honourable position of Prime Minister of this country for so many years should descend to the methods that he adopted the other night. His insinuations, and, in fact, most of his speech were directed against myself. He said that the measure had been brought down to save me, and that I could no longer pose I as one who would administer the laws impartially. He declared that the withdrawal of the John Brown prosecution",248,Interstate Competition

If honourable members will consider what those charges amount to, they will realize how degrading it was for the right honourable member to have made them. The implication was that I have introduced a measure in which I do not believe, and which will be of no benefit to the country, simply to try to save my own political life. would suggest a thing like that? the honourable member for Dalley( Mr The States will again haye complete conTheodore) to understand that any one should act from honourable motives. His whole record shows that an attitude of responsibility, and appreciation of the decencies of life, would never appeal to him. I have felt it necessary to refer to these charges because the people should understand the depths to which some politicians can descend in a party controversy of this kind. Such an attitude towards a measure which is of vital importance to the whole Commonwealth is almost tragic. There are few other points in the remarks of the right honourable member for North Sydney to which I wish to refer. His speech must have caused considerable disappointment to every member of the House; it certainly did to me. I am always prepared to honour an opponent, and I entered the chamber when the right honourable member rose to speak in the expectation of hearing from him an address of the brilliancy of which he is capable, a keen analysis of the Government's proposals, aud some helpful contribution to the debate. But he did not give us anything of the kind. The right honourable gentleman seems, unfortunately, to have developed a considerable dislike to myself, and this clouded his whole speech, with the result that his contribution to the debate was valueless. Of course, he said some delightful things. He gave f u l l rein to his feelings in his allusions to myself. There was his reference to me as a dilettante in politics, and the picture he drew of me springing from stunt to stunt. This must have been particularly amusing to those who remember the right honourable gentleman's own path in politics. There was little else in his speech to which I shall allude. A point much stressed by the opponents of the bill was that if it became law the workers of this country would lose an institution which, in the past, had -safeguarded them from exploitation and injustice, and had made possible the standard of living of which we all are proud. There is no justification for that objection. All that the bill does is to end the dual control of industry by abolishing the Federal Arbitration Court, and leaving to the States the regulation of their own industries, which is not a new thing. trol of their own industrial affairs, and the worker, and the honourable and decent employer, will therefore still enjoy protection against unfair treatment and the competition of unscrupulous rivals. There will still be the regulation of wages, factories acts, workmen's compensation acts, and all the protective legislation that, has gradually brought about the industrial system that we now enjoy. Yet the right honourable gentleman from North SydneyI quote him to show the exaggeration in which he indulged-sai d that the withdrawal of the Commonwealth from the field of arbitration will mean that the workers will return to the "" economic desolation "" from which the federal court now protects them. Could any statement be more ridiculous, when all that will happen is that dual control will cease, and industrial regulation will be left to the State authorities subject to the legislation of the State Parliaments, whose electors are the very same persons who return members to the Commonwealth Parliament? There is no justification whatever for saying that the bill will take from the workers the industrial protection which they have enjoyed in the past. We know that, to a great extent, this statement is made for a political purpose, to influence the workers against the measure; but the people of this country are far too intelligent to be misled by such gross and palpable misrepresentation. Possibly the outstanding contention, and that on which most stress was laid, was that the Government had no mandate from the people for this proposed legislation. In introducing the bill, I dealt with that aspect of the case, and declined to",249,Interstate Competition

I told the people that arbitration was an experiment, and that unless awards were obeyed, it would be impossible to continue the system, as to do so in such circumstances would bring the law into contempt, and if that happened the whole basis of our civilisation would be undermined. Unquestionably, the people were told, time and again, that that was the attitude of the Government. Furthermore, the election was fought on the understanding that the Government would take every step in its power to improve industrial conditions, and to bring about better relaof preventing the Prime Minister from tions between employers and their employees. Therefore, the people did give the Government a mandate to take whatever steps it considered would help to bring about industrial peace. We are now moving in that direction,and we accept full responsibility for our proposals. , The speech of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) must have confirmed us all in the opinion that he is a great advocate; but I do not think he impressed the House with his ability as a logician, because the honourable gentleman's argument was not logical, and I shall mention one or two statements in which the absence of logic was most apparent. belt. opposite appear to have misunderstood what I said.

I suggest that his subsequent statements were illogical, for he told us that, after he first heard of the Government's proposals, he assured a deputation that he would keep an entirely open mind until he had learned the details of the proposal, and the arguments with which the Government supported the bill.

Notwithstanding that, the Government, in 1926, asked the people, by referendum, for increased constitutional powers, which would have given the control of industry to the Commonwealth instead of to the States. the point. Nationalist party, at that time, advocated the limitation of the powers of the Commonwealth, and the handing over to the States of the great majority of our industries. was to take the full power over those if did control. posed in this bill.

That is not the position of those in the Nationalist party; it is certainly not a position which I , as Prime Minister, would occupy. in opposition to the party platform, the right honourable gentleman had no criticism of my action to offer, but actually supported me. he dissents from m y action, departure from the strict platform of the party is in his eyes a crime of which no parliamentarian should be guilty. This matter of party loyalty came up for a great deal of discussion during the referendum campaign of 1926, and a spirited controversy on the subject was waged between Senator Massy Greene and Mr Bavin, the Premier of New South Wales. I propose to read a passage from a statement by Senator Massy Greene which I regard as laying down the proper relations of a pblitical leader to the party whose organization is supporting him in the electoratesWe Nationalists hold that, unfettered by any conference resolutions or any printed programmes, our parliamentary leaders have the right to put their policy to the people when appealing for their support at a general election, and if they receive the endorsement of the people, the endorsement necessarily determines the policy of tlie National party on the issues of that election. The principle thus enunciated I shall certainly maintain so long as I am the political leader of any party. Another criticism of the bill is that it will not remove duplication of jurisdiction. Honourable members on both sides of the House have declared that the Government is merely proposing to substitute six systems for the seven now existing, and that from this change little advantage cau accrue. The honourable member for Fawkner, on this point also, was illogical. He said that we are getting rid of the federal",252,Interstate Competition

685,Mr Beuce,"Yet now, in 1929, whenhave to ask ourselves is-Will the individual worker or employer in his industry be governed by one system or two? By the action the Government is taking, duplication is being removed, because there will be only one control over each individual worker or employer. In the future only one authority will control each individual and each industry. Then it was said that the action of the Government would destroy uniformity. Many speakers have assumed that uniformity exists at the present time, an assumption that must have been dissipated in the course of the debate. the statements of many honourable members, one would think that under the federal arbitration system there is a closer approximation to uniformity throughout Australia in regard to the basic wage thau under the several State systems; that is not so. On the 1st August, 1929, the greatest divergence in the federal basic wage was the difference between £4 Os. 6d. paid in Brisbane and £4 14s. 6d. paid in Sydney, the figures for other capital cities being £4 8s. 6d. for Adelaide, £4 6s. 6d. for Perth and £4 5s. 6d. for Hobart. Under.the awards of the States the greatest divergence is only that between £4 5s. and £4 7s., the former figure relating to New South Wales, and the latter to Western Australia. In South Australia the State basic wage is £4 5s. 6d. and in Queensland £4 5s. so far as the basic wage is concerned, it cannot be contended that the removal of the Federal Arbitration Court will destroy uniformity. bring us nearer to uniformity. It must be remembered, too, that only twelve federal awards operate throughout Australia. In Queensland there are only 26 federal awards operating out of a total of 125. It has been argued that where there is a federal award it overrides any State award, and therefore is the only award that is operating; but that is not so. Where there is a federal award, it does not mean that the whole of the corresponding State award is superseded. It would, perhaps, be more satisfactory if that were the position. only those parts of State awards that are inconsistent with a federal award are superseded, with the result that industries have to be carried on under both. Ur. Bruce. Probably that has contributed more than anything else to the difficulties in which industry finds itself at the present time. A strong plea has been made for uniformity in the interest of interstate trade and interstate competition. But, if we wish to arrive at uniformity on that basis, we shall have to go much further than any one has yet suggested. There are other factors which interfere much more seriously with interstate competition, the outstanding one probably being the legislation passed by the State of Accepting New South Wales making provision for a 44-hour week. It is impossible at this stage to obtain uniformity in that regard. We should need to centralize all power and all control, making the Commonwealth Parliament the sole authority dealing with taxation and innumerable other matters which to-day are within the sovereign jurisdiction of the States, and in regard to which State laws vary greatly. The disappearance of the Federal Arbitration Court will not have the slightest effect upon that position. disappearance of the federal court will a federated industry be subject to. only one supreme control? agreements on a federal basis will be arrived at voluntarily, and registered with the State authorities, so that, instead of awards On the contrary, it will being binding only upon the parties to them, as is the case to-day, there may be a common rule. The existence of the federal court has enabled many centralized federal unions to be built up, and those who are connected with them are determined, if possible, to keep them in existence. That is one of the principal reasons for the large influx of visitors into Canberra during the last few days. When this measure is passed, those federated unions will have an incentive to come to amicable and voluntary agreements with the employers, so as to preserve their federal character. They will be induced Unfortunately, however, to do that because there will be no authority to control any award on a federal basis. Those who are associated with federal unions in an executive capacity will know that their positions",253,Interstate Competition
686,Mr Maxwell,In the event of the,254,Interstate Competition
687,"Therefore, Mr Bruce","I sincerely .trust thatwill depend upon the retention of their federal character, consequently they will strive for voluntary co-operation. The question has been asked why the Government has changed its attitude, and the honourable member for Fawkner wished to know why no indication of the proposed change was given at the time of the last election, or when Parliament was sitting earlier in the year. The suggestion behind his remarks was that the circumstances are exactly the same now as they were in 1926, and as they were at the time when the last election was held, and when this Parliament sat in February and March. That is not so. During last Act was amended, the object being to make a final attempt to operate the system successfully. The Government endeavoured to obviate overlapping, and to make provision for a greater use of the machinery of conciliation. It aimed at giving to the general mass of trade unionists control over, their own organizations, more, unions giving financial support to and ensuring the observance of awards by both sides. The act, as amended, came into operation last year, just prior to the whelming majority of the unionists who federal elections. . The Government hoped that both sides would obey awards and that the system would operate satisfactorily. On the eve of the election, however, trouble occurred on the waterfront. To deal with it, the Government had to make use of the trade and commerce power, and passed the Transport Workers Act. The conditions on the water-front were completely revolutionized. There had been outbreaks of violence in practically every capital city, accompanied by bomb outrages. We then saw to what lengths some persons were prepared to go in defiance of the law. gentleman blaming the trade unionists ? unionists, but I am blaming many honourable members who sit opposite for not having had the courage to denounce what occurred. Later, a strike occurred in the ranks of the timber workers, in defiance of an award of the Arbitration Court, and there were attacks upon voluntary workers who were trying to carry on under the award. Intimidation and violence were resorted to in Sydney and Melbourne. Nefarious practices were indulged in by basher gangs. Having no police force in the various States, the Commonwealth had to rely upon the States to uphold its laws and prevent violence. In Sydney the spectacle was witnessed of a judge of the Arbitration Court being burnt in effigy. that the right honourable gentleman's sense of responsibility would have restrained him from making such an interjection. Further, when we were attempting to enforce a Commonwealth law in which provision was made for giving men engaged in industry an opportunity to determine the issue by means of a secret Parliament the Arbitration ballot, unionists were so intimidated that they could not express their opinions. The ballot-papers were burned, and the Commonwealth Government was powerless to prevent such action. Again, a new atmosphere was created in connection with the timber workers' strike, and we found between 50 and 60, or possibly other unionists who were defying an award of the Arbitration Court. An overwere contributing to strike funds in the form of levies were enjoying the benefits of awards of the Oommonwealth Arbitration Court. Last year the arbitration system was being defied and repudiated by Labour leaders. Eesponsibility for that rests upon honourable members opposite and their friends, who present a ludicrous spectacle now that they are trying to pose as the champions and apostles of the Arbitration Court and the observance of its awards. The people of Australia will not be. deceived. That is one aspect of the altered situation that should not be overlooked by the honourable member for Fawkner. When we went to the electors it was hoped that the depression through which the country was then passing was merely temporary and such as we have many times experienced in the past, but that good seasons would be restored and our financial difficulties would disappear. The position has, however, become worse, and it is now clear that the depression is not temporary but is due to some fundamental defect in our economic life. That is clearly demonstrated in connection with our loan finance. Honourable members are aware of the difficulties experienced by the",254,Interstate Competition

691,Mr Beuce,"I should have thoughtCommonwealth and State governments in obtaining their necessary loan requirements. A big cut was made in the loan estimates last May, but the position has since become worse, and the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the treasurers of the States have agreed to a further cut of 20 per cent. This rendered it necessary for definite action to be taken. A most important factor in this connection is the drop in price of merino wool. The right honourable member for North Sydney asked, ""Is there a cause for this? There might be something in support of the Prime Minister's policy if there had been a tremendous f a l l . in wool prices."" But the. primary producers have had sufPerhaps the right honourable gentleman is not aware that there has been a tremendous drop in the price of wool. recently in Adelaide. member should be better informed on these matters. The price of wool started to fall about October last-whe n the price was lower than in the previous year-and by February the position was accentuated by progressive falls that represented a reduction of from 25 to 32 per cent., and at the last sale there was a further drop. The prices of wheat and wool-ou r two great staple commodities which constitute about 56 per cent, of our exports and upon which the whole of our finances are based-hav e dropped, and our position makes it clear that steps, will have to be taken to reduce the cost of production. Happily there has been a recovery in the price of wheat which dropped heavily, but we must recognize that that recovery is due to seasonal conditions in another part of the world., and we are not entitled to take it into consideration in studying our future position. All these things have happened during the last few months, and make it essential that we should look to the future. The only way in which we can hope to solve our problems is by reducing the cost of production. member for North Sydney discounted practically everything I said on this subject, and stated that the cost of production could be reduced only by reducing wages. He pointed at me the finger of scorn, suggesting that I would reduce wages if I had the opportunity. But I would remind him of some of the things he has said and done. In 1922, when presiding at a conference of employers and employees convened to deal with the economic situation, he definitely stated thatThey could not reduce prices unless they reduced wages. As prices climbed wages also climbed and that if prices had to come down wages must come down also. The right honourable gentleman said that I was iu favour of reducing wages and that he would not be associated with any action of that kind. He then proceeded in what I would describe as an attempt to get the farmers on his side, ficient experience of the right honourable gentleman to prevent him from getting away with that. He asked: Would we reduce the price of wheat, meat and other commodities which the farmers are producing ? Do the farmers want a reduction of prices? The farmers have sufficient intelligence to know that before they would be asked to accept a reduction of the prices of their products the prices of the articles which they buy would have to come down. There have been great developments throughout the worfd in recent years, and the cost of production in the Commonwealth can be reduced more by improving our methods and by close co-operation between the parties in industry than by reducing wages. If we can achieve that we shall derive a double benefit. We shall get increased purchasing power and at the same time a reduction of the cost of living. The right honourable gentleman asked, ""How are you going to do it?"" It will be our endeavour to bring those engaged in industry closer together. What is being done in America? In that country both sides realize that it is in their interest to increase production and efficiency, and under that system both parties benefit. The employers and the workers are beginning to realize that high wages increase the purchasing power of the people. . If we can get both The right honourable parties together we may be able to achieve a great deal. If this measure is passed by Parliament an opportunity will be provided for closer co-ordination by removing the duplication of systems that we have at present.

I repudiate that statement. I objected to the right honourable gentleman's statement at the time, and he said, "" I do not blame the unionists. You are responsible for the bomb throwing."" I repudiate that statement, too, and throw the vile slander back into the face of the Prime Minister. bombing outrages, and the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) suggests that in my remarks I associated outrages to unionists. jected to that effect I immediately said that I made no such suggestion.

[12.30] -(B y leave)-The Government Blakeley, A. has been giving very careful consideration Mathews, J. to the question of the for m of control that McGrath, D. C. should obtain in the future in the Federal Capital Territory, having regard to the fact that the' period of office of the Chief Commissioner will expire on the 2nd of November next. It is clear that in the immediate future it w ill not be practicable to proceed with the development of the capital city at the same rate as was necessary during the period of the transference of the Parliament and the first Government departments brought from Melbourne. During the past four years the annual expenditure within the Territory has averaged over £1,800,000. In the year 1926-27, the expenditure amounted to £2,437,607. For the year 1929-30, it is not possible to provide more than £705,000. The extent a four-day week? The right of the curtailment of the constructional and developmental programme which this reduced provision w ill necessitate w ill be readily apparent. The Chief Commissioner, Sir John Butters, was among the first to realize that the altered situation would, not j u s t i fy the continuance of the by honourable members high salary hitherto associated with his position. He pointed out that his interest was largely concerned with the developmental side of the national capital, and intimated that he did not propose to ask for an extension of his appointment beyond the 2nd of November. In accepting the resignation of . Sir John Butters, the Government desires to place on record its deep appreciation of the services he has rendered to Canberra and its recognition of the efficiency, with which he has carried out, under conditions of great difficulty, the important and"" responsible duties assigned to him.",257,Interstate Competition

In doing so, the Government desires to acknowledge the valuable assistance it has received from Mr Goold during his terra of office. The retirement of. Sir John Butters and Mr Crosby Goold, and the curtailment of the developmental expenditure haa compelled Ministers to consider the form of the future government of the capital. After come to the conclusion that it would be' premature, and not in the interests either of the Territory or of its residents, to alter the existing form of government during the present transitional period, and we propose to continue the Commission for a further period of at least twelve months. Parliament wil l then probably be in a better position to formulate more permanent proposals for the government of the Pederal Capital Territory. It is accordingly proposed to appoint Mr A. J.
