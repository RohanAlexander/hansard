(3) For each year since 2001, how many tenders for the delivery of health, pharmacy and dental services were let to (a) incorporated entities and (b) individuals (4) Is the department aware of contractor disquiet over the tender process for these services, in particular, with claims of irregularities such as (a) documents requesting incorrect qualifications for particular positions, (b) the required business and professional insurances being difficult to arrange, and (c) information at public meetings addressed by Area Health Service (AHS) South Queensland personnel being inconsistent. (5) Is the department aware that some practitioners currently doing the work have refused to participate in the tendering process because the process was so poor. (6) Is the department aware that even some applicants who were identified as preferred tenderers resigned in disgust and refused to participate further in the process. (7) Is the department aware that some applicants, on receiving the letters of the successful tenderers resigned immediately, disgusted with the process. (8) Has the department sought to cover these sudden vacancies by sourcing staff from employment agencies; if so, (a) which agencies provided staff, (b) how many staff have been placed by agencies, and (c) how many new staff needed to be trained in Defence procedures. (9) Did the AHS assure contractors that if they had the technical experience but their price was too high, the AHS would negotiate first with those identified as being the most technically able to provide the service; if not, why not. (10) Why did the AHS tell contractors in South Queensland that they should sign up with an agency prior to tendering submissions as well as putting in individual tenders. (11) Is it the case that companies that are in negotiations with the AHS are applying pressure to staff to sign with them for $3 to $4 per hour less than they are currently receiving with the threat that, if they reject the proposal, they will not be considered for Defence employment; if so, how does the Minister justify this. (12) Can the Minister confirm that the mandatory qualifications for the employment of general and other medical practitioners by the AHS South Queensland are (a) qualifications as a Medial Practitioner and eligible for unrestricted registration in the State or Territory of application, (b) vocational registration, undergoing an appropriate program of medical training or able to show evidence of active participation in continuing professional development, and (c) strong oral and written communication skills and the ability to communicate at all levels of the organisation. (13) Since1 September 2003, have all medical practitioners employed by the AHS South Queensland directly or by a firm contracted by the AHS South Queensland to provide medical practitioners met these mandatory qualifications; if not, why were they employed. (14) Since1 September 2003, have any firms been contracted by the AHS South Queensland to provide medical practitioners; is so, what are the names of those firms. (1) No. Defence is planning to withdraw the instruction as it no longer meets Commonwealth and Defence policy requirements. Future contracting for civilian health practitioners will be undertaken using current approved Defence contracting templates. (2) Chapter 4.10 of the Defence Procurement Policy Manual states “…wherever possible, it is strongly recommended that contracts not be entered into with natural persons.” A natural person is defined as an individual rather than a company or partnership, who contracts to provide goods or services to Defence. (3) The information requested is not readily available. Collation of the information requested would involve an unreasonable use of Defence resources to manually search through thousands of contract files around the country. (4) (a), (b), (c) Defence is aware that a number of contractors were unhappy with the tender process and some have claimed irregularities with various aspects of the tender process. (5) Defence is aware that some contractors were unhappy with the tender process and chose not to submit a tender. (6) and (7) Defence is aware that some tenderers voluntarily withdrew from the tender process prior to the awarding of contracts. Information on their reasons for withdrawal from the tender process is not available. Defence is not aware of existing contractors ‘resigning’ because of the tender process. Contractors are unable to ‘resign’ per se, and have a contractual obligation to provide services until their contract expires. Contracts may be terminated early through mutual agreement between the contractor and Defence. This occurs from time to time for a variety of reasons. Defence does not keep information on the reasons for contractors seeking an early termination of their contract. Known reasons include poor health, changed family commitments, pregnancy, further education, and alternative full-time work. (8) (a), (b), (c) Vacancies caused by tenderers not proceeding to contract or terminating their contracts prior to their expiry date are filled either through accessing companies on the National Standing Offer Panel to provide the required services, or through an open tender process. All staff engaged by Defence are provided assistance at the local level to familiarise them with Defence procedures and documentation. It is not possible to separately identify information relating to tenderers terminating their contracts as a result of the National Standing Offer tender process. (9) No. The overarching requirement for all Commonwealth procurement is value for money. Tenders with high technical merit and high prices may not represent good value for money. Defence enters negotiations with those tenderers that represent best value for money, and is under no obligation to enter negotiations with all tenderers. (10) Individual health providers may improve their chances of gaining contract work with Defence if they tender through multiple entities. There were no formal discussions to this effect by Defence or Area Health Service South Queensland. (11) Defence is not a party to negotiations between tenderers and their employees or potential employees over employment conditions, and is unable to comment on the matter raised in this question. (12) No. However, the Statement of Work used in the recent tender process for medical officers, includes the mandatory qualifications and experience stated in the question. (13) Yes. (14) Yes. Incorporated entities that have provided medical practitioners to Area Health Service South Queensland since 2003 are as follows:",120,Adjournment A Child Ring Up My Office In Tears Because He

The Department administers the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) and the Living in Harmony initiative under which not-for-profit, incorporated organisations and local government authorities are eligible to apply for funding. The portfolio also administers Commonwealth funding for Migrant Resource Centres and Migrant Service Agencies (MRCs/MSAs). From1 July 2006 the CSSS and MRC/MSA funding will be combined into the new Settlement Grants Programme. Not-for-profit, incorporated organisations, local government authorities and organisations currently funded to deliver services under the Adult Migrant English Programme will be eligible to apply. Within the period in question, the department also administered the Indigenous Women’s Programme and (Indigenous) Public Information Programme for which community organisations of Newcastle could apply for funding. These programs have since been transferred to the renamed Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Portfolio under Administrative Arrangements Order on 27 January 2006.

The Australian Government also delivers part of its Natural Heritage Trust through regional delivery arrangements. Under these arrangements in New South Wales, Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) develop investment strategies, which are the basis for Australian Government investment from this component of the Trust. The electoral division of Newcastle falls within the responsibilities of the Hunter/Central Rivers CMA. While community groups may be the ultimate beneficiaries of funding provided to CMAs through investment strategies, they do not apply directly to the Australian Government for these funds. The CMAs are responsible for allocating funding they receive amongst regional stakeholders according to regional priorities.

The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs administers a wide variety of programs to assist communities, many of which are routinely advertised and have quite comprehensive guidelines.

Status of Forces Agreement (Question No. 2575) (1) Is the Minister aware of the article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 20 October 2005 which quoted Dr Kit Collier, a Philippines expert from the International Crisis Group, as saying that President Gloria Arroyo is in a very weakened position and that she is going to find it very hard to get the two thirds majority in the Philippines Senate for the ratification of the status of forces agreement (SOFA) with Australia. (2) Is it the Government’s assessment that President Gloria Arroyo will be able to get the required two thirds majority in the Philippines’ Senate for ratification of the SOFA with Australia; if not, how does the Australian Government intend to progress cooperation with respect to confronting terrorists in the Southern Philippines. (3) Is it the case that the United States took three years to negotiate its SOFA with the Philippines; if so, why is the Minister so confident that Australia’s agreement is likely to be finalised before Christmas 2005. (4) Will Australian and Philippine forces conduct joint ground troop operations. (5) Will it be possible for Australian troops to be permanently based in the Philippines once the SOFA is signed; if so, what legal rights and immunities will Australian troops based in the Philippines (a) have and (b) forgo. (6) What sum has been (a) allocated and (b) spent this year on counter-terrorism assistance to the Philippines. (7) Are there terrorist organisations, other than Jemaah Islamiah and Abu Sayyaf, that may be operating in Mindanao in the Southern Philippines; if so, what are they and are they prescribed terrorist organisations in Australia. (8) What is Australia currently doing to assist the Government of (a) Indonesia, (b) Malaysia, and (c) Singapore to secure the Malacca Straits from piracy and terrorist attack.",145,Questions In Writing
231,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Defence, In Writing, On 7 November 2005:","(1) Yes. (2) Ratification of a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) by the Philippines legislature is a matter for the Government of the Republic of the Philippines to comment on. In the meantime, Australia will continue to progress Defence cooperation activities with the Philippines such as training, education, seminars and professional exchanges. (3) The conduct of any negotiations between the Governments of the Philippines and the United States is a matter for those two Governments to comment on. The Philippines first raised the possibility of a SOFA in February 2004 and formal negotiations commenced in December 2004. The current status of the negotiations is that the Philippines provided a counter-draft on 31 May 2006. Face-toface negotiations aiming to agree a draft text can now follow. Formal approvals and legislative ratification will take longer. (4) No. (5) (a) and (b) The purpose of the proposed reciprocal SOFA is to provide a more comprehensive legal framework for administrative arrangements to support Australian Defence Force and Armed Forces of the Philippines personnel engaged in Defence Cooperation training and exercise activities in our respective countries. The detailed provisions of the SOFA are still subject to negotiation, but there are no plans to permanently base Australian troops in the Philippines. (6) (a) and (b) Expenditure on counter terrorism assistance to the Philippines involves a range of Government agencies, coordinated through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), of which Defence provides one element. DFAT advise that for financial year 2005-06, $5,527,750 is currently allocated in total by Government agencies for counter terrorism support projects to the Philippines, with $3,672,392 having been spent in the current financial year to 31 March 2006. (7) The Government cannot be sure of what terrorist organisations might be operating beyond those referred to in the question. (8) (a) and (b) The Malacca Strait is the sovereign territory of the littoral states. As such, they will determine the most appropriate method of securing the Strait from piracy and terrorist attack, and advise what assistance they would welcome from countries such as Australia. Australia will consider any request for assistance from the littoral states, and has provided advice based on our own experience with maritime security activities. At this stage, Defence is not providing any direct assistance. Nonetheless, it should be noted that Australia does promote security in the Strait, and more broadly in the region, by helping these countries improve their defence and security capabilities through a wide range of cooperative defence activities. These activities include training, education, seminars and bilateral and multilateral exercises.

Workplace Relations (Question No. 2611) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 9 November 2005: (1) Has he read the article titled ‘PM big on WorkChoices hype, but economists have doubts about the reality’ in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 October 2005 which reported that economists cannot see where all the employment and productivity improvements are supposed to come from and that most economists would be hoping the big employment gains come from lowering the minimum wage. (2) What economic modelling has been undertaken by his department to determine the effect of the changes contained in the Work Choices Bill 2005 on (a) employment levels and (b) wage levels in Australia. (3) Can he confirm that the only economic gains from the Work Choices Bill 2005 will come from lowering the minimum wage; if not, why not. (1) I am aware of the issues raised in the article. (2) My Department engaged the Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) at Monash University to undertake economic modelling of the impact of aspects of the workplace relations reforms on key economic variables such as productivity, wages, employment and GDP. The aspects of workplace reform considered were changes to unfair dismissal laws, the benefits of moving to a national system and the changed wage-setting arrangements. (3) Minimum wages can not fall under the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 – (the Act). Under the Act, minimum wages will be protected at the level set after the inclusion of the increase from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s 2005 Safety Net Review and can not fall below this level. A number of economic gains are expected from WorkChoices such as increased productivity. Productivity improvements are expected to be driven by: the shift of workers reliant on awards to other methods of pay setting such as collective and individual agreements. A number of studies have indicated that workers on agreements exhibit higher productivity than those on awards; and firms no longer having to divert as many resources to compliance tasks associated with two systems of industrial relations (federal and state). Employment growth will be stimulated by changes to the unfair dismissal laws which represented a barrier to employment. Further growth is expected through the simplification of procedures that employers must undertake to comply with workplace laws. The negative impact of the previous unfair dismissal laws was demonstrated by a study titled ‘The Effect of Unfair Dismissal Laws on Small and Medium Sized Businesses’ for the Department by Dr Don Harding of the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research using the (then) Yellow Pages Business Index survey. The study was publicly released on 29 October 2002. It found that:",149,Questions In Writing
234,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:the estimated costs to small to medium sized enterprises of complying with unfair dismissal laws amounted to $1.3 billion per year; and 11.1 per cent of small to medium sized employers that did not have employees but previously did, were influenced by the unfair dismissal laws in deciding to reduce the number of workers they employed. This translated to the loss of 77,842 jobs in which unfair dismissal played some role (35,000 of those in which unfair dismissal laws played a major role). Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs: Small Business Payments (Question No. 2667) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 28 November 2005: (a) how many and (b) what proportion of payments made by the Minister’s department to small business were not made within (i) 30 and (ii) 60 days of receipt of the goods or services and a proper invoice in accordance with Government procurement policy. In the financial year 2004-2005 the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs made 14,990 payments of which 95.99% (14,389) were made within 60 days and 76.47% (11,455) were made within 30 days. Veterans’ Affairs: Small Business Payments (Question No. 2674) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 28 November 2005: For 2004-05, (a) how many and (b) what proportion of payments made by the Minister’s department to small business were not made within (i) 30 and (ii) 60 days of receipt of the goods or services and a proper invoice in accordance with Government procurement policy.

237,Mr Billson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Student Assistance (Question No. 2711) November 2005: (1) What Commonwealth Government programs are intended to assist students who speak English as a second language. (2) In respect of each program identified in part (1), what sum was spent in each of the last five calendar years. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government assists through a number of programmes. The three main programmes are the General Recurrent Grants (GRG) Programme, the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs (LNSLN) Programme, and the English as a Second Language– New Arrivals (ESL-NA) Programme. (2) Total expenditure ($ million) for the GRG Programme, the LNSLN Programme are set out below. Expenditures on ESL students from the GRG Programme and the LNSLN Programme are not available. The table also provides expenditures from the ESL-NA Programme over the last five years ($ million). 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 GRG Programme 4,394.6 4,727.7 5,175.0 5,737.1 6,208.0 ESL-NA Programme 36.0 39.5 48.0 51.9 61.5 Note: From 2005 the LNSLN programme was formed by merging of three programmes (Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme (SAISO), Grants for Literacy Numeracy Strategies and Projects, and Special Education Non-Government Centre Support Programme). To ensure comparison with the 2005 LNSLN, these three programmes’ expenditure has been amalgamated to provide expenditure for 2001-4. Superannuation (Question No. 2715) Ms Hoare asked the former Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 29 November 2005: (1) Can he confirm that when a working Australian reaches the age of 70 years their employer is no longer permitted to make contributions to the worker’s superannuation. (2) Can he explain the rationale for the Government’s policy which prevents employees over the age of 70 years receiving employer contributions to their superannuation funds. (3) Can he confirm it is the Government’s intention to encourage Australians to work beyond the retirement age of 65 years. (4) Has the Government considered changing the legislation to ensure all Australian workers receive employer contributions to their superannuation regardless of their age; if not, why not. (5) Has the Government considered retrospective legislation so that Australians who have worked beyond the age of 70 years will be entitled to back payment of forgone superannuation contributions; if not, why not.

239,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:ductible employer superannuation contributions such as salary sacrifice contributions), with the exception of employer contributions which are required under an award or industrial agreement. InA Plan to Simplify and Streamline Superannuation released on 9 May 2006, the Government announced a proposal to allow employers to make contributions on behalf of their employees up to age 75. An employer will be able to claim a full deduction for such contributions. (2) Refer to the answer for question 1. (3) The Government is committed to providing enhanced opportunities and greater choice for mature age workers, recognising that their skills, experience and ongoing contribution to the labour force will play a vital part in securing Australia’s future economic strength. As part of this commitment, the Government has introduced a new Mature Age Worker Tax Offset for workers aged 55 and over. The offset provides a maximum annual tax rebate of $500 with effect from the 2004-05 income year. Eligibility for the offset is based solely on income from working, so that mature age Australians with income from working who also derive significant income from passive sources, such as superannuation and shares, can still benefit from the offset. To further encourage participation among mature aged workers, from 1 July 2005 individuals who have reached their superannuation preservation age and are still working can access their superannuation as a non-commutable income stream. This change recognises that older Australians may prefer to remain in the workforce but reduce their hours of work as they approach retirement. It allows people who wish to reduce their hours of work to supplement their employment income with income from superannuation. InA Plan to Simplify and Streamline Superannuation the Government has proposed that from 1 July 2007 superannuation benefits paid from a taxed fund for people aged 60 and over would be free of tax. This proposal would boost incentives to work. In addition, the Government has changed the superannuation contribution rules for persons aged 65 to 74. As a result, with effect from 1 July 2004, a person does not have to work every week to make contributions into an account with a superannuation provider. This change recognises that Australians aged 65 to 74, who wish to work, may prefer irregular part-time or short term contract work rather than working every week. (4) The Government increased the maximum employee age limit for employer contributions from age 65 to age 70 from 1 July 1997. InA Plan to Simplify and Streamline Superannuation released on 9 May 2006, the Government announced a proposal to allow employers to make contributions on behalf of their employees up to age 75. An employer will be able to claim a full deduction for such contributions. (5) It would be inappropriate to apply any increase in the maximum employee age limit retrospectively. All taxpayers require certainty in their application of the law, and retrospective application would reduce this certainty. Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry: Contracts (Question No. 2721) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 29 November 2005: How many times since 1 July 2005 has his Department entered into contracts with firms for which the description of the contract is stated as ‘contractors’ and in respect of each occasion, what was (a) the name of the firm, (b) the cost of the services provided and (c) the specific service provided under the terms of the contract.

247,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has provided theFuture Detention Health Strategy Why is a new Detention Health Strategy needed? The reports of Mr Palmer into the Cornelia Rau matter, Mr Comrie into the Vivian Alvarez matter and the recent Ombudsman’s report on the case of Mr T, leveled a number of criticisms at the Department about how it related to people it came into contact regarding some enforcement provisions of the Migration Act 1958. Issues identified included the management of the mental health and well-being of people in immigration detention centres and in compliance activity. Following these reports the Australian Government has developed programs to improve health and mental health for people detained under the Migration Act 1958. The delivery of appropriate and culturally responsive physical and psychological health services, including social support programs, is an essential component in the exercise of powers under the Migration Act 1958 to detain people who are suspected of being in Australia unlawfully. The observations of both Australian courts and recent inquiries into the operations of the Department, accepted in principle by the Australian Government, provide a clear mandate to significant improvements and change. The need for a future Detention Health Strategy has arisen because of identified weaknesses in the current provision of health care for people in immigration detention and the need to improve: The provision of mental health screening, access to specialist services, and knowledge and awareness of mental illness across a range of departmental staff and staff employed by the Detention Service Provider; An understanding of procedures that address both the impact of mental illness on people in immigration detention and how they may relate to the Department; Understanding the effect detention and other enforcement transactions by the Department has on the health and emotional well being of people in immigration detention; Expanding the focus of health services from almost being exclusively focused on clinical care to paying attention to other aspects that impact on well being such as the environment, attitudes and practices of staff as well as psychosocial factors that people bring to their interactions; and Separating the delivery of health services from being part of the security and enforcement arrangements for persons detained, so as to remove perceptions amongst external stakeholders that health care may be compromised. As a result of consultations within the Department and with external stakeholders other issues have been identified that a future Detention Health Strategy should address. These include: Providing a greater emphasis on documenting what are fair and reasonable practices, responsibilities, training and support services that should be available across a range of immigration detention situations so the Department meets its duty of care responsibilities. Detention health provisions do not currently cover all types of detention situations; Having a more appropriate, efficient and less intrusive health assessment process. Health assessment processes that currently exist on entry/exit to detention are the same regardless of where, or how the client has become unlawful, or the circumstances of detention; Using an ‘evidence based risk assessment approach’ to health assessments in regard to both what is considered, the frequency, purpose and circumstances of such assessments, and the need for an assessment; Specifying the standard and level of health care a client should have access to across a range of detention settings and situations. This should encompass both an analysis of public health risk and an assessment of what is fair and reasonable and should reflect similar policies of provision and choice in the broader Australian community; and Providing the broad spectrum of a health framework which is not only concerned with disease management but with influencing positively some of the known determinants of poor health outcomes. This should encompass a range of health considerations from promotion and prevention to rehabilitation and future care. Future Health Strategy Summary In light of the Department’s duty of care responsibilities the future Detention Health Strategy will ensure people in immigration detention have access to health screening, physical examinations, primary and specialised care and emergency services. The future Detention Health Strategy will be based around the core principles of being open and accountable and will specify in the health assessment process the reasons for procedures and actions to be associated with findings; treatments that should always be available and those for which elective advice may be given; and how continuity of health care will be protected for people detained and when people leave detention. Specific objectives of the Detention Health Strategy will be to: Outline an appropriate and targeted health framework which sets strategies to ensure that both physical and mental health needs of people in all types of immigration detention are addressed across the spectrum of health promotion and prevention, early intervention, treatment and rehabilitation; Develop a risk assessment approach to screening for disease symptoms across the various types of situations in which people are in immigration detention; Provide care and management of physical and mental health problems in an individual context, taking into account health assessments and advice, cultural understanding of health needs, particularly past experiences of torture and/or trauma; Provide people in immigration detention with a description of the range and standard of health care they can expect when detained; Provide people in immigration detention with health services that are fair, reasonable, and commensurate with Australia’s international obligations and available to the Australian community; Recognise the potential negative impacts on physical and psychosocial well-being of the detention event and of the uncertain outcome of visa applications; Be based on a professional health and mental health service being separate from the Detention Services contract; Be independently monitored and evaluated; and Have a funding program that is transparent and appropriate to providing access to a defined standard of health and mental health services. Funding Year 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2008-09 $,000 $2,652 $2,049 $1,567 $1,586 Funding for the future Detention Health Strategy will support the Detention Health Branch and ensure that DIMA fulfils its responsibility to deal fairly and responsibly with all people detained under the Migration Act 1958, not just those in detention centres and includes a more appropriately targeted health program. Novation of the health contracts will bring all payment and costing for the provision of health and mental health care under direct management of the Department. This will allow further work to take place to examine a variety of health funding mechanisms for small, but heterogenous populations in order that a more effective, transparent funding program can be established for the future detention health program. Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Question No. 3064) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 15 February 2006 For each financial year from 1996-1997 to 2004-2005, has the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) provided financial assistance to companies under the National Interest Account; if so, in respect of each grant of assistance (a) what was the name and postal address of the company, (b) what was the value of the assistance provided, (c) what form of assistance was provided, (d) to which country was the company exporting, (e) who were the counterparties, (f) on what date did the Minister direct EFIC to provide the assistance, (g) on what date did EFIC carry out the transaction, and (h) on what national interest grounds was it provide. (1) Yes. (a) to (g) Details of major transactions on the National Interest Account are published in EFIC’s Annual Report. Certain particulars of all contracts entered into, and guarantees and loans given under the National Interest Account are published in the Government Notice Gazette in accordance with Section 30 (1) of the EFIC Act. (h) All facilities were provided in accordance with the EFIC Act. In particular, facilities were provided where there was sufficient trade or wider benefits to Australia. Under the EFIC Act, National Interest facilities may be provided under Ministerial Direction or Ministerial Approval. In some instances the Minister has directed EFIC to enter into facilities where transactions fell within parameters contained in the relevant Ministerial Direction. EFIC’s Unsecured Advance Payment and Performance Bond Facility, former Export Working Capital Guarantee Facility and a Credit Insurance facility provided during the late-1990s north Asian economic crisis were implemented in this way. Other facilities were the subject of individual Ministerial approvals.

(2) Is his department currently reviewing the operation of this provision. (1) Redundancy payments can be made to a person of any age. However, the taxation treatment of these payments varies depending on the recipient’s age and length of service, and whether the payment qualifies as a bona fide redundancy payment. All lump sum payments made by employers upon termination of employment are eligible for concessional tax treatment, particularly if the recipient is aged 55 or over. Only five per cent of the preJuly 1983 component of a lump sum payment is subject to tax at a taxpayer’s marginal tax rate while the remainder of this component is tax free. The post-June 1983 component up to an individual’s relevant reasonable benefit limit (RBL) is taxed at a maximum rate of 30 per cent plus the Medicare levy. Where the recipient is aged 55 or over, the first $129,751 (in 2005-06) of the postJune 1983 component is taxed at a maximum rate of 15 per cent plus the Medicare levy. Where such payments qualify as bona fide redundancy payments, they are eligible for additional concessional tax treatment. Specifically, in 2005-06 the first $6,491 plus $3,246 for each year of completed service is tax free. Payments made by employers to individuals aged 65 or more do not qualify as bona fide redundancy payments. This treatment has applied since the provision was introduced in 1984 and reflects the fact that people aged 65 or over who are made redundant generally have ready access to other sources of income, such as the age pension. (2) On9 May 2006, the Government announced a plan to remove the complex tax arrangements and restrictions that apply to people’s superannuation benefits. The proposals contained in A Plan to Simplify and Streamline Superannuation would simplify superannuation for retirees making it easier to understand, improve incentives to work and save, and provide greater flexibility over how superannuation savings can be drawn down in retirement. The plan does not propose to change the taxation treatment for bona-fide redundancy payments, approved early retirement scheme payments, or unused leave. However the plan does propose new arrangements for the taxing of employer eligible termination payments (ETPs). Under the plan it is proposed that employer ETPs would be comprised of two components. Firstly, the exempt component would be made up of any post-June 1994 invalidity amount and any pre-July 1983 amount. This component would be exempt from tax.",166,Questions In Writing
251,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Secondly, the taxable component would be the post-June 1983 amount. This would be taxed at 15 per cent for amounts up to $140,000 for recipients aged 55 and over and at 30 per cent for those aged under 55. Amounts in excess of $140,000 would be taxed at the top marginal tax rate. The Government will be consulting on the details of the plan until Wednesday, 9 August 2006. Operation Wickenby (Question No. 3120) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 27 February 2006: (1) Will he provide an update on Operation Wickenby. (2) What sum has been spent on investigating the $400 million that has been lost due to these schemes. (3) How did this fraud emerge and grow without the ATO becoming aware of it and taking action earlier. (4) How many prosecutions does the ATO expect to make and does the ATO intend to prosecute participants as well as the scheme’s promoters. (5) In respect of the phone taps that have been used by the Australian Crime Commission in relation to this case, (a) how many phones have been tapped and (b) have taxpayers’ phones been taped as well as those of the schemes organisers. (1) The Government announced an allocation of $305 million over six years across five agencies in February 2006 to address the tax mischief identified under Operation Wickenby. There are now over 100 officers working on Operation Wickenby. It is expected that this will rise to 250 by September 2006. At this stage, there are nine potentially criminal matters (involving 38 individuals) being investigated by the Australian Crime Commission. The vast majority of cases are still being profiled prior to audit or investigation activity. Tax audits have commenced on a small number of cases. There have been a number of court challenges to Australian Crime Commission processes. Overwhelmingly, these are being resolved in favour of the Commission, but they are causing some delays in the process of investigation. (2) The amount that has been spent by the ATO on Operation Wickenby up until the end of May 2006 is approximately $7.4 million. This is an estimate because costs associated with people working on Operation Wickenby in the early stages were not separately accounted for. (3) Operation Wickenby has its origin in action by the ATO in 2003. The ATO referred potential criminal activity in respect of suspicious tax haven transactions to the Australian Crime Commission (ACC). The ACC then commenced an investigation into money laundering and tax fraud under its Board-approved determination. Subsequent intelligence and information gathered by the Australian Crime Commission through the use of its coercive powers led to information identifying numerous promoters and participants, including a number of prominent Australians, who are allegedly utilising offshore services to avoid tax liabilities and commit fraud against the Australian taxation system. (4) The ATO is continuing to investigate, and gather evidence in relation to, the initial promoter of the arrangements that are at the centre of Operation Wickenby. The ATO in liaison with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and law enforcement agencies will determine which cases to prosecute in accordance with its prosecution policy and the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth.",167,Questions In Writing
252,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) The ATO does not undertake any phone tap activity. Media Ownership (Question No. 3159) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 1 March 2006: (1) Did the Minister see the report titled ‘Coonan’s law could halve media ownership’ in The Sydney Morning Herald on 27 February 2006. (2) In respect of that part of the report which said the Minister expected to have a month of community and industry consultation, can the Minister explain why the public will have only a month to consider and provide feedback to the Government about the proposed changes to Australia’s media ownership laws when the Government has been consulting with the major media companies for more than four years. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) On the 14 March 2006, the Government released a discussion paper on a range of media reform issues entitled Discussion Paper on Media Reform Options. The discussion paper is another step in an ongoing process of consultation. The components of the package have been canvassed publicly over an extended period. On this basis, I consider that five weeks is an appropriate period of time for individuals and stakeholders to express their views on the contents of the discussion paper. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 3165) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 1 March 2006: (1) For each week of 2005, will he provide a list of the commercial aircraft movements between the hours of 5 am and 6 am at Sydney’s Kingsford-Smith Airport indicating for each movement its direction and whether it was a take-off or landing. (2) Will he explain how ICAO noise standards are monitored for commercial jet aircraft movements at Kingsford-Smith Airport. (3) Will he provide a list of commercial jet aircraft movements that did not meet ICAO standards.” In relation to part (1) of the question, a list of the commercial jet aircraft movements between the hours of 5am and 6am at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport is attached. Parts (2) and (3) of the question relate to ICAO aircraft noise certification levels. ICAO noise certification is based on a type certification process that is laid down in VolumeI of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention. Under this system once an aircraft type (eg B747-400, B737-800, etc) is noise certificated all aircraft of that type are deemed to meet the standard. Individual aircraft cannot be tested against the standard using in-service noise and flight path monitoring systems. Nevertheless, broad correlations between in-service and certification noise levels are to be expected.",168,Questions In Writing
