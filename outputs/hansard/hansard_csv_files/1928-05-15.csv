The owners are now tying up tbeir boats. The statement referred to is as follows:An offer aiming at a settlement was received in Melbourne yesterday morning from the Federal Secretary of the Marine Cooks' Union( Mr Tudehope J, who forwarded the following telegram from Sydney:-""Our members to resume under suspended award; question of roster to be subject of conference if required after resumption. Abovo terms, if agreed to, will be subject to ratification at our meeting attention of the Minister for Health to-morrow morning. In view of these negotiations, again request extension of time until to the following paragraph which has Wednesday."" In view of the request of the cooks, which might bring about a settlement, will tbe right honourable gentleman use his influence with the owners of the steamers or make overtures to them, to induce them to suspend action in regard to the tying up of their boats, so that they may meet in conference with the cooks, and a possible large industrial upheaval may be prevented ? Australia has been held up for some weeks past owing to this unfortunate dispute between the cooks and the owners of one of the lines of steamers -trading on our coast. -concerned is acting in contempt of the Arbitration Court, a body constituted under statute of this Parliament, and has nad its award cancelled. To my mind, its proper course now is to place itself completely Tinder the jurisdiction of the court, and unless it does so I shall not feel disposed to take any action in regard to the matter at this stage.

On the 4th May the honourable member following questions:1. Is it a fact that the aeroplane landing ground at Rabaul has been covered by buildings ? 2. If so, where are aeroplanes now to land in the vicinity of Eabaul? I am now* in receipt of the following information from the Administrator:-1. There is no official landing ground for aeroplanes at Rabaul. An old race-course was used by Messrs. Mustard and Parer for this purpose, at their own risk. This area had been resumed by the administration as a site for a native hospital, and was partly built at Eabaul. The construction of the native hospital is now almost completed. 2. It is doubtful whether a suitable landing ground can be found in the vicinity of Eabaul, but one may possibly be located a few miles out of the town. The selection, preparation and control of sites for aerodromes in New Guinea is, however, a matter which comes within the jurisdiction of the Civil Aviation autliorities.

I am now in a position to inform him as follows:1. No; but the Commission, in view of its' responsibility to conduct the hotels on a commercial basis, has been carefully examining the organization to assure itself that there has been no waste, over-lapping, or unnecessary work. The object has been to' reduce expenditure, if possible, consistently with affording guests a standard which will compare favourably with hotels of similar grade elsewhere. 2. The tariff schedules of the hotels "" Canberra,"" ""Acton,"" ""Kurrajong,"" ""Ainslie,"" and "" Wellington"" have been revised and an amended schedule will come into operation on and from the 21st May, 192S.

Is it a fact that the publication of this threat may have a detrimental effect on the investigations of that committee? 3. Will he take immediate action to see that witnesses giving evidence unfavorable to the Commission are given the same opportunity (without fear of legal proceedings) as others to present their case? 4. Is the Public Accounts Committee giving an opportunity to the Commission to answer any charges made against it ; if so, what is the mission ? reason for the Commission taking up such an attitude? to the honourable member's questions are as follow:] . Yes. .2. It is not considered that the investigations of the committee are likely to be prejudiced. 3. No action appears to be necessary. 4. Presumably, yes. The matter originated out of an inquiry addressed to the Commission by a press representative, but the Commission advises that the press report does not express clearly the purport of the Commission's reply, which was to the effect that it was considering the question of obtaining legal opinion as to whether certain evidence constituted perjury or not. The Commission explains, in this connection, that it was concerned not so much with the attacks on itself, to which it will reply in due course, as with the effect upon the public mind of untrue statements in regard to Canberra. On the 10th May the honourable memme the following questions:1. Isi t a fact that residents in the Federa' Capital Territory, many of whom are at pre sent paying Â£104 to Â£208 per annum renta' have been served with rating charges of 4d in the Â£1 for general rates, and 2d. in the Â£1 for lighting, on a pro rata, basis, to the end of last year? 2. Is it also a fact that with each notice was an intimation that if the rates were not paid within 30 days, 10 per cent, would be added; if so, what is the reason for penalizing those who are unable to pay on such short notice ? 3. Is it intended to impose further charges for sewerage, water, and road rates; if so, what rates are to be applied, and from what date? '4. Is it a fact that those rates will make tenants liable for amounts up to Â£25 per annum ? 5. What further charges, in addition to those mentioned above, will have to be met by persons residing in the Federal Capital Territory? 6. Under what ordinance are tenants made liable for rates? 7. Is it a fact that in no other part of Australia are tenants held responsible for the payment of rates? 8. Has_ legal opinion been obtained as to the legality of making tenants, and not the owners of the land, liable for rates as well as rent; does the Government endorse the action of the Commission, and will they support the Commission should any legal proceedings be taken by residents in regard to these charges? 9. Is it a fact that the values of certain allotments of land at Eastlake are being increased by the Commission for rating purposes, and that lessees have been advised that, if dissatisfied, they may appeal to the Com10. Does this mean that the authority which fixed the values will decide the appeal; i i so, will the Minister remedy what appears to be an injustice? I am now in a position to supply h i m with the following answers:1. Yes. 2. Yes. The penalty is provided for in section 15 (3) of the Rates Ordinance 1920, for the Territory for the Seat of Government. 3. Rates for sewerage and water will be imposed, but these have not yet been struck; they will be in respect of the year 1928. There is no power to strike any special road rate. 4. See answer to No. 3. 5. Owners of leases under the City Area Leases Ordinance, or similar ordinances, will be required to contribute half the cost of providing kerbing and guttering and permanent footpaths when constructed.

Honourable members will recall that on the -7th May there appeared a statement in the press, attributed to Mr Lambert, M,P., in which he alleged that he had been offered Â£8,000 to vacate his seat for the representation of ""West Sydney, in the interests of Mr Theodore. It was stated, also, that a similar offer had been made to Mr Anstey, M.P., the implication being that he should resign his seal in the interests of Mr Theodore. On the 9th May, in another statement in the press, Mr Lambert reiterated his charge, and on the same date Mr G.

Theodore. On the 10th May, Mr Cann is reported to have said that he stood by his statement. It has also been reported in the press that the allegations have been denied by the honourable members to whom they referred. These statements, however, are attributed not to irresponsible persons, but to a member of this Parliament, and to an ex-Minister of the Crown in New South Wales. The repetition of the statements by both gentlemen a few days later indicates that they were correctly reported. The allegation that seats in the the character of the people who have national legislature are being bought and sold strikes at the honour and dignity made the charges. of the Commonwealth Parliament, and threatens the very foundations of our democratic institutions. It is for the Government, as the custodian of the people's rights, to take action with a view commission, I say, on behalf of the Opto eliciting the actual facts.

I rose particularly to reply to the speech of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster). He is a good advocate of a cause in which he believes, but he puts so much vehemence into his advocacy of any matter he takes up, that whether he believes in it or not, he can make it appear a good cause. The honourable member drew attention to the posi tion of the returned soldier vine-growers on the river Murray, and spoke of what the reduction in the bounty would mean to them. I am aware that ex-soldiers were settled on the Murray so they could be established in a thriving industry that would both benefit the country and give quick returns to the settlers. I am heartily in accord with that scheme, and trust that the benefits hoped for will be realized. But the honourable member's attitude, coming immediately after the refusal of honourable members opposite to grant an appeal board for returned soldiers suffering from war disabilities, appeared to me to constitute a volte face on his part. The attitude assumed by the Opposition on the motion to which I have referred was that ex-soldiers should be rewarded for their sacrifices by at least being allowed to appeal to a board if they thought that they had not received sufficient compensation for their war injuries. The honourable member for Wakefield was silent on that motion; but he played the returned soldiers as his long suit in connection with the present bill. Although, perhaps, no honourable member is better acquainted with South Australia than he is, I doubt if he could name one wineproducing establishment on the river Murray. In my opinion the wine bounty, from its inception, has been entirely in tbe nature of a boost for ""big busishillings per ness."" Incidentally, the grape-grower has received benefits, and I agree that he should be supported in that way; but let me tell the committee where the vignerons of South Australia carry on their industry. I remind the honourable member for Wakefield that their vines are grown hundreds of miles from the Murray valley. distilleries in the world is to be found on the Murray. is used in that distillery should be dried, aud bounty should be paid on it as dried f r u it ; but, instead of that, large quantities of grapes go to a distillery from which the Commonwealth draws heavy excise revenue. soldiers' industry. not benefit the distillery at Berri. I should not have taken exception to the honourable member's plea in the interests of "" big business,"" in the form of wine making in South Australia, if he had not tacked on to it a claim on behalf of returned soldiers. Last week honourable members opposite refused to grant even a board to which returned soldiers might appeal, should they think they had been unfairly dealt with by the Repatriation Department. Not one honourable member opposite was prepared to give ex-soldiers an opportunity even to appeal to a board to decide whether they were entitled to pensions, or whether the pensions that they had were adequate. But when the subject of the continuance of the bounty to",20,Bribery Allegations Appointment Of Royal Commission

Let the honourable member face the facts. Although he cannot name one big winery on the river Murray, he is familial' with the Auldana vineyards at Magill, on ths foothills of Adelaide. Cleland and Sons' vineyards are at Beaumont, adjacent to Magill, and, like Auldana, they are hundreds of miles from the Murray valley, where the bulk of the ex-soldier grape-growers are settled. Company carry on their wine-making business at Rowland's Plat. Hamilton's are at Marion, near the coast south of Adelaide, and Marion is many miles from the Murray. Hardy and Sons have been in the wine business ever since I have known South Australia. Their vineyards are at Aldinga, on the southern coast of that State. Penfold's are* at Magill, on the Adelaide foothills. The Reynella vineyards are located further south than Marion, and are nearer to the mouth of the Murray than to the Murray valley fruit-growing areas. are at Seppeltsfield, outside Greenock, many miles from the Murray. Adjacent to their vineyards are those of Smith and Sons, of Angaston. The Tarrangarra Wine Company operates at O'HalloranH ill , in the Mount Lofty Ranges. In addition to the distillery at Berri, there is a wine-making establishment at Lyrup; but the honourable member for Wakefield would admit that it is not a large concern. member heard of Waikerie? making industry on the Murray cannot be compared with the industry carried on by the old established firms whose names I have mentioned, and whose brands of wines are well known throughout Australia. The establishments at Lyrup and Waikerie are new, having come into operation since the war, Not one-tenth of the grapes grown in South Australia and turned into wine come from the Murray valley. will hear about this matter. representatives I hope that the honourable member will quote the areas under vines. The honourable member knows well that Chateau Tanunda is located at Nuriootpa, between Angaston and Greenock. That vineyard is of from 25 to 30 years' standing. Salter and Sons are also engaged in grape production in the Angaston district; and Buring and Sobels, whose property is at Watervale, in the hill country approaching the lower north of South Australia, are also big producers. I may also mention the Pewsey Vale property, established by the late Sir William Gilbert, which is in the vicinity Cramp and of Williamstown, where grapes are extensively grown. I have mentioned the principal, grape producers of South Australia, and havo shown the true position of that State in the matter of wine production. It is evident that the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons) is speaking solely in the interests of the big wine producers in opposing a reduction of the bounty. I am satisfied that the honourable member is merely supporting the claims of thos-d engaged in the wine business in a big way. Seppelts' Whilst returned soldiergrowers may get something to succor them for the time being, I am satisfied that four-fifths of the bounty paid goes to old-established growers, some of whom have already amassed fortunes. Mr CooK.^That is absolutely untrue. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -Order! The honourable member must withdraw that remark. honourable member are as correct as most of the statements that fall from his lips. The honourable member for Angas must not forget that I am speaking of the position in a State concerning which I know a good deal.

61,The Honourable Mr Yates,"The statements of thethis point. Only on Thursday last honorahle memhers of the chamber, in supporting a motion moved by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman), endeavoured to render material assistance to returned soldiers; but we could not get the support of the honourable member for Wakefield and other honourable members opposite. We were accused of making it a party matter, and of merely using returned soldiers as political hacks. When the honourable member for Wakefield refers to the bounty as being of assistance to returned soldiers he is speaking with his tongue in his cheek. The grape producing properties controlled by the big wine interests in South Australia lie within a radius of 50. miles of Adelaide, and if the bounty is continued it will not be of benefit to the grape-growers on the river Murray district, as the honourable member for Wakefield alleges. It would be a means of keeping faith with certain grapegrowers; but I wish the honourable member for Angas and honourable members generally to know that if the bounty is retained it will not be of benefit so much to those engaged in growing grapes on the river Murray, as to those engaged it wine production, particularly within 50 miles of Adelaide. my intention, not to deal with certain points raised by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) which are irrevelant to the question before the committee ; but to refer briefly to those which spirit used for fortifying purposes is prohave a direct bearing on the matter now under discussion. The honourable member for Adelaide was right when he said that there is no one in the House who knows more a'bout the wine-growing districts of South Australia than the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Poster); but I suggest, judging from the remarks of the honorahle member concerning the honourable member for Wakefield, that the former has yet a great deal to member was speaking I interjected, ""What about Waikerie?"" For the information of the honourable member I may say that I recently visited Waikerie, which is in my electorate, where there are many returned soldiers engaged in grape growing, all of whom are keenly interested in the bounty. These growers hold entirely different views from those on this 3ide expressed by the honourable member for Adelaide, and consider that a reduction in the bounty affects them more vitally than it does the wine-makers. That is one of the reasons why the winemakers are sitting back. They know that, if the grape-growers receive a reasonable bounty, they will also benefit. I would also remind the honourable member for Adelaide that the Renmark distillery, which is owned by returned soldiers, annually exports large quantities of wine, and that, if the bounty is reduced, there is a possibility of their export trade ceasing. That is one of $he reasons why returned soldiers interested in that distillery have undertaken a threedays' train journey to make representations to the Government, in the hope that it will not do this wicked thing of reducing the bounty. I am asking the Minister( Mr Paterson) even at this stage to see the error of his ways, and to withdraw the bill or amend it so that the bounty will not be interfered with. I should like to inform the honourable member for Adelaide that the spirit used to fortify the wine to a higher degree of strength, to make it suitable for export purposes, is produced on the Murray river. What the honourable member for Adelaide said concerning certain well known wines is perfectly true; but those wines are sold almost entirely on the Australian market, and are, therefore, not fortified to the same extent. The duced from doradilla grapes grown by returned soldiers on the river Murray, which is one of the reasons why the growers wish honourable members to realize the injustice of the proposed reduction. I wish to again inform the honourable member for Adelaide and the committee generally that there are many returned soldier grape-growers who are not engaged on the river Murray fruitlearn. When the honourable growing areas are scattered throughout my electorate. An association of grapegrowers at Barossa, composed of returned soldiers, of which Captain Francis is the president, put its case very clearly before the chief excise oflicer in South Australia, in support of the claim that the bounty should not be reduced and that the price of grapes should be fixed. I have also",22,Sgivgs
62,Mr Parsons (Angas) [3.46],"It ishad a communication from Spring ton, from returned soldiers, stating that they are keenly interested in the bounty, and asking me -to press for its continuance at the present rate. The Minister( Mr Paterson) said that there had been an increase in the preference under the last British tariff, but I should like to inform the Minister that there has been no such increase, the preference which Australia enjoyed on highly fortified wines before the lastBritish tariff was introduced was 4s. a gallon, and to-day it is the same. I chalMarkets( Mr Paterson) during his lenge the Minister to prove that there has been an increase in preference, since thi rate remains the same. Minister, in trying to bolster up his case, said there had also been an alteration in the spirit contents of wines. There has been an alteration in the spirit content, but there has been no increase in the British preferential tariff on Ausclared that I stated that Australian wines tralian wines. The Minister also stated that several wine-makers had declared that they were not really concerned over the proposed reduction of.the bounty, inferring that there was no sincerity in the protestations of the wintmakers, and that several had "" let the cat out of the bag."" Both the honorahle member for ""Wakefield ( Mr Eoster), and I challenge the Minister to supply the names of those wine-makers. The honourable gentleman was not fair in his insinuations. During his second-reading speech he stated that there is a preference on paper, in which I agree with the honourable gentleman. "" is "". "" was "". The Minister is now trying to twist his words around. that remark, and ask that it be withdrawn. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -The honourable member must withdraw that remark. interesting admission in the Minister's speech occurred when he declared that there may be some blending going on in Great Britain, but that it does not affect the position much. Previously the honorable gentleman stated that there was not. and could not, be any blending there. I have a definite statement from Mr RonaldT Martin, a grape-grower and wine-maker, which is confirmed by Mr Angove, of Renmark, by Mr Salter, and by a represansky, to the affect that wine blending is tin said that it is quite easy to blend two parts of wine under 25 per cent, with one part of wine which is under 42 per cent. The duty on such foreign blended wine is reduced to 4s. 8d., as against 4s. on Australian wine. I shall now refer to a statement that was made by the Minister for second-reading speech. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The Order! The honourable member cannot now make a second-reading speech, nor can he discuss at length any remarks made in the course of a second-reading speech. are sold in Great .Britain at from 9s. 6d. to 10s. a gallon. The honourable gentleman deducted various expenses from those amounts, and alleged that Australian wine-growers are now receiving 4s. 2d. a gallon, which compares very favourably with the lower price previously received. The Minister was unjust, as I used the words "" selling price."" The honourable gentleman misused my statement, perhaps quite inadvertently, as he. is not thoroughly familiar with the industry. I previously stated that the landed price was 9s. Id., which figure the Minister also quoted. Afterwards the honourable gentleman used the selling price of from 9s. 6d. to 10s., in an endeavour not to prove that the wine-makers received a greater price than they stated to be the case. A selling price and a landed price are two entirely different things When a British wine merchant lands wine at 9s. Id., he probably makes a profit of from 5d. to l i d a gallon, and incidentally has to give terms, sq that his profit is not exorbitant. The Minister made reference to a "" leading wine-maker "" who recently returned from Great Britain, and who, he alleged, stated that there was a good market for Australian wines, and that the position in Great Britain was quite secure. I asked the Minister at the time to name the gentleman, but he declined to do so. I declared that the Minister had obtained his information from a newspaper article.",23,Sgivgs

Five times subsequently Mr Salter, in conversation, mentioned the name of Mr ""Walker, and I am quite prepared to declare that it was Mr final dividend on the ordinary shares at the Walker to whom the Minister referred. Mr Walker has since written to the honourable gentleman denying that he made the statement referred to. I shall drop the subject there. If honourable members paid a visit to my electorate they would realize how grave is the concern of the wine-growers over this bill, which will ruin many if passed; therefore, even the Minister must excuse me if I appear to overstep the bounds of parliamentary procedure when speaking on this matter. I shall deal with British wines. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN"" Does the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the advisability of raising or lowering the duty? Mr .PARSONS I do. It has been alleged that ""everything in the garden that is, the vineyard is lovely."" On the previous occasion the Minister did not refer at all to British wines. Afterwards he brought that matter up, and now he has given us some very interesting information. He. has told us that the British Government has increased the excise on British wine by 6d. a gallon, premium of 10s., were also carried bringing the price up to 5s. 6d., as against 9s. Id. a gallon which is the landed price of Australian wine. That is not going to be of very much help to the Australian growers. I wish to give .the House some information about the operations of the British company, Vine Products Limited. In The Wine Trade Beview of 9th March, 1928, there is a report of the last annual meeting of shareholders of this company, of which the following statement appears:Dividend of 30 per cent -Futur e of British He then Wines -The chairman in moving the adoption of the report and accounts expressed the hope that shareholders would consider that events had justified the optimism expressed at the last meeting, and that the profit of Â£170,000 for 1927 was more than satisfactory. . . . The trading profit after charging all expenses Thus, during the period from March to March, since the last reduction of our bounty, the profits made by this company increased by over 70 per cent. The balance available after deducting the dividend on the preference shares, and the interim dividend on the ordinary shares, was Â£125,174. The directors proposed to pay a rate of 35 per cent, per annum, making a total of. 30 per cent, for the year. . . . With regard to the position of. the wine trade generally, and their company in particular, he had already said that their profit this year had been secured before receiving the full benefit from the company's Dominion wine operations. In that connection he particularly had in mind the trade anticipated from their contract with the Co-operative Wine Farmers' Association of South Africa. Abnormal shipments of wine from Australia to secure the full export subsidy payable up to 31st August, 1927, by the Commonwealth Government, had, however, been responsible for a heavy drop in the price of Australian wines, an uneconomic stimulation not likely to occur again, as from that date the subsidy had been reduced by Is. a gallon. . . . The home market still offered a very wide scope for expansion, at the present time, whilst there were various other countries into which they might carry their enterprises with profitable results. The. business of Vine Products' Limited had grown from small beginnings to its present proportions against much prejudice and trade opposition, and to-day all must recognize the immense possibilities of British wines for British people. Mr John Davie, C.A., seconded the motion, which was ""carried unanimously, and resolutions increasing the capital of the company to Â£585,000 by the creation of 140,000 additional ordinary shares of 5s. each, to be issued at a unanimously. I have received a letter from Mr R. C. H . Walker, in which the following statement occurs:Under date 6th March, Sir Ernest Rutherford writes:"" British wines ought to be taxed at least as high as Dominion wines, and I have told the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and also the Chairman of Customs so, pointing out that it is in no way a British",24,Sgivgs

The fermentation of the imported 'must' is only a preliminary step to the ordinary labour in an English wine merchant's cellar of laying up, fining, racking, and bottling, &c. Your High Commissioner seems to be diffident about pushing your interests, because the hidebound civil servant here has got into his head that it is a British industry. It is increased, and our wines are now paying the Greeks who have made a fortune out of it."" I have also a letter from Mr C. S. Panton, secretary of the Federal Viticultural Oouncil of Australia. I wish honourable members to understand that, in quoting facts and figures supplied by the wine makers) I do so only because they are in a better position to obtain the information than are the growers. My sympathies are all with the growers. I have said to the wine-makers that they are strong enough to look after themselves, but that I was concerned with protecting the interests of the grape-growers. On the subject of the bounty, however, there is no difference between the growers and the winemakers; they are united in protesting against this reduction. which I have referred statesYou will have noticed that the Imperial budget only increases tlie excise on ""British wines "" by Od. a gallon, whicli will be of but little value, if any, to the Empire wines. The British Vine Products Limited last year made a profit of Â£170,000. It has decided to issue 140,000 ordinary shares at os. each. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN But what has this to do with Australia or the wine bounty? with it : The sole reason that the Government has advanced for reducing the bounty is that Australian wines can now compete on a lower bounty than the present one with other wines which are being sold in Great Britain. I am trying to prove to the Committee that there are factors operataing in Great Britain which will make it absolutely impossible for our wines to compete there if the bounty is reduced. The company of which 1 have spoken has issued 140,000 ordinary 5s. shares, which are being sold at 15s. or a premium of 10s. They w ill probably be offered to ordinary shareholders in the proportion of one to ten. The existing shares are quoted on the market at 31s. 9d. Why is it that this company has been making such large profits during the last twelve months? The reason is that the British Government increased the tariff on imported wines' in A p r i l of last year. Prior to that date our sweet wines were paying, on a prefefental basis, a duty of 2s. a gallon. That duty was 4s. a gallon. Because of that alteration in the duty the British company, Vine Products Limited, has come into its own, and has been able to capture the trade which, to a considerable extent, formerly belonged to us. Even with the increased excise rate of 6d. a gallon, this company is still able to sell itsÂ«products at 5s. 6d. a gallon. They increased their turnover to such an extent that last year their profits were raised to the extent of 70 pev cent. They are creating a large amount of new capital with which they intend to expand their business still further. That is an answer to the statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) that it was impossible for them to expand their business because they were not able to obtain The letter to the necessary space. They are going to build that additional space. If the Government persists with this measure it w ill have to come to the rescue of the industry again, as it had to do in 1924. Some years ago large areas were planted on the river Murray, against the advice of those who had been connected with the wine industry for many years. The growei'3 had no market for their product, and, on the advice of the Federal Viticultural Council of Australia, the Government saved the industry by introducing s measure which made provision for the It has this to do payment of a bounty. Now, in opposition to the studied advice of that council, and in spite of the protestations of the growers themselves, the Government is acting in a manner that w ill prove prejudicial to the industry. I prophesy that before many months have passed the Government w ill have to turn again to the Federal Viticultural Council for advice as to what steps should be taker, to rectify the position. I do not think any person has suggested that the Federal Viticultural Council has ever "" p u t anything over "" the Government. Upon that council are honourable men who have been connected w i th the wine-making industry for many years. They are growers themselves, and have grown up from",25,Sgivgs
71,Mr Parsons,"boyhood alongside the older men who are engaged in production. The interests of the wine-makers are closely wrapped up with those of the growers, and vice versa. If the Government wishes to obtain advice, let it turn to, the source which provided it with such good advice in 1924, when it brought down' a well-considered bill that saved the industry from destruction. To-day the Federal Viticultural Council has, what it did not have in 1924, the united support of the growers throughout the industry. If the Government will heed the warning of that council and those growers, it will refrain from reducing the bounty at the presenttime. RecentlyI had an interview with Mr Gursansky, the president of the Barossa Grape-growers' Association, with which is affiliated the Returned Soldiers' Association at Barossa. Unfortunately, early in the year a very disastrous frost spread right through the Murray valley, and a week or so later a similarly heavy frost swept through the Barossa district, with the result that there has been a very poor yield this year.

The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) summed up the position rightly when he said that the party whip had been cracked. Of course, the Government will prevail, no matter what the honourable member for Angas may say. That honourable member may make very telling speeches to his constituents upon the iniquity of this proposal, but he will also have to explain why he is unwavering in his support of a Government that will commit this injustice against a large section of the primary producers of Australia. member for Angas voted against the Government on the motion for the second reading of the hill. vernment has the number of supporters necessary to pass the bill, and, of course, it will allow the honourable member for Angas to have his little say. able member that I have neither sought nor obtained its permission to do so. vernment will tolerate the honourable member, secure in the knowledge that it has the necessary numbers at its back.

I do not believe that he has answered one of the objections that have been raised by the opponents of the measure. If he were sitting in the corner, where he sat before the days of. the pact, he would condemn, just as strongly as has the honourable member for Angas, a government which is prepared to commit such an injustice upon a large section of the primary producers. This is an act of repudiation. When the moved the second reading, and again the other day, the Minister endeavored to excuse the attitude he is adopting by saying that the increased preference that has been given by-the British Government to Australia, has quite changed the face of the matter.

When the Minister says that the increased preference has placed Australian wines on a better footing, he forgets that a new competitor in the British market is doing serious injury to our trade. The Minister should explain the situation in the interests, not only of the wine-growers, but also of honourable members supporting the Government, who will be forced against their will to vote for this measure. The Government's proposal is to reduce the bounty by 9d. a gallon, and it is no concession to be told that the amendment now moved will confer some benefit on those who have entererd into contracts. The benefit they will get will not extend beyond twelve months. The most serious objection to the Government's proposal is that the growers were given to understand that the bounty would operate until August, 1930!,' that is', for three years. It has been said that the late Minister for Tradeand Customs( Mr Pratten), made it plain to the growers and distillers when the original bill was introduced, that although the bill proposed to pay a bounty of Is. 9d. a gallon for three years, that rate would last only until the British preferential duties were altered in favour of Australian wines; but I submit that all that the growers and distillers had to guide them was the act itself. The growers probably never heard of the Minister's statement, and I am not aware that steps were taken to convey to them the words uttered by the Minister. In the circumstances it is quite reasonable to suppose that they knew nothing about the Minister's words, and that all they had to guide them was the act itself, which contained nothing to indicate that the. full bounty would terminate this year; but on the contrary stated that the bounty would last until August, 1930. Some growers are referring to the present measure as a repudiation bill. The term is not too strong; in fact it is the only way in which one would expect them to describe the bill. The Minister for Markets cannot put forward Great Britain last the excuse that when the late Minister for Trade and Customs was introducing the' bill in March of last year, he informed the growers and distillers that the bounty might terminate when the British preferThat is ence was altered. since then I have reminded them of what was likely to happen. not know what steps the Minister took to remind them. The wine-growers I have met have assured me that they have had nothing to guide them but the act itself. I should like to know if the Minister went among the wine-growers in South Australia or wrote to their associations. I have not heard that he has communicated with any of them in the areas in which I come into contact with the growers. of complaint. like to know what steps the Minister took to make the growers aware of the possible termination of the Bounty -The growers themselves tell me they regard this 8",28,Sgivgs

112,Mr Parker Moloney,"I shouldmeasure as a repudiation bill, because after reading the act they were under the impression that the bounty would la3t until August, 1930, and they made their arrangements accordingly. They now declare that they were disappointed when the Government announced that the payment of the full bounty was to terminate immediately something happened in regard to the British preferential duties. As I have already pointed out, this preferential advantage is pure myth; it has been nullified by the establishment of a British industry that can sell wine at 5s. a gallon, a price with which Australians cannot compete. Although the Minister claims that the growers were told reduction they say that they have been taken completely by surprise. The Minister has said that under the bounty of 3s. a gallon the exporters were 6d. a gallon better off than they were under a bounty of 4s. a gallon. He alleged that during the period of the 4s. bounty the price of wine was Is.. lOd. a gallon f.o.b., and during the period of the 3s. bounty it was 3s. 4d. a gallon f.o.b.; in other' words, that the exporters got Is. lOd. plus 4s. under the 4s. bounty, equalling 5s. lOd. a gallo.n, and 3s. 4d. plus 3s. under the 3s. bounty, making a total of 6s. 4d. Those figures were used by the Minister to justify a reduction of the bounty by 9d. per gallon; but deducting 5s. 10d. from 6s. 4d. the difference is seen to be only 6d. If the Minister's figures are correct, what justification can there be for a reduction of the bounty by 9d. a gallon? That is another of the serious objections the growers have to the present bill. It will leave them 3d. a gallon worse off. That is equivalent to about 25s. a ton to the grower. about Â£1 a ton on sweet wine grapes. But that does not affect the grower. of 3d. a gallon to the distillers must affect the growers. shows what reckless statements the Minister is prepared to make in order to supporthis ease. No grower would believe that a reduction of 3d. a gallon in the price paid to the distiller would not be likely to affect the price paid to the grower. If the price paid to the distiller is affected it is a natural corollary that the price paid to the grower must likewise be affected. Every argument used on the second reading could with justification be advanced in opposition to this clause, which is the kernel of the bill. I think the Government must have been convinced of the arguments used by honourable members on the second reading. I attended a deputation to the Prime Minister from men engaged in the industry. Many members of that deputation were returned soldiers who had been induced to embark on the growing of grapes. In answer to the appeal made by to be prepared for this the Commonwealth Government to "" Produce, Produce, Produce,"" they went out to do so. Some succeeded, others did not, but nine-tenths of them were genuine triers, and as such were deserving of every advantage the Government could offer to them. At all events, they had a right to expect the Government to stand up to a solemn contract it made with them when they were induced to settle on these wine-growing areas. Speaking on this matter previously, I said that the success of the Murray river valley development depended upon the success of the wine-growing and dried fruits industries. Apart altogether from the assistance given to the growers, T think the Government should go further and give a bounty on dried fruits. It claims to have given way a little in regard to the payment of the bounty on wine, and I trust that it will go the whole of the way, and thus treat fairly those people to whom it gave the assurance that if they engaged in the industry of vine-growingthey would receive fair treatment at its hands. of the industry and on my own behalf, I express sincere appreciation of the concessions granted in the amendments brought down by thr. Minister. At the second-reading stage I pleaded for the whole of the 1927 vintage to be included in the bounty of Is. 9d., but the Government has decided that the old bounty should apply only to contracts made before the intention to reduce the rate was announced. The Government is acting only fairly in meeting the trade to that extent, but I am",29,Sgivgs

117,Mr Cook (Indi) [4.45],"On behalfstill of opinion that the old rate of bounty snould apply to the whole of the 1927 vintage. The Minister's statement that empty casks returned from abroad may be admitted free of duty will be received with gratification by exporters as it is a. right they have been requesting for a long time. The concession, he said, would amount to between 3d. and 4d. per gallon, which will be a substantial advantage. He promised also to investigate the operation of the rebate, and if it is found to be Is. 6d. a gallon drawback of excise as contended by the trade, and not Is. 3d. as the department avers, the wine-makers will get the benefit of the larger amount. For that concession also those engaged in the industry will be grateful. In regard to the general merits of the bounty, I am convinced that the Government has not, during recent years, expended money to greater advantage than in the payment of this bounty on exported wines. The Murray river valley was planted largely at the instigation of the Federal and State Governments with vines and in opposition to expert advice, and when the vines came into f u l l bearing, the growers discovered after three or four years of slavery, that there was no market for their bountiful crops. save them from ruin, the Government decided to intervene with some form of assistance. I recollect attending a deputation with the late Mr Oakley, the then Controller of Customs, and opinion was divided as to whether the' industry would fare better from a reduction of excise on spirits, or from the payment of abounty on wine exported. The Government suggested that the excise be reduced from 6s. to 3s. a gallon, but experts in the industry advised that it of grapes and wine, the local market would be better to leave the excise unaltered, and to grant a bounty on export. The Government acted on that advice, and the results have amply justified it. Th.e reduction of the excise duty by 3s. a gallon would have meant a direct and lasting loss to the revenue, whereas the bounty, which has considerably extended the overseas market for wine, is practically paid entirely from the excise collected on fortifying spirit and the substantial increase of revenue from the sale3 of spirit. I was sorry to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) who apparently is unaware of the extent to which the growers have benefited by the bounty. It is true that at its inception the exporters, who at that time were saddled with very heavy expenses, and whose cellars were f u ll of wine for which there was no outlet, benefited substantially, but in respect of subsequent crops the growers received for their grapes the price fixed by the Government, and they derived from the bounty considerably more advantage than did the exporter. Prior to the Government coming to the aid of the industry, large quantities of grapes were allowed to rot on the vines, and doradillas were sold for as low as Â£2 per ton. ' As a result of the price-fixing, which followed the granting of the bounty, doradillas realized Â£6 10s., which is a very suhstantial return, and other varieties of grapes correspondingly. The honourable member for Adelaide was wrong when he said that this is a rich man's bounty in that the growers do not participate. making companies are the greatest beneficiaries. that the Government reduced the bounty To in the middle of the vintage, and at a time when Australia was about to capture a large share of the world's market. Surely such a rich prize was worth some little sacrifice, although, as I have already said, the bounty is costing the taxpayer practically nothing. I am afraid that this reduction will injure the export trade in the immediate future, and that the position of the grower will be as had as, if not worse than, before the bounty was introduced. *Of the total production consumes 75 per cent.; the bounty applies only to 25 per cent.; but the wine-makers, exceeding their obligations, paid to the growers the fixed price in respect of the whole of the crop. ""Now, they have large quantities of wine in their cellars, and if the export trade is cut off, there will assuredly be a glut in the local market. If the cellars are filled with unsaleable stocks of wine, the growers will probably have to take for their grapes whatever price the manufacturers offer, and possibly the price in the coming year will he as low as it was prior",30,Sgivgs
118,Mr Yates,I said that the big wine,31,Sgivgs
119,Mr Cook,"They are not. I regretto the granting of the bounty. That is a serious consideration. I quote the opinion the of Mr Robert Davis, managing director tirely to the bounty-wil l amount to Â£391,386 of Caldwell's Wines Limited, who has a on 30th June next if the Is. 9d. bounty is mainthorough knowledge of the wine intained. If, however, the bounty is reduced to dustry :WHAT IT WILL MEAN. The stocks laid down by the merchant-maker for the past two. or three years have been at considerably increased cost to him owing to his observance of the prices fixed by the Government for grapes and fortifying spirit, and he is now in an unenviable position as any reduction of export following on the intended reduction in bounty of 9d. a gallon is going to throw sufficient of the surplus production of wine on to the local market to further reduce the local selling price-whic h reduction will have to be faced by the merchant with large stocks of high cost wines in his cellars to quit. It is obvious that the local merchant-maker will be unable to continue to pay the increased price of grapes fixed by the Government for bounty purposes, and it is difficult to understand how the Federal Government can overlook this factor in its anticipations. It will mean with local consumption-which , as beforementioned, is three to four times greater than the greatest annual export trade-that the Federal Government itself will force the merchant-maker to disregard its price-fixing for the grapes purchased for the local trade, and the growers will receive the Government price on that portion of wines only made for export, and will have to be satisfied with a price on 75 per cent, of their production which will be governed by the prices that the local merchantmaker can obtain for his wines on the local market. If the position is as serious as Mr Davis has stated, the immediate future of the industry is dark indeed. The following statement in the annual report of the V it i cultural Council accurately represents the circumstances of the industryThe last annual report of the above council throws much light on the Wine Export Bill now before the House of Representatives. Since it was issued there have been developments which enable the position in regard to the wine bounty to be summed up as follows:Expenditure. Gi;oss bounty paid to 12th March, 1928 Less drawback of excise paid .. Net bounty .. Official estimate of bounty at Is. 9d. from 12th March, 1928, to 30th June, 1928 .. Total to 30th June, 1928 Increase in Revenue. Gross increase to 30th June. 1928, if Is. 9d. bounty is maintained Less drawback of excise .. Net increase in revenue t>^('approximately) Mr Cook. It will be seen from the above figures that net expenditure on the bounty-afte r allowing for the great increase in revenue, due enIs. per gallon the estimated expenditure of Â£67,000 for the balance of the financial year will be reduced correspondingly, while the revenue must show an immense falling off. As a set-off against the net expenditure of Â£391,385 on bounty as shown above, the immense benefits that have been derived must be taken int* consideration. When the bounty was first introduced the wine industry faced what threatened to be a disastrous crisis. The bounty not only averted this, but did what it was specially designed to do, namely, increased the prices paid to growers for their grapes. This increase amounted to 120 per cent, for some varieties. The bounty was also responsible for a vast increase in the revenue. The exact figures for 1926-28 are not available owing to a system of deferred payments being introduced; but the figures given above are approximately correct, and have been arrived at after consultation with Customs Department officials. It is estimated on a conservative basis that during the bounty period the growers of wine grapes have benefited, owing to the increased prices, to the extent of Â£700,000. The driedfruits industry has benefited by, approximately. Â£100,000. The net' capital brought into the Commonwealth amounts to over Â£1,500,000. An analysis of these figures shows that the Wine Export Act has been one of the most successful pieces of legislation ever introduced to meet a critical position, and that the total value of the benefits derived from it over and above the net expenditure amounts to well over Â£2,700,000.. No doubt the Government feels that it has reason to be proud of the act. We have yet to learn to what extent a reduction in the bounty w ill affect the industry. I appreciate the concessions that have been made, and I hope that the Minister w ill be able to give us some assurance concerning the use of returned casks, also that he will instruct officers of his department to ascertain what is the true amount of the drawback. The payment .. Â£1,150,385 of the bounty has enabled our exporters 326,929 to secure a valuable trade in Great .. 823,456 Britain. Nothing should be done to jeopardize it . [ 5 . 5 ] I am somewhat at a loss to know Â£890,456 what is the position of the honourable .member for In d i ( Mr Cook), in view of the fact that he voted against the Â£826,000 second reading of the bill.

120,67.000 Mr Duncan,"HUGHES (Boothby)no reason for extreme gratitude to the Government for the alterations to the bill that are suggested. For my part, if the committee goes to a division on this clause, I shall vote against the Government. In what was practically a second reading speech in committee, the Minister( Mr Paterson) covered much ground that had been discussed by him earlier in the debate. In the course of his remarks he referred to certain honourable gentlemen as "" representing the wine industry."" I take exception to that, not because I think he was referring to me personallyI believe he had in mind other honourable members on this side of the House-bu t because they do not represent the wine industry. We might, with as much justification, state that the Minister represents the dairying industry. The use of the phrase, even in a jocular sense, suggests the importation of prejudice into the debate. The explanation of the proposed alterations given by the Minister was disappointing to me. Actually hs did not explain the amendment which it was intended to he made to the bill as originally drafted. Honourable members will recall that, when the bill was before the House previously, the Prime Minister indicated that the Government proposed to reconsider certain matters, with a view to ascertaining if alterations should be made. I expected the Minister to inform us on these various points, and especially to explain why concessions had been made in certain directions and not in others. It is to be hoped that he is in a position siderable proportion of the output of the to give us this information now. I am afraid that, if the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) had not risen to speak to this clause, we should not have had any explanation from the Government at all. The bill has given rise to a considerable amount of discussion since it was in the second-reading stage. I have heard it adversely criticized by people who, I know, have no interest whatever in wine-making. They take the view 'that a fair deal is not being given to people in the industry. I mention this to indicate that criticism of the measure in this chamber has had its reverberations outside, and that people who are not directly interested in wine-making regard its provisions'unfavorably. The Minister stated that certain wine-makers approve of it. I join with other honourable members in requesting that we should have definite information on this point. I do not pretend to know the names of all the wine-makers in my State, but I can mention at random eight or ten well known firms, such as Seppelts, Smith and Son, Hardy and Sons, Auldana, Buring and Sobels, Penfold, Kanmantoo, Reynella and Chateau Tanunda. Some of these firms have been in existence for upwards of 70 years, and are known throughout the Commonwealth. Can the Minister say if any of them are in favour of these Government proposals? I mentioned before that there was one, who conducts a small wine-making industry under the trade name of Tangari; but he is relatively unknown in my State and does not represent the views of either the makers or growers. The Minister has claimed also that only winemakers are concerned in the passage of this bill. The fact that the honourable member for ""Wakefield has received an urgent wire from three growers advising him that they were coming to Canberra as a deputation to the Prime Minister is in itself sufficient to indicate that the grapegrowers do not regard themselves as being without some interest in this matter. I do not wish to be ungenerous with regard to the alterations contained in the bill. They improve the measure as originally introduced, and, as stated by the Minister, they affect a conindustry. But unlike the honourable member for Indi, I do not regard these alterations as concessions, because they should not be put on the basis of concessions. It would have been the proper thing for the Government not . ta have delayed announcement of the reduction of the bounty until this year's grape crop had been gathered. The growers should have been given until the end of this year, so that those who have held back wines in order to mature them or to avoid a glut in the English market, should not he placed at a disadvantage. Under the provisions of this bill the 1928 vintage is excluded, except in the case of those makers who gave notice of their, intention to export prior to the 8th March.

The late Minister for Trade and Customs the Minister son), Bruce), speaking on the second reading there is to be a reduction of the of the bill, declared that the wine-makers bounty? were not doing as much for the industry to understand that the reduction w ill as they should be doing.

I suggested, when speaking on the second reading, that the bill was an attempt to force them to accept some form of control. The honourable member informs me that such a control bill has been prepared, or is already on the stocks. I can hardly believe that to be so, in view of the Minister's assurance to me on tbe second reading that no attempt was being made to enforce any form of control on the wine-makers by the reduction of the bounty. Minister, but by a representative of the growers, that a control bill has been drafted. their views on this subject must havo changed a great deal since I saw some of the leading men in the industry. No doubt there is a handful of the smaller growers who would readily put themselves in that position if they could. The Minister, speaking on the l l t h May, said, according to a press reportThe Government, in order to give a feeling of stability to the industry, intended to conable members who supported the second tinue unaltered the bountv of Is. until 31st August, 1930. Was the Minister correctly reported? what I said. statement seems to me to place the GoA'ernment in a most illogical position with regard to the present reduction. If the matter is to be adjusted accprding to the position in which the industry finds itself, what justification can there be for making a reduction now, but not later, when the industry may perhaps enjoy greater prosperity than it does at the present time? Dealing with the matter on the basis of the Government's own argument, if an improvement should occur in the future, there would logically be a further reduction of the bounty. When the Minister said that he would not make any further reduction until the 31st August, 1930-and I quite believe that he *-ill keep his word-h e stultified his present action. One is reminded of the story of the cricket umpire, whose decision, [180] when appealed to, was "" N ot out; but don't do it again. Next time you will be out."" The Government has inverted that attitude. The Minister has said to the wine-makers, "" You are batting well. We have laid down rules, it is true, under which the game is to be played, and we think that it would be even better if you had a system of control to improve your style I But you are making far too many runs, and, therefore, I give you out. But to encourage you when you come in on the second innings, you can make as many runs as you like, because you certainly will not be given out until the 31st August,, 1930."" the must confess to some surprise and disappointment at the Minister's statement to the committee. I voted for the second reading, and I intend to vote for tlie bill through the committee stage; but it seems to me that the effect of the new British preference, which has now been in operation for more than a year, should be open to clear and definite proof. Thewhole point at issue is whether or not that preference is worth 9d. or more per gallon to the Australian wine exporter.. After this delay I expected the Government to be able to furnish those honor1 reading with unchallengeable evidence of the effect of the bounty on the Australian price in London. I must say, however, in fairness to the Government, that those who oppose the reduction of the bounty have failed to disprove any benefit from the British preference. I should say that, if this preference is not worth 9d. per gallon, it should be easy tea prove it. Altogether the position is unsatisfactory. I move That the following words be added to the clause:""Provided that no bounty shall be payable in respect of wine which is not shown, to the satisfaction of the Minister, to be the product of areas actually planted with vines on the 31st day of March, 1928."" This amendment is no stranger to the? committee. I submitted the proposal in March last year, and I should like to> refer briefly to its history.

He finally declared, however, that as the bounty would operate only for three years, it would not be necessary to impose the condition that I now wish to incorporate in the bill. When I submitted a similar amendment iti March last, the late Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten), who was in charge of the bill, said that at first glance before the bounty was payable, was being he was not prepared to accept it. That was on a Friday morning on the last day of a sessional period; but immediately after luncheon he called me to the table and said that he had submitted the amendment to the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), who strongly approved of it, and expressed the wish that I should move it. The Minister also suggested that I should secure the assistance of the Attorney General( Mr Latham) in drafting the amendment, which I did. LaterI moved tihe amendment, which was accepted by ths then Minister for Trade and Customs on behalf of the Government, and supported by the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), who was then Deputy Leader, and it appeared that it would pass on the voices. However, a certain amount of opposition came from honourable members representing winegrowing districts, and as it was a Friday afternoon and the last day of a sessional period, very reluctantly, at the request of the Minister, I withdrew it. I mention these facts to show that the amendment was accepted by this Government on a previous occasion. I do not know the intentions of the Minister ih this instance; but seeing that a similar amendment was moved by me in March last at the wish of the Prime Minister, the Government should not oppose it to-day, particularly -as the conditions are now practically the same as they were in March last. Although the bounty is being reduced by t>d. a gallon, a bounty of Is. a gallon will still be paid until September, 1930, which Trill involve the expenditure of some lundreds of thousands of pounds annually, which will have to be met hy Australian taxpayers.

They had been directed to plant large areas with a particular kind of vine which, grown unprofitably. I submit that the additional wine exported as a result of the bounty only increases the financial loss to the Commonwealth. The bounty would never have been granted if it had been thought that the industry would not be on a proper basis within a few years and unable to carry on without governmental assistance. It may be urged by the Minister that the bounty will be paid only until September, 1930; and if I were confident that no further payments would be made after that date I would not press my amendment. Studying the matter from a political viewpoint, however, I think there is every possibility of it being paid after 1930, as when once a government starts spoon-feeding an industry it finds it exceedingly difficult to stop. It cannot be denied that assistance in this form has resulted in larger areas being planted, not only with doradillo vines, which are used for the production .of fortifying spirit, but also with other wines, the grapes from which are used for wine-making. To this extent the bounty has been detrimental to the taxpayers. All the amendment provides is that the bounty shall be payable only on wines produced from areas planted before March of this year. The bounty would be paid on the product of vines which were renewals; but if new areas are planted the growers will not benefit from governmental assistance. I shall probably be told that the amendment, if incorporated in the bill, will be difficult to administer. That may be so; but difficulties in administration do not constitute sufficient reason for rejecting an amendment which provides a safeguard. We are not sent here to be told by customs officials what we should clear that after a given date persons applying for the wine bounty must make a statutory declaration that the wine on which the bounty is claimed is the product of areas planted before March last, there should be no difficulty. squad of police would be necessary to enforce the law. the grape-growers are so criminally disposed that they would plant vines with the object of defrauding the Customs Department. The adoption of an amendment such as I have moved will check planting, and the further extension of an industry which is already unprofitable. So far as I am aware the wine bounty is the only Commonwealth bounty on which there is no limit as to the total amount payable. The total amounts of the bounty payable on sugar, cotton, and iron and steel are limited. sugar. a bounty, but the assistance given the industry is limited by the Australian market. on wire and wire netting are not limited. wire and wire netting; but so far as I know, the wine bounty is the only one on which there is no limit as to total expenditure. I do not wish to delay the committee, but I contend that there is a sound, business like, and econoalthough the Government knew exactly mic principle underlying this amendment, which honourable members in performing their duties to the taxpayers should support. In view of our financial and economical position, it is the duty of honbounty of Is. 9d. a gallon should be reorable members to support the amendment, as the wine bounty has already cost the taxpayers two or three times more than was contemplated when it was first adopted. The honourable member for Henty( Mr opposed to the action of the Government. Gullett) is, of course, aware that a proposal similar to that which he has submitted was brought forward when provision was first made for the payment of a wine bounty; but it was defeated. I am, however, in agreement with him as to a limitation. As previously stated, the Government's concession cannot be regarded as in any way generous, or as a straightforward candid piece of business. It is well known that in connection with the 1927 and 1928 season, no notice of any reduction in the bounty was given until after one-half of the vintage was already in the wineries. I wish honourable members to bear that in mind, and to consider whether any upright honourable business concern would submit a proposal such as that we are considering. Possibly if a commercial firm went to the court on such a case it might win on a technical point, but its good name would be impaired. It is just as well to speak plainly in these matters. The Government's proposal in this instance has aroused the interest of the grape-growers and wine-makers to a much greater extent than honourable members who are not in close touch with the industry can possibly realize. I regret that the representatives of the grape-growers on the river Murray area have not had an opportunity to place their case before the Government before this measure is passed. They have excellent reasons why there should not be a reduction in the bounty. They have been here before. of the grape-growers visited Canberra; but there was some delay, and as they could not. remain over the week-end they could not state their case. On a previous occasion they waited nearly a fortnight, what they wanted. Before the representatives of the grape-growers left Canberra they authorized certain honourable members to submit a proposal that the present duced by 3d. a gallon each year over a period of seven years. It was on that point that a division was taken in this House, and the Government had a majority of only three. Actually the majority of honourable members was The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), raised the issue whether the problem affects the wine-makers principally. Unquestionably it does not. It chiefly! affects the man who grows the grapes. The deputation which is to arrive here to-morrow will represent not the wineries, but the returned soldier",35,Sgivgs

The Government suggested a reduction of excise duty on fortifyin g spirit from Os. to 3s. a gallon as a palliative, but the Federal Viticul ment. tural Council pointed out the uselessness of this reduction of excise duty to help the position, and asked for the bounty, which was granted. The bounty was the recommendation of the experts, who were thoroughly familiar with the business. The whole of the bounty so far paid by the Government has been covered to a very great extent by the increased quantity of fortifying spirit made and used, and is considerably less than the 3s. reduction which the Government was prepared to make to save the effect of their own action. Ur. Foster. I want that paragraph to sink deeply Therefore, the industry has been more than Earle Page says that, because we have shipped gallons of wine out of Australia, in of a bounty being continued for a reason, able period, London merchants, who interested in the bounty six months ahead, they arranged to have forwarded large quantities to the trade statistics of the United Kingdom, which he must have available to He tralian wine in bond at the end of February, The clearances for home consumption in the Kingdom for the month of February was 161,631 gallons in 1927, and 148,007 i i i 1928. Tliere is, therefore, at least twenty months' supplies in bond in London, and the further shipments that are going forward are on the contracts booked by London merchants early in 1927, before the reduction of Is. in bounty took place. Therefore, shipments from Australia arc not consumption, and it is evident that the London merchant is not going to renew contracts until he has cleared his bondmerchant is not a philanthropist, and unless Australian wines can compete successfully with continental supplies he will return to his century-old foreign connexions. The main factor of the Federal Government's Bounty Act was the protection of the grapegrowers' interest in obtaining for him a fair return for his product, but the Australian local market is a much greater factor than the export market, as tlie local market absorbs from three to four times the quantity of the greatest exports of wine in any one year. The Government has only been able to control the prices of grapes on the wine export by refusing the bounty to any exporter who has not paid the prices for grapes fixed by the GovernI recollect h a v in g taken a trip w it h the P r i m e M in is t e r in to the w in e g r o w i ng districts, when the r i g h t honourable gentlem a n to l d the b i g wineries d is t in c t l y t h a t the bounty was not for them, b u t for the growers. What about the grape prices for the local Australian consumption, which is 75 per cent, of the grapes produced? The Australian merchant maker who has been fighting for his existence for many years on a broken local market, which has given him a very small return for his efforts, saw in the removal of the surplus wines by exports thc opportunity of the local market being improved, and, never anticipating that the Federal Government would take such drastic action as it has done in the contemplated reduction of bounty, came forward to assist the Government and the industry by observing the grape prices fixed by the Federal Government, although there was no responsibility for him to do so. The position of the local merchant maker is quite different to that of the exporter. The merchant maker has to lay down stocks of wines each vintage to mature for several years to enable him to supply matured wines of various ages for the local market under his various grades. The export maker has been in the position of exporting his wines for some few months after vintage, and his finance problems have accordingly been 7nuch easier than the merchant maker who has to carry his matured stocks for several years and face increasing interest, handling costs, cellar wages and heavy costs of distribution to the local market. What will it mean? The stocks laid down by the merchant maker for the past two or three years have been at considerably increased cost to him owing to his observance of the prices fixed by the Government for grapes and for t if y in g spirit, and he is now in an enviable position as any reduction of export following on the intended reduction in bounty of Od. a gallon is going to throw sufficient of the surplus production of wine on to the local market to further reduce the local selling price-whic h reduction will have to be faced by the merchant with large stocks of high cost wines in his cellars ""to quit. It is obvious that the local merchant maker will be unable to continue to pay the increased price of grapes fixed by the Government for bounty purposes, and it is difficult to understand how the Federal Government can overlook tin's factor in its anticipations. It will mean with local consumption, which as before mentioned, is three to four times greater than the greatest annual export trade, that the Federal Government itself will force the merchant maker to disregard its price fixing for the grapes purchased for the local trade, and the growers will receive the Government price on that portion of wines only made for exports, and will have to be satisfied with a price on 75 per cent, of their production 1 -which w ill be governed by the prices whicli the local merchant maker can obtain for his wines on the local market. Therefore, the Government is precipitating a serious crisis in the industry, which will affect at least 75 per cent, of the grape production, and be beyond thc Government's power to control-whateve r they might be able to do, so far as thc small proportion of grapes produced for the export trade is concerned. The Federal Government's action is most extraordinary in tlie face of the facts that have been placed before it by the practical men in the trade, who do know something about their own industry. The disregard of this practical, expert knowledge by the enormous planting of Doradilla vineyards in the first instance was rectified by the same practical expert knowledge advising the Government to grant a bounty instead of a reduction of excise duty, as they intended to do. Again, the Government is making a drastic cut in the bounty against the same practical expert knowledge, and when it is faced in the future with the result of its own action by the debacle forecasted, it w ill then expect the practical man in the industry to come to its rescue again. It is evident from the facts stated that men in the local marketing end of the industry have by their own broad policy of paying the prices fixed by the Government on 75 per cent, of the grapes produced for wine-whicl i was never exported-assiste d the Government at their own cost to improve the grape-growers' position, and the thanks that they w ill receive for this large-hearted effort of co-operation with the Government-if this further reduction of bounty takes place-wil l be the facing of a broken retail market with cellars f u l l of highcost stocks. If the Federal Government continues with its intention so far as the amending bill is concerned, it w ill be forced to realize by the 192S) vintage that it has placed the grape-grower in a much worse position than he was in before the bounty was enacted. The organization of an export trade which grew so extensively, is a matter requiring extreme care and deliberation, particularly when the export market is at the other side of the world, and when it is realized that actual consumption, and not export, is the factor that has to be considered. The Federal Viticultural Council of Australia has been working unceasingly, trying to weld the various diverse interests and opinions, which are in every industry, along channels of co-operation, with the result that the Federal Government has before it at this moment a Wine Overseas Marketing B ill , which is intended to control the position in the future.

The articl e continuesA number of the exporters in the initial stages of the export trade considered perhaps rightly that the best means of building up the trade quickly, and relieving the local market of that tremendous surplus of wine, was to get the export price to the lowest possible margin to induce the London merchant to give up his century-old connexions with foreign countries, and interest himself in Australian wines. This has been a very big factor to overcome, and the",37,Sgivgs
138,Mr Foster,"I a m r e a d in g an exGovernment will find that the amount of profit actually made by the exporter maker during the period of the bounty, has been a small percentage. The grape-grower has received an immediate and increased profit, both from the exporter maker, and particularly from the.local merchant maker, who has paid the Government prices fixed for grapes without demur, although he has no responsibility to do so other than the broad principle of assisting the Government and his industry. The effect of this interference hy amateurs is to drive the industry towards destruction. heard about the new wine-making company in England, which last year paid a dividend of 30 per cent. This company is extending its operations enormously, and it will eventually be one of our most powerful rivals. Is there anything in the market conditions in Britain to justify this reduction of the bounty by as much as 9d. a gallon? There is nothing at all, because we have yet to prove that we have a grip on the British market. ""We have already a large surplus of wine stored in England, and there is a possibility of that surplus being increased. Every contract with the London buyers contains a stipulation to the effect that no alteration in the bounty will interfere with the price which the importers have to pay. Our wines have been well reported on, and some of the makers here have been maturing their wines in order to give their clients overseas the best possible article. Now they have been caught with large quantities of this wine on their hands, and will suffer if the bounty is reduced. There is a gentleman at this moment on his way to Australia to buy 1,000,000 gallons of high grade wine. He has stated, however, that if the price is increased through the operation of this altered bounty he will not buy a single gallon. member does not suggest that a difference of 9d. a gallon will stop a big deal of that kind! exporters are at present operating on an extremely fine margin of profit at Home, and because they have to meet such strong competition, due to the importation of must from Spain, Portugal, and the near East. Sitting suspended from 6.10 to 8 p.m. I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), and oppose the proposal of the Governmeut to reduce the amount of bounty that is now being paid to the wine industry. I take up this stand, because I recognize that protection is the accepted policy of Australia, and that, if primary industries are to be assisted, there is no alternative except to grant bounties in the case of secondary industries. I Honourable members have realize that very great care must be exercised when consideration is being given to the question whether a bounty should be paid to any industry, because of the possibility of deep inroads being made upon the public exchequer by industries which have no chance of succeeding even with such assistance. We have not to look far to find the reason why the Government went to the assistance of the growers of doradillo grapes. The returned soldiers who were induced to go upon the land and plaut doradillo grapes were in a serious position, and as it was impossible for them unaided to find a market for their product the Government naturally had to assist them. The present proposal is a drastic one. Six months ago a bill was introduced into this Parliament to reduce by Is. a gallon the rate of bounty which was then being paid on the export of wine. It is now proposed to make a still further reduction of 9d. a gallon. It is true that the amount of money which it has been found necessary to set aside to discharge the bounty obligations of the Government has been larger than was anticipated. The reason for that, however, is not that the area planted with doradillo grapes was largely increased, as has been suggested hy the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), but that the growers turned their product into a more lucrative channel; instead of leaving it in the drying sheds, they sent it to the wineries. It has been computed that 46,000 tons of grapes have been diverted from the drying sheds to the distilleries as the result of the payment of the bounty. Such a large diversion was not anticipated. There is another phase of the matter which the Government must bear in mind; it is that which was stressed by the honourable member for",39,Sgivgs

141,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [8.0],"Wakefield. Six months ago the Government undertook to pay this bounty to the wine industry for a period of three years. The only suggestion at that time of a possible modification of that policy was that if the preference given to Australian wine by the British Government was sufficient to justify a reduction, such a reduction would be made. The Minister( Mr dustry is a sister industry to the wine Paterson) has contended that the preference which has since been given by the British Government justifies the proposed reduction in the rate of bounty. A most cursory examination of the position will show that such is not the case. As a matter of fact, in 1924 the British duty on Australian wine was 4s. a gallon, and on foreign wine 6s. a gallon, thus giving to Australia a preference of 2s. a gallon. In 1925 Australia was given a preference of 4s. a gallon, as the duty on its wine was reduced to 2s. a gallon,' whereas the duty of 6s. a gallon on foreign wine was retained. In 1927, however, a change took place in the policy of the British Government, with the result that the duty on Australian wine was increased from 2s. to 4s. a gallon. In the face of that fact, how can the Minister insist that Australia received a preference during that period? duty on foreign wine was raised to 8s. a gallon, or double that which was imposed on Australian wine; but it must be remembered that the proportion of preference which Australia received was smaller in 1927 than in 1925 because she had to pay double the amount of duty, whereas that on foreign wine increased by only one-third. There is also another factor. The line of division between high strength and low strength wineswas altered, with the result that continental wines in which the proportion of proof spirit was less than 25 per cent, were permitted to enter Great Britain on an equality of duty with Australian wines, for the reason that it is necessary to maintain the alcoholic strength of our wines at not less than 34 per cent, to carry them unimpaired over the long voyage. There has been a great economic change in the British wine industry; instead of being an importer Great Britain is now a manufacturer of wine. There has been a large increase in the importation of cheap wines of a low strength from Portugal, Spain and France. Smaller quantities of other wine containing a very high percentage of proof spirit have heen imported and used for blending purposes, and thus the manufacture of wine in Great Britain has become a very important industry. The dried fruits inindustry because the grower of grapes can have his product made into either wine or dried fruits. The action of the Government in giving a large bounty to the wine industry has had the effect of placing the dried fruits industry in a particularly bad condition. A bountyshould have been given to each. If that had been done they would have developed side by side, and both would now be on a payable basis. Instead of that, however, 46,000 tons of fruit have been diverted from their natural channel to the wine industry, with serious consequences to the former. The following wire has been received from the Growers' Distillery at Renmark regarding the quantity of wine which is held in bond in London at the present time:Referring our letter 4th instant, we eable* Harper's Wine Journal, "" Please cable quantity Australian -wine in bond April 30th and quanI t is true that the tity of British wine made last year."" Just received reply, "" Australian bonded 3,380,000 gallons, British manufactured 2,488,872 gallons."" That to me is evidence that there is not in Great Britain a market which will afford a satisfactory outlet for large quantities of Australian wine. According to the annual statement of trade of the United Kingdom with foreign countries and British countries for the year 1926, the total quantity of wine imported in casks into Great Britain in that year was 14,000,000 gallons. Those are the latest figures available. That quantity, together with the 6,000,000 gallons of Australian and British wine in bond is equal to about five months' supply. It must be remembered, however, that Portugal supplies nearly 8,000,000 gallons of the total importations into Great Britain. Honourable members are probably aware that the name "" port"" as applied to Australian wine is derived from the well-known "" Oporto"" of Portugul. It is very hard for Australian port wine, excellent though it is, to compete against the Oporto, which has a special market Therefore, we are practically in a cleft stick. The wine-growers are in a bad economic position, and must be assisted. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has offered the only possible solution of the difficulty. He has suggested that, concurrently with the granting of assistance to the wine industry, it is absolutely necessary that the dried fruits industry also shall be assisted, because it is concerned with the same set of growers. That would enable us to preserve a proper balance between the quantity of grapes turned into dried fruits and those turned into wine. But the Government has turned a deaf ear to the exhortations of the honourable member for ""Wimmera( Mr Stewart) and honourable members who represent dried fruit growers in South Australia. I admit that it is difficult to find the amount necessary to finance this matter in a proper way. It has been clearly shown, however, that a bounty of Â£10 a ton on dried fruits would amount in the aggregate to infinitely less than the sum which has beeu handed out to the wine industry in the past. The bounty of 2s. 9d. a gallon which was paid in 1924 was equal to Â£38 10s. on every ton. of dried fruits. Had a similar bounty been given on the production of dried fruits, that industry would have been placed upon a firm footing. I have quoted figures to show that, in view of the limited market in Great Britain, the outlook for the disposal of a larger quantity of Australian wines there is not too promising. The position is different as far as dried fruits are conexcise on fortifying spirit for wines, with cerned, because, while the Government is prepared to assist and to give preference to Australian productsand there is no likelihood of a change in that policy-there will always he a big market for Australian dried fruits in -Great Britain. that have been supplied to us that the proportion of Australian dried raisins .and currants supplied to the British public is about 20 or 25 per cent, of the total consumption. market in Great Britain for dried raisins and currants, but it is at present largely monopolized by the Californian growers. Had a bounty been given on exported dried fruits, alongside the bounty on exported wines, growers generally would have benefited to a considerable Mr A. Green. extent. Under the present lopsided arrangement the wine industry has flourished, while the sister industry, the production .of dried fruits, has languished. It is time that the Government retraced its steps and placed that industry on a firm footing, and until it attempts to do this, I shall oppose any reduction in the bounty on wine exported from this country. Earlier in the debate on this clause I exhausted my time limit, but having had the opportunity of listening to later speeches, including that of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), who has moved an amendment to the clause, I now return, invigorated and refreshed, to the debate. The honourable member for Henty has taken up the position that the wine industry does not provide the revenue with which to pay the bounty, which, he says, is provided by the consumer. That argument may be applied to many things. The honourable member may say that the land and income taxation and other rates which he himself pays, are really paid, not by him, but by the consumer or the general public of Australia. His contention is far-fetched. I should like to remind him that the grape-growing industry has provided more revenue than any other industry. The growers have not only to bear the excise duties, but also to pay the ordinary rates and taxes of the country. No other country in the world imposes British the possible exception of Italy, which country, I understand, makes a small charge to cover the cost of supervision, The honourable member for Henty also referred to the increased planting of doradillo vines as the result of the wine We know from figures bounty; but I point out that that has nothing to do with the present position of the industry. There is a large honourable member was not in the chamber when I was speaking. honourable member's speech, and made a note of some of his remarks. He really was not conversant . with his subject. Leading up to the moving of his amendment, he stated that there had been large plantings of doradillo vines since the",40,Sgivgs

143,Mr Gullett,I am afraid that the,42,Sgivgs
144,Mr Parsons,"I listened to the payment of the bounty; but I would inform him that within the last few years practically no doradillos have been planted at all. Mr Gursansky, the President of the Barossa Grape-growers' Association, and Mr Salter, the President of the Pederal Viticultural Council, are of the opinion that although the amendment may have emanated from the honourable member with the best of intentions, it would not have the desired effect, because it would be quite easy for a winemaker to keep separate any wines crushed from grapes, which, under the amendment, would be ineligible for the bounty. The wine-maker would export only wines made from grapes, for, which the fixed price had been paid, and which were eligible for the bounty. Wines made from grapes of later plantings, and in consequence, ineligible for the bounty, would be sold locally. Being aware of this and of the over-planting of some varieties of grapes, and with a view to trying to find a solution of this problem, I made a suggestion to both of these gentlemen. They agreed that perhaps the object of the amendment might be achieved by providing that the price fixed by the Government should not apply tcany grapes that were planted after a certain date. A wine-maker would then he able to pay what price he liked for those grapes, and the grower would think twice before he planted further vines. would certainly have a restraining effect on planting, whereas the amendment' of the honourable member for Henty, if included in the clause, would be entirely ineffective. It has been said during the debate that the amount of the bounty paid has exceeded all expectations, and for that reason, should be reduced. should like to remind honourable members that the excise received from this industry also has exceeded all expectations, and British market, at a cost of 8s. per gallon, that it has practically doubled during the period that the bounty has been in operation. It has also been stated that the amount of the bounty is altogether too great considering the price that the wine-makers receive for the wine exported. That is not a fair argument. We must take into consideration the whole ramifications of the wine industry, including the Australian consumption, the quantity of grape juice that is used in the manufacture of grape brandy, and also the export trade, and compare the bounty paid with that and the excise received. If we do that, we shall find that the bounty is costing this country very little indeed. sansky, of Tanunda, who put the views of the grape-growers before me. He pointed out that the probable yield of wine next year would be 20,000,000 gallons. Owing to the severe frosts this season, and to the weather conditions generally during vintage, there has been a falling-off in output, but there will be a bumper crop next year, because the vines that this year were adversely affected by frost, will be all the more prolific because of the period of rest. In addition, several thousand acres of vines will be coming into bearing. The position is that in a few years' time we shall produce 25,000,000 gallons of wine. The Australian consumption is 13,000,000 gallons, and about 1,000,000 gallons are exported to India and New Zealand. Great Britain may, in the near future, absorb 5,000,000 gallons of our wine. At present we are exporting a little under 2,000,000 gallons to Great Britain, and if this Government is to do anything at all to assist the industry, its efforts must be in the direction of increasing the opportunity of selling our wines in Great That Britain, instead of reducing the bounty and making the exportation of wines to that country more difficult than it is at present. We have also to contend with the competition of South Africa, which has an arrangement with the Vine Products Limited, of Great Britain. That country is also planting at the rate of 3,000 acres I a year, and will, in time, be a serious competitor with us. South Africa can land its wines at the best time on the as against 9s. Id. in the case of Australian wines. It has been stated that the wine industry has done little, if anything, to improve the position overseas. I understand that approximately Â£250,000 has been expended by the wine industry during the last two years in advertising in Great Britain. That information was supplied to me by Mr Gursansky. Early in the discussions on this bill I referred to the remarks made by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) when",42,Sgivgs
145,I Discussed This Aspect With Mr Gur,"he first introduced a Wine Export Bill in 1924, and quoted him as having said that it might be asked why the excise duty should not be reduced, seeing that it was imposed as a war measure, and the war was over, but that after consultation with the industry and representatives of the growers it had been decided to let the excise duty remain, because it would provide a fund out of which to pay the bounty. replying he said that I had said that the excise duty was imposed as a war measure and that now the war was over it might reasonably be cut out. I made no such suggestion. the Prime Minister had said. matter of fact I agree with those engaged in the industry that the best thing to do is to leave the excise duty where it is and leave the bounty I should not like my constituents to think that I was so ignorant of the position of the industry that, contrary to its wishes, I would favour the removal of the excise duty. In G-reat Britain at the present time there are over 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine in bond. It is unsold. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber have asked why this should be. The reason for it forms one of the strongest pleas for the retention of the bounty at its present rate, and it is that the wine is not saleable at its present price. If Australian wines were receiving a great measure of benefit from operation Minister would have us believe they aretheir price on the British market would be lower than that of foreign wines, and thus they would be in a favorable position to compete with the so-called British wines; they would not be in bond, and the wine merchants would be anxious to get them out of bond and sell them, because they would be the best' line on the market if only the price was right. But the price of wines is not right, and in consequence large quantities the and what their position will be next year with a bumper crop. sumption of Great Britain is 16,000,000 gallons a year, and 80 per cent, of that is cheap wines sold at about 2s. 6d. a'bottle. There is, therefore, a ready market for Mr Parsons. Bounty 13,000,000 gallons of low-priced wine, and the 3,000,000 gallons qf Australian wine now in bond would easily be absorbed in supplying portion of that 13.000,000 gallons if the wine sellers of Great Britain could put it on the market at a price which would enable it to compete with British and foreign wines. Several telegrams have passed between Mr C.. S. Panton, secretary to the PederalV it i When the Minister was cultural Council and MrL . N . Salter, the president of the council. I shall read them. The first, dated the 2nd May, is ""Paterson desires know whether industry I merely quoted what would prefer honoring all genuine contracts As a ft,t Is. 9d. for '27 vintage or as alternative concession on whole balance '27 wine.

Please wire me Sydney. The reply he received from Mr Salter wasClaim as stated in my wire cannot honestly be disputed. Government must take full rethe sponsibility for any alteration. of the British tariff-the I also place the responsibility on the Government. I disclaim any connection with the present proposal. I am absolutely opposed to it, and in that opposition I am supported by the whole of the grapegrowers of South Australia, who represent 80 per cent, of those engaged in of Great Britain growing grapes for the manufacture of spirit, and I think I am also speaking on behalf of a large proportion of Australian the wine-growers of the rest of Australia. A number of comments still remain in bond; concerning the position of the grapeexport trade has fallen of f , growers have been made by gentlemen the growers are afraid of who are well fitted to speak on the subject.

If this be the ease with wine exported under the bounty of 3s. per gallon, with exporters asking for only a bare margin over cost in order to attract buyers, how much of the 1929 export surplus will be unsaleable, with the makers compelled to ask a higher price in order to make up even a little of the 9d. reduction in the bounty? And, if the wine-makers see no prospect of exporting the surplus over Australian requirements of the 1929 vintage, will they be prepared to purchase more grapes than they can find a market for as wine? The position is undoubtedly serious, and, like in all crises through which the industry has passed, the grower has generally been the chief sufferer. This gentleman also saysThe wine-maker has, to his credit, purchased more than his requirements rather than close down on his growers before the whole crop was harvested, and has found no compensation awaiting him by way of improved markets. But with prices at a high level, made compulsory by government regulation, with the general financial depression restricting trading credits, and with no prospect before him oi disposing of a heavy vintage overseas, the one course open to the maker will be to buy only such quantities as will be necessary for his requirements, and, provided the London market remains as at present, his requirements will be 3,000,000 gallons of sweet wine less than can be made from grapes available. Allowing for the wine distilled to furnish the spirit for these 3,000,000 gallons, it represents in all about 35,000 tons of grapes, for which there may be no buyers. The Government has fixed the price of grapes. There is an old saying that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make him drink. I am entirely in accord w i th the policy of fixing the price of grapes, but if the wine-maker has no outlet for his wine, he w ill only buy sufficient grapes at the fixed price to produce the wine for which he has an outlet. The balance of the grapes w ill be left ou the vines. Of what use is it to get a better price for one's grapes if one can dispose of only three-fourths of them ? If the export trade becomes entirely unprofitable, fhe only course open to the wine-maker w ill be to cut out his export trade. W it h the cutting out of the export trade away goes the only hold the Government has on the wine-maker to compel him to pay a fixed price for the grapes he buys; the wine-maker not being in receipt of any bounty w ill be able to pay what he likes for his grapes. in the old position again. recently I was in conversation with a wine-maker, whose advice was to "" Out the bounty out altogether."" I asked hi m what that would mean. He said-""We w ill get back to normal."" I asked what that meant, his reply was"" Ordinary normal conditions."" I wanted to know how the grower would be affected, I was informed that the grower would get "" a reasonable price for his grapes,"" and when I asked what the wine-maker considered a reasonable price for grapes, the reply was"" Â£5 a ton for doradillos; Â£6 a ton for lexias; and Â£7 a ton for shiraz grapes."" The prices for these grapes at the present time are Â£6, Â£8 and Â£10 10s. respectively. That w ill be the position of the growers when this bill is passed. Another prominent grower of Tanunda has expressed himself in the following words:Now, if we get a slump next year, the Murray people will be yelling for help; it is a way they have when anything goes wrongI do not agree with thatAll irrigation lands are government leases, not freehold. Millions of public money are locked up in the irrigation settlements, and in addition to this, the soldier settlements are a government pledge to provide returned soldiers with a reasonable livelihood. If a slump comes, the Murray will be the first to suffer, as, instead of purchasing spirit from the Murray distilleries, the wine-makers in Barossa will have sufficient grapes at their door to provide for their needs. I do not want to keep slogging at this matter. Surely the Minister has heard enough to convince him that he has made a false step. It is better to retreat from a false position than to butt your head against a stone wall, because you have not the moral courage to beat a retreat. "" To err is human; to forgive, divine."" If the Minister w ill admit that he has erred, we shall excuse him because he is human, and he w ill have the divine forgiveness of the whole of the vine producing districts of Australia. I want to giye the committee the real reason why this reduction in bounty has been made and my authority is the Treasurer.

The dried-fruits industry is able to obtain a payable price for that portion of its produce which is sold in Australia. There is no reason why the wine industry should not do likewise, and be able to pay a fair price to the growers of grapes used for the manufacture of wine for consumption in Australia. Sheltered by a high-tariff wall, the wine-makers have the market to themselves, and are selling a commodity the price of which has not to be cut to the bone as if it were a necessary article of food. A payment of an additional Â£2 per ton for grapes is equivalent to an increase of Id. per bottle of sweet wine. If the difference between the fixed prices for grapes and prices formerly prevailing, is set down at Â£2 per ton, will any one say that the Australian market can not carry the necessary trifling increase amounting to Id. per bottle on sweet wine and less still on dry wine. The Commonwealth Government would be surprised if the wine-makers took the action that some honourable members have suggested is threatened. legislation has been to help the growers, and if the threatened action were taken, the Government would have to review the position and safeguard them in another way. makers do what the honourable member has suggested they will do, it will be time enough for the Government to decide what further steps it shall take; but I do not believe that they contemplate any action of that kind. The honourable member for Angas challenged me to name the gentlemen who, I said, had admitted that the industry could carry on profitably with a bounty of Is. per gallon on the wine exported. I did not say that the wine-makers were about the reduction; human nature being what it is, that was not to be expected; but I said, and repeat, that some of them admitted that the industry could make a reasonable profit""not easy money"" as one remarkedwith a bounty of Is. per gallon as soon as the London market readjusted itself to the changed conditions. I do not feel called upon to mention their names. them. I deny that statement. member is practically challenging my veracity; surely he is carrying his championship of the wine-maker3 beyond the bounds of good taste. When men come to me and discuss their business frankly I should not be acting fairly by them if I divulged their names. But I again assure the committee that more than one wine maker has admitted that the industry can carry on profitably on the basis of the new bounty and the existing price of grapes. I shall briefly reiterate the main points upon w-hich the Government bases the reduction. The alteration of the British tariff has given a substantial advantage to our wine-makers. Continental unblended wines against which ours have to compete were formerly dutiable at 2s. 6d. per gallon; the duty is now Ss., an increase of 5s. 6d. per gallon. The duty on Australian wines has been increased from 2s. to 4s., leaving our winemakers with an advantage of 4s. per galThe whole purpose of this lon. Previously their actual advantage over continental competitors was only 6d. per gallon; to-day it is 3s. 6d. per gallon more than it was then. Of course, wines from South Africa or any other British dominion are on the same footing as our own. In regard to blended wines, the latest advice I have is that the efforts to mix 2 or 3 gallons of low-strength wine with 1 gallon of highstrength wine have been a failure, and have been abandoned. If any blending is done now it is confined to the mixing of 1 gallon of low-strength wine with 1 gallon of highstrength wine. If 1 gallon of 25 degrees strength, dutiable at 3s., is blended with 1 gallon of 42 degrees strength, dutiable at 8s., the average duty of 5s. 6d. still leaves our wines of greater strength enthusiastic with an advantage of Is. 6d. a gallon. A little over twelve months ago, when .the bounty was reduced to Is. 9d., our winemakers had an advantage of only 6d. per gallon. Eveni f low and high strength wines can be blended successfully in equal parts, and assuming that the blending costs nothing, the Australian exporter is Is. per gallon better off than he was a year",46,Sgivgs

A good deal has been said to-day concerning the position in regard to British wine. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) stated that I had failed to deal with that matter on Friday last. As a matter of fact I spoke on it at some length, and to-day I was accused of having made a second-reading speech on the subject. Reference was made by one honourable member to-day to a letter which had been received from Mr Walker, who urged that the excise on so-called British wine should be at least as high as the duty on dominion wines. What is the position? Rather less than a month ago the excise on British wine was raised from la. to Is. 6d. a gallon. We have been informed that the ingredients for the blending of that wine pay a duty of 6d. a gallon, and Australian wine is one of those ingredients. If we add this amount to the new rate of excise of Is. 6d., we find that the new excise on British wine up to 27 degrees is equivalent to 2s. a gallon. We are informed that in almost all cases British wine is of 27 degrees strength or lower, so that the taxation on it very closely approximates the duty on dominion wines of a similar strength. The additional excise on British wines, plus the duty on ingredients, practically places them on the* same taxation footing, strength for strength, with wines produced in the dominions. These facts, then, fully justify the alterations in the bounty which have been made. With regard to the amendment submitted by the lett), I desire to say that the Government is prepared to accept it. did not have an opportunity to speak during the second-reading debate, and I do not propose now to deal with all the various points that have been raised by other honourable members. As has been stated, the clause under discussion is really the bill, and I observe that in the discussion on it, you, sir, have allowed honourable members to deal with almost every aspect of the wine industry. ThoughI do not wish to speak at length, I desire to make my position clear. As a representative of a large number of primary producers who are vitally concerned in the Government's gether with the honourable members for Wakefield and Angas, joined a number of grape-growers from South Australia on a deputation to the Prime Minister to discuss this matter. There is no doubt that they are very much concerned over the proposed action of the Government. The right honourable the Prime Minister and the Minister in charge of the bill have emphasized, over and over again, that the Government has the interests of the grapegrowers at heart, but the Minister has suggested that, in advancing reasons why the bounty should not be reduced, the wine-makers were attempting to mislead me and other honourable members. He endeavoured to persuade the committee that in spite of all that had been said by the wine-makers, and by certain honourable members in their comstituencies, it was possible, owing largely to changed circumstances in Great Britain, for the industry to carry on under the reduced bounty. In effect, the Minister's statement was calculated to make one believe that the wine-makers were endeavoring to "" put one over"" honourable members. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) that when we were considering legislation for a bounty on wine for export a blunder was made in not granting assistance to the dried fruit-growers, concurrently with the growers of doradillo grapes. Why should a bounty be given to growers of doradillo grapes and denied to producers of dried fruits ? The point has not been sufficiently stressed that the producer of doradillo grapes, and of dried fruits is not infrequently one and the same person. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) has submitted an amendment to clause 3. Evidently he fears that without the provision which he seeks to include in the bill, there will be a tendency to increase the acreage devoted to the growth of doradillo grapes. I should like to point out that the increase in production of wine has been due, not to increased acreage, but to the fact that a large quantity of grapes previously absorbed by the dried-fruits industry has been diverted into the wine-making industry. We had an unfortunate experience",47,Sgivgs

It appears that under this bill the wine-makers' measure will be ful l and running over, but, unfortunately, the growers will get only that which runs over, which may be nothing. I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr the Leader of the Opposition and other Foster) concerning the unwisdom of introducing the bill at this juncture. The time is most inopportune. The Government, if it had intended to reduce the bounty, should have taken action much earlier, instead of waiting until the middle of the season when the grapes were being picked. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Cook) appeared to balance on the tight rope very well indeed. seemed to be torn with conflicting emotions.

The clause touches a very important issue. The problem of markets is really the problem of the cost of production. vitally the future of settlers in the Murray valley and the huge works undertaken by the Government to ensure the success of settlers engaged in the fruit-growing industry. The Minister suggested that the deputation of fruit growers which waited upon him in Melbourne last September had asked that the export bounty should be sufficient to bring the price received for all dried fruits for export up to the level of Australian prices. position. What they asked for was a bounty sufficient to return to the grower his cost of production. It is significant that all those engaged in the industrythe Australian Dried Fruits Association, the wine-makers, the doradillo growers, and the Returned Soldiers' League are unanimous in urging upon the Government that the passage of this bil will create a very serious position. If , as the result of this reduction in the bounty, wine-makers refuse to buy grapes in the usual quantities, and at a payable price, the effect will be that a very large proportion of the grapes now used in wine-making will revert to the dried-fruits industry. This is a point which I wish to impress strongly upon the Government. The problems of .the industry will not be solved by this reduction; but other problems will be created. I was glad to hear honourable members on both sides of the chamber support an export bounty on dried fruits. Whether the growers are producing doradillo grapes or any other drying varieties of fruit, if they are engaged in an industry that depends upon an export trade, they are compelled under the present economic system' to compete in the markets of the world, and at the same time submit to Australian He costs of production. They have to pay Australian rates of wages, buy Australian implements at high prices, pay high railway freights and water rates, and purchase dear clothing. Sooner or later it will be necessary to face The honourable member has the unanswerable fact that no industry The honourable memthat depends upon export can carry on extraordinary that, while we are spending millions of pounds on water conservation along the Murray Valley, reduced production is being simultaneously preached. This bill affects But, unless we have a reduction in production costs, we must have either bounties upon exports in the case of all primary industries, or reduced production. These are ugly alternatives; but we cannot escape from the fact that all our primary export industries must choose one of the three. Whatever may be the outcome, it seems to me that the wine-makers, by threats of refusing to buy the grapes if the Government's intention is carried out, are That is not the creating a serious position, and I am glad that the Minister recognizes it. The Minister has stated that he will see that the interests of the grape-growers are safeguarded, and I appreciate the manner in which he has committed the Government in that respect.

It is extraordinary that while the Development and Migration Commission has recommended that no further planting of fruits of drying varieties be made up for consideration later. the two industries are so inter-related that they should not be discussed separately. This Parliament is going ahead with the development of the Murray Valley, and spending millions in water conservation; but the Government has said, "" No further production of wine grapes.*' Concurrently, the Development ancl Migration Commission has recommended that there be no further planting of fruits for drying purposes. situation when a. young country like Australia, with all its potentialities for development, should adopt as a slogan, "" No further production."" Personally, I see no help for it. The people of Australia and this Parliament must realize that the primary producers engaged in export industries cannot longer continue to meet the high costs of production and compete in the world's marketwithout assistance of some description. The growers of doradillo grapes and denied to down under the strain, and they have heen followed by the dried fruits and dairying industries.

The Government accepts the amendment moved by the honourable member for Henty, and I am prepared to vote for it. nificant in that it is a gesture of no increased production. If there are to he no further bounties, then I am in favour of the curtailment of production in the vine-growing and every other primary industry. congratulate the Minister for Markets on his great development since he took charge of his department. The argument that he used in regard to the protection accorded to colonial wine reminded me of the debates on the earlier tariffs, on binders werp equal to only 4d. or 6d. per acre. It shows how far Ministers will go in adducing arguments to show that anything they propose is right. the tariff. referring to the fine protection afforded to the growers in Australia. The prices insisted on by the Ministry for the purchase of grapes will only mean so much extra cost to the consumer. If the cost of wine production is increased, thereby increasing the price to the consumer, it necessarily follows that less will be sold. The committee is discussing the subject of a bounty on the export of wine; but we refuse to allow a single bottle of wine to be sold in Canberra.

The fact that an increase in the position of Australian producers more favorable has'.very little to do with.fhe question. One phase of this matter whicli appeals io me, and which should flso appeal to the Government, is the necessity to' do' everything possible' to relieve producers generally, but, particularly those the Government has encouraged to, engage ih production in the great'Murray Valley. I strongly supported the expenditure, of large sums of money to develop irrigation areas on the Murray River, in Wine casks made in the belief that hundreds of thousands of persons would be satisfactorily settled on the land. We now find, however, that vignerons. fruit-growers and others,'are experiencing such depression. that: legislation has to be introduced 'to 1 assist them.'"" Every effort should""-be' made by the, Government to carefully examine the whole, position in order, to. see where-its policy is at fault, and how those who have taken up land.in certainareas can prosper without the assistance spend Â£200,000 out of the of bounties.

Will the honourable member address himself to the -new clause? has now .determined what shall be the export bounty payable on wine, and this clause relates to the bounty to be paid on wine produced and shipped by a certain date. I believe that I am in order in dealing with that. If this clause is carried, Parliament will have agreed with the principle that a bounty of Only Is. per gallon shall be payable in the future. The Prime Minister, 'when he visited the wine districts in the .company of myself and the:honourable member for Wimmera( Mr We will buy,just the grapes that we reStewart""), announced that the-bounty .was to be -for the benefit of the growers, .and not of the wine-makers.

The Government-fixed the price of grapes, and these grapes 'were bought prior to the Bounty Reduetion Bill being brought before the House The contract for their purchase was-entered into in good faith between the growers and' the wine-makers, on the assumptiqn. that the Government was going'to fix the-price as mentioned in the'contract, and on the understanding that'the bounty of Is. 9d. a gallon would be paid for'three.years. It has been said 'that the Government is justified in reducing *the bounty, because of some remarks made during the debate on a previous bill by the late-Minister for Customs. I do not see how that couldjustify such action . A litigant in a court of law 1 1 would hav.e little chance of winning his case-'if he based it, not upon the language of the statute, but on some -remark orpromise made by a Minister when the proposed law was> under consideration by Parliament. Imagine such a claim being put' up in respect of a tenancy case.' If that principle were admitted it would be: necessary for the courtto study all the copies' of Hansard for both Houses 'of Parliament which -touched upon the particular law under consideration before-a verdict could be given. Yet. ! that is-the .principle which the Government-is asking the-gfowdrs to accept.'It maintains that, because of some remark made by the'late Minister-when-the act was under consideration in Parliament-, it is relieved of the obligation to -carry : outits contract. . It is' an' entirely new principle,and one which, I am prepared to say, has neverpreviously been put forward. Recently in South Australia a very similarcase was before the people. . . j . . . . , In'the South Australian Parliament ah act was passed providing for-the impost tion of rates on hospitals,' and it--was generallysupposed at the time 'that -it would'-apply only""-to, country districts, thoughno -such' proviso was inserted' in the act. During thecourse of the debate i , in the upper House, an-undertaking'was bill that the rate-would-not-apply to the city of Adelaide. Recently the'present Government, searching around for revenue, decided to rate the city hospitals and this aroused a protest. -The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Mann).H-Will the honourable member state what his remarks have to do with this particular clause? ' '' justify my. request'for a 'postponement. In the Adelaide case the objection to the imposition' of the rates was of noavail, because the Attorney-General said that the Government should'not recognize any assurance given even by the Minister in charge of the bill; it had-to go by what was in the act. I -am. asking for &postponement of this provision, because the wine-makers and growers never anticipated' anythingof this kind' heing done. They relied on the act passed-last year being given effect to by the Government for the full term laid down. They did not anticipate that, within six months, a bill would be introduced radically altering the whole position. Had they antici! pated any such thing I do not think'that the grapes would have been bought at the price paid for them.",53,Pairs

As the 192S grapes had necessarily, been bought before this Bounty Bill was brought down, and prices fixed, the only fair and honest thing to do is to honour the contract as far, as the 1928 vintage is concerned. The. Government proposes, in a half-hearted fashion, to make an exemption in favour of a portion of the i'927 vintage,' but I maintain, that such exemption should apply to the whole of'the '1927 and 1928 vintages. This would hav.e the effect of ensuring larger exports of wine from Australia, which 'would, in turn, make room for the 1928 vintage. _ ; . order in reference. to your ruling on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mi'. .Foster).. This bill' is an amendment to the 19'27 act, which' provides for the payment of a bounty for a period of three years'. .That act arose ' out of a' message from the Governor General, and Parliament,, on the receipt qf that message, decided that for three years a bounty of ,1s.' 9d. should he paid. I contend that, by moving to insert the words "" twenty-nine,"" we are not proposing'tq place any new charge on the people of Australia. .The'act already provides ' for such a charge. The Government has now brought, down a measure for curtailing from 1930 to ""1928 the period during which'that charge'shall be made.

I move' , That the Temporary Chairman's ruling be I was not in order in moving' my amenddissented from. At the outset I believed that the honourable : member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) was not within his rights, but upon further consideration I found that there was another aspect to the matter. The Parliament, in pursuance of a message from the Governor General,' some time ago agreed, to a certain expenditure over a defined period. The present proposal of the Government is, in effect, that a less expenditure than that for which provision"" was then ma'de'shall be incurred Surely it is within the province of this Parliament to either reduce or increase the period during which the expenditure shall take place, so long as'the appropriation recommended by the Governor General is not exceeded? I hold that the honourable member for Wakefield was acting quite within his rights when he moved that the words "" twenty-eight"" be struck out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the . words "" twenty-nine."" As he was not encroaching upon the prerogative of the Governor General, his amendment was quite in order. The iTEMPdRARY CHAIRMAN. I remind the honourable member that Standing Order 228 provides,If any objection is taken, to a ruling or decision of the Chairman of Committees, such objection shall be stated at once, in writing, and may forthwith be decided'by the committee.

I then -promised that I would .make a short statement at a later stage. I do not .think that it is. necessary .for me to traverse the history of this .matter. In June of last year the French-Government suggested to the Government of the United States of America' that a treaty should be entered into between the two Powers which would have two fundamental principles^(1) That the two countries should condemn recourse to war and renounce .it as an instrument of their national policy towards each other;' and (2) that all disputes between the two countries, of whatever origin, should be settled -by pacific means.

(2>) The parties agree that the settlement of all disputes of whatsoever nature or origin arising among them shall never be sought except by pacific means. The whole of these details have been, forwarded to the Commonwealth Government, and at the end of last week we expressed to the British Government pur entire sympathy with the proposal and our cordial endorsement of the principles which underlie it: We also expressed the Hope that it will materialize, and that all recourse to war will be banished from the law of nations', France, Germany, and Great Britain have all indicated their adherence to the principle. There are certain questions still to be dealt with, such as the position of a nationwhen it is the subject of attackand its right, to self defence, together with obligationswhich nations may already have entered into, such as those under, the Locarno-treaties and the Covenant, of the League of Nations. It is to be hoped that there will be a satisfactory removal of any difficulty which may exist, and I think that there is every prospect of concrete results arising from these proposals for a treaty for the outlawry of war. I repeat, that the Commonwealth Government has expressed its entire sympathy with the principles, and its desire to be associated with any treaty of such a character should it be entered into. surer) [10.25] I wish to make a personal' explanation regarding the vote which took' place on clause 3 of the Wine ExportBounty Bill a few minutes ago. I have a standing pair with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and neither I nor the Government Whips were aware that the Deputy Leader was not in his place when the division bells rang. I understand, however, that the Whips have arranged a pair for the Deputy Leader of the-Â©pposition ih respect of the division. L desire to draw the Prime Minister's attention to the action of the Federal The Capital Commissioners in respect of the supply of electricity for heating purposes to the hotels and hostelsof Canberra. Last week when the thermometer was almost below zero the power was, without warning, cut off, and, as a result, the residents suffered great inconvenience. I am bringing this matter before the House, not because of any personal, interest, but because I feel that those who reside at the hotels should receive everyconsideration. To popularize the Capital City we must pay every consideration to those who are resident here, otherwise, the city will not progress as it should., I do not wish to criticize the commissioners, because there may have been, some reason for discontinuing the supply [of power. I understand that at one hotel a reverend gentleman was studying when the power supply of his radiator was suddenly cut off. He asked the reason, and when informed that power had been discontinued by the instruction of the Commis-sion, he said that he had received nq notice. He was thereupon informed that the notice had been posted in the building. As he insisted on his room being heated, he was told that ho would have to pay 10s. a week as a flat rate, because no meters wore attached to the-rooms. This gentleman' was prepared to pay that -amount, but, at the time, power was refused on the ground that other residents might make use of it. Many of the residents at the hotels are school-' teachers and public servants whose salaries, after paying for board and providing for other . necessaries of life, are not sufficient to enable them to pay 10s. a week for the use of radiators in their rooms. In justice, power for heating purposes, should be supplied to them. It is ridiculous to charge a flat rate of 10s. a week for power. has nothing to do with this matter, because in the Newcastle district power",56,Heating Of Hotels And Hostels At Canerha Cutting Off Of Power
