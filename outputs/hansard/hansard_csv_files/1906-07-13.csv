Mr .Kelly","In view, of the fact that the Government itself asked the advice of the Imperial Defence Committee on the question of Australian defences-(1 ) Will the Government inform the House as soon as a decision is come to if it is its intention not to follow the advice it has itself sought on the larger questions involved? (2) If the Government decides not to follow the Imperial Defence Committee's .advice, will the Government put the House in possession of the Imperial Defence Committee's arguments on the question as well as that of its local advisers? few weeks addressed the Home authorities by despatch with regard to the very inconvenient and uncertain practice at present obtaining of marking "" confidential"" certain communications passing between them and ourselves. The principle followed is not at all clear, though we have been at some pains to try to discover it. The request preferred was for a complete scheme of Australian defence, which must necessarily be discussed by Parliament. When Ministers have had an opportunity to read the document, and it has been considered by the Minister of Defence and his advisers, I propose to inquire whether it is inadvisable to make public any part of it. From a cursory inspection, I think that there are few, if any, passages which should not be published. If our views differ in any respect from the advice given by the high authority, whose opinion we have asked, it is only fair that we should give the reasons for the' difference. We are not compelled to accept that advice, but we are bound to give our grounds for not following it. Honourable members will agree that the fullestinformation should be put before Parliament, so long as we do not touch on points which may indicate weakness in our chain of defence, or possibilities which it is not advisable to suggest. The whole matter should, and must, be laid before Parliament if it is to be effectively dealt with. CITY TELEGRAPH OFFICES. Postmaster-General, upon notice1.

Then his re:ommendation, along with the other recommendations and information indicated by the clause, would be sent on to the Justice, who would again consider what would be a fair selling price for the goods proposed to be protected, or introduced into the country under special restrictions. Justice would determine that the goods against the importation of which' a protest had been lodged should be excluded from the local market altogether, or should be introduced only under the specified conditions, and what should be the maximum price at which, such goods might be sold if their importation were permitted. I wish to make it clear that I do not desire to establish a definite price. and object of my amendment is simply to fix a maximum, ancl below that anything can be done in the way of competition.

' prohibition ! supporting this amendment because of the other' provisions of the B ill . Considering the spirit of the measure, and dealing with it in its entirety, I say that it is absolutely necessary to have some guarantee that the Bil l shall be what, on the face of it, it purports to be, but what it is not at the present time, a measure to safeguard the interests of the workers and consumers, and not merely those of the manufacturers. A provision such as that contained in the amendment, would no doubt tend to bring about some spirit of fairness on the part of manufacturers. They would not appeal as readily to the provisions of the measure when they -found that a share of the profit they would otherwise make must go to the consumers of the articles they manufacture. ""Under the circumstances, I hesitation in supporting the amendment. I can quote excellent precedents for it . One is an English Act of 1368; and', in this connection, I foreshadowed my present intention by giving notice of an amendment. This English Act provided that the Justice -should, on the motion of any person, assess the prices at which articles must be -sold, so that the manufacturer should have ""reasonable gains and no more."" It is the Tatter part of that provision that I quote liteTally, as it provides for fair prices. By that English Act, however, a manufacturer was liable to a penalty if he did not observe the prices fixed; and here, it will be observed, there is an omission in the clause under -consideration. The English Act provided that any manufacturer who refused to accept the prices assessed should be liable to a penalty of £ TOO for each offence; and a similar provision in the Bill would put an end to much sham patriotism. When manufacturers found that the profits were not likelv to go into their own pockets, but to go into the pockets of the workmen, their anxiety for Parliament to meddle would sensiblv diminish; and it would be desirable to bring an end to the log-rolling in which some of the manufacturers endeavour to indulge I regard an amendment of this character as vitally necessary. Another precedent is afforded in an English Act of 1532, whereby the mayors of 'boroughs and the rulers of counties and shires were called upon to assess the prices at which meat and other victuals should be sold. In the following that the graziers, breeders, and drovers would not sell the cattle at such prices as enabled the retailers to get "" reasonable gains, and no more."" English Act of about the same period relating to the sale of herrings? herrings was passed in the fifteenth century, and dealt with forestalling. When the butchers complained of the action of the graziers, breeders, and drovers, an Act was passed in 1538 providing that any breeder, grazier, or drover who refused to sell stock at reasonable prices should appear before the Justices, and that the latter should thereupon appoint "" in d if ferent men ""-that is disinterested' mento assess the prices.

The Minister in charge of the B ill ought to make further provision to meet the case of manufacturers who choose to work only half time, or take any other action of the sort. Legislation of this class ought to be carried right through to its logical conclusions. If the premises are such as to lead to absurd conclusions, the fault is not ours, but is that of those who assert the premises. This Bill is said to be in the interests cf the workers, and amendments to that end ought to be accepted.

67,Mr Henrywillis (Robertson),"destroy trade. The Bill is complete in its effort to interfere with trade; but what wouid a Justice .know of general commerce to enable him to determine the price of goods ? unfair competition ? all. A Justice knows nothing about commercial affairs. This duty should be intrusted to an expert commercial man, or to a board of experts permanently appointed, and removed from political influence. able member like to be tried by a jury of experts ? sooner be tried by an expert than by an ignorant person. The proposal to determine the price of goods is absolutely absurd. Under the Bill the goods would be impounded. The use of the word "" probably "" would really be an inducement to incompetent persons to operate, because they would say, "" The goods will then be set free, and we can determine the price, possibly with the assistance of the Comptroller-General of Customs."" Comptroller-General to act. already authorized by the Bill to act. With a majority at their backs, the Government can do what they like. But I shall be no party to a proposal to interfere with trade in such a way as is indicated in the amendment. It is not an improvement upon the proposals of the Government, because it would offer an inducement to the deciding authorities to act. They would say, "" The hardship will be minimized if we determine the price""a thing which they would be absolutely unfit to do. Admitting that a man may be most competent as a Justice of the High Court, he may still be quite incompetent to fill a position in which amendment, as a principle generally, still, he would have to deal with trade. And a man who is experienced in only one line of trade would not be competent to d scharge the duty. It could only be properly performed by one who had a general knowledge of trade and commerce, 3. very wide experience, and very long standing in more than one country. I can not possibly support the amendment. expert evidence, and have access to the books of all those concerned. that the honourable member pointed out an instance in which it might work. It is admitted to be practicable as regards certain classes of machinery, where the selling price in the country of production, and the selling price in the importing country are known. But when we come to think of the million and one manufactures the prices of which might have to be determined iby the Justice or the Comptroller-General, we must see that the proposal is impracticable. not agree altogether with the opinions expressed by the honourable member 'for Robertson in regard to the amendment. It seems to me that if it is fair to legislate for the purpose of protecting the profits of the local manufacturers by limiting competition-and I disagree with the contention that it is-the n it is equally right, by similar legislation, to seek to limit the power of a local manufacturer to raise the price of his goods to the public. The purpose of the amendment is to prevent the local manufacturer, when once he has secured a monopoly, .from unduly raising the prices beyond what the Court-which , I suppose, will be the deciding body-ma y deem to be fair and reasonable. I quite agree with the honourable member for New England and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, that all legislation of this character is mischievous and dangerous. Buti f we are to have such legislation, let us see that we protect everybody all round. If the manufacturer is to be protected, the wage-earner should also be protected. We must see that he shall get his "" cut"" out of the benefits oif the monopoly, and also that the public, who, after all, are the principal persons to be considered, shall not be made to pay unduly through the nose for the benefits which have been conferred upon the manufacturers. Although' I do not believe in the principle of the as it is operating all through the Bill for the purpose of protecting other sections of ; the community, it is about time that the interests of the public were considered. It is, I admit, a late hour at which to consider them, but the amendment certainly makes an effort to recognise that there is a public to be considered, and to have its pocket protected against undue onslaughts by local monopolists. For that reason. I (feel inclined to support the amendment.

Not only should we amend the clause in the direction suggested by the Attorney-General, so as to confine its operation to sub-clause 2-whic h is a considerable limitation-bu t even with that amendment the clause should not stand in the Bill.

149,Amendment (By Sir William Lyne) Pro,"move That the amendment be amended by the insertion, after the word "" Minister,"" of the following words :"" who shall"" (a) lay the determination before both Houses of the Parliament within seven days after its receipt, if the Parliament is then sitting, or, tions, bub this B ill as dealing with extrai f the Parliament is not then sitting, within seven days of the next meeting of the Parliament; and "" (i) cause to be submitted to both Houses of the Parliament a resolution approving of the determination. "" If the resolution is passed by both „ Houses of the Parliament, the Governor General may, under the powers of the Customs Act 1901, prohibit the importation of the imported goods, either absolutely or under such conditions and restrictions as he deems just, and in that case the provisions of that Act shall applv to goods so prohibited."" Sitting suspended from 1 to 2 p.m. ment are, I think, sufficiently clear to honourable members, without calling for much explanation on my part. The sub-clause, as it stands, readsThe Justice shall forward his to the Minister, who shall, &c. SinceI gave notice of my intention to move this amendment, there has been a very important alteration made, and that is the substitution of a Justice of the High Court for the Board. But I still believe that the object and purpose of the measure would have been much more effectively and fairly secured if the course I am now suggesting had been adopted, even without the intervention of the Justice. As soon as the receipt of the certificate of the Comptroller-General had been acknowledged' by .the Minister it should have placed an obligation upon the latter to at once consult Parliament if sitting. if it be not sitting, I venture to suggest that the procedure proposed under a Justice will occupy a considerable time. No inspector can be at the beck and call of the Comptroller-General or Minister; he mav be in another part of the Commonwealth ; and consequently there may be a long interval before a decision can be obtained. (Kooyong) [12.59] I I hold that a similar objection will apply to the employment of a Justice. I do not think that there should be any opposition offered to the amendment on that ground. I would remind the Minister that the Bill is intended to deal with extraordinary conditions. The Attorney General has stated that he regards the Tariff as dealing with ordinary importaordinary importations. I may be told that the Minister would always be responsible to Parliament, and that it would always be open to it to dissent from his action. But that argument, I submit, does not properly apply here, inasmuch as there may reasonably be a diversity of opinion on a subject of this magnitude. I earnestly hope that this fair and just proposal may receive serious consideration from the Minister. He perhaps still adheres to his view that, after representations have been made and justified before a Justice of the High Court, importations which may be of great magnitude may be justly prohibited, and that there is no justification for the position I have taken up. But I earnestly submit that there is a' serious responsibility placed upon the Minister as to the manner The objects of the amendin which the Bill shall be applied, and that anv suggestion is worthy of consideration. I understand that a distinct promise has been given by the Opposition to push the B ill through its Committee stage today. Therefore, I do not propose to deal determination exhaustively with the subject-matter of the amendment, or to show to what extent restraint of trade may be involved. It is a tremendous power which is being given to the Minister. I think that even with the reference to the Justice, it will be found to be rather complicated and expensive machinery; and to entail enormous hardship upon certain importers. I submit°that inasmuch as the Ministry has substantially affirmed that the object of the Bill is to deal with extraordinary conditions, we are justified in asking that Parliament should be afforded an opportunity of considering extraordinary determinations of t h e . M i nister. Every item of the Tariff had to be But approved by both Houses, and surely when drastic action is taken by the Minister in regard to certain imports his determination ought to be subject to review by the same tribunal. I sincerelv believe that if the amendment is adopted, it is likely to improve the condition of things. It is not submitted out of anv feeling of hostility to the principle underlying the measure. If",27,Pairs
150,Mr Knox,,28,Pairs
151,Mr Knox,"the Bill is seriously applied, even with the numerous alterations which have been made, and the concessions which have been secured, I fear that serious consequences may result. Parliament is the expression of the will of the people, and it should, I think, be called in as arbitrator in a matter of this importance. [2.9] I rise to support the amendment, which I hope will be agreed to. It has a great deal more importance than appears on the surface. For the first time in the history of a British Parliament, there is a deliberate proposal: to put the power of prohibiting trade outside Parliament. I see nothing inconsistent with the machinery providing for full and fair inquiry by a Justice with all the powers of a Court, thus guaranteeing a disinterested, impartial, and thorough sifting of all the facts concerning allegations of dumping. That will be an advantage, I have no doubt, because when we receive such evidence from the Justice, it will be practically the last word as to the substantiality of the facts alleged or otherwise. Therefore, I think that instead of leaving the matter for the final determination of a Justice, we ought to reserve to ourselves the right to determine whether goods shall be prohibited from entering the Commonwealth even though they may be subject to the Tariff impositions which Parliament has already provided for. We have established trading, relations with other parts of the British Empire, and with the rest of the world, meeting differences in skill, advancement, numbers, or efficiency between our workmen and their competitors by the imposition of duties,. But it is now proposed to hand over to the Minister the rigjit to arbitrarily prohibit importation, without-the necessity of consulting Parliament in the matter. This is the first time that the giving of such power to the Minister has been suggested. Parliament should not let this power leave its hands. If it does, it fritters away the sovereign control with which it is invested. I hope that the honourable member for Kooyong will press his amendment to a division.

I believe that the employment of labour-saving appliances would probably solve the problem which is to-day presented by our Northern Teritory tov enabling us to successfully cultivate tropical products. Agricultural machinery is at present in a state of evolution. The machine which was perfect last year may next year be out of date. In the United States and Canada especially, the enormous fortunes acquired by great implement makers are being utilized for the one purpose of steadily improving their machinery. So far as many of our primary producers are concerned, Ave must recollect that they have to face the markets of the world with their surplus products. Our wheat, butter, and fruit have to compete with countries which employ the most up-to-date machinery. No Tariff can possibly assist them. If our farmers are to increase their export trade, it can only be by the use of the best labour-saving appliances obtainable. I am aware that a clause has already been inserted in the measure which, to some extent, protects the manufacturer. Buti f we pass the Bill in its present form, it will be within the power of those who are engaged in the manufacture of out-of-date machinery to hold up the importation of the most modern labour-saving appliances, and thus to place our agriculturalists under an enormous disadvantage. ister of Trade and Customs) [2.39] I certainly cannot accept the amendment of the honourable member in its present form, but if he is prepared to agree to its modification by the insertion after the word "" producers,"" of the words "" without unfairlv iniuring any other section of the community,"" I will agree to it. the effect of the clause.

An amendment moved by the honourable gentleman is under discussion, and he cannot more to amend an amendment of that amendment until it has been dealt with. quite in order in moving the amendment of the amendment. when the deputy leader of the Opposition rose to a point of order, that the attitude of the Ministry would be more honest if they simply negatived the amendment of the amendment, instead of proposing the addition of other words. If that course were adopted, we should have a fair straight-out vote on the honourable member for Franklin's proposal. Let us consider for a moment what would be the effect of passing the amendment of the amendment in the form now proposed by the Minister. Experiments with a view to the improvement of agricultural machinery are being made month after month and year after year. It is only a little while since complaint was made to the Minister that so-called foreigners were conducting a. trial of disc ploughs with the object of discovering the improvements necessary to secure a machine best suited to the various soils of the country. If an improved plough on this pattern were sought to be introduced, the Minister, under his further amendment of the amendment, would be able to prevent its importation. We should desire to give free play to the improved machinery which comes here from other countries, instead of seeking to prevent its importation because our own manufacturers do not keep pace with modern development. The amendment of the amendment refers to stripper-harvesters. There can be no doubt that great improvements will be made in those machines as the result of experiments being made by agricultural experts. But what would I be the position if an improved stripper-harvester were sought to be introduced?

If they are accepted, ing this action in the interests of the manufacturers alone, but I trust that they realize the true position. Had the Government agreed to the amendment enabling the Justice to fix prices, we might have allowed the present proposa.1 to pass; but they seem to be endeavouring to do all they can to help the manufacturers, who comprise the smallest section of the community. That is the one object of the B ill . I shall vote by the importation of the articles specified, for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin. The proposal submitted by the Minister is absurd. If the Government are opposed to the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin, the Ministry should negative it in a straight out, honest way, and not seek to defeat it by a side wind. No doubt the Minister of Trade and 'Customs will boast to his constituents that he has assisted the farmer by reducing the price of stripper-harvesters; but he knows that his one object has been to enable local manufacturers of those machines to obtain a higher price for them. If he speaks the truth he will admit that his object is to prevent the competition which keeps down prices. If he were honestly pursuing the object that 'he claims to have before him, he would simply McKay when he was in a combine to keep up prices against the farmers. They certainly deserve no consideration. If I were satisfied that the business of Mr that Ministers, who should consult the McKay was being ruined by importations of harvesting machinery, I should not be prepared to give him any assistance, because he was in combination with others to keep up the price of agricultural machinery against the farmer. Throughout the consideration of this Bill Ministers apparently have assumed that there is only one class in the community in whose interests legislation should be passed. Amendments in the direction of helping other classes have come only from the Opposition, who have endeavoured to secure that some protection shall be afforded under this measure to the worker and to the consumer. amendment. need hardly say that I strongly support the amendment proposed by the honourable I member for Franklin. The Minister of Trade and Customs proposes to add to it the words "" without unfairly injuring any The Committee other section of the community."" It appears to me that those words would cover and one or two persons claim to be unfairly injured, they will prevent the primary producer from being considered. It is almost universally accepted that in all cases the majority should rule. That is the principle followed in this House, and I think it should be applied in this case. If it is shown that only a very limited number of persons are likely to be injured and that their importation will benefit the great majority of the primary producers, it is the majority who should be considered. I am aware that the Minister has a majority of supporters behind him, but I still ask the honourable gentleman to so alter the amendment which he has proposed as to enable the interests of the majority of the persons concerned to be considered. Knowing how fond the honourable gentleman is of fair play, and that he is a strong believer in majority rule, I ask him not to impose conditions which may have disastrous effects upon the primary producers as a whole, and merely for the benefit of a few small men engaged in a particular trade. does not call McKay a small man ? whether he is a 'small or a big man, but I consider that he is a most unfair man. I am sorry to see interests of the people as a whole, are prepared to consider the interests of individuals as against those of the great majority. We know that the interests of the towns are freouently diametrically opposed to those of the country, but if the country suffers the towns must feel the effect. In all the circumstances, it appears to me that the Minister should take a broad minded view of this matter. As the honourable ggntleman is strong, he should be merciful. As this is about the last occasion in connection with this Bill on which members of the OpI shall support the position can appeal to honourable members opposite to dojustice to the primary producers, T hope they will respond unanimously to the appeal, and will accept the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin.",31,Pairs

Without intending to be offensive, I think that the Minister may be congratulated upon the slimness of his amendment. has outslimmed honourable members opposite. ment is a very slim one, but I do not think it will go down with the people when they understand it properly. Under the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin, the Justice, in certain cases, would be required to take into consideration the question whether goods being imported will benefit the primary producer. If the Justice takes that into consideration, ipso facto he must also take into consideration the question whether their importation will not benefit every industry in Australia. Every industry we have, and every phase of trade in the Commonwealth, depends to some extent on the success of the primary industries. If , through lack of the proper implements and tools of trade, the primary industries languish, every industry in the Commonwealth must suffer. What is asked by the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin is, not that the primary producers should be given some unfair advantage, but merely that they shall be enabled without interference to continue their avocations, which are of so much benefit to the whole Commonwealth. referring to the Minister's amendment. amendment is quite different. It is very specious, but it will not stand investigation. provide that the Justice shall inquire The Minister's proposed addition of the words "" without unfairly injuring any other section of the community,"" would enable any manufacturer to hold up the whole of the primary producing industries of the Commonwealth. One manufacturer has only to prove that "" unfair competition."" not in the usual acceptation of the term, but according to this Bill-and unfair competition according to this Bill is successful competition-is talcing place, and if it is shown that goods are being imported successfully against the local manufacturer, the whole of the producing industries of I hope the appeal Australia may be held up. We have had enough of these catch cries. The Minister will deeply regret it if he insists on the insertion of the word because the farmers t of his own electorate will see the hollowness of the proposal, which is drafted to hoodwink them. The farmers of the Hume are quite as intelligent as the farmers in other parts of the Commonwealth, although they have in the past returned the Minister of Trade and Customs as their representative. Sir WILLIAM LYNE And they always will return me. the Hume will not rStain their confidence in the Ministeri f he insists on these provisions.

There must be a division on this question, in order to test the sincerity of Ministers, -and of a section of the Committee, in their statement that nothing in the measure is likelv to injure the primary producers. The description of the implements given in the clause is taken from the New Zealand Act, the only addition being "" stripper harvesters and any other implement usually used in agriculture."" On the second reading we discussed the New Zealand Act, and it was pointed out by the honourable member for Echuca, and others, that Mr Seddon provided that, if the manufacturers of such implements were suffering from unfair competition, they should receive a bonus. The honourable member for Franklin desires to whether the goods used by farmers, or likelv to be used by them, are imported with the effect of benefiting the primary producers. The effect of the amendment proposed by the Minister is that any manufacturer who produces obsolete implements which are superseded by an imported article, would be able to block the importation on the ground that it injured himself and those whom he employed.

The question before us is whether the primary producers are to have their interests considered in these determinations. No doubt their interests ought to be considered; 'but, in contrast to the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin, the amendment of the Ministry seeks to put those interests in a secondary place. I am very glad to say that a large portion of the manufacturing classes have protested against the B ill , but, when dealing I thought the honourable with legislation of the kind, .we ought to pay some consideration to those who provide the means whereby the interest on our public debt is paid, and the country enabled to carry on business from day to day. The question is whether the primary producers are to be considered, or whether their interests are to be scattered to the winds. I hope honourable members will accept the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin, because, if they do not, they will act to the detriment of the interests of the primary producers. clause under discussion is substantially taken from the New Zealand Act. Out of £120,000,000 worth of products of Australia, excluding New Zealand, A class. £90.000,000 worth is the result of the work of the primary producers, and over 650,000 persons are engaged in these great primary industries. If we take as an example New South Wales before any duties were imposed, we find that out of £30,000,000 worth of secondary products, £28,000.000 worth were created without the aid of anv Tariff. Thus, in the priI f the honourable mary industries £90.000,000 worth, of produce, and in the -secondary industries £28,000,000 have been created without any artificial aid. A t the present time we are paying £10,000,000 in order to get less than £2.000.000 worth of manufactures in another direction; in other words, we are paying £ 5 for every pound we get back, apart from the extra value ' people have to pay in the retail trade.

Government ihas already opposed an amendment which provided that fair and reasonable wages should be paid, and that fair prices should be fixed at which the articles affected should be sold; showing that they intend to make' this Bill, far as possible, operate in favour of one or two individuals. The amendment upon the amendment would prevent the primary producers from getting the benefit of any improvements in machinery which might be introduced.

I am prepared to test the honesty of the honourable member who made that interjection by moving an amendment which will exempt the miner. member for Coolgardie said that the amendment is for the benefit of one special class. The Bill throughout is intended to benefit the smallest class in the community. who made that remark does not dare to raise his voice against it. He sits calmly behind the Ministry voting for class legislation of the worse description. amendment widens the scope of the Bill. I am prepared to widen it as much as possible. I do not come here to vote for legislation in the interests of two or three manufacturers. I am prepared to place the miners on the same footing as that upon which this amendment seeks to place the agriculturists. I like men to be consistent, and when some honourable members condemn class legislation and at the same time sit behind a Ministry which is guilty of the grossest legislation of that description, and never open their mouths in protest against it, I stigmatise their interjections as simply hypocritical. wish to give another reason why the amendment should be adopted. When the Tariff was being dealt with, the manufacturers obtained large exemptions for their tools of trade. We are simply asking that the primary producers should be treated in the same manner. I am prepared also to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie, and to exempt the miners. I should be only too happy to support an amendment in that direction.

Of his own motion, the Justice can state a case for the opinion of the Full Court on a question of law, and I desire to give either party the right to obtain, by request, such an appeal. I understand from the Attorney-General that it will have to be inserted after sub-clause 2. I should like to know if he agrees to the right of appeal being granted.

It is not right that the goods should be forfeited. There might be no objection to the goods themselves. In the cases in which the powers of forfeiture are exercised under the Customs Act, the goods are supposed to be deleterious or harmful. The articles with which we are now proposing to deal might ibe perfectly sound and desirable, and there would be np reason to object, 'to their introduction under certain conditions, which the Judge could make as drastic as he pleased. [3.41] I should like to know if the Attorney-General thinks that under the clause as it stands a prohibition applying to the goods introduced by one importer would extend to all similar goods of the same be forfeited manufacturer, irrespective of the conditions under which they were imported and sold. It seems to me that under paragraph a the determination of the Justice would have the effect of a proclamation under the Customs Act 1901, and would apply to all goods of a certain class. I find, on looking at the interpretation clause, that imported goods include all goods of certain classes, or all parts or ingredients thereof.

Although an offence may be committed by only one importer of .a certain class of goods, all similar articles will be placed under a ban. The power to remove the ban is given, not to Parliament, or to the Justice, but to the Executive only. Six months after a proclamation had been made it might be found that the -circumstances ofi the trade had undergone a complete change, and yet the prohibition wouldl continue in force. of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne indicate clearly the harsh character of the provisions of the measure, and I am sorry that he did not at an earlier stage grant us his assistance in toning down their effect. I am glad that he has suggested that the Judge should have power to limit the prohibition to the gcods introduced by the offending importer. Under the Bill, as it stands, if one importer of machines, such as harvesters, were competing unfairly, twenty other importers of similar goods operating under perfectly fair conditions, might be prevented from continuing to carry on their business. [3.48] I understand that the Attorney General will consent to an amendment ir. the direction I have indicated, and I therefore move That the amendment be amended by the insertion after the word "" restrictions,"" line 8; of the words "" or limitations of any kind whatsoever."" not think that the amendment would go -quite far enough. In paragraph d, of subclause 2 of clause 14, it is provided that competition shall be deemed unfairI f the imported goods have been purchased abroad, by or for the importer from the manufacturer or some person acting for or in combination with him or accounting to him, at prices greatly below their ordinary cost of , production where produced or market price where purchased. It is clear that that might happen in only I one or two isolated cases. A man might import certain goods, and a Justice of the H i gh Court might make an order which would affect the whole of that class of goods. In other words, because one man chose to act unfairly by importing certain commodities, a prohibition might be imposed upon the whole of that particular class of goods. Surely that cannot be the intention of Ministers. operative clause, and no harm can be done if we define unfair competition. I hold that it is not sufficient. Eveni f the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne be right, I still say that it should not be within the power of any single Justice to make an order from which there can be no appeal whatever. Perhaps the Attorney-General will now see The remarks the force of allowing an appeal from the decision of a Justice upon a matter of fact, as well as upon a question of law. If such extraordinary powers are to be vested in a single Justice, it is highly desirable that we should permit of an appeal being made to the F u l l Court. Upon .questions of law there can be an, appeal in any case. Act an appeal is allowed upon questions of law. Having regard to the decision of the Privy Council the other day, in the case of an appeal from the High Court, I say that we cannot prohibit appeals upon points of law under certain circumstances. "" Clearly, we ought to vest in the High Court the power to decide whether or not one of its Justices has acted properly. I do not think that the addition of the words "" all limitations of any kind whatsoever "" is sufficient, and the Attorney-General ought to recognise that. It would be very much better to make an alteration in the direction I have suggested.

Edward S (Oxley) [4.39],"Ido so; and in furtherance of my desire to have Brisbane placed upon the same footing as Melbourne and Sydney, I wish to ask the Prime Ministeri f my information is not correct? to ask the Prime Minister whether the Cabinet has yet arrived at a decision with respect to putting the suggestion to the electors at the next general election for an amendment of the Constitution providing that in future the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be held some months later than the usual time ?

It is not for me to dictate the order of business to the Government, but we all'have a responsibility to our constituents and to the country in that regard. I , for one, consider that the revision of the Tariff is the most pressing matter before the Parliament. I think that it is infinitely more pressing than the measure with which we have been dealing. I understand that on a previous occasion it was intir mated, in reply to some questions, that the Government intended to proceed with it when they had got further reports. To me that appears to be a waste of time. If it is intended to proceed with the matter at all during the.present session, surelv the sooner we begin to do so the better! By the time we shall have finished with the three reports that are before us, probably others will be to hand. The Attorney General will, I am sure, support my request. He will remember how he devoted his time, in season and out of season, more especially out of season, in abusing the late Government for not proceeding with an immediate revision of the Tariff-eve n before they had any information that would enable them to do so satisfactorily. Surely he will see the necessity of not losing any time in dealing with the matter, now that we have reports of the Tariff Commission to guide us, and enable us to do the work satisfactorily. every election, nine-tenths of the candidates and, I believe, nine-tenths of tbe members returned have been distinctly pledged to the .establishment of a scheme of old-age pensions. I desire to ask whether the Governject, and if so, whether it is proposed at an early date to introduce a. measure of reform about which this Parliament is practically unanimous? ter) [4.45] The honourable member for Coolgardie is correctly informed that the I would remind the honourable delay in tbe consideration of the proposition as to Sir William McGregor has been due be made between the Colonial Office and himself before he can consent to become a candidate for the post. The House They has already been informed, in reply to the honourable member for Moreton, it will have the opportunity of discussing the matter recognise that before any appointment is made. The consideration of a vote for the purpose of wireless telegraphy will come before the Cabinet during the next few weeks, in connection with the preparation of the Estimates. The Premier of Queensland is in possession of a copy of the letter which was received by the Government with reference to Brisbane, and also Melbourne and Sydney, as ports of call in connection with the oversea mail service. Any statement made by that honourable' gentleman is therefore certain to be correct, because he has the tenderer's letter in his hand. The-question of altering the date for holding future elections for the Senate to March or April has not been decided by the Cabinet, but is, I am in a position to say, favorablv regarded by it. No time will be lost in dealing with the Tariff. It is recognised that when the proposals are submitted it will be desirable to deal with them in a group, and, of course, to dispose of them as rapidly as possible. In the meantime, we have to provide another place with sufficient work to keep it continuously occupied for the period which we shall need for dealing with the Tariff.
