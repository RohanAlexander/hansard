Censure of Whitlam Government House)I wish to inform the House that I accept the notice of motion given on 18 July by the Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony) as a censure motion for the purposes of standing order 110. I take it, Mr Speaker, that the notice of motion will now be called on. Motion of Censure Australian Country Party) (2.16)I move: That the Government be censured: (1) for its failure to observe proper parliamentary as to the future. When we hear reports of procedures which would require the honouractions and counter-actions being taken by able member for Eden-Monaro to substantiate countries overseas, what we need is strong supserious allegations he has made inside and port for the Corporation and confidence that outside the Parliament reflecting on the integrity of the members and staff of the Austhe actions it is taking are right and proper. tralian Wool Corporation and the Leader But what is the level of intent of the honourand Deputy Leader of the Australian Country able member? What is this sinister plot that Party, (2) for its tacit support of the allegations made credit the Corporation in order to have it by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro reconstructed or is he endeavouring to have of a conspiracy between the Leader and Deputy Leader of th Australian Country Party and certain members of the Corporation dismissed three unnamed members of the Australian Wool and replaced with boobs who will be nothing e Corporation and involving senior staff of the more than lackeys for the present GovernCorporation to support the price of wool at ment? What is the idea? The members of excessively high levels in order to embarrass the Government, (3) for its refusal to support proposals intended t.i with a great reputation and of enormous require the honourable member for Edenexperience. Of all the organisations in AusMonaro to produce the written evidence he tralia none has a prouder record in the short claims to possess in relation to his charge, and period it has been in operation than the (4) for prejudicing the future marketing of the Australian Wool Corporation which has done Australian wool clip through permitting uncera mammoth job through a most difficult tainty to exist as to the integrity of the Australian Wool Corporation thereby creating doubt period of time in trying to stabilise and to as to its future commercial operations. This is indeed a serious charge to level against country. Its whole record is one to be comthe Government. It is not a censure motion mendeda very laudable one indeed. that is taken lightly. The allegations and accusations that have been made are indeed serious. They involve 2 senior members of this stantiate his evidence by presenting it to this House. They involve the members of the House, then he must stand discredited in the Board of the Australian Wool Corporation eyes of this Parliament and he must stand and the senior staff of that Corporation and, discredited as a disgrace to the Australian of course, these charges have very serious wool industry, as a man who has been long implications as to the operations of that body involved with the industry and as a man who in trying to realise the best possible price for has contributed to it. I give him due regard. 11284/74-^R -[16 ] the Australian wool industry and in the best interests of the nation. One might have thought that the acts of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Whan) were unwise, silly comments made on the spur of the moment, but they appear now to be part of a campaign-almos t a plot-to try to discredit the Corporation in its operations and in its capacity to be able to make commercial judgments on what price ought to be paid for Australian wool. If this is an operation to try to discredit my Deputy, the honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) and myself, it has rudely backfired. All it has done has been to throw tremendous doubt on the Australian Wool Corporation and the whole Australian wool industry. Such allegations and inferences could not have come at a worse time industry at the moment is under very great pressure of declining prices and uncertainty he is trying to play with? Is he trying to disthe Corporation are men of great standing, bring about orderly marketing of wool in this If the honourable member does not sub-",7,Setup

3,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Leader of the for the Australian wool industry. The woolDuring his period in the Bureau of Agricultural Economics he earned a reputation for some of his activities concerning the objective measurement of wool. So the statements that have been made were not made by a man who knows nothing about the industry or the seriousness of the situation in which it . is placed. He is a very senior member of the Government. He is a senior member of the Government's rural committee. He is a member who has professional training in this area and I know that he understands just what this is doing. So unless the evidence is presented to this Parliament all we can say is that he is acting with evil intent to try to discredit members of Parliament and members of the Corporation. His statements, of course, run in conflict with the attitude of the Government. The honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) has stated that the Government will support the Corporation in its commercial judgment for the rest of the wool selling season. We applauded that. We thought that was a sensible statement to make at a time when people were getting very nervous about the action of the Government in backing up the Corporation. But last week we saw a series of statements, emanating from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, which have thrown utter confusion into the standing and the reputation of the Corporation. The honourable member has made the very serious allegation that there is collusion-indeed , a conspiracy-to try to manipulate the market. These things cannot be taken lightly. These statements would have been cabled to countries all over the world which are interested in buying Australian wool. I have had experience in negotiating with other countries and in the course of those negotiations and discussions they have brought forward series of quotes of statements by prominent Australians and members of Parliament which might have supported those countries in their particular line of argument. So it is without doubt that all the statements that have been made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the general controversy that has built up around this question in the last few days would be cabled overseas. The point now has arrived where I think it is so serious that the Government should make a statement alleviating the fears, suspicions and the concern of these foreign countries which are so interested in buying Australian wool. What must they think of the accusation that there is a conspiracy to build up a false price in the market? The record of events during last week shows a deliberate program by the honourable member to try to discredit the Corporation, and, of course, my deputy and me. This has gone on unabated and without any genuine apology for what he has been doing or saying. In this House last Tuesday, 16 July, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro alleged that there was a conspiracy between the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Country Party to support the price of wool at excessively high levels so as to embarrass the Government. In a speech during the debate on the Address-in-Reply the honourable member said, and this was his first comment: It is no secret that there have been discussions between the Wool Corporation and the leaders of the Country Party to devise this mehod of embarrassing the Government. That could have passed as nothing more than political jargon in the course of a debate in this House and one would have let it go by. But the next night, last Wednesday, on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program 'Country Hour', the. honourable member for Eden-Monaro made the following statement in relation to the activities of the Australian Wool Corporation in the week's sales: We've got written comments that the members of the Wool Corporation have identified themselves with the Country Parly and, not only that, but they have colluded wih the Country Party to establish an embarrassing position for the Government Then at 7 o'clock that night in the ABC news bulletin the honourable member for Eden Monaro said: In this last week I've received another account of conversations by 3 members of the Wool Corporation in which they said that they had discussions with the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Country Party along the lines that they would support the market at an excessively high level in order to embarrass thc present Government. Honourable members will recall that in the House last Wednesday night both the Deputy Leader of the Country Party and I made personal explanations to point out that what the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had said was completely false and that we had had no association with the Corporation and its members in any way relating to thc price fixing of the market. In fact, I have not had any association for a considerable period of time with any of those members. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro replied that he accepted our statements but he continued to claim that he had evidence to support his allegations. It did not matter that we disavowed his claims. He went on rampantly making the allegations without presenting the evidence. In the House last Thursday morning the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory, representing well above commercial limits and thereby embarrassthe Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt), ing the Government. said that he was quite sure that anything said by the honourable member for Eden Monaro would be backed by facts. There is a senior member of the Government saying: 'Right. He can make those statements because he knows they will be backed by facts'. We want to see those facts and we believe that the Government has a responsibility to produce them for the whole nation to see because the matter needs to be examined closely. To give the honourable member for Eden-Monaro an opportunity to produce the evidence I have spoken of, I moved after question time last Thursday for the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the honourable member from substantiating his allegations with the evidence that he claims to have in his possession. The Leader of the House( Mr Daly) replied in his usual manner, but I think this time he disgraced even many of his colleagues sitting behind him. They know that the honourable member for Eden Monaro has caused great damage to the Australian Wool Corporation and to the wool industry as a whole-damag e that cannot be measured but which is unquestionably very serious. Unfortunately no honourable members opposite had the courage to support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders so that this matter could be cleared up and I woulcl think that today they will use their numbers again to try to win this motion, as they undoubtedly will. But unless this matter is resolved a very serious cloud will remain over the whole of the operations of the Corporation and the industry. Members of the Government Party knew that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had lost his political pants last week; so when we moved for the suspension of Standing Orders they crowded around to protect him and to save him from having to back up the charges which he made.| No doubt they will try to do the same thing today. One would have thought that last week's episode would end the whole affair. But in the Australian Broadcasting Commission program 'Country Hour' last Friday the honourable member repeated his allegations and again claimed that he had evidence to support them. He said: Members of the Corporation claimed that they have spoken to the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Country Party in order to organise a reserve price 1 would certainly like to know who are these members of the Corporation who are supposed to have spoken to me and to my deputy because, as we have said, we have had no such discussions with any members of the Corporation. This allegation is nothing more than a furphy for some political motive which we have not been able to understand, except that we know the consequences of what is happening. On this program the honourable member said that he accepted the statements made by my deputy and me and said that he apologised for any embarrassment that he had caused us. But he went on to say: But the fact remains that we do have evidence that 3 members of the Wool Corporation made this claim. Asked to name the 3 members, the honourable member said: I would not like to name them. How weak can one get? There are 9 members of the Corporation under suspicion; three of them are being accused. To which three of that nine is the honourable member referring? This is what we would like to know. He said that he had a verbatim account of conversation in which 3 Corporation members made the claim, reinforced by other evidence. I take this to mean that the honourable member has a verbatim transcript from a recording or from shorthand notes taken at the time. Asked whether he was prepared to produce the evidence, the honourable member said on this program: No, I am not, because I have given the . . . He hesitated at that point, ancl then went on to say: I know that the evidence that is available is in the hands of the people who can make the appropriate decisions. Asked whether he hacl handed the evidence to the Minister for Agriculture the honourable member said: The Minister has access to exactly the same material. Today the honourable member is reported in the Melbourne 'Sun-News-PictoriaF as pressing for a judicial inquiry into the activities of the Australian Wool Corporation. So you will see, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member's allegations still hang over the heads of the members of the Corporation. It is no use calling for an examination of the activities of the Corporation unless one has some bona fide evidence to verify these very serious charges which the honourable member has made. In the same ABC program last Friday, the to hear the substantiation by the honourChairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, able member for Eden-Monaro in this Mr Maiden, was asked about the honourable House today?

The wool industry cannot remain under this cloud of suspicion. The honourable member's allegations, as far as I am concerned and as far as the Deputy Leader of my Party is concerned, are completely false. They have been denied. They have been denied by both of us. They have been denied by the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation. It is time that the honourable member's claims were exposed and it is time that this Government, or members of the Government who make these wild, extravagant charges, were pulled into line. The Government, in the form of the Leader of the House, has acted shamefully in this matter. The Leader of the House last week prevented the matter from being discussed and cleared up. As a result, the only course of action we had to take was to level a censure motion against the Government, and I hope that the Government will see the seriousness of what has happened. The wool industry people all around the When I answered questions hy the Country world are entitled to think that claims made by Party members early last week as to the a Government member with special interest in Government's attitude to the Australian Wool the wool industry do carry some weight.

But as I believed the Wool Corporation to be completely above board in its deliberations and that it had operated within the guidelines of Government policy and in the best interests ot"" the wool industry and the nation, 1 had no alternative but to give the Labor Party for the State seat of Burrinthe Government's support to the Corporation, and this I did. Subsequently I listened to the exposure by the honourable member for Eden Monaro of the evidence which he has received. The more one delves into this sordid business the more highly suspicious become the circumstances and the motives of last week's wool sales conducted by the Wool Corporation. 1 regret also to say that the more highly suspicious become the activities and motives of some members of the Australian Wool Corporation who are in a position to influence and even to determine the policies and decisions of the Wool Corporation. There is a very bad smell developing around the activities of the Corporation. I nm afraid this smell is going to get worse. Let me refresh honourab'e members' minds with the history of the appointment of members of the Australian Wool Corporation. Just prior to the 1972 federal elections, when it became obvious that the Liberal-Country Party coalition woulcl fall, the Deputy Leader of the Country Party, the honourable member for New England, in his capacity as Minister for Primary Industry, performed an act which was completely inexcusable. It. was politically dishonest. Just prior lo this vital election, which saw the annihilation of the Liberal-Country Party Government, this Minister appointed thc members of thc Wool Corporation, which is the most powerful industry executive in Australia, be it primary or secondary industry. It was a shocking act of political dishonesty. The appointment as Chairman of the Corporation of Mr A. C. B. Maiden was not unexpected. As far as I know, he has been a public servant without any political bias whatsoever. I have, known him for 25 years and 1 respect him. But he is the Chairman only. The appointment by the then Deputy Leader of the Country Parly of Mr S. S. Nevile as Deputy Chairman was also made just prior to the federal election. Mr Nevile is known to be anti the Aust ral inn Labor Party. He is, of course, entitled to his views. He has opposed for years the technical marketing innovations and reforms frequently put forward by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. Just prior to that, federal election, Mr D. J. Asimus was appointed by the Deputy Leader of the Country Party. He was and probably still is a member of the Country Party. I am informed that he stood for the Country Party against juck and he carried out a most vicious campaign. Mr NixonI take a point of order. The Minister is defaming people by making political allegations. The fact is that Mr Asimus was a grower nominee. He was nominated by a growers' organisation.

They must cease and if they do not I will take action again. members opposite did not hear me, Mr ter Northern Development are most offensive Speaker, I repent that Mr Renshaw was a member of the aristocratic Australian Club, known throughout Australia as the Country Party Cluba place notoriously known, where plots against the Australian Labor Party are continuously hatched and implemented. Mr Renshaw, as a member of the Australian Wool Corporation, actively supported the Wool Corporation's decision to go ahead with last week's sales. Yet if the newspaper reports are true, last week he in fact double-crossed the Wool Corporation. In a public journal and in inverted commas he was reported as stating: 'If I had my way, I would cancel all sales and find some way around the situation until 20 August'. In fact, he had fully supported the decision of the Australian Wool Corporation to go ahead with last week's sales but, in the middle of the week-if this report is true-h e doublecrossed the Wool Corporation and said that he would have cancelled the sales. In absolute fairness to the Chairman, Mr A. C. B. Maiden, political dishonesty of the Country Party in appointing him to the position of Chairman on the eve of the fateful federal election of December 1972-fatefu l for the Liberal-Country Party GovernmentI should say that Mr Maiden offered his resignation to the Government prior to taking up his appointture. It is highly significant, as I am informed, that not one of the other political appointees who so openly opposed the policies of the Australian Labor Party offered his resignation, as he should have done in a situation which reeked of political dishonesty. It is against this background that we witnessed last week's events-the infamous meeting of 3 members of the Australian Wool Corporation at the Australian Club, the Country Party Club.

57,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honourableattempts to undermine this Government. The3 members of the Corporation dined together with one recognised leader of primary industry. As their meeting progressed their aims and objectives were discussed with others. apparent objectives of these Wool Corporation members were to do exactly as happened last week-to put a price peg into the market which was absurdly high in view of the recognised opposition by wool buyers to sales in July. They obviously knew full well that the Australian Wool Corporation would have to buy huge quantities of wool and they would have to pay huge amounts of money-SI6 m of taxpayers' money, an action which would, of course, seriously .embarrass the Australian Government. I am informed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that this plan was confirmed with the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Country Party, on the advice given to him by people who took part and who, of course, were aware of these discussions at the Australian Club. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, acting in good faith, has not divulged publicly the names of the 3 members of the Corporation who were present at the Australian Club-the members who made allegations against this Government, the members who hatched this scheme to embarrass this Government and which involved the Australian Government in public moneys amounting to $16m. But last week the honourable member for Eden-Monaro gave to the Deputy Leader of the Country Party the names of the 3 members of the Corporation. Mr Lionel Bowen-Ah! Mr SinclairI do not divulge confidences. Dr PATTERSONI now ask the Deputy Leader of the Country Party: Has he contacted these 3 members of the Wool Corporation since the honourable member for Eden-Monaro gave him their names, or was he already aware of the full content of their discussions and their objectives, or has he received a denial by each. the Country Party and the Deputy Leader of and every one of those 3 members of the discussions last week to undermine the Australian Government? I have already recounted the inexcusable impropriety of the leaders of the Country Party in appointing to the AWC certain members who were known to oppose openly the Australian Labor Party and its members and who were known to be members of the Country Party. These men were appointed just prior to the federal electionan action of gross deceit and an action of contempt of this Parliament. The Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Country Party have denied any association with or knowledge of this meeting at the Australian Club. But can anyone trust the Leaders of the Country Party? At the last election they were the authors of the dirtiest and rottenest untruths with which I have ever been associated in any political campaign. challenged me to substantiate it and this 1 will do with respect to you. the worse exhibition of gutter politics and character assassination at its worse, not caring if their statements and accusations were completely and utterly untrue-al l this designed to confuse and to generate hate against the Labor Party. But now let me give example to illustrate the credibility of the Leaders of the Country Party, and as you have asked for it I will refer to you specifically. campaign a bitter campaign of hate was waged against the Labor Government, particularly against myself in the electorate of Dawson. The Deputy Leader of the Country Party came to Mackay, my home town, the centre of thc richest sugar growing electorate in Australia and the biggest user of nitrogenous fertilisers of any area in Australia. He came at a time when the election air was emotionally charged with the superphosphate issue. But the nitrogenous fertiliser question was not an issue. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and I , on behalf of the Government, announced in this Parliament in the presence of the Leader of the Country Party that the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy would be continued and legislation would be enacted to extend the Act. However, the Deputy Leader of the Country Party, in full knowledge of the facts, issued a written Press statement in Mackay which was a diabolical untruth. What is worse, he issued this written statement, in the full knowledge that its contents were",24,Patterson Thi S Person Was Ment In July 1973 It Was An Honourable Ges

67,Dr Patterson,"During the last electionuntrue, under the heading 'Sinclair warns Labor will take away nitrogenous fertiliser bounty if re-elected'. Later he said: 'It is a wonder they didn't'. That was a deliberate untruth. He stated then in writing: The deputy leader of the Australian National Party other words, he holds himself up in this Parsaid in Mackay this morning that the Labor Government if re-elected would immediately cancel the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty. That statement by the Deputy Leader of the Country Party was a deliberate untruth. (Extension of time granted) This statement by the Deputy Leader of the Country Party was maliciously untrue. I replied immediately in writing through a Press statement. Mr SinclairI didn't receive it. Mr SinclairI didn't receive it. a position to know what letters or communications took place. wants me to table the Press statement. I will. Country Part is competent to answer any questions when he speaks. the Country Party said that he did not receive my Press statement, but the next day he issued a Press statement commenting on mine. I then went on to say, in writing, that Mr Sinclair had abused every rule and ethic of Parliament and should be made to face the consequences. I was not one grain of truth in Mr Sinclair's statement, which he had plucked from the air in a despicable and desperate tactic to try to win votes in the sugar growing areas of Queensland. The facts are that on 7 April last Federal Cabinet made an unqualified decision to continue the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy, which is of vital importance to the Queensland sugar industry and which was due to expire on 31 December this year. Mr GortonI rise to order. Can we debate the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy at some other time and get back to the wool industry? Dr PATTERSONI am simply referring to the credibility of the Deputy Leader of the Country Party. I reveal this utter hypocrisy because he has challenged me to do so. Last Wednesday night, 17 July, when speaking against the honourable member for Eden Monaro he said, in answer to an interjection from the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), that if there were any truth whatsoever in the allegations made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro he would resign. In liament as a person who is prepared to resign if he tells a lie. YetI have completely and utterly exposed, in writing, what he said about the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty as a deliberate and utter untruth. I have given the House the facts concerning that fertiliser bounty. They are in writing and cannot be denied. The Government completely rejects the grandstanding of the leaders of the Country Party in proposing this censure motion. It has the utmost confidence in and respect fo; the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. He has exposed to this House the motives of certain members of the Australian Wool Corporation who are bitterly opposed to this Government and who will leave no stone unturned to undermine this Government. I hope that the Government will carry out a full investigation of the activities of the Australian Wool Corporation. In the meantime, the particular members of the Australian Wool Corporation, whose names have been given to the Deputy Leader of the Country Party, should resign from the Australian Wool Corporation immediately. Further, if the leaders of the Country Party have been involved in any way in this plot they should resign from this Parliament. On behalf of the Government I utterly reject this said, again in writing that there motion. make a personal explanation as one who has spoken to one of the members of the Australian Wool Corporation who have been named, Mr Claude Renshawthe call.

Let me repeat: Neither my Leader nor I have in any way been associated with these men in the way that the honourable member suggests. I believe there is absolutely no truth that the members of the Australian Wool Corin the allegations. Shame on a government to suggest that the normal processes of law in Australia should be reversed, because that, Mr the charge laid upon them. But that the GovSpeaker, is the ultimate conclusion of the charge made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the Minister for Northern Development. Let me underline the way in which this would happen. In Australia there is a presumption of innocence-bu t not for the Labor Party, not for the Labor Government. There is no presumption of innocence. There is a presumption of guilt. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has stated: T, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, have made a charge. Therefore you have to answer it.' This is the way in which the law might be operated in banana republics and dictatorships around the world, and in some of those Communist countries for which members on the other side seem to have a marked affection. McCarthy? honourable member for Casey referred to that gentleman. The Minister for Northern Development will henceforth be condemned. By the manner in which he has made specific charges, which are unsubstantiated, against individuals he has followed a procedure and a practice which have been universally condemned and he has claimed that there is a basis on which the charges should be made. The whole of the basis by which an innocent man is presumed to be innocent has been sought to be reversed by the charges made by the Minister for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. If there is any substance in those charges, the hcnourable member has responsibility to produce the evidence, to name the men concerned and to substantiate the charges made against them. To operate the law in any other way is completely contrary to the Australian Constitution and to the practice of the British common law which we have inherited. Shame on the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the Minister for the Northern Territory for speaking in that vein. To my mind, the charges made by those men go to the very fundamental basis on which we expect men outside the Parliament to exercise responsibility. I believe, and I had thought before that this was a bipartisan view, that responsible men in the community can be asked-indeed , called on-to act in the way poration have been acting in serving the industry and the country, in accordance with ernment today has denied and that the Government today has thrown into question. It has placed serious charges against a number of individuals but it has failed to substantiate them. There has been a continued repetition of charges. There has been an allegation about the possession of written evidence. The written evidence has not been produced. The Government stands condemned for the 4 reasons that are outlined in the motion now before the House; the Government stands condemned because it has failed to uphold the principles by which parliamentary democracy should work; and the Government stands condemned because henceforth any fall in the Australian wool market will be not the fault of the Australian Wool Corporation and not the fault of the market forces that previous spokesmen have tended to support but the fault of Labor machination in order to assert and abuse the power which, fortunately, will not be Labor's for long. gentleman's time has expired. Opposition is seeking to censure the Government for reflecting upon the integrity of the Australian Wool Corporation. In my view thc integrity of the Australian Wool Corporation was compromised by the previous Liberal Country Party Government. The events of last week are just an extension of the weaknesses inherent in the Wool Corporation. They had their foundations in the previous Australian Wool Board. In presenting the following evidence to the HouseI hope to establish a prima",28,Patterson Thi S Person Was Ment In July 1973 It Was An Honourable Ges

90,Mr Whan (Eden,"Monaro) (3.37)-Th efacie case for an independent investigation of the structure and activities of the Wool Corporation and its predecessor, the Australian Wool Board. My evidence is drawn from a long professional association with the wool industry. The results of my own research into wool marketing have been published in over 60 articles and papers. A general summary of those results and those of other research workers in the field is available in the report of bucket me and the Australian Government. the Wool Board's Objective Measurement Committee and in a paper entitled 'Wool Marketing', which I published in a journal entitled 'Wool Technology' in December 1973. In that paper and also as a member of the Crawford Committee which suggested the establishment of the Wool Commission, as well as prior to that time, I advocated a price insurance mechanism that contained both a flexible reserve price and a floor price. It was the previous Government, under an Australian Country Party Minister for Primary Industry, that prepared the present Act, which only makes allowance for a flexible reserve price. That should be remembered in the light of a Press statement yesterday by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) in which he castigated the Government for not instructing the Corporation to establish a fixed reserve price. In essence, the reforms outlined in recent wool marketing research could save wool growers over SlOOm a year. The major barrier to the introduction of such innovations lies in the attitudes and affiliations of the present members of the Wool Corporation. Nobody on the Corporation has a wool technology background and is equipped to grasp the implications of the new developments. An examination of the qualifications of the present membership has been given to this House already by the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson). It is instructive to draw the attention of honourable members, as he has done, to the fact that in this House-the House of Representatives-n o one can hold an office of profit under the Crown. The situation is clearly different in the New South Wales Upper House. Two other members of the Corporation have been directly responsible for the long succession of wool marketing failures perpetuated by the Wool Board and the Wool Commission. I have already set out a detailed criticism of these events in a booklet entitled 'Proposals for Wool Marketing in Australia' published in 1969. None of the charges made in that booklet has ever been answered even though they involve members of the Country Party, 2 members of the Corporation and a senior staff member. Perhaps this booklet would be of some assistance to Sir Harry Budd, the editor of the Country Party newspaper 'The Land' who, I understand, has been instructed to Most of the failures in wool marketing were due to the fact that the members of the Wool Board tended to protect the narrow interests of the groups which put them on to the Board rather than the interests of wool growers as a whole. Mr SinclairI take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is the honourable member entitled in this place to malign a member of another Parliament?

In one case, at page 1354 of Hansard of 11 April 1973, I discussed the circumstances that led to the creation of the Yennora wool selling complex in Sydney. In another case at page 654 of Hansard of 20 March 1974, I set out the details of the failure of the Wool Corporation to publish the results of an experiment which set out to demonstrate factors in favour of a traditional position in the processing and handling of",30,Patterson Thi S Person Was Ment In July 1973 It Was An Honourable Ges

The experiment was commissioned to be carried out in the Port Phillip Mills, of which Mr Nevile is the managing director. The sum of $16,432 was paid to Port Phillip Mills to conduct the experiment. The results were never published because they did not confirm the original expectations of Mr Nevile. I have here the account sales and I shall table the document. It demonstrates clearly what I have said. It is addressed to the Australian Wool Board, AOMP Group, 578 Bourke Street, Melbourne. It shows: To costs of Experiment' and itemises those costs. It shows: 'Estimated result: Costs as above $24,150. Estimated value of yarn $22,929'. This evidence demonstrates quite clearly that $16,432 was paid to Port Phillip Mills Pty Ltd or its associates to conduct the experiment. That experiment has never been documented. I raised this matter, as shown in Hansard, on 20 March 1974. None of the statements I made in those 2 expositions has ever been challenged by the people concerned. A further example of the tendency to protect the narrow interest groups of the industiy is found in the justification provided for the price averaging scheme. This scheme was prepared to save money for selling brokers at the expense of wool growers. If brokers had not been protected they would have lost business to private buyers. Selected tables were quoted from my own work to arrive at the conclusion that a price discount occurred for all smali lots of wool sold in the market. The very research papers from which those tables were selected demonstrated that the discount operated for wool grown in some regions and not in others. One group of wool growers who lost money because of the intellectually dishonest approach adopted by the Wool Commission at the time were those in the New England area. At that time the honclair) was the Minister for Primary Industry, and he did nothing. The authors of the price averaging plan are respectively a member of the current Wool Corporation and a senior member of the staff. If the private enterprise person well known to me and whose integrity companies which they serve so well had made a similar series of miscalculations those companies would have been bankrupt long ago. I now turn to the extraordinary events which led to the reappointment of the present members of the Wool Corporation. Unlike the impeccable behaviour of the present Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) in the 1974 election and against all the conventions and decencies of politics, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party who, I repeat, was then the Minister for Primary Industry, renominated the members of the Corporation 8 days before election day in 1972. At the time there were complaints from members of the Australian Wool Industry Conference that they had not been consulted and those complaints were aired quite vocally at that stage. The circumstances surrounding these reappointments certainly are worthy of investigation. As we have heard, subsequently the Chairman, Mr Maiden, who was more sensitive to the impropriety to the appointments, offered to resign. The only member of the present Corporation who has a clear mandate of support from the present Government is Mrs Hilda Rolfe, our own choice. In regard to this selection, it should be observed that the following resolution was passed by the annual conference of the New South Wales Graziers' Association this year: That the Association object to the manner which a member of the Australian Wool Corporation was appointed; that in any future appointments to the AWC, the Minister adequately consult the AWIC. In fact, the Minister did discuss the appointment with the AWIC and could not accept its nominee because that man had told many people that he could not work with the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, Mr Maiden. I have had reports that a member of the Wool Corporation is promoting the view that objective measurement and sale by description can apply only to a narrow range of wool types. These developments form the basis of the SlOOrn savings I have already mentioned. In the light of the evidence presented to the Objective Measurement Committee this claim cannot be supported. If as I suspect this represents the view of the entire Wool Corporation, either it does not have a grasp of this subject or it is again speaking for the vested interests of those who for their own profit are opposed to progress. Two weeks ago I received a letter from a I respect. The letter contained statements attributed to 2 senior staff members of the Corporation. The first statement was: The Corporation was working in such a way as to insulate it from any possible interference by the ALP Government. The board of the Corporation was sufficiently powerful to resist any Labor pressure.",31,Patterson Thi S Person Was Ment In July 1973 It Was An Honourable Ges

It was his baseless, mischievous comments which whipped In thc present case we see a repeat of the by the honourable member for Gwydir on the men in the House.

I have already indicated the substance of the detailed cost of such an experiment. The Chairman and Managing Director is Mr S. S. Nevile. In concluding this speech today 1 point out 10 the House that we see in the Country Party's action a deliberate campaign to put the Government in a position where it has no option hut to support the wool market at a level selected by the Country Party. T remind the House that on 15 November 1970 the then Minister for Primary Industry who was then the present Leader of the Country Party said: The reserve price mechanism is not designed lo force prices up but to moderate or level out the instability of auction prices. Also: 1 repeat what I have said. The scheme is not intended to force or defy the wool market hut io test 11 and to get thc best and most realistic price the market can pay. Those are virtually the same guidelines as arc laid down today by the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt). The Leader of the Country Party went on to say: T am afraid those growers who believe wool users can bc forced-in this day of ready availahilily of cheaper though perhaps inferior textile substitutes -l o pay a certain price for wool arc not facing up to Anlhony, J.

Second Reading (4.25)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to establish a statutory authority to administer Australian Government assistance to the arts. The authority will be known as the Australia Council. I regard this Bill as an historic development in 61 the promotion of the arts in Australia. It fulfils -. . . 55 a long-standing commitment to the arts which I proclaimed in the Australian Labor Party's policy speech in 1972 and which the Government has pursued since coming to office. I Jenkins, H . A. believe that the formation of an independent Johnson, Les Australia Council will inaugurate a new era of vitality and progress in the arts, that creative Keogh, L. J. artists of all kinds will enjoy a new measure Klugman, R. E. of security and status in the community and that the Australian people as a whole will McKenzie, D. C. have new and wider opportunities to particiMathews. C. R. T. pate in the arts and enjoy the emotional, spiritual and intellectual rewards which the Mulder, A . W. arts alone can provide. The creation of an Patterson, R. A. independent authority for the arts follows the approach adopted in other countries including Scholes, G. G. D. Britain, Canada, the United States of America Thorburn, R. W. and New Zealand. It takes into account the need for specialised skills and knowledge in Whan, R. B. the promotion of the arts. At the same time Young, M . J. it recognises that a measure of freedom is needed to optimise opportunities for artistic Nicholls, M . H . achievement. I believe our proposals strike a realistic balance between these 2 requirements. Katter, R. C. I can best describe the Government's broad Killen, D. J. objectives for the arts by outlining the policies that we intend the new council to follow. These Lucock, P. E. are defined and set out in the Bill. They are Lvnch, P. R. consistent with numerous statements on the Government's policy towards the arts which McMahon, W. I made last year. It will be the first task of Millar. P.

We want to promote a knowledge and appreciation of Australian arts in other countries. We want to promote incentives for, and recognition of, achievement in the arts. Finally, we want the new Council to encourage the support of the arts by the States, local governing bodies and other persons and organisations. The Government believes there has long been a need to restructure and improve government machinery for assistance to the arts if they are to keep pace with the needs and aspirations of a growing population and rising",38,Industrial Unrest
120,( Mr Speaker,Hon. J. F. Cope),39,Australia Council Bill 1974
121,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa,"Prime Minister)levels of education. Government support for the arts has developed fitfully over the years. The Commonwealth Literary Fund began providing pensions for writers in 1908, but no programs of assistance for practising writers were developed until the beginning of the Second World War. The Commonwealth Art Advisory Board existed from 1912 but there was little assistance for living Australian artists a view to developing proposals to put to the before the 1970s. It was not until 1967 that the needs of Australian composers were recognised by the Australian Government. All of these bodies were established by administrative decision, and in an ad hoc fashion. All were limited in the assistance they could provide, although the Commonwealth Literary Fund, for example, had developed a number of programs for the assistance of writers and writing, and the other bodies had begun to initiate or to develop new activities. It was only in 1968 that the Australian Council for the Arts was established to help, primarily, ballet drama and opera. The prime motivator in this development was Dr H. C. Coombs. Dr Coombs had been actively associated with the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust in the 1950s and was a man deeply committed to the encouragement of Australian cultural life and to the recognition of her cu!luial identity. He was thus very well fitted to undertake the chairmanship of the Council. Again in 1972 he advised my Governnient and took responsibility for setting up an extended, more rational and more democratic system for the funding and development of the arts than had ever been attempted previously. Australia is deeply indebted to him for his outstanding service. Among bankers Dr Coombs is the greatest promoter of the arts since the Medici. We are particularly fortunate that, at the time of Dr Coombs' retirement, Professor Peter Karmel was willing to assume the chairmanship of the Council. His wide experience as a distinguished economist and university and public administrator and his long association with programs and enquiries relating to government policy and expenditure will be most valuable in providing sound guidelines for government expenditure in the arts. Within weeks of the election of the Government I announced interim arrangements to replace the old ad hoc bodies so that support for the arts could be continued, commitments honoured, and the planning of new programs begun. Although there was some public comment about the speed with which these steps were taken, they were in fact dramatically effective. The past year was one of considerable achievement. Government assistance to the arts in 1973-74 was twice that of 1972-73. New and important initiatives were taken in almost all areas. A reconstituted Australian Council for The Arts consulted with arts bodies and individuals involved in the arts with Government for a structure better able to administer government support for the arts. As honourable members will recall, I kept the House informed of the measures being considered and the deliberations that were taking place. On 24 May 1973 I tabled the interim report of the Australian Council for The Arts on the proposed statutory authority, and on 8 November 1973 I tabled the Council's final report. The broad areas of the arts that the new Council will encompass are set out in the Bill. So too are the functions the Council will have to meet, the Government's objectives for the arts and the powers the Government believes are necessary to achieve those objectives. The Council will be a body corporate consisting of not fewer than 18 and not more than 24 members drawn from a broad range of artistic, community and related government interests. The Council will be responsible to the Minister and to the Parliament for the conduct of its affairs. In matters of staff and finance it will have the widest freedom of operation compatible with considerations of public accountability. It will engage its own staff and determine their terms and conditions subject to the approval of the Public Service Board. It will administer its own financial affairs and operate its own bank accounts subject to normal requirements of financial accountability and the presentation of reports to Parliament. The bulk of the day to day work, however, will be carried out by a number of specialised boards which will be responsible for decisions relating to expenditure within their own budgets and for developing professional services geared to their needs. Subject to the directions of the Minister, the Council will be required to delegate functions and powers to the boards, and each board will be responsible for developing policies in its own area of the arts. Membership of the boards will be broadly based. They will include a wide range of appropriate interests and a majority of artists or others closely involved in the arts. It is our intention that government support for the arts should not become the province of entrenched interests and that it should serve, in the widest possible way, the artistic needs and aspirations of the Australian community. Provision has been made, therefore, to rotate the membership of the Council and the boards. This procedure has already been followed with respect to the necessary appointments made to replace those members whose terms of appointment expired on 30 June 1974 . In response to public advertisement a great many names were put forward for consideration and from these a selection was made for appointment for terms of 1, 2 or 3 years. In making this selection particular weight was given to the object of encouraging community involvement in the arts, and the composition of the Council and boards now strongly reflects their role in this crucial process as well as in direct support for those practising the arts conhome the prospect of enriching their lives cerned. The terms of appointment of members of the Council-othe r than government members-and of the boards is not to exceed a total of 4 years of continuous service, and at least one year must elapse thereafter before a person is eligible for a further term of membership. Too often before 1973 the same people tendered advice over many years-sometime s for ten and even up to 20 years. Terms of appointment were indefinite or were renewed several times over. Whatever their qualities and without diminishing the valuable services they performed this circumstance seriously inhibited the infusion of new ideas and fresh stimulus. I emphasise that in all areas practitioners and others involved in the arts will make up a majority of those called on to decide and give effect to arts procedures. We hope also to sustain wide public interest and involvement in the work of the boards by periodically repeating the invitation to all who are interested to nominate persons who might be considered for appointment. It is proposed that lists of names of those nominated will be maintained at all times and the Minister will be required to consider them when considering new appointments. Artists have an essential role to play in society. No one can imagine a mature civilisation without their contribution. Australia has a rich and distinctive artistic tradition. We have produced many renowned and gifted artists-bot h creators and performers. The Government believes they should be able to work in their own country secure in the knowledge that the community and the Government place a high value on their contribution to our way of life. Unfortunately this has not always been possible. Too many of our finest talents have been lost to overseas. We want to ensure that our greatest artists remain in Australia and prosper in Australia, and that the whole Australian community is the richer for their presence. Already this is happening. A number of our internationally recognised artists and performers are returning to pursue their careers in Australia and others, who would once have gone overseas to find opportunities are now finding those opportunities here. I believe that, through the measures in this Bill, we will create greater artistic opportunities for all talented Australians. We shall be offering to all who by birth or choice have made this country their through participation in or appreciation of the arts. I commend the Bill to the House.

Before the debate is resumed on this BillI should like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Bill 1974 as they are related measures. Separate questions may, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate. to have a general debate covering both measures?

The Opposition's decision in the particular personal joys with the final proposals Senate last year to delete this mining code that we placed before the Australian public was based on the almost unlimited discretion was a proposal that a special section of the contained in this legislation. Senator Greencommission should be established to deal with wood last year spelled out our objections in small producers-the almost forgotten group some detail and I do not propose, to repeat of people who are involved.

They have never had anyone to whom gate in accordance with the instrument of delegation. they could put their case and they have been Obviously these are very wide powers perjust a forgotten group. Our coalition decided mitting the Minister to grant or refuse; to to create a special' tribunal or commission to impose conditions or cancel authorities, licences As one who has lived his lifetime in mining areas and in a mining environment I derived great joy from the fact that we were at long have pioneered the industry, who are perhaps have never been able to get their undertakings which these people could come for assistance. Special funds would have been provided for this. However, we will have to wait for another 2 years and 10 months to put that proposal into operation. I was talking about clause 22 which provides that the Minister may grant or refuse an exploration permit on similar bases to those provided in clause 13. BeforeI leave that point I think we should have a closer look at the Bill, particularly clause 13, and spell out just how far the Minister's authority extends in relation to these reconnaissance permits or authorities as they are called in the legislation. Clause 13 states: A person may make an application to the Minister for the grant of a reconnaissance authority in respect the ministerial approach? The clause continues: of a block or blocks. This means that there will be regimentation und a bureaucratic approach. I think that if the Government's approach were made sufficiently clear to the Australian people there would be comparatively few members of the Australian Labor Party in the Parliament. I get a little tired of the constant harping on socialism. I much prefer to look upon it as bureaucratic regimentation. Anyone associated with the horse racing game would know that this approach applies with the Totalisator Agency Board. I am not going to knock the totalisators. They serve a purpose in providing funds for the improvement of racing and so on. But they also bring with them a cold, soulless type of regimentation as is contained in this Bill applied to mining. At TAB agencies one goes along, has one's bet and does one's dough. One does not even have the opportunity of listening to a broadcast of the race. This is the type of bureaucratic control and regimentation that is provided in this Bill. If this message got through to the Australian people we would be swept back into office. It is aU right to talk about horse racing, but the matter is much more serious when it involves those whose hopes and aspirations are implemented in an industry of the mammoth proportions of the Australian mining industry. I turn back to clause 13 which further provides: An application under this section(a) shall be in accordance with an approved form; My God, there will be some forms to be filled in around this country(b) shall be made in an approved manner; (c) shall be accompanied by particularsof(i) the block or blocks in respect of which the application is made and the operations that the applicant proposes to carry on in that block or those blocks; I can just imagine some of the old gougers and small mining operators with whom I come in contact almost every day of my life in the Northern Territory and in my part of north-western Queensland, even being able to afford to provide this information! This sort of requirement immediately eliminates the little man. Clause 13 continues: (ii) the technical qualifications of the applicant and of his employees; That would produce some terribly interesting information. Would one have to be a geologist or geophysicist to come within the orbit of (iii) the technical advice available lo thc applicant; and (iv) lhe financial resources available to the applicant; Once again this would squeeze out the little bloke. This is required by the great so-called Labor Government. Thc clause continues: (d) shall bc accompanied by a fee of S100. The small miner might rake that up, I suppose. So much for clause 13. This Bill provides the power to take away all rights to continue with work regardless of previous expenditure or undertakings. This discretion, of course, again is left to the Minister and not to the Parliament. I imagine that in the course of time the voice of this Parliament -thi s fairly empty Parliament at the moment -wil l be stifled to such an extent that Australia will be controlled by a group of bureaucratic committees. I see this shift of power. It is not even subtle. Under the Coombs approach the people of Australia will not be represented in this chamber; the voice of their representatives will not be worth a tinker's damn. We will be controlled by bureaucrats and academics. Unless one has some sort of professional degree one will have little standing in this nation. That is the way the shift of power is going. So let us look at this provision. There is power to take away all rights to continue with work regardless of previous expenditure or undertakings and this discretion is left to the Minister and not to the Parliament. Under clause 57 any permit, licence or authority may be granted on 'such conditions as the Minister thinks fit and specifies in the reconnaissance authority, permit, licence or access authority'. This access authority is interesting. You may have to go to a justice of the peace to obtain an access authority. There may be only one justice of the peace in the area. If you own the local butcher shop and he has started up in opposition to you, he may not give you a permit for access to the area in which you are interested and which you wish to mine. I do not wish to proceed through the whole list of objections the Opposition has to this legislation, but it is sufficiently long and important for us to object to the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill in total. It is true that the Bill is drawn in part from and opportunities, even getting away from the the code of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) technical side of it where one might have a Act, but there are some important differences dozen different types of copper ore to treat. which ought to be pointed out. Under the There, is a great diversity of conditions under 1967 legislation applicants for a licence were which mineral resources are developed. I would required to accompany licence applications be one of those who would particularly like with details of the work proposed to be underthe Minister to clear up the matter. taken and the expenditure involved. In addition, the applicant could set out any other matters for the Designated Authority to consider. Under this mining code that we are relationship of its position to a minerals code considering, work and expenditure proposals has not been established. I might ask: What has are to be included as well as the technical been established in relation to the mining inqualifications and financial resources of the dustry? The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act applicant, as I just read out. However, a major 1967-1968 contains, in effect, a code for the difference is that the applicant is to provide areas and is, in the broad, a collective agreedetails of the extent of Australian participation ment between the States and the Commonin the venture. The weight that would be wealth for a uniform system of administration. attached to that criterion is not known, but I think those words were probably written we do not oppose that criterion on principle. when we had federalism. If one tried to get I think we have always made that approach this sort of approach these days the miracle of clear, although we have been misrepresented the loaves and the fishes would be kindertime and again in that respect. However, it garten stuff by comparison.

If there is one thing that people who are associated with the mining industry recognise, it is the great diversity of pressures The fate of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority is not certain at this stage, and the exploitation of petroleum resources in offshore offshore sovereignty in respect of petroleum resources in the same way as this code relates We have the situation where the Parliament accused now of being permissive but I think",41,Minerals Submerged Lands Bill
125,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Giles),I,44,Minerals Submerged Lands Bill
126,Mr Katter,"The Minister has indicatedthere is no better way of describing that particular process than as a strip tease processlittle by little. But the excitement does not mount as the strip tease process develops because there is too much gloom in this industry and the future is so insecure. This mining code indicates that the Minister intends to operate, in respect of minerals, on a basis fairly similar to the previous lease basis and has rejected, for example, an option system of application. Yet, what are the Minister's intentions in respect of petroleum resources? How do they relate to this legislation? We do not know and no one can ever get near enough to the Minister even to ask him the time of day. Similarly, the associated Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Billl provides for royalty payments of between 1 per cent and 10 per cent of the specified value of the minerals. Yet again we have no policy statement from the Minister of his intentions in respect of royalties on petroleum resources. So, the vague, nebulous situation becomes more and more accentuated. The Opposition has called for a White Paper on the Minister's portfolio. This call is directly related to our attitude to this legislation. If the Minister proposes that the Petroleum and Minerals Authority, or, indeed, the Australian Industry Development Corporation is to hold a privileged position in the allocation of offshore leases, this should be publicly stated, as should his requirements for the acceptable level of Australian equity or control in these offshore leases. I make the point here that I have attained one of my life's ambitions, even though it is in a shadowy way. I am the Opposition spokesman-the shadow Minister-o n northern development and the Northern Territory. Just about every significant mineral resource in Australia, with the exception of some resources in the southern parts of the nation, is within this area. I have made it my business over a period of perhaps a quarter of a century to learn the thinking of the mining industry at all levels. One matter is bugging it at all levels and is stifling and breaking the small producers who have invested in equipment in the hope that they might know which way this industry is heading. They are trying to see some sort of shadowy indication of the guidelines which the Minister and his Government ing cost situation and royalties. I wonder have in mind for the future of the mining whether the Minister would be tolerant enough industry. The general opinion is that the GovI ask the honourable member for Blaxland ernment has injected the serum of nationalisaperhaps to discuss this matter with him-and tion and that this will continue to grow. Of course honourable members are aware of what has happened in many countries. We agree with participation to a point. Who would argue against it? But what of regimentation of the industrya tap on the shoulder and a direction to appear before the court tomorrow because a lease is to be taken away? We would never agree to this. I would say that on that basis alone the results of the recently held elections were not surprising because I am not aware of any mining centre where the so-called Labor Party did not sustain dramatic losses. I instance my electorate which is absolutely riddled with mining operations and mining development. The people at all levels, in these areas showed their non-acceptance of the regimentation of the mining industry. If the Minister, as he has implied, insists on a majority Australian participation as a prerequisite under Commonwealth administration, the criteria for the granting of exploration permits and licences are much more specific than indicated in the Bill. Again, this is a nebulous airy-fairy type of approach. Similarly, the associated legislation dealing with royalty payments contains reference to a wide range of possible royalty levels and gives no indication of possible policy to take account of, for example, differing cost situations. Again we come to a diversity of situations. For instance, there can be a mining operation adjacent to the coast-for example, some of the coal mining operations in the Bowen Basin in my own electorate. But in the heart of Australia at Tennant Creek freight costsI make the point here that freight costs will be a damn sight higher when the freight subsidies are removed-ar e high and there are obvious disadvantages in being thousands of miles from the centre of activity. How on earth can we have uniform legislation or uniform controls to apply to these various areas? We have no statement from the Minister as to how this mining code differs from his intentions in respect of the all important petroleum code. He has given no indication whatsoever. If, as we suspect, there is to be a substantially different code dealing with petroleum products, this Parliament should be told and the industry generally should be told. A few moments ago I mentioned the differbig enough to come to Queensland to have discussions with Gordon Chalk, the Queensland Treasurer, who has recently returned from overseas having secured a 1900 per cent increase on the royalties which currently are being paid on our coal exports. This is an absolute triumph for the so-called people who swing hands with the multi-national organisations. I repeat that if, as we suspect, there is to be a substantially different code dealing with petroleum products, this Parliament should be told and the industry at all levels should be told. We have no statement as to Government intentions in respect of assisting State governments which have benefited from royalty receipts if the Commonwealth's position in the High Court is upheld. Where will they finish up? The Opposition believes that with respect to minerals and petroleum there should be a comprehensive code which is unified and consistent. We believe that it should be accompanied by a comprehensive White Paper on the Minister's policy intentions in his portfolio so that we are not debating suppositions. I repeat that: We believe that it should he accompanied by a comprehensive White Paper on thc Minister's policy intentions in his portfolio so that we are not debating suppositions. I think in the whole of this terrible drama of disaster for the mining industry we. in this House, have constantly debated nothing but suppositions. Apart from these reasons we reject this legislation as the minerals code it contains is at variance with thc conclusions of thc report of the Senate Select Committee on Offshore Petroleum Resources. Let the people of Australia understand that this Senate Committee went into great detail and sat over a period of many months. This report pointed out the dangers of unlimited ministerial discretions which this legislation contains in abundance. I referred a little while ago to decisions to be made by the High Court. The Commonwealth Government has repeatedly asserted that the only proper way of resolving the present disagreement over off-shore sovereignty is to take the matter to the High Court. This the States have now done. Here is the extraordinary situation. Nevertheless the Commonwealth insists on introducing legislation which, if passed by the Parliament, could well come into effect before the High Court has given its decision. In this connection we all know that both of the present Bills are designed to come into effect on the day of royal assent. There will be no time wasted there. The whole exercise is an invitation to even further confusion in the area of off-shore mining, to even further confusion in the whole mining industry of this nation. We on this side of the House totally oppose this Bill. speech by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) was motivated by the muddled thinking of the Australian Country Party. One of the disasters of this national Parliament is that for many years important areas like the extractive industries in Australia have been governed by this agrarian pressure group, this team of backwoods hillbillies, the Country Party. It has been involved, right down to the grass roots, in all the previous decisions affecting the mining industry, because that is where its election campaign funds have come from. This Government has called a halt to that. To decipher the speech that was made a few moments ago, for those who are interested, I will give some history of the matters involved. On 16 April 1970 the Gorton Government introduced the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill. The primary role of the Bill was to assert the sovereignty of the Commonwealth of Australia over the off-shore areas of Australia from the 3-mile mark to the limit of the territorial sea. That Bill arose from a decision of the High Court of Australia in the now famous Bonser v. La Macchia case. In the judgment of the High Court the Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, said: The States never had sovereignty over off-shore waters to the 3-mile limit either as colonies or as states. In other words, in his view, it was within the Commonwealth's domain to have control of the off-shore areas of Australia. Before the Gorton Government decided to introduce that Bill, a joint -Commonwealth-State Act called the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act covered exploration in Australia's off-shore areas. But it was a botch-up right from the start, and all that we have seen are abuses of what ought to have been a reasonable exploration policy developed by the State governments and the Commonwealth governments under that Act. The Gorton Government, to give it credit, said: 'We will not have any more of this. The Commonwealth of Australia does have constitutional power to legislate in respect of the off-shore, and we will assert that power through the Territorial Sea and Contitnental Shelf Bill'. The then Minister",44,Minerals Submerged Lands Bill
127,Mr Keating (Blaxland) (5.6),"Th efor National Development, the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn), said in a letter to the Australian Mining Industry Council in March of 1970: As to off-shoreminerals other than petroleum, the is no mining code. Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total rights outside the 3-mile limit, lt proposes to legislate in pursuance of this position. Honourable members will recall that at that time the rotten borough administrations of the Liberal and Country Parties in the States said: 'This is no good. We don't want control of the off-shore going to Canberra'. How could Bjelke-Petersen rort the off-shore of Queensland if control of it was in Canberra? How could Sir Charles Court rort the Western Australian situation if control was in Canberra? How could any of these little State governments-and a lot of them city State governments-ror t the off-shore of the extractive industries if the off-shore areas were controlled by Canberra? So they put on a blue. The result was that the Liberal Party had a crisis of confidence within its own ranks and nearly brought its own Prime Minister down on a no confidence motion in this House. That was Prime Minister Gorton. Five months later he fell as Prime Minister. The reason he was deposed was that his government wanted to pursue this question of sovereignty for the Australian Parliament. The Bill died then. When the Labor Government came to office we resurrected it and revamped it into what is now called the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill. It was in 2 parts. The first part declared that the Commonwealth of Australia had power off-shore and the second part was a mining code which would allow for the physical mining of the area after the declaration of sovereignty. That Bill has been through the Parliament 3 times. It has been carried by the House of Representatives on 3 occasions. It has been rejected in the Senate twice, but on the third occasion it was passed with an amendment, the amendment being the deletion of the mining code. The Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill which we have before us today under its separate title was originally part of the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill. The Senate destroyed that Bill by agreeing to that amendment, because it realised that without the mining code the declaratory PartI of the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill was powerless. Even though the Bill was passed into legislation in its emasculated form it has allowed the matter to be tested in the High Court so that once and for all a decision on jurisdiction can be made. But in the meantime mining cannot be controlled because there What we are introducing here today is a mining code. It was criticised by the honourable member for Kennedy in the most vague of terms. He referred to some of the provisions in this Bill. Similar provisions exist in any Bill. Of course you have to have a bureaucracy to administer the massive offshore area of Australia. Unless there was a bureaucratic arrangement to administer this legislation, how else would the honourable member propose to grant exploration leases and finally production leases across the whole length and breadth of the boundaries of the coastline of Australia? Of course we have to have these things. We can see similar provisions in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. We will carry this Bill in this House because the Government has the numbers in this House, and I am confident that it will be carried in the Senate also. It will then allow the mining industry of which the honourable member for Kennedy spoke to get into some of the areas that it should have been allowed to explore many years ago. This Bill provides for the setting up of a graticular system, something which the Opposition gave away years ago, something which it abandoned under the stewardship of the former Minister for National Development, the honourable member for Farrer. Clause 11 of this Bill provides that the surface of the earth shall be deemed to be divided up by what is known as a graticular system into areas each one minute of arc of latitude by one minute of arc of longitude, which gives each block an area of approximately 1.15 square miles. If we have those blocks it is possible to administer the Act so that some can be pushed out for exploration, some can go to production, while others can revert back to the Commonwealth at the appropriate time. We have a basic unit of area to work with. That is something which the former Government abandoned. Under the old graticular system four-ninths were to revert to the Commonwealth. The former Government abandoned the four-ninths which the Commonwealth would have retrieved from leasing agreements in return for a miserable l i per cent increase in royalty. That was another give-away in the days of the Liberal-Country Party administration. The honourable member for Kennedy also referred in hazy terms to the reconnaissance authority. I will tell the House something about that. The general scheme of the legislation contemplates a 2-stage system of title. The first stage of the scheme may be preceded by a reconnaissance authority which, when granted, will, subject to other existing titles, confer upon the holder a non-exclusive right for a period not exceeding 12 months to search for all minerals in the block specified by methods set out in the authority. This will allow for basic exploration. The actual first stage then is an exploration permit which will confer an exclusive right on the permitee to explore for minerals specified in the permit and carry on approved operations and execute approved works in the permit area. The second stage is a production licence which is broadly thc equivalent of a mining lease on land and covers further exploration for specified minerals and their recovery. What is the big hassle about this concept do so. It never achieved anything. All it ever of areconnaissanceauthority? The honourdid was to sell Australia's resources overseas able member for Kennedy suggests that there at well below world parity prices across the is something improper about it. There is board. nothing improper about it. It is a perfectly sensible, reasonable piece of legislation. But the Opposition, for miserable political advanState governments which we have under tage, wishes to try to kill it again. The honLiberal-Country ourable member talked about what Sir Gorclassic example is the State Government don Chalk has obtained for the mining indusof Queensland at the moment-wil l cease try in Queensland and what the Opposition if the control of Australia's offshore has done for the coal industry. It has done mineral resources is under the Federal nothing. That is the truth. This Government Parliament and, if honourable members like, has obtained increases in the price of coal. a federal bureaucracy. I do not move away The present Minister for Minerals and Energy from the word. Honourable members opposite is the first Minister in this Parliament ever talk about bureaucratic machinations.

Because honourable members opposite ment. It has obtained massive increases in the mention bureaucracy, we are supposed to run price of iron ore. But for the success of the away. But who runs these affairs in the States? Minister for Minerals and Energy not half of It is a pity that the bureaucracy did not run the iron ore projects in Western Australia them there. The trouble is that they are run would have been continued, as the devaluaby the multi-national companies, the State tion of the American dollar by 22 per cent Premiers and the State Ministers. They can rendered the industry uneconomic. The mining industry was foolish enough to erate this second class situation. We are here write all its contracts in terms of United States to legislate on behalf of the Australian dollars, thus effectively downgrading its inpeople. No amount of party political prejudice come by 22 per cent. The Minister for Minerals and Energy got that income back. He renegotiated clauses of the contracts. It was the Minister for Minerals and Energy who achieved that, not the mining industry. The mining industry came on the scene after the hard work had been done. Certainly the hillbillies on the other side of the House could not be capable of such negotiations. Can honourable members imagine the honourable member for Kennedy doing that? Can they imagine the honourable member for Kennedy facing up to the Nippon iron and steel organisation and trying to secure a price increase? It would eat him for breakfast. The honourable member for Kennedy cannot speak in derogatory terms about the Minister for Minerals and Energy. He has brought to this nation an awareness of the might of Australia's extractive industries. The Government said: Australia intends to be an honest trading partner. We are willing sellers and we expect people to be willing buyers. We expect to sell on reasonable terms. We have achieved those terms. The former Government did not The activities of corrupt rotten borough Party administrationsa be bought almost for the price of a meal. That is the reality of the situation. We will not tolon the part of honourable members opposite will stop us. The declaratory provisions of the Seas and Submerged Lands Act have been carried by the Parliament.

What did honourable members opposite, who are trying to interject, think I meant, other t'Ian constitutionally valid? Do they think that I would believe thaf the High Court would uphold something that was not constitutionally valid? How ridiculous can they get? Sir Percy Spender was a former 11284/74-R -[17 ] member of this Parliament and a Minister in a former government of the Liberal-Country Party coalition. He was later President of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Have honourable members opposite ever read what he said about Australia's offshore areas and what he believes with respect to the law on offshore areas? Honourable members will know that the World Court has heen involved in demarcation disputes between nations as to the control of continental shelves and continental margins between and around countries. What did Sir Percy Spender say? He said that the Australian Parliament has power to legislate. This Government agrees with that view. It introduced legislation which now has been passed by the Senate, although in amended form. The amendment which rendered that legislation inoperative in the sense of providing a mining code is being dealt with today in the consideration of this Bill. When this legislation is passed through both Houses and is enacted, there will be a mining code for the exploration and production of the minerals that lie offshore from this country; that means under water. I heard the impassioned plea made by the honourable member for Kennedy about 15 minutes ago concerning the small fellows. He asked whether they could raise $100 to put in an application for a licence. Small fellows do not explore offshore. Any company that starts to mine in deep water offof the prospector with a pan over his back, a pick over his shoulder, trudging through the countryside, digging holes, looking at the minerals, and saying: 1 have come across a bonanza'. To engage in offshore operations big money is required. We expect any companies which search offshore to be able to produce the goods and to undertake a reasonable exploration program. These must be companies of substance. Such companies are not scared by the simple provisions of this Bill, even though the honourable member for Kennedy may be. He is scared because he cannot understand it. The Bill is a simple piece of legislation.

135,Mr Keating,"Thank you, Mr DeputyMinister from one of the major mining companies. He will constantly harp on this type of thing. think there is substance in the point of order. The honourable member for Blaxland did not name any specific person. The ruling of this House for some time has been that if people are not named a point of order in that respect is without substance. Speaker, he did say 'the Leader of the Country Party' -legislation to which I have referred will be the honourable member should not name anyone. If he does, I will need to ask for a withdrawal. I suggest that he get on with his speech. that the 2 sources of income for the Country Party are the elite rural interests and the mining industry. Those are the facts. We will not put this Parliament in the situation where the mining industry is foreign controlled. A great many of our mining companies are foreign controlled. This Bill makes provision to ensure that a 51 per cent Australian equity is maintained in any mining venture. We insist upon that. The Canadian Government now is demanding a 51 per cent equity in this industry. This legislation insists upon it. We will not be fooled around by a mining industry which is foreign controlled. We require control of the offshore resources, both mineral and petroleum, to be vested in the Federal Parliament. The position in the States is not like that. It is very easy for these pukka sahib executives to duchess these State Ministers and to con them at large. That is what happens. They will not be conning the Australian Minister for Minerals and Energy or the parliamentary Labor Party. We believe that the proper right of this Parliament is to exercise jurisdiction over Australia's offshore assets-in respect of this legiswhom the honourable member singles out for lation, minerals, and ultimately petroleum. We believe that the Australian Parliament through the Australian Constitution has that power. The end result for future generations of Australians will be found in the form of the legacy from this Labor Government. Our actions will come to be appreciated in perhaps the next 10 years, 15 years or 20 years-no t directly at the moment but in future years. They will come to appreciate that all of the vast extractive industries that are mining the massive.minerals and energy resources of this country have been required to do so in a manner that is to the benefit of all Australians, to be enjoyed by all Australians, that the resources have not been allowed to be given away at bargain basement prices, below world parity prices,, by an agrarian rumpa pressure group -such , as the Country Party. That is not on. That is why I believe that this legislation will be carried by this House. I ask all honourable memhers to support it. I believe that it will be carried by the Senate. I also believe that the upheld in the High Court. I commend the Bills to the House. know whether the sort of speech that we have just heard from the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr Keating) passes as logic or oratory at branch meetings of the Australian Labor Party, but I can assure him that it will not cut any ice here. The honourable member's speech was a hotch-potch of contradictions and nonsense, as I will spend a moment or two pointing out. His speeches are always full of abuse. Indeed, it would be clear to anyone watching him speak that he is so emotionally involved in the subject of his legislation that he really cannot separate the factual and objective aspects of it. Interlaced throughout all of his speeches on this subject is a hymn of hate against the State Premiers, particularly those of Western Australia and Queensland, that is filled with intemperate references. I will not go into them any further as I do noi want to give emphasis to them, but I will point out to the honourable member that it hardly helps his case to talk in that way. Another notable aspect of the honourable member's behaviour is, as is well known in this place, that he is a protege of the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor). The honourable member helps the Minister a great deal in this House and in the Labor Party. Naturally the Minister is the only person any sort of praise-and what gushing praise it is. The Minister receives all the thanks for everything that the honourable member regards as being progressive in the mining industry in this country. According to the honourable member, it is the Minister who saved all of the iron ore companies in Western Australia.

140,Mr Garland (Curtin) (5.26),"I do notliave survived but for the actions of the Minister. What a laugh! The Minister did not have one hand in the setting up of those industries. He did not do one thing to help them. As a matter of fact, no one criticised them more than he did years ago when he saton the Opposition benches. He criticised all the projects that were set up in the 1960s. Naturally, as a member of a government which has brought about a currency devaluation that has had a damaging effect on all the export industries of this country the Minister had to try to get better prices from the importers of our iron ore and other minerals. I noticed that the honourable member lor Blaxland is walking towards the door of the chamber. He knows that all of the things I have said are true and that he has misrepresented the position. The honourable member brought up the old chestnut about how the mining companies should not have tied their contract prices to the United States dollar. What was the alternative? I challenge honourable members opposite to find for me one banker who is engaged in raising international finance or one stockbroker who has engaged in raising money for mammoth projects which have turned around the balance of payments strength of this country who will say that he could have done other than tie the currency to the United States dollar rate. Most countries of the world are still following the same practice. The reason why they are still doing so is that the United States currency is still the strongest currency and the only currency to which one can look for major stability. Honourable members opposite may not like that, but it remains a fact of international finance. I point out also that this legislation, which the Government says is so important, is being represented -at 5.30 p.m. on this Tuesday by one Minister-the Minister for Defence( Mr tion is as to who has the rights und whether Barnard)-and that not one other member of the Labor Party is present in the House. It is supposed to be an important piece of legislation to the Australian Labor Party; yet its supporters have walked out on it. No doubt they have gone to an early dinner or to something of that kind and have left the Minister for Defence here as their sole representative. Well, all praise to him. Perhaps he has been rostered to be in attendance; I do not know. Be that as it may, no interest is being shown by the Labor Party in this matter. The honourable member for Blaxland also referred to some legal opinion on this matter. I might add that he also gave a lot of his own opinions, which are far less qualified. Of course, the fundamental point that has to be made about this Bill before one even starts to talk about its detail is that its introduction is completely premature. This legislation represents Part III of a Bill which was presented to this House by the Government last year and which was deleted by the Senate for the reasons set out in the debate on that Bill. I will not go into those reasons now. The remainder of the Bill that was passed asserted Commonwealth sovereignty over off-shore areas. That sovereignty has been questioned by several States. Proceedings have been initiated in the High Court in relation to that assertion. At one stage of his speech the honourable member for Blaxland tried to imply that the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton), who is a former Prime Minister, would be, because he saw much in favour of this sort of legislation, behind this legislation today. I point out that what the right honourable gentleman has said for many yearsI have heard him say it many times-is that the Commonwealth should assert that it has sovereignty and the High Court should be left to decide who has sovereignty. The High Court is in the midst of determining the sovereignty issue. It has not yet determined it. To bring in this legislation at this stageI know that in the weeks to come the Government is going to say how urgent many Bills are and how it can allow only 10 minutes for them to be debated hecause there is insufficient time-is to make a mockery of the Parliament because it is not urgent. Although the sovereignty issue is not, strictly speaking, sub judice it certainly needs to be resolved before anybody will know what the true posithe Commonwealth law can be said to be legal. The Minister will not say what his attitude is to the petroleum aspect of off-shore exploration because this Bill specifically excludes that. There is no reference to that subject beyond, of course, the specific provision in the Bill that it should not be covered. I summarise my remarks by saying that the -major Bill2 Bills are being debated concurrently-represent s Part III of the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill 1973 and that the provisions of Part III of that Bill were not passed when they came before the Senate last year; only PartI and Part II of that Bill were passed on that occasion. PartI and Part II of that enactment include a claim by the Commonwealth to sovereignty and to sovereign rights in respect of the territorial sea and internal waters excluding those that were subject to State sovereignty in 1900 and including not only internal waters but also the continental shelf. That enactment is at present the subject of a High Court challenge by several States which are seeking a declaration that it is unconstitutional. The Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill 1974 as is covered by clause 2. So there is no provides a code for the exploration and mining delay in its provisions while its validity is of minerals in the area over which the Comtested. Obviously that will result in extreme monwealth claims sovereignty and in relation uncertainty by any company or group seeking to which the honourable member for Blaxland to explore in the off-shore area. Thirdly, the says the High Court is going to give the Minister may require information and docuCommonwealth sovereignty. Of course, it will ments relating to minerals in off-shore zones be recalled that immediately he made that from anybody capable of providing them, assertion I interjected and that he then reincluding, of course, State governments. I treated and said that the High Court will think we are aware of the attack which the be deciding whether it is constitutional. The Government is making on the States in those honourable member changed his ground areas in which the States have been exercissomewhat. The fact of the matter is that the ing power. Are we to say that the States High Court will be determining the issue and, should have no powers? Certainly we will not at this point, nobody, not even the High Court, say that they should have all power. knows what that determination will be. Because the Bill that we now have before us relies on the very existence of sovereignty We have had a balance in this country since the constitutional validity of which the present 1901. It has existed under the federal system. High Court challenge will determine, its I for one am not going to say that that introduction is premature. The determination balance should always remain the same. I by the High Court is basic to the whole believe that from time to time it needs to matter. It is obvious that this legislation will be changed. But I certainly do not believe be of no consequence until the legal doubt is that every aspect of government is best conremoved. Let me mention one or two salient aspects believe that many matters are handled of the legislation. Firstly, it applies only to inefficiently from here, let alone unwisely. minerals and, as I said, specifically excludes That is the experience of all large administrapetroleum. So the legislation relating to tion around the world. It is being discovered petroleum is not affected. Let me comment on that much more local involvement is necesthat point. The Minister refuses to say what sary for greater effectiveness. But this Govhis attitude is. The Opposition's shadow ernment does not believe in that fact.

If we leave them that the State governments can exercise. One there undiscovered, if large scale projects are can give many examples of that. not launched in order to find them we will be all the poorer, and so will the world be poorer. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) is always anxious to say that Australia has responsibility for the provision of resources to other countries and particularly to the less developed countries. I ask: What about this major aspect-on e that is probably much more important than any amount of foreign aid which this country can direct, because the sum is so much larger? Secondly, the Bill will come into operation on the day on which it receives royal assent, What is necessary is some sort of balance. trolled from Canberra. On the contrary, I It will be an offence to explore for minerals or to carry on operations for the recovery of minerals in the off-shore zone except in accordance with the provisions laid down in this Bill, and they are indeed stringent. Apparently the Government is moving towards a stage of wishing to take unto its own authority all exploration-indee d we know that that has started in the fields of oil and gas exploration and minerals as well. The transitional provision in Division8 provides for the continued operation of exploration under State laws until a decision has been given on the application for a licence under the Commonwealth Bill. The State laws, so far as they relate to exploration for or operations for the recovery of minerals in any part of the off-shore area, are specifically excluded. We are debating an associated Bill providing for a royalty to the Commonwealth on minerals taken as allowed by the major Bill-the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill. If enacted, these Bills will conflict with the State Acts. Many of the State Acts-in my own State of Western Australia it is known as the Mining Act 1904-73-appl y below the low water mark. I am not aware of any extensive exploration taking place but obviously, as technology improves, there will be a great deal of exploration. So the validity of this legislation depends on the result of the present challenge to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. Meanwhile anybody who wishes to explore will not know what to do. There will be complete uncertainty, and uncertainty involving huge sums of money means no exploration at all. Since this Government was elected in December 1972 we have seen a tremendous reduction in the exploration for oil, gas and minerals. It is of no use talking about the principles involved if the result is that one finds nothing. That helps nobody. This is just another Bill which will increase the uncertainty. That position is exacerbated by the Government's refusal to state its general policy. In conclusion let me mention that Senator those of that opinion say 'Aye', to the contrary Greenwood, who is the Deputy Leader of the 'No'. Liberal Party in the Senate and a former distinguished Attorney-General, made a speech on the legislation of last year to which I referred. In that speech he set out in some detail all the reasons why the Opposition is opposed to that legislation and, in particular, to the gentleman can have his name recorded as over-wide discretion which it contains. I prevoting against the Bill. diet that we will see from this Government, the longer it stays here, more and more attempts to take unto itself more and more power. I think that power, as well as economic development, is what these Bills are all about. I say: 'Thank God for the Senate and what it did last year, and thank God for the efforts of the State governments in most of the attempts they have made to inhibit this legislation.' The essence of democracy is not unitary rule by Whitlam but divided power. The essence of democracy is divided powerdivided between the chambers, divided between the Commonwealth and the States.

150,Mr Lynch (Flinders) (5.53),"The Billrespects, a reflection of an increasingly complex and mature financial and economic structure in Australia. The Opposition does not believe that direct controls over the non-bank financial institutions can be a substitute for general monetary measures. Indeed, any government that tries to use such controls as a substitute will find that its policies fail to influence the macro-economic variables to which they are directed and will, at the same time, cause substantial distortions and inefficiencies in the capital market. The misuse of powers granted under this legislation would have serious economic consequences. We believe, however, that it is desirable for a government to possess the broad powers contained in this Bill. Controls over the behaviour of financial institutions can be a desirable supplement to market measures for the purpose of monetary policy and they can be used to protect investors where the financial security of their investments might be jeopardised. The imposition of direct controls over a wider segment of the financial sector than the banks will increase the proportion of financing subject to control and may speed the impact of policy changes. At present the banking sector is subject to a significant degree of control. The trading banks are subject to interest rate controls and the statutory reserve deposit provisions. They also abide by the voluntary LGS convention and are subject to direction by the Reserve Bank over their lending activities. Savings banks are subject to interest rate controls, and their quantity and direction of lending is regulated. If a case can be made for subjecting the banking system to these controls, I believe that as a matter of equity the Government ought also have the power to impose direct controls over the non-bank sector. However, it must be emphasised again that, if such powers are used in a heavy handed way and are allowed to become a substitute for market-oriented measures, they will in fact be counter productive. No better example of that could be given than the Government's misguided attempt, during 1973, to hold down housing interest rates while at the same time pushing the long-term bond rate and thus all other competing rates to record levels. The market, of course, reacted in a predictable fashion. Investors became loath to commit their funds to the building societies who were unable to offer competitive rates of interest on their deposit. The resultant fall in building society lending, and the eventual collapse of the policy, is now a matter of history. The whole history of Labor's monetary policies is, of course, a very unhappy one. Had monetary growth been cut earlier in 1973, when the Government's advisers and independent commentators first warned of excess demand in the economy, both inflation and interest rates would have been much lower than they are at present. Instead, the Government went ahead with a massive expansion of Government spending and even the increase in bond rates from 6 per cent to 8 i per cent was quite ineffectual in offsetting the results of fiscal expansion during 1973. The Opposition Parties believe that monetary expansion should be operated to regulate the economy in conjuction with a responsible fiscal policy. The Opposition rejects the use of high interest rates to transfer resources to the public sector. Indeed, we reject the expansion of. the public sector which is this Government's specific policy intention and which the Treasurer has admitted will be achieved through a combination of high interest rates, inflation and higher taxation. The Opposition believes, also, that while the powers embodied in this Bill will be useful for relative application or to be kept in reserve, that the general direction in which the application of monetary policy in Australia has been heading-that is, away from direct controls and towards market-oriented measures -shoul d be continued. This view, and the need for the powers given under this Bill to be used responsibly and in conjunction with market measures, is supported by the Reserve Bank in its 1972 annual report at page 38. I quote: The recent extension of greater flexibility to banks reflects the view that it is important, both on grounds of equity and for implementing policy, that intermediaries which are subject to direct controls should ibe freed whenever possible of restraint applied through those controls to preserve to the extent practicable their market share as financial intermediaries. Experience has shown that direct controls, although perhaps useful tools of policy over short period, can diminish in effectiveness when applied continuously over long periods. Although a broadening of the range of financial intermediaries is no doubt largely a consequence of natural development, the exercise of direct control over some part of the financial system obviously encourages, after a time, a shift towards areas not subject to direct control. A widening of the area subject to controls might not substantially reduce this problem because markets develop means for by-passing restraints even if elaborate administrative machinery is established. In the process, there is some diversion of business away from the more efficient means for channelling savings to potential spenders. A Liberal-Country Party government would use monetary controls responsibly. Our domestic economic policies would be based on responsible fiscal policies and market-oriented monetary policies-supplemente d where necessary by the direct controls this legislation will give to the Commonwealth Government. We believe that a competitive capital market is the background of Australia's development potential. The non-bank financial sector would not be disadvantaged by responsible use of these powers. We must accept that a general monetary policy, either of expansion or of restraint, will operate more rapidly or to a greater extent on some particular sectors of the economy than on some others. This so-called sectoral imbalance which can arise through changes in monetary policy can, of course, have undesirable social consequences. Where this sectoral imbalance arises from the operation of normal market forces it should, from an economic point of view, be subject to general acceptance. I believe the sound and responsible course of action to redress the conflict between the goals of monetary and social policies is to use fiscal policies. Where severe sectoral imbalance arises from artificial rigidities within the capital market, then those rigidities and constraints which have historically been associated with the monetary policies of successive Australian governments cannot simply be eradicated overnight. Therefore, I believe that there is no case for the outright rejection of quantitative monetary controls. Equally, I believe that the non-bank and the banking sectors of the economy ought to operate under a similar framework of Government supervision. Thus the Opposition views legislation affecting non-bankfinancialintermediaries as a useful supplement -to the broad range of monetary policy options but as an option that can and should only be used in a limited and specialised manner. The former Governor of the Reserve Bank, and now the Prime Minister's special economic adviser referred to the problems associated with Government interference with non-bank financial institutions in the following terms: There woulcl be great difficulties in any attempt to which embraces commercial banks, merchant supervise the activities of commercial borrowers, particularly financial intermediaries, in the same way as those of banks. The business undertaken by these intermediaries is definitely diverse and the policing of pared with 12i per cent for banks, and the the legislation would be more complex and possibly ineffective. Furthermore, there is a good deal to be said for avoiding legislation which could prove unnecessarily restrictive if this can be done without harm to the economy and injustice to the investing public. The price of freedom here as elsewhere may be the voluntary acceptance of responsibility. Our experience during the last year has demonstrated the dangers both to businesses which rely upon other people's money and to the investors themselves when such responsibility is ignored. Dr Coombs' successor, Sir John Phillips, referred in the following terms to the problems of controls over banks in his R. C. Mills Memorial Lecture in 1971 when he said: However, as with other institutions, their growth in the long run depends upon their ability to offer services that others do not or cannot offer as efficiently. Use of direct controls usually hinders this process of having the community's financing done by the most efficient means. In the same lecture he stated: Shifts. . . induced by direct controls do not necessarily promote the efficiency of the financial system, where the optimum position from an economic point of view is an institutional structure determined by the relative efficiency of the various intermediaries in providing financial services. The views of both a former Governor of the Australian Reserve Bank and the present Governor clearly support the Opposition's position that the powers contained in the Bill before the House have the capacity to be counter productive if used without regard for their economic consequences. Equally, they support our contention that the current restrictions applying to the banking system should continue to be eased. Controls, similar to those proposed in the Bills, have been in use for a significant period in European countries. For example, West Germany applies asset ratio controls to all 'deposit-taking institutions' which includes banks, credit co-operatives and mortgage lenders. Similar measures embracing banks and the equivalent of Australian 'fringe banks' have also been adopted in South Africa and New Zealand. The United Kingdom has, since September 1971, moved in the same direction by applying minimum reserve assets ratio requirements and special deposit requirements, similar to statutory reserve deposit requirements in Australia, with the Bank of England to all major 'deposit-taking institutions', a term banks, discount houses and the larger finance houses. The minimum reserve assets ratio for the latter, for instance, is 10 per cent, comBank of England has indicated that calls to special deposits will 'normally be at the same rate as calls on the banks'. It should be recalled, in this regard, that the Treasurer indicated in his second reading speech that statutory reserve deposits would not be applied to non-bank financial institutions in Australia. The United States has not applied asset intermediaries to usurp some of the payments funcratios to financial intermediaries generally but, tions of the commercial bank may reduce the latter's at times, monetary policy has included the relative importance, it is not a significant factor from use of consumer credit controls and interest the rate ceilings on deposits. In January legislastability in so far as they succeed in commandeering tion was submitted to Congress seeking the money balances to supplement the current inflow of application of cash reserve requirements to all savings either by a switch by the public out of curdeposit taking institutions. Thus the type of controls which may be indence volved under the legislation before the House there are are by no means unique in international for transferring funds to defecit units to enable them terms. In the same way they are not, of to increase monetary demand. course, unique in Australia as a result of the Banking Act enacted by this Parliament. The Treasurer, in his speech to the Ecoanalyse the facts we have about the growth of the nomic Society of Australia and New Zealand non-bank referred to the Financial Corporations Bill in plained by the increase in personal savings and is the following terms: The rationale for the introduction of the legislation is changes in the rate of growth when interest rates and the related policy stance are well documented are rising, that are significant from the point of view in the major theoretical works and the empirical of short-term cyclical policy. We find little evidence studies which the rapid growth of the non-bank finanof an acceleration in the rates of growth of three cial institutions produced in the 1950's and important intermediaries when interest rates were 1960's . . . there is no disagreement that such rising during the 'fifties. The presumption is that intermediaries have significant potential to undertake the non-bank financial intermediaries were doing little activities which are inimical to an effective monetary more than fulfilling an intermediary role between policy. The Opposition parties believe that statement to be an over-simplicatibn which does not accurately reflect the findings of monetary theorists or of empirical studies. It is true, however, that monetary theorists and major public inquiries, such as the United Kingdom Committee on the Working of the Monetary System and the United States Commission on Financial Structure and Regulation, have all adverted to the capacity of financial institutions to create disintermediation. The Radcliffe Commission rejected any attempts to substitute for the traditional control of the money supply a complex of controls over a wide range of nnancial institutions. It stated: Such a prospect would be unwelcome except as a last resort, not mainly because of its administrative tration of monetary policy and have advocated burdens, but because the further growth of new new measures for their control. For example, financial institutions would allow the situation conProfessor Warren Hogan, in the 'Economic tinually to slip from under the grip of the authorities. Record' in 1960 referred to the conclusions of The Radcliffe Commission has, of course, been the debate in the United States in the followwidely criticised by economists for its overing terms: statement of the potential threat to stability arising from the growth of non-bank financial weakened by the faster growth of those financial intermediaries. In the United Kingdom Professor Clayton's work, while recognising the capacity of British financial intermediaries to be de-stabilising, has taken a more balanced view. That report stated: It is an important feature of our analysis that, while in the long period the tendency for non-bank angle of short-period contra-cyclical policy. The non-bank intermediaries are a potential threat to rency and bank deposits into non-bank intermediary deposits or through sales of bonds out of their portfolios. We have shown that, although there is evithat the size of idle balances is considerable, considerable imperfections in the mechanism In the absence of adequate flow of funds data and knowledge of the public's relative preferences for money and near-money assets, we have to try to intermediaries. We have argued that the rapidity of their growth in the 'fifties can be exnot of itself evidence of destabilising behaviour. It savers and borrowers. In the United States, monetary studies, such as 'Money in a Theory of Finance' by Gurley and Shaw, have tended to place a further discount on the capacity for financial intermediaries to create de-stabilising effects. Gurley and Shaw did, however, make the following observation: But when the monetary system comprises private commercial banks seeking profits, a system of controls over the activities, especially when banks are subject to rigorous competition from uncontrolled intermediaries, may in time create problems for the monetary authority. A number of Australian economists have likewise adverted to the capacity of financial intermediaries to create problems for the adminisFirst, the impact of monetary policy has been institutions not subject to central banking controls. Secondly, new types of controls are needed to combat the decline in effectiveness of the central bank's present array of weapons. These amount to proposals for enforcing minimum reserve requirements on nonbanking financial intermediaries. Commenting on the Australian situation, Professor Hogan had this to say: The rise of the non-banking intermediaries gives announcement last Friday that the consumer cause for alarm as it seems to have hampered monetary price index in the June quarter had risen by policy at the very points where its usefulness is most no less than 4.1 per cent not merely dispelled strongly upheld. In his conclusion he noted that: The effect of the growth of the non-banking iinancial intermediaries is to thrust the burden of adjustment tion of prices. I have no illusions about the to their activities upon the banking system. The magnitude, or the intractability, of the task we trading banks suffer losses of reserves as a result face. It must be obvious to all of us that, with of lending activities outside their control; they are prices and costs now rising at these rates, therefore forced to limit the amount of credit provided by the banking system. By itself such action may only and with inflationary expectations now so swell the fringe of unsatisfied borrowers who will entrenched, inflation cannot now be beaten turn in greater numbers to other financial interwithout severe costs. It must be equally mediaries. An effective control of the financial system is not possible when monetary policy is directed obvious that we would have preferred to avoid solely towards controlling the liquidity of the banking those costs. The plain fact is that we no longer system. It is necessary to devise techniques affecting have any real choice. the liquidity of the entire financial structure. Otherwise, financial assets can always be transferred between intermediaries to circumvent the authority of the central bank. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. sitting for dinner I quoted the views of Professor Hogan as outlined in the economic survey of the 'Economic Record (I960)'. I said that, although Professor Hogan concluded that there was no alternative to a revision of policies towards financial intermediaries, he was constrained in reaching his conclusions in this regard by the constitutional difficulties which limited the Commonwealth prior to the Concrete Pipes case. In short, there is a consensus among economists that an uncontrolled non-bank financial sector has a capacity to create disintermediation. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Ministerial Statement (8.1)-by leave-During the period ahead the that is, when compared with the erosion of Government and the Australian community capital by inflation.

Too much money was chasing too few goods. Our approach to this situation was simple and logical. Through our exchange rate and tariff policies, we proceeded to increase to the maximum the flow of goods on to the market. Equally forceful was the Government's attack on the excessive liquidity and too easy access to borrowed money which was feeding the already excessive demand. Restraints were applied to the flow of funds from abroad and a tighter credit policy was gradually made effective. This first stage in our approach has been a long slow haul. In the process interest rates have risen to. unprecedented heights. Given our abhorrence of high interest rates, that has been a measure of our resolution. Let us, however, be quite clear. We would all like to see interest rates coming down, not going up. But although nominal interest rates are now",54,Financial Corporations Bill 1974

We shall certainly keep it that way as long as is necessary. At the same time we shall maintain a proper flexibility. I inform the House that this afternoon the Governor of the Reserve Bank announced a further release of SDRs. both SDRs and SRDs. The ones to which I refer are the SRDs, the statutory reserve deposits-no t the special drawing rights, no matter how much some people might like to have special drawing rights. For a number of reasons monetary policy has had to carry an undue share of the burden during recent months. As fiscal policy takes on a greater role it will be appropriate to amend the policy 'mix' so as to reduce that undue burden. Stage two of our approach was unveiled at the Premiers Conference recently. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) then announced a policy for 1974-75 of restraint in government spending throughout the nation. He foreshadowed that the Australian Government would be deferring or rephasing much of its own planned spending in 1974-75 and he announced financial provisions to the States which, in totality, were designed to ensure a similar policy of restraint on their part. One of the problems in dealing with inflation is that everyone wants it beaten but everyone also wants his own activities to remain quite unaffected. Everyone favours general restraint but still wants particular expenditure. There is no wayI repeat, no way-in which inflation can be beaten which will not involve discomfort for a while for the community as a whole. That is the background against which, tonight, I am announcing some further developments in our approach. In the normal course the steps I shall announce tonight would have been comprehended in a Budget in mid-August. However, with the Budget timetable now so delayed by the election, we have decided to take certain steps immediately. Some will no doubt question the need for the further measures; but after all, it does seem that in the last month or so the rate of increase in demand has eased somewhat. The boom, perhaps, is already on the wane. Further measures now, it will be said, will be too much, too late. Let me therefore say a little about the economic situation. THE ECONOMY Throughout 1973-74 the economy was overstretched. There were shortages of labour and of many goods, despite a huge rise in imports. Aided by strongly rising incomes, consumer spending rose very strongly. The rise was particularly marked in the second half of the year although it may have slackened off a little in the last month or two. Spending on private housing construction also rose strongly in 1973-74. Newfinancefor housing has been falling from the exceedingly high levels reached a year ago. Even so, private dwelling commencements in the March quarter, the latest period for which we have figures, were still running in seasonally adjusted terms ahead of the industry's capacity to complete dwellings. At the end of March dwellings under construction were 30 per cent higher in number than their already swollen level of a year earlier. When thefiguresfor the June quarter are published next month we would expect to find that over strain considerably reduced. Even so, data on new private dwelling approvals for the 3 months to May show an annual rate of over 150,000 being sustaineda high rate by any but the false standards of 1973. There is no doubt that the pressures on the industry are now easing, and easing fast. I shall say more about that in a moment. But what some are now complaining about are the prices at which they may have to sell houses as they complete them. For the first time for years speculative developers face some uncertainty about the prices at which they can sell. The Government has been aiming to achieve that. We set out to break the inflationary expectations which have been creating an artificially high level of demand for land and private housing. We are beginning to succeed. We are certainly not going to throw away that success just as it is coming within our grasp. In this and other respects",58,Inflation

159,Mr Creani Have To Be An Expert In,"I remind the House of what the Prime Minister said in his statement to the Premiers recently. When, as we will, we hear of some such ventures going badly wrong in the period ahead, we will know that the risk element has been reintroduced into such forms of investment. I know that the lower levels of lending for housing, and the higher interest rates, are hurting would be home buyers. It is with one aspect of that problem in mind that I will be introducing legislation in the Budget session to allow, subject to certain conditions, housing mortgage interest payments as a concessional deduction for income tax purposes as from 1 July last. We shall also have regard to the other aspect-the availability of finance for housing. Up to now more money for housing would only have meant a bidding-up of housing prices, not an increased output of houses. However, that situation will change and is already beginning to do so. As it does, we shall be vigilant to ensure that our policies are geared appropriately to the developing situation. For example, at the Premiers Conference one area of spending in which the States were told they were not being restrained was welfare housing. As the Prime Minister said at that time, the Government is determined to ensure that less privileged families in our society are not denied the chance to live in adequate homes, and that many low-income families are given the opportunity to buy homes of their own. Yet the number of nouses completed in the public sector in the year to March 1974 was the lowest for 15 years. All the resources were being drained off into the private sector. We have no intention of bringing the private housing industry to its knees. Our policies will be designed to avoid any such outcome. But at the same time we are determined to achieve some easing in that sector along with others. That must occur if the public sector is to be able to build many more houses for the needy, which is our desire. Although such data as are available for private fixed investment present a somewhat mixed picture, thefiguresfor the March quarter were well up on a year earlier. Public sector spending rose strongly during 1973-74. Overall, then, the demand situation in 1973-74 was one of excessive strength. That was in part reflected in a great rise in imports. In the 3 months to June imports were no less than 69 per cent greater than a year earlier. Despite increased supplies and the progressive tightening of credit through 1973-74, manufacturers in June were still seeing the main constraints on their activity as physical. In the ACMA/Bank of New South Wales survey 71 per cent of manufacturers nominated shortages of either labour, materials or plant capacity as the main constraint on their activity. Towards the end of thefinancialyear, however, some signs of an easing in demand pressures did begin to emerge. Although unemployment remained low-a t the end of June persons registered represented only 1.34 per cent of the work force-unfille d vacancies fell sharply in the June quarter, presaging an easing in the demand for labour in the coming months. Meanwhile, the effects on industry of tight credit and of sharply increased import competition have been becoming evident, in a sporadic way. On all the evidence the pace of demand does appear to be slowing and should ease further in the months ahead. The extreme over strain from which we have been suffering will thus be dissipated and some slack in demand for resources could develop as 1974-75 goes by. The Inflationary Outlook It will be said that this is enough-that more measures taken when the boom is on the wane is overkill. From the standpoint of dealing with inflation the reality is otherwise. The upward thrust of cost and price pressures will not be turned back by our decisions up to this time. What we have done so far has stopped inflation from accelerating even faster. If that is all we can achieve, however, we shall have merely set the stage for the next round of inflation to take off from this higher 'base. I say without exaggeration that the Australian economy now faces a highly dangerous situation. Let me focus on 2 key elements. First, costs are now rising very fast. In 1973-74 average weekly earnings rose by 16 per cent. They are now rising at over 20 per cent. But such figures have nothing to do with the real purchasing power of those wages. I do not prolong the point. We have a wages explosion which is damaging everyone, and wage-earners as well. The second key element in our situation derives from the rest of the world. In the first half of 1974, output in the OECD countries overall appears to have actually fallen. It is plain that, if deflationary policies are resolutely pursued by some of the major countries, those policies are going to have pervasive effects on world economic activity and world trade. Australia will not be immune from those effects. This is not an occasion to analyse the world economic outlook but for Australia tiiere are certain implications. Australia has ample intertheir impact on the economy, on businesses national reserves. Not only can we afford a further period of sizeable deficit in our balance burdens imposed are borne primarily by those of payments but also we need such an outcome for a time both in order to keep up the total supply of goods to the economy and from the monetary policy aspect. However, if our inflation goes on unabated or accelerates while key countries overseas are reining in theirs, we will find our position becoming untenable in two or three years' time. In those circumstances-and I emphasise that we are not going to allow them to happen-w e would have to take external economic policy measures for balance of payments reasons which would make our domestic inflationary problem much harder to deal with. Just as one can have a vicious wage-price spiral, so one can have a vicious inflationary-balance of payments interaction. There are only too many overseas examples to attest to that. Inflation and Our SocietyI have referred to the familiar economic competitiveness of our industries, they are case for curbing inflation. But the case goes unlikely to enter wage negotiations in an far beyond economics. Inflation is utterly inappropriate frame of mind. equitable in its effects. Let me illustrate that by way of a mundane example.

The Control of Demand First let me say that the foundation for any anti-inflationary policy must be in the control of demand. We have pushed supplies to their maximum and little can be added on that side. Furthermore, until employers become to some degree uncertain about their capacity to pass on cost increases, their interest in resisting such increases and in countering their effect by greater efficiency or by accepting lower profits returns is likely to be minimised. Let me say also that, until those on both sides who negotiate about wages become more concerned about the effect of rapidly increasing wage costs on future employment of workers in their own and other industries or occupations, and the long-term effects of such cost increases on the international This, then, is the first strand in the Govgeneral policy of expenditure restraint, he said that the financial allocation for the Post The Minister representing the Postmasterrate is to rise from 7c to 9c; the telephone connection fee is to rise from $60 to $80; business telephone rentals are to rise by $20 per annum to $75; residential telephone rentals are to rise by $10 per annum to $65; and the local call fee is to rise from 4.75c to 6c. To make some further contribution towards restraining the growth of private demand, the Government now proposes to increase certain customs and excise duties. The consumption of tobacco and spirits involves the community in high social costs and the Government has for some time had increases in the duties on those products under consideration. We now propose an increase in the duties on potable spirits equivalent to 3c a nip, effective immediately, to yield an estimated $39m in 1974-75 and $43m in a full year; and an increase in the duties on cigarettes and other tobacco products, equivalent to 4c on a packet of 20, effective immediately also, to yield an estimated $61m in 1974-75 and $67m in a full year. The Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns) representing the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Murphy) will be giving details shortly. Before leaving the taxation area I also foreproceed steadily and soberly with its plans to shadow one tax measure which we shall introduce in the 1974-75 Budget but in respect of which I am not in a position to announce details tonight. I refer to a proposal for a capital gains tax. Work has been proceeding on the many complexities involved for some months now. The tax as finally devised will be a carefully considered and fair one. Restraint of Expenditure Apart from tax and other measures to restrain private expenditure, the Government acknowledges that public expenditure must also be restrained. As the Prime Minister said at the Premiers' Conference, we are anxious to see that there is continued substantial progress with the programs we have been implementing, especially in such vitally important fields as education and health. job of imitating Gough. member for Barker will remain silent. I will not warn him again. recognised that it would not be feasible, in the circumstances, to achieve in 1974-75 the rates of progress with all our programs to which earlier planning and expectations have been pitched. I reiterate that tonight-wit h a number of them we will have to accept a slower rate of implementation than we had been hoping for. Let me be clear. an example for you next week. The Government does not deviate from its determination to proceed steadily and soberly with its plans to build an Australia in which life will be richer (Honourable members interjecting) Mr PeacockI think your speech writer is setting you up. resume his seat. If honourable members wish to hear the speech, they will have to remain silent. I will not ask the honourable member for Kooyong to cease interjecting; I warn him now. I call the Treasurer. does not deviate from its determination to build an Australia in which life will be richer and opportunity more freely and equitably available. But the Government accepts that its plans must be realised with a timing consistent with the needs of sound economic management. These matters will be examined more fully in the context of the 1974-75 Budget but I now announce decisions which are an earnest of our resolution. The expenditure restraints we have required of the States will be fully matched by our own, including some in areas which we regard as vital to our long-term social objectives. First, we propose to reduce the immigration program for 1974-75. Subject to existing commitments, we shall be aiming for a total intake of not more than 80,000, of which assisted immigration would be not more than 40,000that is, approximately 10,000 less than last year. Secondly, in the policy speech last April reference was made to our plans to embark on a major pre-school and child care program at a cost then estimated at $130m in this financial year. This initiative reflected the high priority that we have consistently attached to the meeting of needs in this area-needs , I might say, which had been neglected almost entirely before.

Given these delays, as well as the now extreme need to restrain the further growth of government spending, the Government has reluctantly decided to postpone until 1975-76 the commencement of the full-scale program. We will, of course, fully honour the commitments that we have already entered into under the interim pre-school and child care schemes, and which alone could call for an outlay of about $34m in this financial year. Investigations currently in train may lead to the provision of further funds during the year. I come lastly to the question of the means test. When this Government came to office, we undertook to abolish the means test on age pensions in the life of the Parliament and we took the first step last year to give effect to this undertaking. We planned to take a further step this spring. first step. will listen patiently we will get to the result quicker. member for Warringah will remain silent. I will not speak to him again.

This temporary deferment will reduce prospective expenditure thisfinancialyear by some $45m. The difficult economic circumstances which we face, however, do not allow us to shed our responsibility as a Government to those with slender resources who inevitably are hardest hit by inflation, namely, the recipients of social service pensions and benefits. Moreover, I am conscious of the fact that the recent elections, which were forced on us by the obstructionary tactics of the Opposition in the Senate, have caused the Budget to be delayed a month. If we pursued the normal course, pensioners would be deprived for that time of the benefit of the increased rates. Accordingly, the Government has decided to increase the levels of pensions and benefits now by $5 a week in the standard or single rate and $6 a week in the combined married rate. These increases bring the standard rate pension to almost 25 per cent of estimated seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings in the June quarter 1974. The increased rates will become payable from the first pension pay-day after the legislation receives Royal Assent. The increases will apply to age, invalid and widows pensions, supporting mothers benefit, sheltered employment and rehabilitation allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, repatriation service pensions, repatriation war widows pensions, and to recipients of tuberculosis allowances. In accordance with our established policy, we shall again review pension rates and benefits in the autumn of 1975. The cost of these increased benefits will be $340m in 1974-75 and $355m in a full year. My colleague, the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) will introduce the necessary legislation shortly. Protection of Employment The Government is satisfied that the approach it is adopting to the inflationary problem is the only one open to it. It recognises, however, that it is operating with instruments of policy which cannot discriminate finely. It will be necessary to ensure that no unnecessary waste ensues. The fact that the instruments of policy are necessarily somewhat rough and ready means that, for a time, the growth of activity is likely to fall off. In those circumstances I need hardly say that we shall take all possible steps to cushion the effects of the economic forces involved upon those affected and to alleviate any unavoidable distress that may arise. The major retraining programs now being brought into being by the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) will be one element in that process. The national employment and training system is a broad and flexible scheme that can be geared to meet and integrate the needs of individuals and the conditions of the labour market. The scheme is designed to apply, for example, to persons rendered redundant and to persons whose employment prospects are affected by residence in an area where employment opportunities are limited or declining.",62,Inflation

I problems in the field of wage determination present the following paper: is the upward course of prices. It was for that reason that one of the first steps we took after coming to office in December 1972 was to move towards the establishment of a much greater degree of price surveillance-princip ally, though not solely, through the setting up of the Prices Justification Tribunal. The Bill adjourned. which is now before the Parliament indicates enhance the role of the Tribunal further. As the Prime Minister said in his statement to the Premiers, the Prices Justification Tribunal can do only so much. Nonetheless, we now propose to invite the Tribunal to scrutinise with care price claims that are based on wage costs in excess of awards; where profit margins exceed those operating in 1972; wherefirmsare unwilling to absorb reasonable ment in efficiency; where prices are expected expenditure; or where selling costs, including advertising, appear excessive. As a means of bringing some further indirect pressures to bear upon prices, the Government will press ahead with its trade practices legislation. That legislation will outlaw, without scope for exemption, agreements between suppliers providing for the fixing or controlling of prices. Other kinds of agreements and arrangements restricting competition also will be generally prohibited. Conclusion I have sought tonight to make clear the Government's deep concern about current inflationary trends and its determination to act to bring them under control. To do so will require a balanced program designed to have an effective impact but which can readily be adjusted to the changing needs of the emerging situation. In our forthcoming budgetary deliberations we shall be seeking to shape such a program. In doing so, we -Inflation-'Ministeria l Statement, 23 July 1974.

I commend the proposals. Debate (on motion adjourned. POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES BILL 1974 Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading Special Minister of State) (8.47)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. At the Premiers Conference in Canberra on 7 June 1974 the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) announced that there would be substantial increases in postal and telecommunications charges. These are required to ensure that the rates which customers pay for Post Office services are sufficient to cover costs and also provide a surplus which can be re-invested to help meet the growing demand for service. Details of these proposed adjustments are contained in 2 Bills. Comments on the main proposals follow. For convenience details are set out in the schedules now available to honourable members. In the main, the effective date of variations is 1 August 1974. This Bill is to amend the Post and Telegraph Rates Act in respect of postal and telegraph charges. Another Bill will amend the Post and Telegraph Act and associated regulations. Certain miscellaneous charges will be adjusted by administrative action. Post Office Trading Results Although the Post Office's commercial accounts for the year ended 30 June 1974 are not available at this stage, it appears from preliminary estimates that the overall result was a break-even position only. At current tariffs, the Post Office loss could exceed SI00 million in 1974-75. ln common with business undertakings throughout Australia, costs have risen because of higher wages, increases in material prices, and improvements in conditions of service, especially for recreation leave and superannuation. That proportion of costs which cannot be absorbed by productivity improvements needs to be passed on to customers. Major changes in superannuation liability have occurred. In 1971 it was decided to increase the Government's share of pensions and in 1972 the previous Government appointed Professor A. H. Pollard to inquire into methods of adjusting Commonwealth superby Dr Edwards) annuation benefits. Resulting from his recommendation, the Superannuation Act 1973 provided for staff pensions to be adjusted by 1.4 times the percentage increase in the consumer price index. These actions increase future payments to past and present Post Oflice employees; so there must be a sharp increase in Post Office payments for superannuation liability. Post Office payments for superannuation liability increased from $49m in 1972-73 to $104m in 1973-74, and provision for payment of $130m has been made in the Post Office budget for this year. One important change is being made to the financial structure of the postal service, which will offset in part some of the cost increases. As recommended by the Australian Post Office Commission of Inquiry, it is intended to write off accumulated postal losses as at 30 June 1974. This will reduce the postal service's interest bill by about $17m in 1974-75. Much of theses losses has arisen because charges were set too low in relation to costs by decisions of the previous Government for economic or political reasons: Because interest has been payable on losses there is a spiral process which must be broken if the postal service is to be placed on a reasonable footing for the future. It is generally accepted that the Post Office should finance a significant proportion of postal and telecommunications expansion. The report of the Vernon Commission recommends that 50 per cent of fixed asset expenditure should be financed from internal sourcesprofits and provisions for depreciation and long service leave. This enables the Post Office to meet demand for service at a higher level",64,Inflation

Standard articles in envelopes tionary measure to restrict Post Office borrowings in 1974-75 to the same amount as in 1973-74-$385m . The effect of the proposed higher charges on the consumer price index is marginal; it is estimated at about 0.2 per cent in 1974-75. With the proposed charges and likely increases in wage rates, a profit of about $60m is forecast, which is more comparable with the $60m earned in 1971-72, and the $41m in 1972-73. Post Office Tariff Structure Last year the Government made important changes in the Post Office tariff structure by tackling concessional and uneconomic areas of Post Office activity which provided hidden subsidies to selected areas of the community. It is unfortunate that some of the Government's efforts to phase out concessions were obstructed, particularly the registered newspaper and periodical category which will lose about $9m in 1974-75. This loss continues to -be met by other Post Office customers who must pay more than they should, on cost grounds, for the services they use. In these proposals attention is given to public telephone and telegraph facilities, both of which it is appreciated provide important community services. The public telephone local call fee was last varied in 1963 and public telegram rates in 1970. It is necessary for these to be adjusted to take into account cost increases since those years and thereby to reduce the loss which must be covered by other customers. For many years up to 1964 the rental for government and business telephone services was higher than for residential services. This recognised that the telephone service is far more valuable to the. business subscriber than to the private subscriber. The businessman also has the advantage of claiming the telephone as an expense for taxation purposes. It is considered that these reasons are still valid and that it would be equitable to re-introduce a higher rental for business and government services than for residential and other services. The practice of differential rentals is followed in many other countries including Britain, Canada, the United States of America and New Zealand. In the postal service, also, an important change is being made in the tariff structure. The traditional letter and other articles categories, based on contents, will be replaced by standard postal articles and nonstandard postal articles, based on shape and size which are the major determinants of conforming to the Australian Standards Association specification are the cheapest for the Post Office to handle, both in manual and machine systems because of their convenient size and shape, and should attract the cheapest postage rate for the ordinary mail. The variations to telephone and telegraph charges, detailed in the. schedules, are expected to raise $]09m in 1974-75. Service Connection Fees and Telephone Rentals In adding a telephone service to the network the cost involved well exceeds $2,000 on average, ranging from more than $1,600 in the capital cities to over $3,600 in country areas and even in excess of $9,000 in rural areas. At present levels the contribution which the connection fee makes towards the cost involved is too small. When a product or service is priced well below its cost it leads to an artificially high demand for it. For a Post Office service, the cost of meeting that demand makes inequitable inroads into the national resources available to meet total community needs. Connection fees are therefore being increased from $60 to $80 for new applicants where new plant is necessary to give service and from $30 to $40 where an existing subscriber moves to another address and new plant is required. No increases are proposed where the line and equipment are 'in place'. The charges are estimated to increase receipts by about $5.5m in 1974-75. For telephone rentals, as indicated, differential rates are to be applied to government and business services compared with residential and other services. Government and business rentals will increase by $20 to $75 per annum and residence and other rentals by $10 to $65 per annum. Uniform rentals between metropolitan and country areas were introduced last year and, having regard to the higher costs of providing service in country areas than in metropolitan areas, the Government intends to continue with that principle. Metropolitan rentals were last increased 3 years ago. The rental adjustments will raise about $54m in 1974-75. Telephone Call Charges The local call fee will be increased from 4.75c to 6c per call. The local call fee was last altered in 1971. This increase will not reflect directly into trunk call charges where, with one exception, increases for day time calls are confined to between 3.5 per cent and 5.3 per cent. The exception concerns day rate calls over more than 645 kilometres-40 0 miles-wher e the increase is 26 per cent. There are as many reductions in trunk call charges as there are increases. The reductions range from 3 per cent up to 40 per cent. At night, the shortest distance trunk calls, up to 50 kilometres, will cost only 6c-that is the local call fee-for each 3 minutes if subscribers dial the calls themselves. The charge for such a call in the day time will also be reduced by about 20 per cent to 12c. The outer metropolitan areas of capital cities will receive great benefit from these reductions but there will be considerable benefit to country people also. A statement illustrating the benefits of these reductions in the various electorates is available to honourable members. If trunk call customers require their calls to be connected by a Post Office telephonist when they could dial the calls themselves, extra costs are incurred by the Department and it is reasonable to expect callers to pay extra for the personalised service. The fee for this service is being increased from 20c to 30c a call but even so the additional costs will not be met. Revenue from these increases in charges is estimated to be about $41m in 1974-75. Public Telephone Call Charges The fee for a local call from a departmental public telephone has been 5c since 1963. That charge is altogether uneconomic, taking into into account the high costs of new equipment incorporating anti-vandalism measures and the high costs of maintenance and repairs to damaged telephone cabinets and instruments. Even at the new rates, costs will not be covered. The new charges will not be effective until public telephones are converted to operate on 10c coins and this will take 12 months or so. Public telephones are used by a lot of people who do not have a telephone of their own. However, it is not reasonable that these users of public telephones should pay less than telephone subscribers who also have to pay rental for their service. Average weekly wages have risen by 130 per cent since 1963 and the increase in the public telephone fee is reasonable on the basis of that comparison. Similarly, Sydney bus and Melbourne tram fares have increased by 100 per cent over that period and the Sydney and Melbourne newspapers have increased by between 90 per cent and 140 per cent. Because of technical design most of the 30,000 public telephones would have to be replaced if they were to operate on a fee between 5c and 10c. Costs would exceed SlOm and a substantial lead-time would be involved. Telegrams Since the present rates were set in 1970, wage rates for operating staff have increased by over 50 per cent and there have also been considerable improvements in conditions of service for staff. Each telegram handled currently means a loss of about $1.50 and that level of subsidy by users of other services or by the general community cannot be allowed to continue. The increases in telegram chargesabout 50 per cent-wil l reduce but far from eliminate the present loss. The fee for lodging a telegram by telephone or teleprinter is also being increased from 10c to 15c due to increase in labour costs. The increases in telegram charges will raise about $2.5m in 1974-75. Telex Call Charges This service is akin to the STD telephone service but uses teleprinters as the means of communication. The present call charges have been in force for 3 years and an increase from 6c to 7 c per meter registration is being made. The extra revenue is estimated to be nearly $lm in 1974-75. Telephone Directory Entries (White Pages) The present rates for block type entries and additional information inserted at the request of subscribers were set in 1967. Directory layouts are being changed progressively from this year to provide clearer presentation of subscribers' entries-ye t requiring less paperand a more appropriate structure of charges for special entries being introduced. This is a completely separate matter to the rates for entries in the pink and yellow pages, the space in which is sold by private advertising contractors. Although revenue from this sector is estimated to increase by 50 per cent overall if present entries are retained, individual subscribers will be affected to varying degrees. They will, of course, have the opportunity to alter entries to reduce cost if they so desire. The adjustments are expected to result in additional revenue in 1974-75 of $0.3m. Miscellaneous Telephone Facilities Last year, it was indicated that certain miscellaneous equipment and services were being provided at unprofitable rates. Some charges were increased but the new rates even then barely covered costs; others were not increased at all. Adjustments now being made affect installation alteration charges for extension telephones, intercommunication equipment, alarm equipment, etc. and rentals for extension telephones and certain private manual branch exchanges. The adjustments will bring in about $5m in 1974-75. Postal Services Turning to the postal service, it is expected that the increased charges will bring in $37m in 1974-75. Letters and Other Articles The basic rate of 7c is being increased to 9c, irrespective of weight for those items contained in the most commonly used envelopes. These will be known as standard postal articles and they currently comprise about 92 per cent of all letters and 16 per cent of Other Articles. A standard postal article will be any item of mail between the dimensions 90 millimetres by 140 millimetres and 120 millimetres by 235 millimetres, having an oblong shape with a ratio of width to length of 1 to not less than 1.414 and with a maximum thickness of 5 millimetres. These dimensions apply at present to mail carried by air within Australia at normal rates of postage under Operation Post-Haste. There is no weight limit for standard postal articles so that such letters the benefit of the concession rates for Cateover 20 grams will pay reduced postage, 9c instead of 15c. Non-standard postal articles will be charged not apply if deliveries to subscribers or purfor according to their weight. The4 weight chasers are made for payment by private desteps are the same as those now applying for livery organisations competing with the Post Other Articles-that is, 50, 100, 250 and 500 Office. This proposal does not affect delivery grams. The basic rate becomes 10 cents, the by the members or staff of an organisation or subsequent ones being 20, 30 and 40c. by newsagents. Standard postal articles will continue to be carried by air where this will speed delivery. Airmail rates apply for non-standard items. To allow a change-over period in which reflect more closely the value of pre-sorting, stocks of non-standard stationery can be run with much less emphasis on overall volumes. down, up to the end of 1974 non-standard The cheapest rates will apply to bags of mail enveloped items up to 50 grams may be posted all for one postcode. The standard postal at standard article postage rates although they will be forwarded by surface mail. The additional receipts in 1974-75 from these categories will be $23m. Domestic Parcels Rates will be increased and the pricing structure changed to provide a more evenly stepped tariff of a base fee plus a per kilogram charge. A more realistic arrangement of scales 3, 4 and 5 has been made to reflect the distances involved and the conveyance costs incurred. Compensation up to $10 will now be paid for parcels damaged in the post. This change will improve the competitiveness of the service and will be welcomed by customers. Registered Publications No further increases in the postage rates for CategoryA or CategoryB publications are proposed beyond those already prescribed in existing legislation to apply from 1 March 1975. However, rates are being increased for CategoryC from 1 March 1975, again recognising that standard articles are the cheapest to handle. A more gradual scale of charges is provided for items over 100 grams. Educational newspapers and periodicals published by non-profit professional and employer organisations, transferred to CategoryC on 1 March 1974 will be transferred back to CategoryB from 1 August 1974. Currently, some mailers are paying private delivery organisations in competition with the Post Office to deliver their publications, particularly in high density areas, and are using the Post Office for the uneconomic areas. It is considered that the mailer should not have gory A or B without giving the Post Office the business for the more economic parts of its network. From1 March 1975, these rates will Bulk Presorted MailA new basis of charging will be adopted to article concept and an improved progression in charges according to weight over 100 grams have been incorporated. Special Services Increases are proposed for the unprofitable special services such as registered mail and certified mail, with higher compensation coverage. Increases in the fees for private boxes, bags and receptacles are also proposed tives, postal tariffs would need to be increased with effect from 1 April next year for existing at the rate of 15 per cent per annum and services. The higher fees are to operate from telecommunications charges at 7 per cent per 1 August 1974 for new services. An annual annum. These proposals are in excess of those registration fee of $10 for business reply perfigures, being 22 per cent and 17 per cent, mits is also proposed. Overseas Mail The standard item concept has not been in time it seems likely that labour costs in introduced into the overseas service because 1974-75 will be about 25 per cent higher the Universal Postal Union Convention rethan in 1973-74, compared with the 12± per quires the categories of letters and other articles cent assumed previously by the Post Office to be used for international mail.

Money Transfer ServicesA flat fee of 60 cents for amounts up to to a greater degree than formerly, as with $200 is to apply for all ordinary domestic other business undertakings.

181,Mr Lynch (Flinders,"Deputy Leader ofAs the Treasurer is aware, Governments in such countries as the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada have had the benefit of conclusions drawn by various committees of inquiry prior to introducing this type offinanciallegislation. The Opposition believes that the operations of the legislation before the House should be kept under continuing review. 1 believe it would be appropriate for the Treasurer, after consultation with the Reserve Bank to present a detailed report to the Parliament on this legislation after its first year of operation. Finally, I refer to the amendments which are proposed by the Opposition. They are, I believe, constructive and positive initiatives. They in no way seek to interfere with the effective functioning of the legislation. Each amendment will, of course, he considered during the Committee stage of the Bill. My remarks during this second reading stage are directed towards the substantive amendments we propose. We seek to include a new Division3 ot the Bill whioh deals with lending policies. The existing clause 14, sub-section (6) provides that the Reserve Bank may not make a determination in respect of the provision of finance to a particular person. We propose to extend that prohibition so as to include particular persons or a particular transaction or transactions. This amendment, although of a technical nature, we believe, provides an important safeguard against the abuse of this clause. We propose an additional sub-section to clause 14 to prohibit a determination being made, either deliberately or inadvertently, which would force a financial institution to cease operating in a particular area of finance or to operate in an area in which it had not generally operated previously. This is an important amendment. Non-bank financial institutions have developed in response to the need for specialised financing techniques in specific areas. Their financial skills and techniques on which their continued operations rely are highly developed but cannot necessarily be transferred to deal with the differing requirements of other areas of finance. We seek to amend clause 15 to provide that the Reserve Bank may make differing interest rate determinations in respect of building societies in particular States of the CommonThe amendment put forward by the Opposition wealth. In the absence of any amendment, the falls short of the guarantees advocated by the Reserve Bank would be forced to make comPrime Minister and nor does it equate with mon determinations for all building societies. 'lender of lost resort' facilities. It does, howBuilding societies operate, due to statutory ever, provide the Reserve Bank with the 11284/74-R-[18 ] requirements, on a State rather than a national basis. Their interest rates are already regulated by a majority of State Governments. It has been historically demonstrated that, for a variety of reasons, building societies in some States are able to attract funds at rates less than in other States. There is no discretion for the Reserve Bank to make interest rate determinations on a selective basis. This would penalise building societies-and home buyers -in some States. Interest rates could be unnecessarily high in some States, thereby adding costs to the home-owner, and too low in other States, resulting in insufficient funds to meet demand. The Bill, as the result of a Government amendment, provides for the Treasurer, after consultation with the Reserve Bank, to exempt a corporation from the application of any determination if he considers that the public interest and the existence of special circumstances justify his so doing. It is intended that this provision be used where unforeseen difficulties arise pursuant to the application of a determination. We agree generally with this approach but propose a further amendment to remove the authority from the Treasurer and to place it solely with the Reserve Bank. I refer, in this instance, to Opposition amendment number 5. Opposition amendment number 7 provides for an additional sub-clause to clause 25. The effect of the amendment is to authorise the Reserve Bank to use, in respect of building societies, the powers contained in section 8 of the Reserve Bank Act. This section permits the Reserve Bank to make loans, guarantees and so on. It is in the public interest to ensure that the Reserve Bank has the capacity to protect building societies should there be a serious threat of insolvency arising from the Reserve Bank's own determinations under Part IV of the legislation. In drafting this amendment the Opposition had in mind a statement made in this House by the Prime Minister on 23 May 1973, when he said, in part: It would be a very proper thing for this Parliament now to see that such basicfinancialinstitutions as building societies are equated much more in their operations to banks-that is, we should guarantee their security and in return they should pursue the public interest in their lending policies. capacity to assist building societies should the bank consider it to be warranted. We propose to amend clause 31. The effect of this amendment is to make it mandatory for the Reserve Bank to consult the associations or other bodies representing the companies under the Act prior to making a determination. As the Bill stands, the Reserve Bank is required to consult only 'from time to time as it considers desirable*. We believe it is vital different Bill. It contains a number of amendfor proper consultation to take place between the Reserve Bank and the companies involved if the policies adopted are to be sound and effective. The final substantive amendment to which I wish to refer, provides for the addition of a series of new sub-clauses to clause 22. Its effect is to ensure an adequate opportunity for the Parliament to examine, and debate if necessary, regulations proposed by the Government pursuant to this legislation. The effect of this amendment is to require regulations pursuant to the legislation to be implemented by the procedure of affirmative resolution. That is, no regulation will have effect until such time as both Houses have passed a resolution of affirmation. This procedure has not previously operated in the Australian Parliament but it does operate in respect of certain legislation in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom the legislation in respect of banks and non banks generally provides for what are termed subordinate 'orders' and 'regulations' to be made subject to annulment. There is, however, one important exception. In the case of the sums in excess of the statutorilyprescribed limit which the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies may allow building societies to loan a customer in any one year, his order to this effect must be approved by resolution of each House.

Finally, it must be emphasised that the Opposition would have substantially amended the Bill introduced by the Treasurer in 1973. The Bill before the House is, of course, a ments, endorsed by the Opposition, which arose following consultation between the Treasurer and the non-Bankfinancialinstitutions concerned. We welcome the Treasurer's decision to revise the legislation and trust that the amendments which will be moved during the Committee stage will be accepted as positive and responsible initiatives. Dr GUN (Kingston) (9.33)-If a government is to exercise responsible control over 'the national economy it is absolutely vital that it be clothed with the power it needs to take any measure which it sees as appropriate at any particular time. The Financial Corporations Bill, which we are examining fonight, will provide the Government with a further option to those powers which it already possesses. It does not possess this option at present. This measure is long overdue. This Bill will extend fhe present powers which the Government, through the Reserve Bank, has over the banks to the non-bank financial institutions. It does not follow that the Government will bring in a whole range of direct controls over the non-bank financial institutions, any more than the existing powers have resulted in direct controls over the banks. But it is important that the powers are there to be used judiciously if and when necessary. In the 1940s, when the then Labor Government introduced similar powers over the banks repeal the Act at all. I suppose the opposition future some appropriate complementary legisof the Liberal Party at the time was the lation will be brought in to provide similar natural human fear of change. The change, controls over them. of course, was essential and eventually it was accepted by all political parties in Australia as being essential. There is no question that may be effective in generating an adequate after this measure we 'are debating tonight degree of economic welfare. But this is only has been adopted everyone will come to accept a general rule. The trouble is that markets in that it too is a normal and quite proper power general are not free. I think nearly all econofor a central government to have in controlling mists now subscribe to that view. Even the the non-bank financial institutions.

The Opposition says that it supports it. ative economist in this Parliament and perhaps But it was dn power for many years-mor e the most conservative economist this country than 20 years-and it did nothing about it. has ever seen, I think would agree that some I presume that it was the same fear of change degree of public regulation over the private which dominates all Liberal governments sector is essential.

It is a good example of mine a national minimum wage to ensure that the inertia which characterises all Liberal all workers are guaranteed the necessities of governments. In the recent months since this legislation was first mooted, considerable efforts have been made by the various financial institutions, which I shall call fringe banks, to persuade the Government to abandon the legislation. The hire purchase companies, not surprisingly, have expressed their outright opposition. Other institutions, seeing the writing on the wall, have each asked for special consideration. The permanent building societies, for instance, have said: 'Go ahead with the measure but leave us out because we are a special case'. The acceptance houses have put forward a rather extraordinary proposition. On the one hand they say that they should be excluded from the legislation, but on the other hand they want the whole field of intercompany loans brought within the legislation. My view, if I make any criticism of the legislation, is that it does not go far enough. I believe it should include the inter-company market. I believe, as I implied in a question I asked the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) the other day, that the legislation should include life insurance companies within its ambit. If they are not to be included I hope that in the As a general rule, the free market forces right honourable member for Lowe( Mr McMahon), who is being unusually rowdy this life. Everybody accepts that unfettered private enterprise can and does result in monopoly or its opposite, excessive fragmentation. These matters undoubtedly require government intervention, although there may be legitimate disagreement about the type of in-, tervention there ought to be. Certainly, the Australian Country Party believes in the distortion of market forces. Indeed, that is what the Country Party is all about. The plethora of rural subsidies and the granting of loans at subsidised interest rates to rural producers at the expense of everybody else in the community, of course, are completely orthodox to a Country Party man. I notice that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch) said earlier that a Liberal-Country Party government would introduce a completely market-orientated monetary policy. It is interesting to listen to that statement in the light of the history of the Liberal-Country Party Government which interfered with the exchange rate to maintain it at an artificially low parity. There are a number of other examples of such policies. For instance, it is only since the Labor Government has been in office that the banks have been free to operate in the open market in dealing with negotiable certificates of deposit. This is a restriction that was taken off them under the Labor Government. In fact, it is only since the Labor Government came to office that we have had a truly market orientated capital market in Australia. Similarly, distortions occur in the area where fringe banks operate, so it is essential that we have public regulation of these institutions! The most topical example of where direct controls over fringe banks are needed is the rates of interest at present being paid and received by hire purchase companies. I refer particularly to the happenings in the financial market after the Government's activities in the securities market last year and earlier this year. Last September the Reserve Bank began vigorous selling of government securities at a reduced price. Following this, Commonwealth cash loans were issued also at an increased rate. The effect of this was to divert funds out of the private sector into government securities. I rebuff the argument put earlier by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch). This was a proper action to take to reduce the demand for housing in the private sector back to the level where supply was able to ""cope with demand-for building resources-and also to try to divert resources in into the welfare housing field and through the housing money made available through the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. This action has been successful in reducing the rate of approvals to a level with which the building industry can cope. I believe it will soon also be reflected in a levelling off of housrine particularly to the excessive number of ' ing costs. However, there was an undesirable side effect in that building societies had to raise their interest rates to compete for the limited funds available. Some increased interest rates were passed on to people paying off existing mortgages. The Government successfully persuaded most building societies to restrain their increased interest rates to a maximum of one per cent. However, because of the lack of any direct controls over the fringe banks, the Government was quite powerless to do anything about the hire purchase companies. The result was that the hire purchase companies subsequentlyfloatednew loans at substantially increased rates of interest which must eventually, of course, be passed on to the borrowers. So the situation was that the interest rates of the building societies were controlled by voluntary co-operation-tem porarily anyway-bu t no such restraint was applied to the hire purchase companies.' Of course, if the Government had tried to' get them to apply restraint; it would not have been possible for them to do so. In contrast to the building societies the hire purchase companies are primarily profit-making institutions. The hire purchase companies, as a result of this lopsided situation, were able to outbid the building societies which have now started to find the situation very difficult. Some have recently announced that their interest rates will have to go up further. I believe that with the passage of this legislation the Government could limit the interest, rates of hire purchase companies and the building societies then would be able to compete for funds at a lower level of interest rates. I believe that this is an outstanding example of the need for judicious use of direct controls. This would not be the long term solution, but at the right time and in the right place direct control of interest rates could have improved the lot of many home owners and, beyond that, the situation that the Government was faced with last year. Perhaps the most important area in which this Bili could be effective is in the control of the type of lending activities carried out-that is, the qualitative control. These are areas which cry out for government control. The problems which have occurred from the building activities of financial corporations have become a national scandal. I am referhigh rise office blocks being built in our capital cities. Large amounts of building materials and labour are being wasted on private office space. It was interesting to see even the spectacle in a recent television program of the director of a large building corporation admitting that the high rise development that is taking place now is far in excess of present needs. But he still said that it was a good financial investment. No government can tolerate that situation when lahour and materials are urgently needed for building houses. The direction of investment into areas of greatest priority is, therefore, a most important result of this Bill. If the interests of private enterprise do not coincide with the national interest, the lending institutions will have to be prevailed upon. I know that definition of the term 'national interest' is very elusive. Frequently when governments refer to the national interest they really mean their own political interest. Surely nobody could quibble with the proposition that building houses is much more important than building empty office blocks. Up to the present time the only body which has exercised any responsible attitude to what type of buildings should go up has been the Builders Labourers Federation with its highly commendable policy of preserving Sydney's heritage. I should like to see the Builders Labourers Federation exert a similar influence to ensure that priorities in the building industry go towards building houses and not office blocks. This Bill will enable the Government to have the same control over capital investment in Australia. I believe such government control is quite justifiable. I believe it is quite rates to drop. However, what I do fear is that justifiable for the working people of Australia, such as members of the Builders Labourers Federation, to have a similar say in the direction of investment in AustraUa. I cannot see that it should be the exclusive prerogative of those people who own capital in Australia to determine what should be the direction of investment. I abhor the fact that in doing this in the public interest, at the cost of their own welfare, members of the Builders Labourers Federation found that their organisation was deregistered. That is a fact which I deplore. I hope we will not see it perpetuated. As I have said, I regret that insurance companies have been excluded from this legislation because I believe that they are perhaps the main transgressors in the misallocation of resources in the building industry. I believe direct controls will be required to direct investment away from land. A major social problem has been the issuing of funds at high interest rates for people to purchase land for purely speculative reasons. The result has been to reduce the amount of land available for building houses and to drive up the cost of building blocks. I should like to add, however, that there are certain other urgent measures necessary to control land prices. I again ask the Government to give consideration to introducing a capital gains tax on land to be paid annually on the increased value of undeveloped land even if that increased value has not been realised at a sale. The fringe banks have expressed the view that all controls, where possible, should be voluntary. I agree with them. I think that perhaps the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) agrees also. It is quite clearly in the interests of the Government as well as the institutions concerned that controls should be obtained, as far as possible, by voluntary co-operation. In this way, we can avoid having to establish a bureaucracy to police the regulations. It would avoid the development of other institutions outside the ambit of the present Act or what I think is referred to by the 'in' group as disintermediation. However, it is important that the Government should have the power to enforce its monetary policy should that need arise. Perhaps one particular area will be when bond yields drop, which I hope will not be too for into the future, and when we find that there should be a tendency for interest when the monetary situation in this country can be eased, it will not be followed by the fall in interest rates which we would like to expect. I suppose it is a Uttle like what has happened with the revaluation of our currency; we found that the price of imports did not drop as it should have but merely that the importers were making a greater mark up. IfI recall correctly, under the Liberal Country Party Government in 1971 there was an increase in interest rates which was passed on to borrowers but when subsequently the bond rate was reduced the same reduction in interest rates was not at the time passed on to borrowers. That is the sort of action over which some sort of direct control is essential to ensure that that type of ratchet effect does not occur. In relation to the control of hire purchase companies, I believe we ought to examine the possibility of the Commonwealth Bank competing with private enterprise in hire purchase. I should like to see the Commonwealth Bank establish its own hire purchase subsidiary. The Commonwealth Bank, because of its highly competitive interest rates, has a beneficial influence on the conventional banking sector and in the field of housing in particular. 1 should like to see this precedent followed in the field of hire purchase. In bringing this measure in, the Government is not using the big stick. The open market will continue to operate as long as it is the servant of the people and not their master. It will act primarily in co-operation and consultation, and it will provide an invaluable instrument to all future governments in their control of the economy. It is worth mentioning that the Banking Act, which I suppose is really the model for the measure we are discussing now, was a sequel to an unsuccessful attempt by a Labor Government to nationalise the banks. It is accepted as conventional wisdom today that perhaps the ultimate weapon of nationalisation of the banks is no longer appropriate. However, I think that in the light of some events that have occurred in recent months consideration might have to be given to stronger measures in the control of the banking institutions. We had the disgraceful situation of lender of last resort facilities being available to the private banking sector but rather than swallow their pride and go to the Reserve Bank-if what the general manager of one of the private banks said or implied on television is to be believed-the banks went outside the Reserve Bank. Rather than use the lender of last resort facilities they borrowed elsewhere at higher rates of interest, probably at the expense of the other borrowers from the banks. If the banks are to behave in such an irresponsible fashion, certain sanctions will have to be considered by the Government. The ultimate weapon, of course, would be the direct nationalisation of the banking institutions. In conclusion, I support the Bill. I am pleased to note that the Opposition is generally supporting the Bill. I think the bipartisan attitude of the 2 sides on this measure shows that there is a difference as to whether governments get things done. We both agree with this measure. The Labor Government has done something about it. The Liberal and Country Parties, when they were in government, did nothing. question everyone must ask when considering this Bill is: Is it necessary or desirable? Before that, maybe it is prudent to state a case for the non-banking financial institutions. The somewhat changeable and notoriously wrong given, as he said tonight in the speech he made on the mini-Budget, to delusions-sai d in his second reading speech on the Financial Corporations Bill: There is no denying that these non-bank financial that we would not need this Bill to enable the institutions operating in a competitive environment Reserve Bank to supervise the non-banking can increase the efficiency of the financial sector in financial intermediaries if we lived in a world attracting funds and channelling them into the areas they are needed most He cannot have it both ways and ought to be committed to protecting those financial institutions which have, according to him, done so much good. I challenge the Treasurer's inaccurate statement that there is no disagreement that such intermediaries have significant potential to undertake activities which are inimical to an effective monetary policy. There is considerable disagreement, as I will indicate, and the Treasurer ought to identify those who agree with direct controls and with him. The Reserve Bank, when left free from political pressure, does not think direct controls over the non-hanking financial intermediaries are necessary. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Sir John Phillips, has said: The use of direct controls usually hinders the process of having the community'sfinancingdone by the most efficient means. In its 1972 annual report at page 38 the Bank said: Experience has shown that direct controls, although perhaps useful tools of policy over short periods, can diminish in effectiveness when applied continuously over long periods. Recognition of this by the Bank of England led to a series of reforms in 1971. An English professor, R. R. Hirst, speaking about this matter in an address to the winter school of the New South Wales branch of the Economic Society in 1972 said: Less emphasis is to be given to restrictions on lending to the private sector whether they are liquidity or qualitative constraints. The emphasis of monetary policy is to shift towards the control of broad monetary aggregates and to the associated level of structure of interest rates. The British Radcliffe Commission had this to say about suggestions to substitute a complex of direct controls for the traditional controls over the money supply: Such a prospect would not be welcome except as a last resort-no t mainly because of its administrative burdens but because the further growth of new financial institutions would allow the situation continually to slip from under the grip of the authorities. Speaking from long experience, I am sure that this view of direct controls is correct, and an understanding of its significance and importance is critically important when considering this Bill. Dr Coombs, the immediate past Governor of the Reserve Bank and now lam), shares these views. My own attitude is",80,Seamen S War Pensions And Allowances Bill No 2 1974

The Treasurer's statement that 'a review procedure conducted in the context an obvious and cheap debating trick to conBefore speaking about the amendments the I am sure the Liberal Party committee would vices of a Parliamentary Counsel available to me in drafting the amending regulations. A perusal of the second Bill now before the House shows that at least 3 amendments recommended by the Opposition have already been made. They are important. Their acceptance is welcomed. There is much left to be done. Based on the logic of the arguments, the Treasurer, Mr Lynch and I , have presented, the Opposition will propose . 5 substantial amendments to the 1974 Bill now before the House to ensure certain things. As my time is limited, I will move on to deal with the amendments proposed to the various clauses. We wish to ensure, amongst other things, that clause 32 is amended to add a sub-clause to require the Executive to have an 'affirmative resolution' passed by the Senate and House of Representatives before any regulation takes effect and, that regulations shall cease to have effect at the expiration of the period of 12 months after the date on which they took effect unless each House of the Parliament passes a resolution approving the continuation of the regulations. This provision does not apply to determinations by the Reserve Bank. For the reasons I have given this is unmistakably the most important change in a constitutional sense not only to ensure control of the Executive by the Parliament as an essential ingredient of representative government but also to prevent abuse of Executive powers and to practise the policy of open and honest government with Parliament acting as the means by which the public is informed and protected. The second amendment proposes that clause 14 relating to lending policies be amended to weaken The exclusion of any group would materially make it clear, to use the Treasurer's own words achievement of the broad objective of the legislation in the Explanatory Notes, that the regulations substantially more difficult to achieve. under sub-clauses (2) to (6) inclusive are reThat ignores the fact that the inter-company stricted to granting power to the Reserve Bank market has been left out of the Bill, as the to make 'determinations': '. . . only with honourable member for Kingston so easily, but respect to the volume or direction of lending', drawing improper conclusions, said.

The third amendment seeks to amend clause 15 to permit the Reserve Bank to make differand presently connected with the non-banking ent determinations relating to the receipt or financial institutions.

Our fourth amendspeech or who prepared the Bill that the introment has as its purpose to amend clause 18 duction of TCDs or NCDs and the freedom of the Bill to enable the Reserve Bank and for the trading banks to determine interest not the Treasurer to grant exemptions from rates on overdrafts in excess of $50,000, the application of the Reserve Bank's detertogether with the process of disintermediation minations relating to asset ratios, lending a word I have captured from the honourable policies and interest rates. The fifth amendment seeks to amend subclause (3) of clause 25 to honour the Prime Minister's promise made to the permanent building societies on 23 May 1973 that the Labor Government, to use the Prime Minister's words:'. . . should guarantee their security and in return they should pursue the public interest'. This will be done by specifically providing in the Bill for lender of last resort facilities under section 8 (c) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959-1973 to be made available to the permanent building societies which are covered by the proposed legislation. The Treasurer's statement in his speech of 1973 relating to this matter is sloppy and falsely argued. It fails to honour the Prime Minister's promise. It raises the following critically important political questions: Who runs the Government and is the Prime Minister to be humiliated and his promises dishonoured by the Treasurer whenever he or his advisers feel that their own hunches or inclinations are involved? There are two other amendments that I want to mention, however quickly. The first relates to clause 3, at page 2 of the Bill, and proposes that one of the objectives of the Act must be to provide an adequate level of finance for housing. The second relates to clause 31, at page 19 of the Bill which requires the Reserve Bank to have consultations. We propose that, in particular, consultations should take place before determinations are made. At page 8 of the speech to which I have referred the Treasurer said: the proposed legislation and could make the that this 'left out' part of the market is one which has been growing strongly and which is spreading its activities into many areas new to member for Kingston-wil l substantially restrict the activities of the inter-company market. At least I hope it will. I hope that finally it will bring them under control. I turn now to the lender of last resort facilities that are availahle under section 8 (c) of the Reserve Bank Act. It is well known to ithe Liberal Party's economic committee that lender of last resort facilities are not made available automatically to a trading bank or other organisation as of right. It has never been suggested that those facilities should be made availahle automatically to the permanent building societies or other organisations covered by the Act, as has been suggested by the Treasurer in his speech. Obviously, whoever wrote that part of his speech must have wanted to be blatantly obstructive or was ignorant both of the provisions of the Banking Act and of the accepted practice relating to lender of last resort facilities. In the remaining minute or so that I have in which to speak, I would like to put a proposition to the Government on behalf of the Opposition. I have already prepared and had circulated a number of amendments. I ask the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) to agree to their incorporation in Hansard. If that were to happen, we would then agree not to pursue the matter any further and would let the Bill pass the Committee stage and the third reading stage without opposition. leave granted for the incorporation of the amendments in Hansard? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)(1) Clause 3, page 2, line 3, after the word "" resources "", insert the following words: "" , the ensuring of an adequate level of finance for housing"". (2) Clause 3, page 2, at the end of the clause, add the following words: ""and determinations or directions shall not be made or given under this Act except for the purpose of achieving the object"".

Question resolved in the af&rmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That {he Bill be now read a third time. I shall be very brief in my remarks. I wish to explain to the House that, although the Opposition has not sought to debate this Bill in Committee, there are, as honourable members will be aware, a number of amendments of which we gave notice to the House in the course of the second reading debate. Those amendments were brought to the notice of honourable members by the right honourable discussion that will ensue in another place the Opposition will be pursuing those amendments. The fact that they have not been debated or pursued any further in this chamber does not indicate in any way that the Opposition will not push them and support them in the debate in the other House of this Parliament. This is a very important piece of legislation. The Opposition is concerned about the matters which have been identified in the amendments to the Bill which the right honourable member for Lowe has notified to the Parliament. They are amendments that we believe will contribute towards the more effective operation of this piece of legislation. It is for that reason that those amendments will be moved and pursued in the Committee stage of the debate in the other place. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. Adjournment Debates-Emergency Mousing -Australia n Wool Corporation-Whitlam Ministry-Primary ProducersUnemployment in Rural Areas Motion (by Mr Crean) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. not my intention to rise at this early hour in the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House, but I take the opportunity this evening to remark that the system which has operated in this House of closing off an adjournment debate at 11 o'clock is one which I think many honourable members have found to be workable. It will be recalled that when the system was proposed by the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) some reservations were expressed by certain honourable members, particularly on this side of the House, about the method of conducting the adjournment debate. The suggestion which appealed to me most and which I take this opportunity to present to the House is that in cutting off the debate strictly at 11 o'clock come what may-that is the position at present, pursuant to a resolution of the House-ther e is a danger that the last honourable member to speak in the debate will attack other honourable members or perhaps persons outside this House in a somewhat strong manner and not leave them any opportunity to reply. That is something which has worried many honourable members. I do not want to elaborate on that aspect, but I do want to place on record the fact that that sort of thing has happened on one or two occasions in the last 12 months. I hasten to say that I appreciate the fact that when honourable members put their names on the list which is kept on the table in front of the occupant of the chair they sometimes find that they are not the first or second person",90,Seamen S War Pensions And Allowances Bill No 2 1974

But I do think that anyone who wishes to launch a strong attack, particularly a rather personal one, ought to remember that the person on whom the attack is launched is entitled to make some sort of rebuttal. I do not think it is right that the matter should be allowed to stand over until the next day, if the attack is made on a Tuesday or Wednesday night, or the following Tuesday or Tuesday week if the attack is made on a Thursday night. I make that point because we have had one or two experiences of it in the recent past. I will not mention the name of any particular honourable member in relation to this subject. I conclude by saying that honourable members ought to remember that the adjournment debate closes at 11 p.m. and each ought to make arrangements with the occupant of the chair who normally is you, Mr Speaker, to see that he is not the last speaker and that he has left some time for someone to reply. like to bring before the House an issue of year there is a person or a family in desperate great moment in my electorate and, I believe, need of emergency accommodation. I point in many other electorates. I refer to the out to the House that these are only the matter of emergency housing. There is a need ones that we know about-thos e who have to define clearly what is meant by emergency actually come and asked for assistance. housing. When I use that term I am not referring to the acute housmg shortage for low income earners, although in my electorate that what this means in terms of human suffering. is a problem in itself. In the Dandenong area The investigation that was carried out by in the centre of the electorate there is the social workers and welfare organisations in longest waiting list in Victoria for housing the municipalities of Springvale, Dandenong commission homes.

We depend on hand be sleeping in the open, in parks and the like, outs. At no time at any level of government, if it were not for the magnificent work that except in sporadic cases by municipal councils, is being done at present by the voluntary social welfare agencies such as St Vincent de Paul even by professional social workers working after hours and by the churches. Only last FridayI was speaking to the monsignor in charge of the Dandenong parish. He confirmed thefindingsof people who had investigated this problem. He pointed out that only 2 days earlier he had received a knock on his door at 2 o'clock from someone seeking accommodation. The need is clearly established when we look at the figures supplied by the welfare groups in my electorate, again using the definition of emergency housing that I used before-meanin g a need for housing for the immediate night or the immediate week. The Dandenong Citizens Advisory Bureau has shown that in a period of one month, in October 1973, there were 23 requests for help. The Springvale Citizens Aid and Advisory Bureau has shown that in a period of 4 months there were 20 requests. The Doveton Social Work Office has shown that in a period of one year there were 30 requests. If we combine all those figures we see that in the I leave it to honourable members to equate centred in Dandenong, quite a large group of young people and families who come to I submit that the present situation is totally",91,Adjournment
189,Mr Oldmeadow (Holt) (10.20),"I should electorate of Holt almost every day of thehas there been an attempt to tackle the problem on a long term basis. I know that in my own electorate social workers have prepared a submission which was put to the Victorian Government but no action was taken. The submission highlights the fact that there is not available the right type of accommodation such as hostels, guest houses, low cost hotels and boarding nouses. It also highlights the present makehift solution whereby the individual has to ask for and accept charity. That situation can lead only to a loss of self-respect and independence. I believe that my electorate is not unique in having this serious problem, even if it is possibly more acute in my electorate than in many others. It is for this reason that I have brought the matter to the attention of the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr the research could well be done there. I comLes Johnson). In doing so I am well aware that, he as the Minister has been responsible for negotiation with, the States whereby allocations for welfare housing have been higher than ever before. I know that he has always pleaded the cause for those in greatest need. However, I put to the Minister the proposal that specific grants be made to the States for emergency housing. I believe that this is possible. It has been done in many areas such as education. This could be a co-operative effort at the 3 levels-certainl y with the States. Even if we do not go the whole way to start with at least pilot projects could be set up to try out such a scheme. I hasten to add that, if there were to be a pilot project, the electorate of Holt would be a suitable choice for a number of reasons. The first would be the severity of the problem that I have outlined. Virtually every night of the year there is one person or family who is in need of emergency accommodation. The second would be that, the groundwork has already been carried out in that electorate. Professional and lay workers in the field have met on a number of occasions. They have given considerable attention to this matter and as to how such a project could operate. They have set out the type of accommodation that is required, how it could be managed at a local level and the basic conditions of residency. I know that the Minister would agree that many difficulties would be involved in setting up a pilot project. Mr Les JohnsonI would like to see the submission. Minister a copy of the submission later. Finance for such a project has also been discussed. I believe that a person who receives help, although he may not be able to make a contribution at the time, should be expected to make some small payment retrospectivity. I stress that even a pilot scheme or a more widely based scheme is seen only as the short term answer. We know that there is a great need for research in this area. There is very little factual information in the community as to the problems which precipitate housing crises of the proportion about which I have been talking. AgainI submit to the Minister that the electorate of Holt would be an excellent place for such research to be done, possibly by the Monash School of Sociology which is right alongside my electorate. I believe that, with thc magnitude of the problem in my electorate, mend this matter to the Minister for his scrutiny and investigation and press for some action to be forthcoming in the future. to discuss the importance of the Australian Wool Corporation and the very important role that it plays in marketing Australia's most important export income earner. Wool is still Australia's most important export trading commodity and, according to legislation, the Australian Wool Corporation has been given the very important task of marketing this clip. I am concerned that some of the happenings of the past week could in some way discredit the reputation and the integrity of an organisation that is doing a tremendous job for the Australian wool industry, the wool growers within it and the people who depend on the industry for their living, whether shearers, people living in country towns or supporting the trade in one way or another. The Australian Wool Corporation assumes an importance not just to the industry and those depending upon it but also to Australia as a nation. The export income earning industries will undoubtedly assume an even greater importance to the Australian economy as time goes on and when we face all sorts of internal economic problems. Therefore, it is essential that nothing is done in what is a difficult world trading situation to disrupt or impair Australia's capacity to sell wool, wheat, meat, ores or any product that can earn foreign exchange on the overseas markets. The Australian Government has embarked upon what is a most ambitious social welfare program. Its education program alone is going to cost many",92,Adjournment

This Government will have to rely upon the export income earning industries perhaps more heavily than any government has relied upon them in the past. Of course, the attacks that have been made upon the people serving on the Australian Wool Corporation are to be deplored. I should like to read from the Wool Industry Act the section relating to the way in which the members of the Australian Wool Corporation are appointed. It states: 8 -(1. ) The Corporation shall consist of nine members, namely:(a) a Chairman; (b) four members to represent Australian wool growers; (c) one member to represent the Commonwealth; and (d) three other members. (2.) The members shall be appointed by the Minister, the Chairman being appointed as a full-time member and the other members being appointed as part-time members. (3.) Before appointing the members referred to in paragraph (d) of sub-section (1.) of this section, the Minister shall consult the Australian Wool Industry Conference. Honourable members should bear in mind that the Australian Wool Industry Conference is comprised of equal representation from the 2 major constitutent wool growing bodies in Australia-the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation. Those organisations elect in a truly democratic fashion representation upon each of the national bodies. It is from that membership that the Australian Wool Industry Conference is established. The Act continues: (4.) The members to represent Australian wool Chifley Government to serve on this very growers shall be appointed on the nomination of the important Commission. Who could charge that Australian Wool Industry Conference. '(5.) A member referred to in paragraph (d) of Minister because he may have had Country sub-section (1.) of this section shall be a person specially qualified for appointment by reason of Party affiliations? Here is a man who has experience in the marketing of wool or wool products, proved himself over a long period of years in the processing of wool or in the manufacture of to have capacity and knowledge of the Auswool products or by reason of other experience in tralian wool industry. He is a man who has commerce, finance, economics or science. (6.) The performance of the functions or the exercise of the powers of the Corporation is not affected life in more ways than one. I might say that by reason of there being a vacancy or vacancies in he happens to be the brother of a former Labor the membership of the Corporation.

Allegations that members Country Party stooge. He may have sympathy have been chosen because of political affiliafor the Australian Country Party but that is tion with the Australian Country Party are grossly unfair. In fact, I would not know what are the political affiliations of two of the members of the Corporation, nor do I care. However, I have a very high regard for the capacity and the ability of members to serve the Australian wool industry and Australia in this capacity. I want to give the House some idea of the qualifications that these gentlemen possess. Mr David Asimus has been a member of the Australian Wool Commission since 1970. He has been a Director of the Australian Wool Marketing Corporation since 1970. He attended St Paul's College, Sydney University, and won a Nuffield travelling agricultural scholarship to the United Kingdom. He is very highly regarded in the wool industry and in wool trade circles. Mr Reginald Vernon Sewell has been President of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation since 1964. ""He has been a member of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation Board since 1968. He was President of the Wool Secretariat of the Farmers' Union of Western Australia from 1962 to 1964. He was Executive Member of the Australian Wool Industry Conference, a member of the Australian Wool Commission from 1970 and a member of the Export Development Council since 1969. Mr Claude Dominic Renshaw has been a member of the Australian Wool Board since 1963.

This Party stands on its recorda proud record of serving the rural community of Australia.

We heard tonight another illustration of this but I am not permitted to speak on that matter. Some months ago we were concerned when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Whan) made a very strong move to buy in and try to cripple the meat industry. He tried to introduce some sort of fixed price system whereby the housewife could get meat at a reduced rate. This, of course, failed as far as the housewife was concerned but it could have been a major contributing factor to sapping the confidence of the meat industry as a whole.

Because of his policies in this House a few weeks ago this gentleman was rightly displaced. To my mind he has no right to be making some of the statements he has made, unless the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) is prepared to say that the former Minister has that right. The end of this article states: He warned that any Australian Ministers of State, public servants or Government workers would be sacked immediately if they sought to promote discrimination on the grounds of race, colour or creed. I do not know, but I am led to believe by Press statements and, I think, a statement by the Prime Mmister that Mr Grassby has been appointed as an ombudsman for migration in this country at a reported salary of $26,000odd. plus expenses. I realise that. No doubt expenses could be another amount in the vicinity of the amount I have just mentioned. I do not know. It all depends on the staff he has. I am told that he has offices in various parts of his former electorate. I do not know on what grounds he has those either.

We have had a homogeneous population and let us keep it that way. I recall visiting South East Asia not so many years ago with a parliamentary delegation. We were in Malaysia. The then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman met the delegation. I recall very vividly that this man, after discussing many subjects, said: 'Australia is very fortunate that it has no racial problems. I wish my country was in the same position as yours. My only recommendation to you people from Australia is never alter your policy'. That came from a very successful Prime Minister in that area. This matter concerns me as I know it concerns many thousands of people outside this chamber. It is all very well to say that we will have no discrimination; we will open the doors to all and sundry. But then, of course, sooner or later there will be discrimination. There has to be discrimination. To my mind it is completely unbelieveable for a former Minister of this Government to suggest that countries like Rhodesia are financing a racehate campaign. It is an irresponsible statement and one which I believe the Prime Minister should nip in the bud. He should explain to this House what it all means.

The situation in the textile industry in Wangaratta is not to be treated, as some honourable members see it, as a minor pocket of unemployment. There is a very serious principle involved in the causes leading to the dismissal of these people. The causes lie directly and squarely at the door of the Labor Government. It is through the actions of the Labor Government that the textile industry has insufficient demand for its products and. therefore, does not have the required demand for its work force. The decision made in July 1973 by the cedented and remarkable decision-to cut tariffs across the board by 25 per cent was the start of the rot. The announcement was welcomed by academics and people who have never produced anything in their lives, but it was regarded as a very sinister and disastrous decision by hard headed businessmen with the responsibility in Australia of employing people and producing the wealth of this country. The predictions they made in July are coming true and worse is yet to come. That decision started the rot, but on 1 March the Government announced the abolition of import quotas on textiles, particularly in Tespect of knitted and woven textiles. This allowed a flood of cheap imports from low cost countries to increase. How people in this country think that factories that have to pay employees $2.50 or $3 an hour can compete with people in low cost countries overseas paying their employees 20c or 30c an hour is beyond my comprehension. The present position in Wangaratta concerns people who have their homes there, people whose children are in the middle of a school year there and people who, together with their sons and daughters, comprise a vital part of the previously progressive, stable community of Wangaratta. They form a substantial part of the service clubs, youth movements, church congregations, sporting teams and sporting clubs in the City of Wangaratta. Is this Government going to uproot these people as was implied in the statement by the Minister for Labor and Industry( Mr Clyde Cameron) to the House last Thursday night? While referring to the key manpower policy initiatives under active consideration at the moment, he used these words: . . . a relocation assistance scheme to assist persons without reasonable local employment prospects to move to areas of greater employment opportunity. Is the Minister referring to .the people who have been dismissed from the mills and the textile industries in Wangaratta and other non-metropolitan cities or to people who have been dismissed from the meat works? Is this Government going to uproot these people and follow some socialist philosophy by moving people about like pawns on a chessboard? Those of us who represent non-metropolitan areas in this Parliament will not stand for that and neither should the members of the Government whose various spokesmen claim to represent rural areas and non-metropolitan areas in this Parliament. Where are those members of the Labor Party who boast that they represented areas outside the capital cities? Has there been one word from them about the disruption and the unemployment in areas outside the capital cities of this country which is being caused by Government action? Has there been one word from any of the Labor Party members on this matter? I have not heard one. I certainly think that country people will continue to show that they realise that members of the Labor Party, particularly those in the Ministry, are incapable of representing them in this Parliament. up a task force and having people sweeping the streets. objective.
