Of course, this will necessitate very considerable discussions with both organizations in order to effect the necessary economies, which will require a re-arrangement of services and a re-allocation of business. Discussions will also be necessary concerning new aircraft. When these matters have been fully considered a statement will, no doubt, be made concerning them.

It has been agreed that this subsidy will cost the Commonwealth £5,300,000 this year. It has also beenagreed by all conco-operate with the Commonwealth in cerned that it is undesirable that any more wheat than necessary should be used for stock feed.

I hope it will not be established that justice to any industry is dependent upon political manoeuvring.

I submit, witb great respect to you, that tbe Standing Orders do not forbid the asking of questions without notice in relation to individuals. They merely prohibit imputations against, persons in questions without notice. Nothing in the Standing Orders debars any honourable member from referring to an individual. StatesNotice must be given of Questions regarding computations have to be made and a great the character or conduct of individuals other than Ministers or Members of the House. Therefore, if a question does not make imputations concerning character or conduct, the fact that an individual is mentioned does not make it out of order. disallow all questions without notice which refer to any person. I think such questions should be asked upon notice. We have had excellent reasons in the past for ensuring that in the future such questions shall be placed on the notice paper. thc Minister for Health questions concerning the health of aborigines and the right honourable gentleman informed DIP that a Commonwealth survey of theii health problems was being made. I now ask him whether that survey has been completed, and whether the findings can be made available to the House and the public? orable member had asked those questions, a medical officers in charge of aborigines in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. I understand that the officers agreed to pool their knowledge.

It is an extremely complicated project and many deal of consideration must be given to various aspects of the undertaking. ter for Immigration a question relative to the urgent need for allocating more immigrant labour to rural industries. I understand that, under the Government's immigration programme, schemes are operated whereby secondary industry authorities are able to nominate immigrants to come to Australia on the basis of an agreement for employment for two years, and that the cost of the passage is met by the industry on the basis of repayment to the industry by the immigrants during the course of their two years' contract period. I understand also that if an immigrant does not carry out such a contract there is power to return him to the country from which he was brought. Those conditions provide some guarantee to the secondary industries concerned that immigrant workers will remain on the jobs for which they have been brought to this country. Is it possible for such an arrangement to be conference was held of the extended to cover the rural industries, so that people engaged in rural activities may have some guarantee that if they nominate immigrants, bring them to this country and pay the cost of their passages, they will be able to rely on their remaining in their employment for a period of two years? relation to what we term the "" special project procedure"" is as the honourable member has outlined it.

Tbe honourable member's suggestion is a useful one, and I cannot sec, off-hand, any consideration that would inako it impracticable. I shall be very glad to consider it. As I have said in this House on otlier occasions, the Government is most anxious to see a greater movement of immigrant labour into rural production, and if the honourable member's suggestion is adopted it may encourage rural employers to bring out more immigrant labour than has been the case in the past. for Immigration a question which periods, which have.not been developed by relates to charges for accommodation in the lessees? immigrant hostels. I refer to a communication which I have recently received from the Minister, in which he wroteAccommodation in hostels is on thc basis of plans for publication, but I shall be full board-ther e being no provision for lodgpleased to supply any information that ings only-and that is explained to migrants the honourable member or anybody else beforo they leave the reception centres.

It does not include any charge for the capital cost of construction of thc hostels or any other costs such as a statement on the subject of copper in interest payments. The tariff charged answer to questions that have been asked at these hostels compares very favourably with that which is charged at private employers mainly, establishments. In my experience cases of hardship are very rare. The wives of many of these immigrants take employment either in the neighbouring district or the hostel itself ancl the joint incomes of the husband and wife are quite substantial ancl adequate to cover the cost of their accommodation.

52,"Ryan, R. S. Mr Beale","The honourable memberproducers and consumers of the free world were invited to attend, Australia being one of some twenty or more countries which accepted the invitation. A t this conference it was agreed that there should be something of the nature of a pro rata share and share alike of the scarce materials among the member countries. Australia put forward its case based on its past consumption and present and future needs. Australia obtained a consumption allocation of 8,900 metric tons of copper for the fourth quarter of 1951. This was thc amount to which we were expected to l i m it our consumption for that quarter, so that it took into account our local production as well as what we would buy from abroad, if we could buy any. This allocation was less than our estimated needs by about 5,000 tons a year if that quarter's allocation were worked out on an annual basis. -Some people have suggested that Australia should not have participated in the conference. The Government does not agree with that view. In the first place, there were other materials being discussed and allocated at the conference as well as copper. For instance, sulphur is vital to Australia, and if we had not been there, we would have suffered very greatly. If we had stayed away from the conference, we would most probably not be in a position to buy copper at all at normal prices, because the limited amount available would have been allocated among the participating countries. Asi t is, even with our allocation, we have not, for some time, been able to buy any substantial quantities. It has also been suggested that our representatives did not obtain a big enough allocation. I suppose the representatives of every country are saying that sort of thing, but the fact is there was only a limited amount to go round and we got what we could. We were represented by two very able officers in Mr. Meere, Deputy Controller of Customs, who has had a wide experience in procurement problems, and Dr. Raggatt, who was then Director of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, and who knows the copper problem thoroughly, and also by others. These officers are nobody's fools, and I am satisfied that on this, the first and somewhat tentative allocation, Australia could not have done any better. The Government does most certainly think that Australia has a very stro2ig case for a greater quarterly allocation hereafter, because of our defence needs and the special circumstances of oui expanding economy. We are, therefore, doing everything we can to ensure that we shall get the biggest possible allocation for the first quarter of 1952, in respect of which the International Materials Conference is about to resume its sittings. To this end, we have been having discussions with several of the leaders of the copper-using industries and they have co-operated readily and generously with us. They have made available, and are sending to Washington, two very able and knowledgeable men who will act as advisers to the Government's delegates there, so that Australia w ill he able to put before the International MaterialsConference in support of its case, the best and most up-to-date information concerning Australian copper needs from the point of view of industry. These two men are Mr Walmsley, secretary of the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company Limited, and Mr Bult r secretary of Metal Manufacturers L i m i ted. The Government is quite certain that Australia w ill benefit from their presence in Washington. But getting a greater allocation is one thing and getting the copper within that allocation is another. For many months past, it has been almost impossible to buy copper abroad at normal prices. A t present, the Government is giving all the assistance that it can give, on a high level, to enableindustry to buy its requirements. Onlylast week I was in communication with the Ministerf o r External Affairs( Mr Casey) about the matter. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) asked me, in the course of his question, whether the copper shortage was affecting our stockpiling policy. It is not affecting our policy decision,, which was taken last year, but it hasaffected our ability to buy our copper stockpile in pursuance of that policy. So far, we have just not been able to secure it. If we were able to get it, it would, of course, be at the expense of local requirements. A t present, therefore, we are concentrating our efforts on securing enough copper for current needs, and to some extent at least, copper for stockpiling will have to wait until these needs are met. Of course, copper can be bought at fancy prices. The normal world price is about £227 sterling a ton, but although we cannot get it at that price, we can get it at a price two to three times greater and we are not having any. Japan, for instance, has been offering semi-fabricated copper at prices up to £700 a ton and, no doubt, this comes partly from the 13,000 ton allocation which that country gets through the International Materials Commission. Speaking personally, I do not regard this as a very satisfactory state of affairs. We have been turning our attention to iocal production also. The problems here largely concern plant and materials. For instance, I have been informed that there is a substantial tonnage of copper blister at Mount Lyell which cannot be refined because t n e r e is a shortage of in support of the motion, coke. We shall do what we can to remedy this. Mount Isa has been out of production since 1946 and we had hoped that it would have been back in production a long time ago. Shortage of materials, and price factors, have had a lot to do with the delay, but I have now been informed that the company will be producing a substantial tonnage by 1952. The Government is giving, and will give, the company every assistance in its power.

66,Mr Anthony,"The honorablethose hold-ups began and ceased are significant. From the 1st June to the 18th September of this year, 78 coastal vessels were held up for periods of from ten days to a fortnight, because the Seamen's Union refused to provide crews for them. It alleged that crews were not available to man the ships. Of course, the word had been furtively passed round that some members of the crews should leave certain vessels, and, in accordance with the conditions that pertain to the sailing of -ships, those vessels could not put to sea without full crews. For that reason, many vessels which should have been engaged in the transportation of not only sugar but also steel, coal, lead, coke and other important materials, were laid up at Newcastle and at other ports. But the significant fact is that, during the week before the referendum on communism was 'held on the 22nd September, no vessel was held up on the whole of the Australian coast. that preceded the referendum on the 22nd September last. thing can impress the honourable member for Watson, that those persons who have .authority to provide crews for ships had been engaged, from the beginning of June last until the middle of September, in preventing seamen from manning the vessels. The consequences of that policy had been felt by every person in the community. It is of little use for the cane-cutters, farmers member for Leichhardt much more inand mill labourers in north Queensland tc -do their jobs if organizations that control labour in the transport industry and in other key industries are able to nullify those efforts and cause, possibly, substantial losses. The Government has not .accepted such a position with equanimity. Something of a very substantial character must be done to try to relieve the situation that has been brought, very properly, to the notice of the House by the honourable member for Leichhardt. Yet, the position to which he has referred is not unusual. It has occurred year after year since the end of World War II . , and, to-day, is relatively the same as it was in 1949 and 1950. urgent now than was the case two years ago. honourable member for Leichhardt. The demand has been urgent ever since the end of the war. According to advice that I have received, most of the sugar is lifted in the earlier part of the season, and those operations are completed by the end of the season. The bulk of the sugar that is accumulated is required for the Australian market. The sugar that is exported is generally lifted by about the end of December. Most of the crushing, as the honourable member for Leichhardt and the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) are well aware, has been completed, except at one or two mills, and, therefore, it is not expected that, the position will become worse. The storage capacity is sufficient to cope with any additional quantities of sugar that may be received. The Colonial Sugar Befining Company Limited, which refines the bulk of the Queensland sugar crop and is the agent of the Queensland Sugar Board, has been busily occupied in endeavouring to charter ships from overseas sources. As a matter of fact, it has succeeded in chartering a number of vessels, which will become available for the Australian trade early in next January. I understand that approximately four ships have so far been engaged to make at least one voyage, and possibly as many as six voyages, in an effort to l if t the crop. I am not able to give to the honourable formation about the matters that he has raised, other than to tell him that a number of vessels that normally carry sugar have been diverted to the transport of coal from Callide. The output of coal from that source is increasing as a result of the policy of this Government in subsidizing Postmaster-<General not to discuss the coal-mining industry. Sugar is the subject of the motion that is now under consideration. the honourable member for Leichhardt that the increasing output of Callide coal,",23,Sugar Formalmotion For Adjournment

74,Mr Anthony,"I am indicating toand the necessity to transport it to the southern parts of Australia, are an important element in the diversion of shipping from the sugar trade, at least for the time being. Undoubtedly, our ability to lift, not only sugar but also other products, is somewhat deficient, but that position is due substantially to the efforts of the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union of Australasia, which has prevented us from taking full advantage of the shipping facilities and capacity that are available in this country. Anything that can be done by the honourable member for Leichhardt, and other members of the Labour party, to break the hold of certain gentlemen on the Seamen's Union will contribute materially to the solution of the shipping problem. Members of the Labour party should give a greater measure of assistance than they have given to date to the efforts that are being made by the Government towards that end. So far, we have not received any material assistance from them. We think that, by about the middle of next year, the sugar crop will have been lifted. That estimate is subject to the proviso that something else does not arise to dislocate shipping. So far as it is possible for the Government, with the means at its command, and for the Colonial Sugar Refinery Company Limited and the Australasian Steamship Owners Federation, which has also chartered a number of vessels that will come into the trade about the middle of January next, to alleviate an undoubtedly difficult situation, adequate steps to that grams that declare that the shipping end are being taken. Because of the seriousness of this matter, I expected that the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) would deal with it more calmly, and would reveal greater discretion than he has. As usual, he approached the subject with the same degree of discretion as we should expect from a gorilla at an afternoon tea party. The honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce), who raised the matter of lack of shipping for the transport of sugar from north Queensland ports, was fair, discreet and calm, and set a standard for the debate that the Postmaster General would have been well advised to emulate. I am amazed that the Postmaster General, who is a practical farmer and has been associated with primary production for many years, has so little knowledge of the sugar industry. His lack of knowledge was revealed by a statement that he made towards the conclusion of his speech. He considers that the shipping position will adjust itself,, and that all the sugar will be lifted froni north Queensland ports by the middle of next year. In other words, such improvement must occur within seven and a half or eight months. That statement is evidence that the Minister knows nothing about sugar after it has been produced, and particularly when it is stored during the summer months in the tropical belt of north Queensland. The Minister evidently does not realize how much damage and loss are caused to the sugar industry as a result of the deterioration of sugar while it is awaiting shipment. Obviously, the honourable gentleman is also not aware that the canefarmer does not receive any payment for his sugar until it has been loaded into ships. If the honourable gentleman is aware of that fact, he has very little regard for the consequences. The Minister said that he would discuss shipping over a period of years, but he confined his remarks to a brief period of only three years. I have received this morning from cane-growers' organizations not from branches of the Australian Labour party or from the Seamen's Union-tele situation is worse to-day than it has been for many years having regard to all the circumstances. The Minister spoke of the volume of sugar that was awaiting shipment in 1949, but he did not say, probably because he did not know, that the 1949 crop was of record proportions. That meant, of course, that much more sugar than usual was available for shipment. The current crop is relatively small. The Minister remarked that the mills had already finished most of the crushing. Usually crushing continues until the end of December, and sometimes it goes on into January. That fact should convey to the honourable gentleman some idea of the small volume of the surgar crop this year. It is a disgrace to the Government",24,Sugar Formalmotion For Adjournment
75,Mr Edmonds (Herbert) [11.53],"that, in these circumstances, sugar should he awaiting shipment. The Minister spoke of the slow turnround of ships and said that the activities of the Communist-dominated Seamen's Union were responsible for the delay in lifting sugar stocks. I do not know where the honourable gentleman obtained his information, because it was completely inaccurate. My authority for refuting it is the latest report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. If the Minister will take the trouble to study that report, or to inquire from somebody who has read it if he does not want to do so himself, he will learn that the board considers that the intensity of loading at north Queensland ports is reasonable and no less than should be expected. with 1939? ro 1939. AllI want is to have the sugar lifted. The Minister might ask the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board why it did not refer to 1939. shows that the rate of loading for the years to which it refers has been satisfactory. Nobody is entitled to point the finger of scorn at the waterside workers on that account. The Minister made a futile attempt to evade his responsibility by engaging in propaganda about Communist activities on the waterfront and on the ships. I remind the House that the seamen held up ships in Queensland during the regime of the Chifley Government; but that Government, with the assistance of the Australian Shipping Board, was able to bring about a steady improvement of the shipment of sugar. I had hoped that the honourable member for Dawson( Mr Davidson) and the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr stacks contain scores and scores of bags Pearce) would speak before I received the call from the Chair. I expected tohear some information from those honourable gentlemen because they, unlike the Minister, obviously know something about the sugar industry. I am disappointed that they have not asked questions in this House about the sugar situation. Members of the Opposition in this chamber and in the Senate have been relentless in their endeavours to have action taken to improve the position, but not one word has been uttered on this subject by Government supporters who represent sugar-producing areas. Perhaps they are afraid to embarrass Ministers. I remind them that, when I sat on the Government side of the House, to which I expect to return soon, I was untiring in my efforts to ensure that justice should be done in the interests of the industry and the consumers. I am grateful for the ministerial response that made my endeavours successful. I now urge hoi'ior.ib!' 1 members on the Government side of the House who come from sugar districts not to be afraid of embarrassing Ministers, but to "" have a go"" and try to get results. The telegrams that I have received this morning were sent to me by cane-growers' organizations in the Lower Burdekin, Home Hill, Herbert River, Tully and Houghton districts, and they inform me that about 100,000 tons of sugar is awaiting shipment in those areas. The Minister said that everything was "" hunky-dory "" and that all the sugar would be lifted by the middle of The report next year. I warn him that unless some extraordinary event occurs, the mills will commence crushing the 1951-52 crop a month or six weeks before the middle of next year and before all the 1950-51 crop has been shipped. What has he to say about that ? That situation would be serious enough even if deterioration did not occur in stored sugar. But, if the honourable gentleman will consult the honourable member for Dawson, the honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser), who at least know what happens, he will learn that deterioration begins in stored sugar as soon as the weather becomes really warm. The sugar that once contained sugar but which now look like dirty lumps of molasses. That is how sugar is wasted. Eveni f the Minister is not concerned about the community generally, at least as an Australian Country party man and a champion of the farmers he should be sufficiently interested to do whatever he can to prevent that from taking place.

The"" definite matter of urgent public imsaid, it is a bad thing for raw sugar to portance "" on which the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce) has based his adjournment motion has constituted a serious problem to the sugar industry for the last ten years at least. The difficulty to shift all raw sugar before the onset of transporting sugar from north Queensland ports to overseas markets and southern markets should be considered calmly, as the honourable member urged, in an attempt to improve the situation. The honourable member said that he would welcome correction of his statements if he made mistakes because he did not wish to mislead the House. I propose to correct some of the mis-statements that he made, so that the House may have the facts of the matter. The major correction is in respect of the total of sugar at present outstanding at Queensland ports, in comparison with the total that was outwas in office he found it necessary, from standing at the same time last year. I have checked this morning with two independent and reliable sources in Brisbane, and I can state with authority that the quantity of raw sugar at present outstanding in Queensland ports is approximately 20,000 tons more than it was at this time last year. That is a reliable figure, and it differs considerably from the figure of 80,000 tons that was given by the honourable member. I do not think that he made a deliberate .misstatement, but I can assure him that the figure that I have given is correct. figures. to allow the honourable member to examine the figures afterwards, and I think that he will concede that they are correct. Further, as the Minister( Mr Anthony) has pointed out, the crushing of sugaris practically finished in Queensland for the present season. By the end of this week only two mills will be continuing to crush sugar. That will mean that there will not be a further accumulation of raw sugar at ports, and, therefore, that the position will not become more serious than it is at present. I am not making these statements with the idea of minimizing the seriousness of the position, because it is a. serious one which the sugar industry would be pleased to have solved. As the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) has be stored after February, and the general position that the industry is facing now, and has been facing for the last ten years, is serious. Before the war it was possible of the wet season in January ancl February, but for the last ten years it has not been possible to do so and many thousands of tons of sugar have had to remain in Queensland during the wet season. In many instances stored sugar has had to be reprocessed before it could again be handled. The blame for that situation does not lie at the door of this Government any more than it lies at the door of the previous Government. The honourable member for Herbert said that when the previous Government time to time, to speak rather plainly on the floor of this House about the position in an effort to have it remedied. 1 know that he did so. I also spoke in this House to the same effect during the previous regime. The previous Government applied itself to any request that was made to it about the matter, and did what it could to relieve the position, just as this Government is doing. That position has been caused by circumstances which are beyond the immediate control of this Government and were similarly beyond the immediate control of the previous Government. The honourable member for Herbert expressed regret that he had not heard me or any of my colleagues who represent sugar-producing areas ask questions during this session about this matter. Let me assure him that we have been continually pressing, in the correct quarters, for alleviation of the position. The remedies which the Minister has indicated are being adopted, particularly in regard to the charter of ships, are, to a certain degree, although not wholly, due to the representations that we have made in quarters where such representations have most weight.",26,Sugar Formalmotion For Adjournment

80,Mr Bruoe,I should like to see the,27,Sugar Formalmotion For Adjournment
81,Mr Davidson,"I shall be happyI t was found by about the middle of this crushing period that tihe situation in regard to the lifting of raw sugar was becoming serious, as it had done on previous occasions. Sugar Board, a State instrumentality that is actually responsible for shifting the sugar because it owns it, instructed the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, as its agents, to attempt to charter further shipping to augment the coastal shipping. That action has been taken. As the Minister has pointed out, several ships have been obtained from sources overseas so that the present lag in coastal shipping may be taken up. I shall quote some of the details that have been supplied to me by the company in regard to the charter of such ships. They are as follows:-Cap o Noli, one voyage in January, 7,000 tons; Union Builder, three voyages, commencing in January, 5,000 tons each; Evanger, commencing in November, chartered for from four to five months, 5,000 to 6,000 tons each; Hia Fey, commencing at the beginning of December, one voyage only, 6,300 tons. That means that tihe company, acting as the agents of the Queensland Sugar Board, has made provision for the lifting of approximately 55,000 tons of sugar over and above the capacity of coastal shipping. So it .cannot be said that either this Government, or, to be quite fair, the Queensland Government, has been unaware of the position or has been in any way indolent about attempting to meet it . ' Therefore, the Minister was quite correct when he stated that, within a reasonable period, before the onset of JuneI believe, the position in rement's attention to the serious position gard to sugar removals in Queensland will be considerably relieved. Let us examine one of the major causes of the present situation, because it is of no use for us to talk about a situation without attempting to remedy it. I say that the basic cause of the trouble is the slow turn-round of ships-that is to say, the slow loading rate in the Queensland ports and the slow discharge rate in the southern ports. That slow turn-round is the result of the attitude that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has adopted over a period of years. I do not make that statement dogmatically, but shall provide proof of its accuracy. The proof is contained in a comparison of the loading rates at the port of Mackay in 1939 and 1940 compared with the loading rates at the same port So the Queensland in 1950 and 1951. These figures have been compiled from tables kept by the Mackay Harbour Board, and cannot be gainsaid. They show that in 1939 six vessels were in the port of Mackay for a total of 36 days, during which period they loaded 42,059 tons of sugar, or 1,168 tons a day. I shall not use the fallacious method of giving the number of tons loaded by a gang an hour, because that could be misleading. I prefer to examine the overall position. In 1940 the loading rate for six vessels was 997 tons a day. In 1949 the loading rate for sixteen vessels had dropped to 679 tons a day. In 1950 it had dropped to 616 tons a day, and in the first two months of this year it had dropped to 510 tons a clay. power position? position is exactly the same as it was before. The loading rate, therefore, has dropped by more than 50 per cent, in ten years. There is the problem which must be rectified before there can be any amelioration of the position. able gentleman's time has expired. support the case that has been made out by the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce), who directed the Governthat has arisen in north Queensland in respect of sugar stocks. I do so despite the assurance of the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony), who represents in this House the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay), that no substantial losses would occur as a result of the accumulation of 238,000 tons of raw sugar at northern ports. The honourable member for Dawson( Mr Davidson) referred to the fact that only 20,000 tons more sugar is stored this year than was stored at the same time last year. The honourable member knows very well that, as is normal at this time of the year, the sugar mills in Queensland are still working and many of them will be crushing",27,Sugar Formalmotion For Adjournment

85,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [12.13],"Iup to January. But because of tbe fact that this has been one of the driest years in Queensland's history, the quantity of sugar passing through the mills has been reduced. Therefore, the fact that the accumulation of sugar is now only 20,000 tons more than it was at this time last year indicates that there has been some problem in regard to the removal of raw sugar from north Queensland ports. From time to time the newspapers have published details of the difficulty which the people of Sydney and Melbourne have experienced in securing supplies of sugar. Tbe industry is capable of producing the requirements of the whole of the Commonwealth and a considerable quantity for export overseas. The shortages that have been experienced in the southern parts of Australia are due to the fact that the sugar has not been lifted from the ports of north Queensland, in which' 238,000 tons of raw sugar has accumulated. The economic advisers to the Government have stated that Australia must increase its exports because, of the fall that has taken place in overseas balances. This industry could make the same substantial contribution to Australia's overseas funds that it has made in the past. The honourable member for Dawson stated that the position had been serious for the past ten years because of the slow turn-round of ships and cited figures in relation to the rate of loading at the port of Mackay. The reason for the delay caused to Commonwealth owned ships that have called at northern ports to pick up sugar is that when privately owned ships have entered tliose ports work on the Commonwealth owned ships has been suspended in order that the privately owned ships might be turned round quickly. The people have had to pay for the delay in the turn-round of their vessels. Instead of blaming wharf labourers for shipping delays honourable members opposite should examine the responsibility of management for the delays that have occurred. The blame cannot all be placed on the shoulders of the seamen and the wharf labourers. As tlie honourable member for Dawson stated, when sugar is left in storage in Mr Riordan. Queensland during the wet season it is affected by the humidity. The consequent losses have been borne by the sugarfarmers and have been reflected in the general economy of the sugar industry. During the wet season sugar in store becomes hard and is much more difficult for the wharf labourers to handle, and. as a consequence, there is a reduction of the rate of loading. The Government should ensure that adequate shipping shall be made available for the purpose of carrying urgently required goods from southern ports to north Queensland ports. There is a shortage of steel right through the ject is outside the scope of this debate. difficulty in supplying cargo for ships to take to north Queensland so that they could return with sugar for the south. The honourable member for Dawson stated that 55,000 tons would be lifted from north Queensland during the next few months. But 238,000 tons has accumulated in those ports. The Government should arrange for cargoes available in the south to be shipped to northern ports so that the vessels may then be loaded with sugar for the markets of the Commonwealth and for export abroad in order to increase our overseas balances. [12.22] -As the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce) said, there is a very serious menace to the sugar industry and the people of Australia. The sugar industry is perhaps the most highly organized and efficient industry in Australia. It has one serious difficulty and that is the shipment of sugar from north Queensland. There is not very much trouble in this respect in my own district but in the north of Queensland the problem has become a menace to the industry. It is a well-known fact among shipping people that in 1939 vessels spent two-thirds of their time at sea and one-third in port. Now two-thirds of their time is spent in port and one-third at sea. The loading of sugar in north Queensland ports is dominated by the foreign-controlled Waterside Workers Federation.

88,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"Shipping and Transport, sugar was loaded at the rate of 23.3 tons a gang-hour in northern Queensland in 1939. In 1950, it was loaded at the rate of 13.7 tons a gang-hour. the rate of loading occurred during the period of office of the Chifley Government, of which the honorahle member for Kennedy( Mr Eiordan) was a member. Yet never, during that Government's term of office, did the honourable member make the ranting references to the industry that ho made to-day. As a member of the Labour Government, the honourable member must be held to be partly responsible for this state of affairs. He may find something of value to contribute to a debate on another occasion; he certainly did not do so to-day. In 1939, 34.3 tons a gang-hour was loaded into ships in Australian ports. In of ships has been aggravated during the 1950, 13.6 tons a gang-hour was loaded. F secured those figures this morning from the Department of Shipping and Transport. They illustrate the extent to which the handling of sugar has been delayed in north Queensland ports and the seriousness of the menace to which the sugar industry has been subjected. The sugar industry is controlled by the Government of Queensland by virtue of the fact that the shipment of sugar to the capital cities is arranged by that Government. So menacing has the position become that the industry is considerwould have been great enough; but ing the possibility of bulk-loading ships so as to restrict the opportunity of the enemies of this country to damage the industry. Those people represent the only inefficient section of the industry. The people who grow the sugar operate tlieir farms efficiently. They work in the very well for the honourable member for fiields in hot weather to produce the cheapest sugar in the world for the people of Australia. The sugar is transported to the wharfs efficiently. But those who work on the wharfs are apparently determined that the industry shall suffer some loss and they have succeeded in giving effect to that determination. wharf labourers have acted in a manner that is detrimental to this country, and if we do not take action against them with the assistance of the trade unions of Australia and of Opposition members we shall come up against a brick wall, as the honourable member for Kennedy did before he voted against the Government's proposals to control communism. I hope that honourable members will recognize the existence of this menace in northern That deterioration in Queensland. I compliment the honourable member for Leichhardt upon having raised the matter, and I emphasize that this action has been taken deliberately by Communists against the sugar industry and the people of this country. I was very interested in the remarks of honourable gentlemen opposite who attempted to discredit the Government. Opposition members who have spoken on this subject have shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the industry. Those who have had contact with the shipping position in northern Queensland know full well that the slow turn-round last few years by the influence of the Communist elements in the shipping industry, particularly those in the northern ports of Queensland. This Government had to undertake a terrific task in reorganizing shipping generally, and in particular in reorganizing shipping at the sugar ports. Shipping schedules had been so completely upset that the efficient shipment of sugar had become a. task of great magnitude. If that had been the only problem the task the sugar industry is vital not only to northern New South Wales and Queensland, but also to the whole of the Australian economy. Our Communist friends, realizing this, have worked untiringly to upset this industry. It is all Herbert( Mr Edmonds) to shake his head about what I am saying; if ' he had had an unbiased mind he would have recognized it as truth. The attempts to smash the sugar industry have been made by the enemies of Australia-the Communists. TheI f the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce), the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) and the honourable member for Herbert had not gone onto the rostrum in order to protect the people who are helping to destroy the sugar industry in Australia, there would have been some justification",29,Sugar Formalmotion For Adjournment
89,Mr Pearce (Capricornia) [12.29],"for their attack on this Government in connection -with its handling of these matters. From 1939 to the present time, there has been a steady deterioration of the rate of loading of sugar into ships in the northern ports of Queensland. I suggest that the honourable member who has just interjected should try to rectify this state of affairs. He is not without some influence in the trade union movement, and perhaps he could use that influence to clear Communists out of the waterfront unions in Queensland. The sugar is there, but the slow turnround of ships, aggravated by Communist influence in the waterfront unions, is gradually strangling the sugar industry. has a phobia. mine is not permanent; the honourable member for ""Watson's is. Let us now consider the vessels that will be lined up in Sydney harbour to unload sugar. Lugano is due on the 26th November and will not be completely discharged until the 7th December. Eiver Burnett is due On the 4th December and will not complete its unloading until the 20th December. Bilhurra will arrive on the 12th December and will not complete discharging until the 20th December. whom the honourable member sponsors and attempts to camouflage, the enemies of this country, make it impossible for them to discharge within a reasonable time. Tambau will arrive on the 20th December and complete unloading operations on the 28th December. Biver Norman will arrive on the 24th December, but will not complete discharging its cargo until the 14th January. Therefore, honourable members will realize that the plain fact is that the and for his prospects at the next general Government is doing all that it can to organize the shipment of sugar from northern ports, but that in the north of Queensland a strong Communist influence is operating against the loading of ships, and in Sydney the rate of discharge of sugar ships has slowed down considerably. What is the good of criticizing the Government about this matter when it is bending every effort to get at the root cause of the whole trouble? Honourable members opposite make themselves appear ludicrous in the eyes of honourable members in this House and of everybody outside of it when they stand up and fulminate about something for which they are directly and indirectly responsible; that is, the complete domination by Communists of the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union of Australasia. Honourable members opposite are the guilty ones. It is of no use to say that the Government has done nothing. Honourable members opposite should realize that they have done something that is not to the advantage of Australia in that they have allowed the trade union movement to be. dominated by the enemies of Australia. The honourable member for Herbert spoke about this year's crushing of sugar cane. He certainly knows very little about it, as I shall soon prove. The crushing at Queensland ports is nearly completed. In Mackay all mills will complete crushing this week. That is contrary to what the honourable member for Herbert, in his ignorance, said. At Bowen, the Proserpine mill has completed its crushing, and the Inkerman mill will complete its crushing operations by the 21st December. At Townsville all mills will complete crushing by the 24th November. At Lucinda Point all mills have completed the crushing season. At Cairns, all mills will have completed their crushing by the end of November except the mill at South Johnstone, which will continue to crush until the 8th December. honourable member tell us the location of these mills that he has spoken about? member does not know where the mills are in his own electorate, I am sorry for him election.

He will have to shudder between now and the next general election if the knowledge of the sugar industry he has revealed to-day does not improve considerably. I claim to know something about the sugar industry. Minister for Immigration in 1948, when the Labour Government allotted 1,000 new Australian labourers to the sugar growers. During that year the sugar industry enjoyed a record crop. We also provided flannels, blankets, socks, sandshoes, knives; in fact, anything that the labourers needed. If the Chifley Government had not taken that action that record crop of sugar cane would have rotted in the fields. That record 194S crop amounted to 900,000 tons of cane. The next year's crop established an even greater record of 924,000 tons. Both crops realized an average price of about £24 a ton and millions of pounds went into the accounts of the sugar growers of Queensland as a result of the Labour Government's action. This year, the Government anticipates a yield .of about 600,000 tons of sugar cane. Had the record crop of 1948 been repeated the whole of the cane would not have been cut, because the workers availif a sufficiency of workers had been available, 300,000 tons of cane would still have remained uncrushed, if what the honourable member for Capricornia says is correct, namely, that all the mills have not yet completed their operations. The honourable member mentioned a sugar mill at Bowen. There is no sugar mill in that town, but I remember seeing a timber mill there. There is no sugar mill within four miles of Cairns. There are mills at Gordonvale, Goondi, Mourilyan and South Johnstone, near Innisfail, but none at Cairns. Labour governments did something of tremendous importance to the sugar-growers of Queensland and all that we ask iB that this Government shall do as well as we did. We suggest that this Government should move the sugar cane as expeditiously as we did and try to make an effort to get the necessary ships. Every government has had difficulty about shipping matters. Shipping on the Australian coastline is in very poor shape. No big ships have been put on the Australian coastal run by private enterprise for a number of years. It is time the Government made a greater effort to obtain ocean-going vessels for I was trade between Australia and Great Britain, ancl vessels for the Australian coastal trade. It is pure nonsense for honourable members to blame communism for our shipping troubles; in fact, it is worse than nonseuse, it is dangerous propaganda which has been disseminated hy people who know that they have no excuse for procrastinating and who want a bogy of some sort.

The more the income of a worker is increased by cost-ofliving adjustments, the more he pays in taxes ancl the more his standard of living is reduced. The Prime Minister said that, when incomes rose, taxes would be reduced. Incomes have risen, but income tax has been increased. Eveni f it has not been increased, wage-earners, owing to their high income, would now be paying greater sums in income tax than they paid last year. taxation would be reduced as economies were effected in administration. Has not the Government effected such economies by dismissing 10,000 public servants? Why, then, has it been necessary to incessantly been taunted on tlieir joint policy increase taxes?

I challenge any Government supporter, or anybody else, to contradict his observations. He is reported in the Queensland journal CountryL if e of the 15th November as having saidWhen in Opposition to the Chifley Government, the present Treasurer said that the high taxes imposed by the Chifley Government caused inflation and the only way to end inflation was to reduce taxation. He has now imposed a ruinous rate of taxation as the only way of curing inflation. And that is what is wrong with the Country party. With a drought on us which has already proved disastrous to many; bush Arcs raging throughout the State and even into the town; poor lambing, breeders dying and the Federal Administration squeezing the life out of the industry, the outlook is indeed gloomy. Unable to read the writing on the wall, the Government bumped up income tax from 75 per cent, to 85 per cent., and, as a crowning act of folly and injustice, retrospectively abolished the averaging system back to the boom year ending June, 1950, when wool sold at twice its present value. This act alone cost the industry £47,000,000. Mr Cameron advanced the following further argument:Every extra pound earned by the efforts of small growers is now an added liability with an income tax of 85 per cent., a wool-grower may have to pay £160 on each £100 earned. I suggest that the Treasurer might debate that matter with Mr Cameroni n order to find out for himself what the wool growers really think about the Government's policy with respect to the wool industry.

If the Treasurer does not believe that widespread discontent exists over the Government's taxation policy, I advise him to ascertain that fact from the latest gallup poll that has .been conducted on this subject. If he would also read the press, he would see how unpopular the Government's taxation policy really is. Indeed, resentment has already become apparent within the innermost circles of the Liberal party. The Melbourne Argus, the "" Fair Play"" newspaper, in its issue of three days ago, reported that at the annual meeting of the federal council of the Liberal party, Mr Mackinnon, who was member for Wannon in the Nineteenth Parliament saidTaxation has almost wiped out incentive earning and crippled industry.

137,Mr Calwell,"I am sorry forable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) has made an observation that the people will profit from in the future. He says, iu effect, that when a party is out of office any. argument is good enough to enable it to win an election, and that when it is in office it can preach an opposite doctrine and expect to delude the people. The Ministerf or Immigration ( MrH o l t ) said, in 1946, that the Liberal party undertook to reduce taxes by 40 per cent, during the following three years. I u those three years, a Labour government reduced taxes by more than 40 per cent. saidI shall be very surprised and disappointed if an overwhelming proportion ,of that remission is not granted during the first financial year, because the party recognizes that, if tax reduction is to have the revitalizing effect that ends by reducing national income, it is difficult is so badly needed, the biggest cut must be made in the first year. Yet, when his party was returned to office, he became co-author with the Treasurer of the most savage system of income taxation that has ever been imposed upon the people of Australia. All honorahle members opposite would prefer a system of taxation that did not affect very seriously the wealthy interests of the country. They would also like to reduce probate duties, and bring about a situation in which wealthy groups would scarcely know from the taxation they paid when they died, their probate duties would be so small that they would not even know that they were dead. But I have in my dossier the reports of the opinions of persons who do not support the Labour party, but are most critical of the Government's taxation policy. For instance, Mr C. A . 0 . Sindel, the president of the Taxpayers Association of Australia, who has never spoken with me in the Sydney Domain or on Melbourne's Yarra bank in advocating a better social order, has made the following statement about this b ill : It does not matter how much taxpayers have their wages increased, they will still be worse eiT. . . . The 10 per cent, levy falls proportionately most heavily on the low-income groups, and because of the principle of graduated rates of tax will fall heaviest on any extra income earned by hard work. The severity of the new A t least the honorcharge will further discourage the working of overtime, the planting of more acres, and the risking of capital in extending businesses and starting new ones. Mr C. B . H a l l , who is the director of the Chamber of Manufactures in New South Wales, has also denounced these tax proposals. The president of the Chamber of Commerce Incorporated, Sydney, MrK . E. Coles, a member of the firm of G. J. Coles, which is not exactly an organization of impoverished shopkeepers, criticized the taxation proposals of the Government in the financial year 1950-51. In some respects those proposals gave some measure of relief but, in other respects, they increased taxes. He saidOn that occasion the Minister Taxation which still stands at 27 per cent, of the national income is surely at a most dangerous level. Undoubtedly, we will be shortly called upon to make a national effort that will be a drain on the nation's purse. As any further taxation will defeat its own to see where this additional revenue is to come from. Last year, the Government appropriated 30 per cent, of the national income by way of taxation compared with 27 per cent, in the previous year. This year, it w ill extract from the people 33 per cent, of the national income. The Director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia in Canberra, has also condemned the present tax proposals, and Sir Charles Lloyd Jones, who received a knighthood from this Government, made the following statement about this that, they were alive, and budget:One thing certain is that while expenses will continue to mount in every direction, the additional taxation coming in a year of falling income is going to take its toll from every class of the community. Sir Charles Lloyd Jones is the managing director of David Jones Limited, a big business octopus in Sydney. certainly hittin g the big companies with its taxation proposals. taxation proposals are hitting the little people harder than they are hitting the wealthy classes.

Many hospitals are finding that the October issue of Bydge's Journal:There has become fixed in the mind of to-day's Govermnent a conviction that taxation rates should be made so high that they drain reversed his opinions in many ways off, or confiscate, the bulk of personal incomes, since 1949, and, I say, though with and that in the case3 of very large incomes, the all due respect to him personally, that rates should take substantially all the income it is unfortunate for the nation that over a certain limited figure.

This is found it possible to reduce taxation, admitted by the Government who, however, although their economies are affected by advances the alarming principle that liigher taxation rates are necessary in order to combat inflation. If ever there was a fallacy, it is that. last general election. Since when have high taxation rates been an antidote to inflation? In fact, the exact opposite is true. High tax rates encourage inflation; they are tlie breeding ground of inflationary tendencies; they are the nursery of national trouble. Nobody can successfully contravert that opinion. I should mention that I am placing all the opinions on record because they will be most useful to many people a little later. The Treasurer's second-reading speech on this bill is, in my opinion, noticeable for too many evasions and too much double talk. As the nation's financier, the right honourable gentleman is a failure, and his failure will have dire consequences for everyone. why the Labour party is determined to oppose this bill, as it has opposed othei bills that have been introduced to give effect to the Government's financial policy. We desire the people to know precisely our attitude towards it. Labour Government did a good job for Australia. We left our successors a sound economy and plenty of money.

155,Mr Calwell,"I am aware of that1949. That administration at least would still be reducing direct and indirect taxes, and giving the public tremendous benefits that this Government has failed to give to them. This Government has not tackled the problem of inflation in the right way. 1 am not permitted to canvass the measures by which a Labour government would tackle inflation, but at least such an administration would have prevented the ever-3piralling of prices, which have reached fantastic heights and resulted, together with other happenings, in the closing of woollen mills in Victoria. able member's remarks are not related to taxation. I have allowed him considerable latitude. was straying a little from the subject of taxation, and I shall return to the bill. This Government has a case to answer before the Australian people. It must explain why it is increasing taxation, when, during the general election campaign in 1949, it promised to reduce taxation. It does not matter whether the Government pleads guilty or not guilty to that charge for it will be found guilty by the Australian people. The second charge which the Government has to meet before the Australian people is in respect of its decision to abolish the averaging system, which members of the Liberal party ancl the Australian Country party lauded in other days. system abolished for the ordinary taxpayer previously? good reasons that were accepted by the Opposition of the day. However, the present Opposition does not believe that the averaging system should be abolished now or at any time, and contends that it is not fair to go back to a period of high wool prices as the starting point for the abolition of the averaging system. We also say that the flat rate of the 10 per cent., by which all income tax assessments will be increased during this financial year, is not fair, because a man on a high income or a man on a low income will be subject to that flat rate. Eor many years the income tax has been levied on a graduated scale. The proposed overall increase of taxation is at the same rate for the poor man as it is for tbe wealthy man, ancl, in that respect, the principle is wrong. As one of the leaders of the graziers has pointed out, it is possible for a man who has an income of £100 this year to receive an assessment of £160. Nobody's ingenuity can find a sufficiently good argument to defend such an iniquity before the bar of public opinion. By every criterion, the budget is bad, and this bill, in particular, is very bad. By every standard of straight public dealing, this Government has behaved badly, wrongly, and, if I may hazard the opinion, disgracefully .in the manner in which it has dishonoured its pre-election promises to the people. Throughout Australia to-day, one hears no criticism of the Labour party or talk about working for Chifley, or about the increased revenues that are to go into the coffers of the Labour Government. The people do not even mention that they will be required to pay higher taxes to the present Treasurer. All that they ask, in effect, is, "" When are we going to get rid of the present Treasurer ancl the Government?"" In that spirit, I leave the bill to the consideration of the House. May the departure of this Government be hastened with the greatest possible speed, and may the Labour party have a fair opportunity, with control of the Senate ancl this House, to do justice to Australia. Mr .GRAHAM (St. George) [2.58] The House has been entertained by a display of erudition by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) on thc subject of taxation, although ] describe some of his views as peculiar. 1 suggest that the honourable gentleman does not seriously entertain the opinions that he has expressed, and that he has taken advantage of the fact that he is in Opposition to attack the Government with all the offensive remarks that he can muster.

I , personally, have stood on a box in the Sydney Domain, and addressed an audience, though I admit that I did not get as much support as I might have received in more familiar places. However, the group of which I was a member had a most interesting time in the Domain, and were given the credit of having the courage to go there, and express our views. The honourable member for Melbourne has been guilty of the grossest political humbug in his references to the Government's proposals. I admit that, in 1948, I thought that the late Mr Chifley, who was then Prime Minister and Treasurer, was guilty of treating ex-servicemen with disdain because he refused to increase taxes in order to finance improved repatriation benefits. I confess my sin. I realize now that responsibility for the government of the country rests properly upon the shoulders of the administration and upon nobody else. It is mere humbug for an honourable member to say one thing when he is a Minister and something else entirely when he is in Opposition. Reference has heen made to tax reductions in New Zealand. Unfortunately, many Australians do not yet clearly understand that Australia has a particular relationship to New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, which arises from the common necessity to combine for the defence of democracy.' All the Premiers of the Australian States, Labour, Liberal and Country party, agreed in conference with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer (i Sir Arthur Fadden) a few months ago that, under the existing conditions of inflation, it would be a sad and needs of the States. bad act of administration to obtain new money by means of government credit. Therefore, they decided that capital expenditure on public works in ali spheres should be financed from the Commonwealth purse, -which, after all, is the public's pocket. That is why the Government has incurred the considerable displeasure of the community in general by increasing taxes. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) and other members of the Opposition have referred tn PU alleged surplus of £114,500,000 for Graham. which provision has been made in the budget. In fact, that item does not represent a surplus. It was included in order to enable the Government to underwrite government loans in the event of public subscriptions failing to fill the loan quotas. In other words, it will enable this Government to keep the States solvent. It is the grossest aet of political treachery to attempt to stab in the back a government that has agreed, for the first time in Australia's history, to underwrite the responsibilities of the States. The Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland attempted to gain as much party political advantage as possible at the Loan Council meeting by standing out against this Government and the governments of the other four States. But onegreater crime was committed. That odd fellow who is the Premier of Victoria appeared to be very pleased when he left the conference chamber at Canberra and said, in a broad Scots accent, "" I have never been better treated"", but he returned immediately to his home town and proceeded to abuse the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and everybody associated with them for thp treatment that he had received. flection on the honourable member for Indi( Mr Bostock).

That is tlie basic issue in relation to socialism. This Government acts on behalf of the people. It abhors the theories of the Opposition. Furthermore, before it has finished its task, it will' unscramble the Labour party's egg and put the feathers back on the chicken that the socialists have plucked. Honourable members will recall that the honourable member for Melbourne has devoted a great deal of energy in recent years to his attempts to convince us that we cannot unscramble a scrambled egg or put the feathers back on a plucked chicken.

Only in a country of enormous freedom where the most clever "" spivs "" could organize themselves could such a political party be formed. with taxation? been obliged to increase taxation because of the grave problems that it inherited from the former Labour Government. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr to be an election in November. The Rosevear) knows as well as I do that the budgetary total of £1,041,000,000 was the irreducible minimum. suggested how it could be reduced even by one penny. Do honourable members opposite suggest that the Government could reduce its commitments for defence, social services or repatriation? They have not said so. Therefore, I consider that they are guilty of an immoral practice in treating this matter merely as a political plaything. The Prime Minister of New. Zealand went to the people of that dominion this year and said that he would reduce taxation at a time when the present Government parties proposed to increase taxation. The honourable member for Melbourne and his colleagues conveniently overlook the fact that, although taxation has been reduced in New Zealand and increased in Australia, Australians are still less severely taxed than are the peoples of New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Taxes provide the means by which we can develop our capacity to fight, and we must fight as a member oi the great team to which those other countries belong. Australians should realize that they bear the lightest burden of the United Nations team. We are the people who lack the courage to face up to our real responsibilities. Members of the parliaments of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America would be fully justified in saying that Australia was the "" weak sister "" of the United Nations team and that it wished to derive the greatest benefit from the minimum cost. The blame for this disease that infects the community must be laid at the door of those individuals who have benefited most from the travail of the last 50 years.

That is £2,000 more than his actual income in the year ended last June, even after about £4,200 has already been paid in advance. Although this taxpayer had an indication of his potential income, he had no indication of the axe that the -Government intended to wield, and so he reduced his mortgages and his overdraft -at the bank, as he well might do, in view -of the increase of his income. Having reduced his overdraft and mortgage by £6,000 he has already spent money that he will now need to pay in taxes. His position will be very serious as a result of the Government's retrospective abolition of the averaging system. I hope that the Treasurer will give serious consideration to the position of that taxpayer. I suggest that it is not an isolated case, but that there are probably many other people, in the electorate of Mallee and elsewhere, who are in similar circumstances. I turn now to income tax generally. Income tax purports to be tax on income. The aspirations of taxation authorities are well expressed in the report of the Committee on the Taxation of Trading Profits, known as the MillardTncker Committee, which was established in 1949 by the United Kingdom Government.. Paragraph 8 of the committee's report statesThe general scheme of the Income Tax legisof staff and, innocent of the pitfalls that lation being not to tax anything hut income, capital increment as such being outside its scope and income derived from business being more usually denoted by the word "" profits we took as the first of those principles that as nearly as practicable the taxable profits should be no more and no less than the true profits of the business as computed on established accountancy principles. In effect, that means that in taxing a business some regard must be had for accepted accountancy principles and some distinction must be drawn between what, under accountancy practice, is to be regarded as income on the one hand and what is to be regarded as capital on the other. In actual practice it is sometimes very difficult to decide whether an amount is income or whether it goes over the border into the capital field. Considerable difficulty is met with from time to time in drawing a line in income tax legislation ibetween income and capital. In fact, sometimes the line has had to be crossed because capital depreciation has to be allowed for in the computation of profits,"" and sometimes what is normally regarded as capital is treated as income. We shall have another example to-night, when the relevant amendment comes before us, of how in the coal industry, for instance, what would be regarded in another business as capital transactions will be held, under the legislation, as being of an income nature. There are other anomalies in the principal act to which the Treasurer should give some consideration because they cause a great deal of difficulty. One such anomaly to which I shall refer affects ordinary taxpayers and arises from the operation of sections 26 (d) and 26 (e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act which refers to payments made to people on retirement from their occupations. I shall cite one example that I know from my own experience, because the person concerned came to see me recently about the matter. He had been employed by the tramway authorities in Melbourne and would have become entitled, on his retirement at the age of 65, to a gratuity of about £750. If he had retired from his occupation he would have been taxed on only 5 per cent, of that lump sum; but the tramway authorities asked him to remain at work because they were short enshroud interpretations of the Income Tax Assessment Act, he continued in his employment although he received his gratuity of £750. Unfortunately for him, because he had not retired, under the technical meaning of section 26 (d), instead of being taxed on only 5 per cent, of the gratuity he was taxed on the full amount of it. The payment of that tax made a large hole in his retiring allowance. The Government has suggested that in the interests of increasing production people should continue in their jobs after they have reached the age of 65 years. If the Government really wishes people to heed that exhortation it should make some amendment of thp Income Tax Assessment Act to provide for a notional kind of retirement so tbar people who receive a retiring gratuity at the age of 65, but do not retire, would be taxed on it as if they had actually retired. Taxation Board of Review case No. 62 gives an example of the kind of ridiculous situation that .can arise. It deals with a school teacher who reached the age of 65 years while he was employed at a private school. On his retirement he became entitled to a lump payment of £800, only 5 per cent, of which would have been taxable. The school committee decided that it would be a. serious drain on its finances to pay that amount in one year, and decided, in effect, to pay it in three instalments of £100 in each of three years. So instead of being taxed only £15 in one year, which would have been the case had he received the payment in a lump sum, the school teacher was taxed on £100 in each of the three years. It is surely possible to have some definition in relation to such matters. The Parliament can express its vvill and indicate that it wishes that section of the Income Tax Assessment Act to operate in a cerain way. I suggest that the Parliament did not intend that section to operate in the way in which it operates. The learned editors of the Butterworth Taxation Service have given a reverse example of that in a footnote to the report of case No. 62. He says that if a person was paid £500 not to engage in some kind of employment because the person who paid the money considered that his engagement in that employment would interfere with the payer's profits, that lump sum of £500 would be taxed under section 26 (d) of the act. If , however, the payment of the sum was divided into five equal instalments it would not be taxable because it would escape under the interpretation of section 26 (e). Such anomalies are ridiculous, and should be remedied. I pass on to another example which arises from the operation of sections 83 to 86 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which deal with the sale of businesses on lease-holds. These sections impinge directly on ordinary people in the community. 'I know that there is some doubt about the Parliament's original intention in inserting these sections in the act. I was for some time employed in the Taxation Branch, and in those days it was understood that the sections had Mr Crean. been put in the act merely to bring hotel licences within the scope of its provisions. Hotel licences are in a peculiar position in that they are limited in number by State laws. The increase of the value of such licences cannot be said to be primarily due to any efforts of the owners of them. Apparently, it is suggested that if a person who rents premises on which he conducts a small grocery business sells the business at the end of his working life and receives more for it than the value of the goods and equipment the excess amount is taxable income. If that was the intention of the framers of the legislation, it should be made clear by the Parliament itself. If ' the Parliament wishes to impose a capital gains tax it should legislate for the imposition of a capital gains tax. It should not simply make other taxation legislation applicable to people who are not sufficiently fortunate to own a freehold property. Under the interpretation of the legislation to which I have referred, persons who are economically substantial enough to own the freehold of a property are in a better position than those who only hold a lease. Dozens of cases have come before the Taxation Board of Review for determination of whether businesses have been sold at a capital gain. Battles take place between the representatives of the Taxation Branch and taxation agents who represent the taxpayers concerned. The person who has had a contract of sale drawn up is usually in a more fortunate position than the unwary person who has sold without taking cognizance of the circumstances. In volume 1 of the Taxation Board of Review Decisions, published by the Law Book Company of Australasia Proprietary Limited, a note has been appended to case No. 102 which readsAn appeal to the High Court, in respect of the above decision, is pending. The Taxation Board of Review was constituted in order to provide a simple form of ventilation of taxation cases. The High Court is not the appropriate place to resolve these difficulties. Cases which are not decided by the Board of Review in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner of Taxation should be examined by the Parliament. In the same volume a note is also appended to case No. 105, which readsAn appeal to the High Court, in respect of the above decision, is pending. In those two cases, because the Commissioner of Taxation was not satisfied with the decision of the Board of Beview, he has taken the case to the H i g h Court. The people's money w ill have to be spent in order to have the H i g h Court determine a matter which should be determined by the Parliament. Fundamental principles of taxation are involved in case No. 105, which concerns a business in the State of Victoria. The law of that State provides that every worker shall receive two weeks' annual holiday at the end of twelve months' employment. The act has been so worded as to imply that one-fiftieth of that holiday period shall accrue automatically every pay-day so that at the end of a year, two weeks' leave w ill have been accumulated. Tf at the end of the year a man ceases to continue in his employment and has not taken his holiday he is entitled to the equivalent of two weeks' wages. Following what are regarded as normally accepted standards of accounting, some firms have decided to make a provision for the payment of accumulated holiday pay. As payment in respect of leave is obligatory by statute, reservation is made in respect of certain periods for payments is respect of such leave. In case No. 105 in the volume to which I have referred, Mr Cotes, one of the members of the Taxation Board of Review is reported to have saidThese remarks appear to me to support a general principle that, in ascertaining the net income of a business for taxation purposes, the interpretation of the law should be brought into harmony with recognized accounting theory and practice, except where the specific verbiage of auy section or sections of the Act precludes this course being followed. A reference was made to such cases in is absolutely inaccurate. Reference to the paragraph 189 of the report of the Comincome tax rates w ill show that it is mittee on the Taxation of Trading Profits. impossible for a person to pay more in It was stated that where there is a statutax in respect of any financial year than tory obligation to provide for a' fixed he receives in income in that year. It annual holiday the amount involved is is true that provisional tax in respect of a definite ascertainable charge on a busithe next year's income, plus the tax due ness and should be provided for hy a reserve according to normal accounting practice. It was recommended that that practice should bo followed in countries where there were statutory enactments of this kind. The Board of Review acknowledged that principle, but the Commissioner of Taxation now wants a judgment to be given by the H i g h Court. I suggest that that is an absurd state of affairs. Accepted accountancy practice should be followed unless the Commissioner of Taxation has very good reasons for considering that it should be varied, in which case the matter should be submitted, not to the H i g h Court, but to the Treasurer. I consider that the act should be amended in order to provide for such a procedure to be adopted. Perhaps the cases that I have quoted could be considered by the House at a later date. The Treasurer announced, perhaps rather buoyantly, that he would simplify taxation and remove anomalies, but a considerable number of anomalies still exist and apparently, rather than abolish them, he proposes to support the actions of the Commissioner of Taxationi n approaching the H i g h Court. These anomalies are very real to the persons whom they affect and who have paid thousands of pounds more each year in tax than they have received in income. Judged by accepted accounting principles, that state of affairs is an absurdity. A t least this bill gives honourable members the opportunity to ventilate the anomalies which exist, inquire into the purport of the principal act and consider whether the desirable objectives that I have mentioned can be attained. must refute the statement that was made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) to the effect that taxpayers have paid more in taxation than they have received in income. That allegation has been made very freely and on the current year's income may exceed the income of the current year, but a person who found himself in that position would have the benefit of deducting from",43,Arthur Fadden
175,Mr Failes (Lawson) [ 3 . 4 0 ],"Ihis taxation liability the amount of provisional tax that he had paid in the preceding year. If that provisional tax was not sufficient to meet the tax due in respect of the current financial year he would have to pay an amount which he may not have expected to pay. Nevertheless, such a person is in the position of providing for the future just as the wage-earner is who pays a high rate of provisional tax in the early part of a year and who receives such a low wage in the latter part of the year that his total income is not taxable. rebate at the end of the year. Honourable members know that it is common for wage-earners to receive rebates at the end of the year. So other types of taxpayers can pay more in provisional tax than the tax assessed and receive a credit for the excess amount paid. But it is legally impossible for any person to pay more in taxation in respect of one year than his taxable income for that year. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) devoted a considerable part of his speech to quoting from newspapers and other authorities. I believe that he did try to string an argument around his collection of statements by other people. A number of the honourable member's quotations were from editorials which did not represent the opinion of the subscribers to the newspapers concerned. But because a newspaper prints a statement in an editorial it does not follow that it represents any great volume of public opinion. But let us assume that newspapers, in their editorials, do express the belief of the public. The leading article of the West Australian dated the 26th October, after mentioning that a deputation from certain graziers' and taxpayers' organizations had failed to convince the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) that he should abandon the modified averaging system of taxation of primary producers' incomes, statedIt is difficult, in principle, to fault the argurepresentations. Therefore, representaments put forward by Sir Arthur for the change in the light of present economic conditions. Taxation methods, moreover, are flexible and always open to adjustment to meet altered conditions in the future. Honourable members opposite have accused the Government of not keeping its promise Mr Failes. to reduce taxation. Do they suggest that if they were in office and circumstancesdemanded that taxation should be increased they would not break a promise to reduce it? I draw attention to the fact that last financial year we very considerably reduced taxation. We carried out our promises to investigate the whole of the tax field. A committee is meeting at the present time and is discussing propositions that have been put to it . That committee can be approached by any honourable member in this House, and He would receive a indeed by anybody in Australia. A number of such propositions and suggestions have been incorporated in the legislation that the Government has submitted to us. Any person of average intelligence is bound to perceive that the Government, by this measure, proposes only to adjust its financial arrangements to the economic circumstances of the time. I do not intend to state all the reasons which justify the budget and taxation proposals as honourable members know that they are genuine and inescapable. The West Australian article that I have already quoted continuesThe five-year averaging of incomes for Federal tax rating purposes now applies only to primary producers. Once again the honourable member for Melbourne, who credited the late Mr. Chifley with introducing the averaging system, is completely wrong. The honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) introduced the averaging scheme into the federal taxation system in the early 'twenties. At that time he was the Treasurer, and he did a remarkably good job. Treasurer. ber who interjected merely gives a further display of his ignorance by repeating that parrot cry. New South Wales, the only State to adopt the average system, did so as the result of Country party tions were made by the Country party both in New South Wales and in the federal sphere to introduce averaging provisions in order to level out fluctuations in the yearly incomes of primary producers as the result of marketing and",46,Arthur Fadden

177,Mr Failes,"The honourable memseasonal changes. In 1936, a royal commission on taxation considered the whole matter of averaging and decided that the averaging system caused great anomalies. It then suggested that it should be disconstarted with floods, this year started with tinued in respect of all incomes except those of primary producers. The royal commission also considered matter that is pertinent to this debate. 16 decided that in the system of averaging there is a considerable amount of wasted effort in the preparation of taxation returns. Every honourable member knows that there is a serious lag in the issue of taxation assessments. Honourable members are continually getting letters from their constituents in which it is requested that the Taxation Branch should make its assessments more quickly. A t times, constituents have written that they owed three or four years' taxes but could not get their assessments. Honourable members opposite will realize how embarrassing that must be for any government. About 80 per cent, of taxation returns of primary producers are not dealt with in the relevant financial year, and of those only about 80 per centare assessed and the tax collected. In other words, only about 60 per cent, of the income of each financial year is assessed and collected in the year. In the light of those facts it would be sensible to abolish the average system which causes those anomalies and delays. In 1938, the Australian Government removed the averaging provisions from all taxpayers other than primary producers. The matter has since been reviewed again, and in tbe light of present circumstances it has been considered wise to remove the averaging provisions from primary producers, whose income exceeds £4,000 a year. are not at present suffering from the violent fluctuations of income that have occurred in the past. In fact, the incomes of many primary producers have increased on a gigantic scale. Taxable incomes have increased at a rate out of all proportion to the average incomes on which taxpayers are being assessed. That is all right for the primary producer while his income continues to increase, but it w ill be a different story when it begins to decrease. If the primary producer is to get any benefit fro m lower income taxes to see h i m the detrimental consequences during a period through the difficult times which are coming, then he would be better off if this averaging system were abolished. I can see difficult times coming. Last year fires, and perhaps next year w ill be notable for widespread droughts. The another West Australian article to which I have referred continuesIts retention (averaging) was intended to protect them against fluctuations iu the prices of their products and from income variations due to seasonal conditions. But the substantial rise in incomes in recent years has exposed weaknesses in the system and, as the Treasurer pointed out in his Budget speech, "" it operates to the advantage of a taxpayer in a year of high income when he is best able to pay and to his disadvantage in a year of low income when he is least able to pay"". Briefly the Treasurer proposes that thc averaging system should be abolished for the assessment of a primary producer's taxable income in excess of £4,000 a year. It is in a period of high general incomes that such a change can be made with least difficulty for the taxpayers concerned. The article then goes on to point out exactly what that means. The honourable member for Melbourne has suggested that primary producers do not want this change. I am probably in just as close touch w it h ' primary producers as is the honourable member for Melbourne, because I am a primary producer myself. I assure honourable members opposite that now that the system has been thoroughly understood, primary producers realize the wisdom and sense of this Government's taxation proposals. Oncei t was believed that the new proposals would apply to all incomes of primary, producers, but now it is realized that it w i ll apply only to incomes of more than £4000 a year, and that other Primary producers primary producers w ill have a right to make an election. In the light of those facts a totally different view prevails among country people. If the contention be maintained that the primary producer has not f u l l y considered the proposals, I draw the attention of honourable members to a report made by the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation which reads, inter aliaThat representations made to the committee on the subject of averaging do not reveal any unity of views, apart from a desire to escape of declining incomes. The most important of it is not necessarily bad. It can only be the proposals put before the Committee were bad if it is proved in fact to be bad. While us follows:(o) Every primary producer should be given the option of making an eleceffect, that is not necessarily bad. In the tion as to whether the averaging same bill that we are considering, it w ill provisions should apply to him. be found that sub-clause (1.) of clauseOnce the option had been exercised 40 readsit should be irrevocable. . . .

This quotation readsIn effect, the collection of taxation from the annual period in which the income is That is a very sound principle. The measure, article continuesa sense the application of the new system and in some cases there may lie embarrassment in meeting the cash taxation requirements because of commitments already undertaken. That is a short-term problem and should uot strain the facilities of rural finance. I believe that it is thoroughly sound. The article proceedsTt should be remembered that many wageiNinierti also had to make personal financial adjustments in the period of transition to pay-as-you-earn taxation. That legislation was introduced by a Labour government, but now that the Labour party is in opposition, honourable gentlemen opposite say that something that their party did during its term of office is not suitable or satisfactory when this Government is in power. It is perfectly sound in principle and iu practice to exclude from the everaging system primary producers whose annual taxable income is in excess of £4,000 and to give to those whose annual taxable income is £4,000 or less the right to choose whether they will continue to take advantage of the averaging system. Those provisions w ill not increase the burden of the primary producer. Some primary producers w ill no longer be entitled to .enjoy a concession that they have enjoyed hitherto but that concession is a double-edged sword in a period of declining incomes as they will discover. The proposal that the modifications sliould be applicable to the year ended on the 30th June, 1950, is retrospective in name only. A great benefit w ill continue to accrue to primary producers as a result of the operations of the averaging system over the years. They are to be required to make a small sacrifice now, but that w ill be of advantage to them in the long-term. During the last few months, the budget either has been condemned as bad or has been described as powerful medicine that is necessary in a difficult situation. Doubtless the harassed Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden) derived comfort fro m the fact that the honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes) described it as being sound in practice, f u l l y acceptable to the surplus revenue to be accumulated reveals Australian primary producers and in accord with all the accepted principles of taxation, justice and equity, but I warn tlie right honourable gentleman that he w ill be very disappointed if he hopes that that view is being expressed throughout the country areas and the cities of Australia. The honourable member for Lawson was quite wrong. Nowhere is this budget accepted as being sound in principle, equitable in its operation and justified by the present circumstances. Taxation has two major purposes. The first of these is to raise revenue to enable the Government to meet its ordinary administrative expenses, pay social services benefits and discharge its other commitments. The second, which has come to be regarded in many quarters as the most important function, is to distribute the national income f a i r l y among all sections of the community. Income tax is now regarded as the most equitable method of achieving both of those objectives. Many surveys have been made of taxation principles and practice. Those who have made the surveys have in every instance advocated that direct rather than indirect taxes should be imposed, and have condemned increases of indirect taxes. Income tax causes less hardship to the various sections of the community than do indirect taxes. It permits a very flexible system to operate under which allowance can be made for family responsibilities for contractual obligations and for the meeting of the future needs of taxpayers and their families. Every enlightened Government regards income tax as the best means of raising revenue and of distributing the cost of national services equitably. This Government has departed from all, the accepted canons of taxation. In an inflationary situation, it has budgeted for a huge surplus of revenue. As I said in a previous debate, that is not necessarily wrong because in certain circumstances it may be wise to budget for a surplus as an anti-inflationary measure. But a necessary condition is that the rates of income tax in operation at that time shall be low. A t present, the rates of income tax are high. The action of the Treasurer in increasing them in order to enable a complete misconception of the purpose of budgeting for a surplus. If the present rates of income tax were, let me say, between 6d. and 10s. in the £ 1 , the",47,Arthur Fadden
178,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [4.02],"Treasurer would be justified if he decided to accumulate a surplus of revenue by increasing those rates, but, in the present circumstances, when the rates rise to as high as 15s. in the £1, it is bad to budget for a surplus, irrespective of what is proposed to be done with it. The Treasurer has made a completely wrong approach to taxation and to the present economic position. In budgeting for a surplus, he has had recourse in a large degree to indirect taxes. By so doing, he has made certain that prices will rise sharply and will continue to rise. That is the very situation that he would have the country believe he has sought to avoid. He has explained that, by a courageous approach, he has sought to stem the rising tide of inflation, but no one in the community to-day will agree that that objective can be achieved by the methods to which he has resorted. By increasing indirect taxes and thus causing prices to rise sharply, he is bringing increasing numbers of people into the higher income tax field. As each adjustment of the basic wage is made, taxpayers in Australia are required to pay income tax at higher rates, and they have less money with which to meet the needs of themselves and their families. Treasurer, by his financial measures, is causing conditions to alter in a manner that he should seek to avoid. The right honourable gentleman has said that, having regard to the present situation, a courageous approach is required. Is it courageous considerably to increase excise duties, sales tax and all kinds of indirect charges upon goods that are consumed, and are meant to be consumed, by the people of this country ? As the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) pointed out some time ago, it is clear that the Treasurer is not budgeting to reduce purchases by the Australian people. If he were doing so, he would not expect revenue to increase as a result of the operation of increased indirect taxes, but he does expect that purchases will increase and that the consequent increase of revenue will permit of the accumulation of a surplus. The honourable member for Lawson said that the right honourable gentleman has that the farmers do not object to the accepted the prevailing view that the modification of the averaging Ur. Tom Burke. The fact is that the farmers do object to it. The honourable gentleman said that the farmers are beginning to realize that the modification of the system will be of great benefit to them. He emphasized that farmers whose annual taxable income is less than £4,000 will be allowed to choose whether to continue under the averaging system or revert to the normal system of taxation. At this stage, let me remind the Treasurer that the averaging system was considered by a royal commission. changed since then. not changed since then. The principal fact that caused that royal commission to report in favour of the averaging system was that the incomes of the primary producers of Australia were fluctuating. That basic condition still holds good and will continue to do so. World prices will continue to fluctuate and so will the incomes of primary producers. Seasonal conditions will continue to vary and, as a result, the incomes of primary producers The will continue to fluctuate. If there has been any change of the position since 1927, it is that the fluctuations of the incomes of primary producers have become greater. With the shortening cycle of economic boom and slump, the fluctuations now are very real and very sharp. quite clearly discomfited by the facts of the present situation, is seeking by interjection to divert me from my line of thought. A continuation of the averaging system would be quite justified, in view of the conditions that obtain to-day and that will continue to obtain in the future. There is no more justification for abolishing the averaging system now than there would have been in 1927. The Treasurer has been responsible for some exceptional moves against the primary producers of this country. I shall not enumerate them now, because I did so in a previous debate. It is obvious system. farmers of Australia are responsible for",50,Arthur Fadden

184,Mr Tom Burke,"The Treasurer,the present inflationary conditions. He denies that he has accepted the view of Sir Douglas Copland, but it was that learned gentleman who drew attention to the incomes of farmers and singled out farmers as a medium through which inflation Douglas Copland has claimed time and time again that the Government should look to the farmers for increased revenue for ordinary purposes, and that, in an attempt to curb inflation, some of their money should be taken from them. It is true that the incomes of farmers have increased vastly. Substantial benefits flow to the community as a whole as well as to primary producers from present prosperous conditions. But what is the Government's approach to companies that are making vastly increased profits out of the farmers? During the last three years, some companies in the motor trade have paid dividends of up to 60 per cent, on the capital invested in their organizations. machinery firms are reaping a harvest from the farmers; and wool-broking firms which, though few in number, are of vast financial strength, are making killings among primary producers. However, the Government, under its taxation policy, passes by the wealthy combines and ignores the large fortunes that those organizations are making out of the farmers. Primary producers must be astonished when a government, the Treasurer of which, is leader of the Australian Country party and the Minister for Comis deputy leader of that party singles them out to bear the brunt of additional taxation. It is idle for the Treasurer, the honourable member for Lawson and the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) to claim that the farmers do not resent such treatment. The Government is placing an unfair part of the taxation burden upon the farmers, and it is making an unrealistic approach to the problem of inflation. Time will prove whether the farmers welcome these additional imposts and the abolition of concessions that they previously enjoyed. Their reaction will be effectively tested when they are given the option of remaining under the averaging system of assessment of income tax. Let us see -how many primary producers with taxable incomes of less than £4,000 a year will choose to withdraw from that system. The Government has imposed a flat rate increase of 10 per cent, upon all taxable incomes. Quaintly, it has claimed could be attacked. Sir that it has done so because such an additonal impost can be easily removed in the future. The imposition of additional tax on a flat-rate basis will assuredly impede production. Such a system is unjust because it does not make any allowance in respect of the different obligations, family and contractual, of taxpayers. The flat-rate increase is a discriminatory tax. Eor that reason it must be condemned. When the supporters of the Government were in Opposition, they claimed that rates of tax at that time impeded production and that the Government of the day should evolve a new approach to the problem of taxation. On each occasion on which thc Chifley Government reduced rates, the Agricultural present Treasurer, who was then in Opposition, claimed that no actual reduction of taxes had been effected because the quantum of tax had increased. This Government is increasing not only the quantum of tax but also the rates. The flat-rate increase of 10 per cent, has been described as a shortterm tax which the Government hopes that it will be able to remove next financial year. The temporary nature of the tax will impede production. Manufacturers will not be anxious to increase production when they know that if they do so during the next twelve months they will render themselves liable for a disproportionate increase of tax. They will seek to escape from this temporary impost. The Government cannot justify the imposition of a flat rate tax on grounds of either accepted taxation principles or of equity. Supporters of the Government have cited rates of taxes in New Zealand, Great Britain and the United States of America with a view to proving that Australian taxpayers, even after taking into account the increases of tax under the budget, will be better off than are taxpayers iu those countries. That is a completely dishonest and unconvincing approach to this matter. Such a comparison, in order",51,Arthur Fadden
185,Merce And Agriculture ( Mr Mcewen),"to be valid, must take into account not only rates, but also total collections of taxes of all kinds in the respective countries, as well as the services, including social services, that are made available to the people in them. In Great Britain, for instance, substantial benefits of a social character are provided. Even the newly-elected Conservative Government of Great Britain has not indicated that it intends to abolish those benefits. But this Government, in addition to imposing these savage increases of taxes, is also levying new taxes which it is attempting to disguise with pleasant names. For instance, persons are now to be obliged to pay for hospital benefits under a scheme that is attractively styled an insurance scheme. The Government will oblige persons to pay additional charges for such services. Facts of that kind must be taken into account in any valid comparison between the position of taxpayers in Australia and in other countries. The Government has not disclosed such facts to the House. When the Chifley Government introThe Government's approach to the probduced a measure to impose a tax on lem of inflation is unrealistic.

Prior to the last general election, when it should have been making an attack upon the vital problem of inflation, it was interested only in bargaining for political power in order that it might continue to govern in the interests of the great financial combines in this country. Now, it has obliged public companies to pay 10 per cent, of their assessed tax in advance, and has sought to justify such action on the ground that the Commonwealth Committee ou Taxation, recommended that it should do so. What an alibi! The Government will reeeive in the current financial year considerable revenue that it would not normally collect until next financial year. It endeavours to justify such a policy on the ground that it must meet in the current financial year certain expenditure of a non-recurring nature. In spite of that claim, governmental expenditure, and, consequently, taxes are increasing.",52,Arthur Fadden

Furthermore, it will not affect those who have a taxable income of up to £6,000 a year so long as their average income during the prescribed period does not exceed £4,000 a year.

I am perfectly well aware that for a reduction of taxation. A few some honourable members, when they enter months ago, another general election this House, do not express their personal was held, and during that campaign the views on various subjects. They are the Prime Minister and the Treasurer warned representatives, not so much of their the people that circumstances had so electors, as of .certain organizations that altered that the community would be comfundamentally have been responsible for pelled to make sacrifices that could not be tlieir election to the Parliament, and, foreseen in 1949.

For example, members of the obvious truth, their pretence that nothing Labour party are expected to voice in this has occurred since 1949 to justify an Parliament the opinions or, say, the Ausincrease of taxation, and their accusation tralian Council of Trades Unions, the that the Government is guilty of a breach teachers' organizations, and similar of faith are futile efforts to discredit the organizations. Government supporters 1841 also have their contacts with every section of the community, but Opposition members tend more than Government supporters to place emphasis upon one factor in preference to another factor. Members of the Labour party, in expressing themselves in favour of the retention of the averaging system, probably argue in the sition. The Government wishes to abolish the averaging system, and, therefore, we are opposed to such a proposal. If the political wheel turns, we shall be in office, and the Liberal party and the Australian Country party may then wish us to restore the averaging system. In such circumstances, we shall be opposed to such a move "". The attitude of members of the Labour party to the Government's proposal to increase taxation is obscured by their reluctance to face certain obvious facts. Their contention, which has been volubly expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne, is that the GovernTo suggest that the special ment has no right to increase taxation after members of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party promised the people, during the general election campaign in 1949, that a non-Labour government would reduce taxes. Bearing that fact prominently in their minds, Government, and, indeed, are not worthy of the Australian Labour party. Opposition members, if they genuinely wish to challenge the Government on its taxation policy, should examine the inescapable facts. The world is trembling on the verge of war. A most inflammable situation exists in Egypt, and in other parts of the Middle East. The war in Korea is causing us considerable concern. Eastern Europe may be likened to a volcano that has been smouldering for some time and may erupt at any moment. Those inescapable facts constitute the test that should be applied by Opposition members to the necessity, or otherwise, for increased taxation and a greater measure of sacrifice on the part of the community. The Opposition, if it adopts that form of test, may attack the Government on the ground that the financial provision for defence purposes is insufficient. Australia has never suffered invasion, nor experienced the horror of being under an army of occupation. could claim that, for the sake of the women and the children, and in the in terests of our national heritage, they should submit the Government's defence programme to critical examination. If they decided that sufficient money had been provided for defence, they could seek to discover whether it was being expended wisely. That would be a legitimate basis on which to criticize the Government, although I , personally, do not consider that grounds for such an attack exist. In my opinion the Government has gone as f a r as it can go, in the time available, to place our defences in order. opposite havo merely introduced into this debate piffling issues that are not likely to raise the status of the Labour party in the eyes of the public. Whatever may be said in defence of the system it is a factor for finances that the way in which that system has developed is, to a large degree, unavoidable, as a result of the war-time conditions in which it was introduced, but the effect has been most unfortunate. Mr Tom Burke. Colin Clark, M . A . , made the following statement in a lecture that he deliveredon the subject, the "" Principles of Public Finance and Taxation"" : We require the responsibility of the Government to the people to be set out iu Constitutional and legal form. Now, on its conduct on tlie levying and spending of money, as on all its other activities, a Governmenit is judged by the electors in due course. The first principle of Public Finance is that a Government will not undertake extravagant or irresponsible projects because it knows that it will have to pay for them by imposing taxation upon its own electors. Mr Clark considers that, according to such a test, we are suffering from a situation that is due to the system of uniform income tax. State governments are expending vast sums in the raising of which they have had no responsibility. I shall not labour that point, but I consider that one of the major factors that has led to extravagance in this country is that the Commonwealth, under the system of uniform income tax, is obliged to hand out huge Members of the Labour party sums to the States, which have none of the responsibility for raising them. Such a system undermines their whole financial independence. Perhaps the system of uniform assessments is inescapable and desirable. Mr Colin Clark, whose ability w ill not be challenged by those who have any knowledge of this subject, considers that it is not impossible to devise an income tax assessment form on which would be stated the amounts that are due to the Commonwealth, a -State and a local-governing body. B y that means, the share of each of those three authorities would be pin-pointed and each would accept responsibility for the raising and expenditure of its portion. I know However, honourable members of no way in which responsibility can be imposed in any activity in rational civilized life unless a person who expends money is made responsible not only for the expenditure but also for the raising thereof. That principle, applies in a simple way to civil expenditure, and with of uniform income tax, much greater force to governmental that is responsible expenditure. I believe that u n t i l the an increasing drain on the main responsibility for raising money is of the country. I admit borne by those who expend it , this country will d r if t deeper into the financial morass and the Government w ill be obliged to impose additional taxation in an endeavour to extricate it . Mr Another factor that increases the drain upon our finances is the destruction, complete or almost so, of voluntary effort in the community. I was a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales when a hospital benefits scheme that covered practically the whole of rural New South Wales was deliberately destroyed upon the introduction of the Commonwealth scheme. I protested in vain. That was a splendid scheme of self-help. It was extremely well organized and very economical in operation. The people were beginning to appreciate its advantages and to give their wholehearted support to it when, for the sake of obtaining a Commonwealth grant, the State Government ruthlessly destroyed it. All that remains of it to-day is the metropolitan section. The Government, realizing that the destruction of that section would cause it to become very unpopular, hastily dug up some flimsy excuse for retaining it and fortunately for New South Wales and also for the rest of Australia, because it assessable for Australian income tax puraffects a big proportion of our population, the section still operates. But the country section of the scheme was destroyed, notwithstanding its numerous benefits, and no attempt has been made since to resuscitate it. I believe that, as mining profits derived by the taxpayer a. result of the wisely conceived legisladuring that year. tion that the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page). has introduced, that portion of tlie scheme will be re-established. mine in a particular area for a prescribed Voluntary effort cannot be equalled by any paid service. The truth of that statement is exemplified by the work of those numerous individuals who, through churches and similar agencies, give service to the community without stint because of their beliefs. They seek no reward other than the joy that they experience as a result of giving service to their fellow men. The mistake that was made in New South Wales was repeated on a larger scale in Great Britain. When voluntary schemes are abandoned in favour of systems that must be financed by governments, the result is a disastrous snowballing: of public expenditure. I shall now refer to the bill in detail. similar character, the Government will It is a very technical measure, but it includes many worthy provisions. Two important objects are to assist and encourage the development of mining and to remove certain disabilities that hamper primary production. The relevant provisions will give effect to a policy that I advocated strongly earlier in the current session when I said that the Government should use taxation deliberately as an instrument of national policy tb strengthen important industries which are tending to decline or which are not being developed quickly enough. 1 specifically mentioned primary production, mining, forestry and fisheries. All those industries are of basic importance to the national economy. The bill provides that expenditure of a capital nature incurred on necessary plant or the development of a mining property, or on housing or welfare in relation to mining operations, shall be allowed as a deduction in conformity with certain provisions that are embodied in proposed new section 122. The provision will also apply to mining operations in New Guinea that are conducted for the purpose of producing income that will be poses. Section 123AA of the principal act authorizes a deduction in the year of expenditure of the cost of exploration and prospecting on mining tenures. The deduction is limited to the amount of Section 23 (p) exempts income derived by a bona flde prospector from the sale of his rights to metal or mineral. I believe that those provisions are extremely wise. However, more encouragement should be given by both State and Commonwealth authorities in the development of new mining ventures. Many commodities other than coal and gold can be obtained by mining. One project in which I have taken an interest will, if successful, make it unnecessary for Australia to import bismuth at a cost of about £2,000,000 a year and will satisfy a. very important demand for a trace element with which to enrich many of our soils. I hope that, by means of this measure and future legislation of a be able to rectify the unfortunate lag in primary production. The granting of tax deductions for housing costs upon a suitable basis that would protect the Treasury would enable us to o vercome many of the difficulties associated with the establishment of immigrants in rural districts. I assisted the New South Wales Parliament to enact legislation that provided that SO per cent, of the cost of a house in the metropolitan area of that State should be allowed as a deduction for taxation purposes. The proportion was later increased to 90 per cent., and then to 100 per cent., and the Government guaranteed the financial liability of the householder with the institution that provided him with the money for the construction of li is house. However, that Government refused to extend such concessions to country districts. A primary producer with a taxable income of £4,000 who wishes to provide a house for an employee at a cost of £3,000, or a decent homestead for himself at a cost of £6,000, is placed in a difficult financial situation. He must resort to borrowing in order to provide himself with cash for his immediate needs. I am sure that the Treasurer, becatise of his knowledve of this subject, will take action, as soon as he is able to straighten out various difficulties that are involved, to provide tax relief for persons who wish to build houses for rural workers. I am pleased that steps have already been taken to rectify certain taxation anomalies that affect primary producers in other respects. These citizens should be helped by all available means to increase production for the benefit of the nation. Members of the Opposition, in their of literature upon which to draw for the youthful and other enthusiasms, would future benefit of the nation. abolish all inheritances, or, at any rate, make death duties so severe that very little would be left for the beneficiaries of able member's time has expired. any estate.

That is also true of many other activities in the field of primary production. I am particularly interested in thisaspect of taxation because I have known many valuable properties to be divided and dispersed as a result of heavy taxation. I emphasize the fact that 3uch estates are assets of the entire community, which will always be obliged to depend to an exceptional degree upon our primary industries. I pay a tributeto the Treasurer who, under extremely difficult conditions, has been able to provide for the needs of the community byplacing an effective brake upon inflation without allowing injustices to be perpetrated against individual sections of thp community. I have a tremendous respect for the value of good books. The legislation of some States provides that gifts and bequests of books shall be exempt from taxes. Books are of the utmost value to the community. Many of us can bear witness to their usefulness in many forms of education. Libraries are repositories of all that has gone before in human progress. Nobody would think of starting with a spade to develop a highly complicated piece of modern farming machinery. The expert would begin with a modern implement and,'applying the knowledge that he had acquired, would seek to improve it. We have a heritage Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner)",53,Arthur Fadden
187,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honortho 10th December, 1949, when the Chifley Government was in power, the present Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) maintained a continuous attack upon the 1 Chifley Government on the ground that it had refused to reduce taxes and to effect administrative economies. The present Government parties made to specific promise to the people that, if they were elected to power, they would reduce taxes and reduce the cost of administration. They were returned to power, and they faced another general election in April of this year at which they told the people that they stood by the promises that they had made at the 1949 general electionin other words, that they stood by their promise to reduce taxes. Instead of reducing taxes, however, the Government, under this measure, which provides for a substantial all-round increase of taxes, including an increase of 10 per cent, on individuals, does the very opposite. The Treasurer also provides for high rates of company taxation and for modification of the averaging system which has applied to the incomes of primary producers. was interested to note that the honourable member for New England in the early stages of his speech chided members of the Opposition for tlieir attitude towards the proposed modification of the averaging system, but he did not at any stage of his speech say .that he supported the Government's proposals in that respect; nor did he say that he was in favour of the modification of the system in the form proposed, or in favour of the modification being retrospective in effect. It he also say whether the Government is is easy to understand why honourable members opposite gloss over the very uncomfortable fact that the Government is not merely modifying the system but also making it retrospective, thus adopting a principle of taxation that is utterly general issues involved in this legislation, indefensible. I am pleased that the Treasurer is New England has pointed out, is connow in the chamber, because I wish to cerned mainly with mining companies. direct his attention to another matter The projected amendments appear to that was debated in relation to a preintroduce some important principles vious tax measure. I refer to the policy that go far beyond the subject of that he, or the Government proposes to taxation of mining companies alone, apply in connection with company and I think that they are worthy taxation. During the course of the of examination by the House. It must last Parliament the Treasurer concome as a shock to many people to learn tinually stated in this House that the Government proposed to introduce an excess profits tax in relation to the earnings of companies. When pressed by honourable members on this side of the House to be definite about the inatter, he said that there was no need to worry about any delay in the introduction of such a provision, because when it was introduced it would have retrospective effect to the 1st July of last year. Although the Treasurer has not said so, he has apparently accepted the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation which, whilst it advised against the levying of an excess profits tax, made certain alternative proposals, one of which was that companies should nav their taxes on the pay-as-you-earn system over a period of three years. I ask the Treasurer to tell the Parliament and the people, so that individuals concerned with companies will know what their future commitments will be, whether the Government has a policy on this matter of placing companies under the pay-as-you-earn system. This year, I he is not merely taxing companies on their earnings for the year, but also requiring that they shall make an advance payment equal to 10 per cent, of the tax payable for the current year, which is to be credited against each company's liability for the financial year 1952-53. I ask the Treasurer to inform the House whethei that 10 per cent, levy is intended to apply only to this year, or whether it will apply to next year and the following year. Will taking this step as a preliminary part of a long-range project to put companies on the pay-as-you-earn system. I pass now from consideration of the to the actual provisions of the bill which, as the honourable member for that gold-mining companies are exempt from income tax and social services contribution. I do not know why that state of affairs exists, and I should like to hear the Treasurer justify it. I am notsuggesting that this Government is responsible for the practice because it has been in existence for some time. is continuing the practice and, in this legislation, actually proposes to extend the concession. One of the provisions of the measure is that gold-mining companies will be allowed to sell gold in the premium markets overseas, where the prices are high, instead of selling it to the Commonwealth Bank at a fixed price. The extra income that they will derive from the sale of their gold overseas will be free of income tax and social services contribution. What is the Treasurer'3 justification of that state of affairs? The honourable member for New England has pointed out, very rightly, that the Government can use tax policy deliberately to encourage certain vital activities in the community, such as primary production. That is a submission with which many honourable members will agree. But in relation to goldmining companies there is not merely a concession, but a complete exemption from taxes. I do not know whether that principle is a relic of the days when we were on the gold standard and gold was all-important. only importance that gold now has to Australia is that it enables us to earn credits, including dollar credits, overseas. The man-power and equipment that are utilized in the winning of gold could be utilized in another manner which would be more beneficial to this country. At present it is used to dig gold from deep mines and to sell it to buyers, who dispose of it. Eventually it finds its way to America, which is the great creditor country, where it is buried at a fort, and an armed guard is set to protect it. That is all the use to which it is put, and it does not help us or the world in any way. I submit, as my personal point of view, that the time has arrived when the Government and the people might examine the position, and ask what justification there is for the unessential gold-mining industry being given such a high priority and 3fr. W. if . Bourke. being granted this astounding concession of exemption from income tax and social services contribution. The concessions that apply to the gold-mining industry are now to be extended-to some degree-no t wholly, to the coal-mining industry. Surely Nevertheless, the Government it is rather strange that the coal mining industry, which is the very basis of our production, should not have been enjoying any of the concessions that have applied to the gold-mining and other mining industries. It appears from the report of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation that the Joint Coal Board made strong representations to the committee for the grant to the coal-mining industry of the same concessions as had been granted to other mining industries, with the aim of encouraging developmental activity and of increasing the production of coal. I think that most honourable members on both sides of the House will agree that the coal-mining industry should receive concessions in relation to capital expenditure and equipment in conunon with other mining industries. Another important and rather novel principle is that the mining industry is allowed to treat capital outlay on plant and development, as a tax deduction. This principle is now to be extended to housing and other welfare I consider that the activities, not merely in relation to the coal-mining industry but also in relation to all mining industries. At first sight that would seem to be a very worthwhile and desirable development, and I gather that the Joint Coal Board was anxious that this concession should be made to the coal-mining industry. I should support, without hesitation, any proposal under which coal-mining companies would spend money on welfare activities, as long as those welfare activities were not to be of a profit-making nature. The provision means that money spent in mining areas on hospitals, medical and dental clinics, child welfare clinics, libraries, sports arenas and play centres shall be regarded as deductible expenses for taxation purposes. That provision will have the effect of encouraging mine-ownurs to undertake activities in that desirable direction, which will be all to the good.

I know of an industry in Victoria the proprietors of which decided to build a number of houses for its employees, but did not allow them to occupy them as tenants. Under the landlord and tenant law in Victoria the tenant of a house has certain rights and can be evicted from it only under certain wdl-defined conditions. If those conditions are not complied with the tenant can enjoy security of tenure. Lawyers advised that the provisions of this statute bill, but this important part that I am could be evaded by arranging for the employees to take up residence in the houses as licensees instead of as tenants. As licensees they could be ejected without being given any notice and at the whim of the proprietors. 'In these days of housing shortage the fact that a man with a family lived in a house owned by his employer with that form of tenure would enable the employer to exert great pressure on him. That is not a proper state of affairs. I submit that these facts illustrate that there is a fundamental objection to the extension of the scheme that the Government proposes to foster under this legislation. If the rather novel innovation in the bill which provides for taxation concessions to be granted in respect of money spent on housing for the benefit of the employees were modified to provide that the employees should purchase the houses rather than rent them. I should like the scheme to be widely extended in the way suggested by the honourable member for New England. Such concessions could well be granted to a wide range of industries, including primary production, in order to encourage employers to provide homes for their employees.

That is the outbreak of the Korean war. Since that time the democracies have bad to make hasty preparations for the protection of the freedom of all their peoples. We have heard nothing about all that from, honourable members opposite. The Korean war, as a part of a world challenge to democracy, is the fundamental reason why taxes have had to be increased. The Australian people realize that, even if the members of the Opposition try desperately not to see it. Can airy honest, conscientious member of the Opposition deny that that is one of the major reasons for greater government expenditure at the present time ? If they do not admit it, their policy is completely consistent with the campaign that is now being waged in all the suburbs of Sydney, and, I believe, throughout the other cities of Australia, by the Communist party, which is objecting to the additional taxation imposed by this Government on the ground that a great part of the revenue raised in that way will be used to prepare for another war. This Government is not preparing for war for the purpose of making war, but because we are living in a world in which we must resolutely face up with the rest of the democracies to a force that is seeking to take away from us the dearest thing in our lives. Mickey ancl Minnie. able member for Watson( Mr Curtin) will restrain himself. war now being made all over the world are the reason being made for world-wide inflation. Great Britain, the United States, Canada and the other democracies are caught up in an inflationary spiral at the present time because of the need for defence preparations. Australia proposes to expend, proportionately, very much less than will be expended by the other democracies. That is because Australia is a young country and must carry out great national developmental works in order to exploit its natural resources and increase its Dopulation. Australia at national works, and at the same time is sharing fully with the other free nationsin the preparations for defence. While preparing for war' and develop ing our country we must attempt to control local inflation, or at any rate do our part to control world inflation. If we are to do that we must curb the spending of, the s-irplus money in the hands of the people. Our national income last year was £800,000,000, or 35 per cent, more than in the previous year. Notwithstanding this vast income, the income tax imposed on individual taxpayers has been increased hy not more than 10 per cent. That is certainly not the terrible thing that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the honourable member for Melbourne would have us believe it is. The additional income tax will produce only another £25,000,000. The Opposition has been pressing for the imposition of an excess profits tax. I remember clearly the frequency with which its members made a similar demand last year. The imposition of an additional tax of 2s. in the £1 on all profits over a certain sum will produce the same result as would the imposition of an excess profits tax. Honourable members opposite were very vociferous in their advocacy of such a tax last year, yet they now intend to vote against it. That tax will produce nearly £28,000,000. Despite the total increase it is still true to say that taxation is lower in Australia than in any other democratic country. Even our great need for money for developmental and defence work does not alter that position. Let me compare the income tax paid in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia by a man who has an income of £1,000 a year. Doubtless honourable gentlemen opposite will agree that that is a very small income. They are in receipt of £1,500 a year, and I am certain that they would like to be paid more than that. A man with an income of £1,000 a year who has no dependents pays in income tax £283 8s. a year in the United Kingdom, £208 10s. a year in New Zealand, and only £148 10s. a year in Australia.

A man on that income, who has a wife and two children, pays in income tax in the United Kingdom £178 18s. a year, in New Zealand £163 2s. 6d. a year, and in Australia only £91 10s. a year. Those figures show that the Treasurer, in framing his taxation proposals, was fully aware of the need to protect and assist families. The accusation of the Opposition that income tax in this country is now at an excessively £34,000,000 will he expended. The payhigh level is not borne out by the facts. The right honourable gentleman has seen fit to make a number of taxation concessions that will be of great assistance Treasury this year an additional to some sections of the community. This year, no tax will be levied upon servicemen's pay. Doubtless honourable gentlemen opposite will agree that that is an, excellent provision. It camiot be denied that, in the past, ago and invalid pensioners were not treated fairly. show the hypocrisy of the Opposition in relation to such matters. During the 1949 general election campaign, the Labour party advocated an increase by 10s. a week of age and invalid pensions, but when this Government increased pensions by that sum, honourable gentlemen opposite said that the increase was not targe enough. invalid pensions are not covered by this measure. sions are paid from revenue derived from taxes that will be levied under the terms of this bill. with expenditure but with taxes. concessions that the Treasurer has 'been able to make only because he expects to receive sufficient revenue to enable him to do so. Old married couples who are not in receipt of age pensions and whose joint income is £468 a year will now pay no income tax. That is an excellent provision. It is obvious that the Treasurer has given great consideration to the needs of various sections of the community. I do not suggest that there are not errors in and omissions from his proposals. We do not all see eye to eye upou such matters. There are certain things that I should have liked to be done, but I believe that, on the whole, the Treasurer's taxation proposals are excellent. The need for increased revenue is apparent. This year, payments to the States will be £38,000,000 greater than last year. Upon defence, an additional ment of social services benefits this year will entail an expenditure of over £23,000,000 more than last year. The payment of war pensions will co3t the £6,000,000. Who will deny that it is necessary for the Treasurer to raise additional revenue by the imposition of increased taxes in order to meet those commitments? I repeat that the present level of taxation can be justified only if the Government adheres strictly to its policy of reducing the cost of government as far as possible. I am convinced that it will do so. We do not want high taxes in this country for any longer than is necessary. We hope sincerely that the war clouds will clear and that then, because a vast expenditure upon defence preparations will not be required, we shall be able to give to the people some relief in respect of taxes. The Treasurer's taxation proposals are sufficiently elastic to allow adjustments to be made quickly. I cannot understand why it has been considered necessary to impose upon property owners taxes that are not imposed upon other sections of the community. I realize that the Government, in doing that, has, as it' were, followed tradition, but I cannot see the justice of it. No section of the community in this country to-day has been hit harder than have the property owners. The rents that they receive from their properties have been pegged much more effectively than have prices. Statistics show that rents, or the incomes of property owners, have increased but little, if at all, since 1939. Notwithstanding that, the Government has apparently come to thc",64,Arthur Fadden

213,Mr Cramer,"I am dealing withconclusion that it should, in accordance with custom, impose upon property owners additional taxes to which other sections of the community are not subjected. I do not blame the Treasurer for what has been done, but I think the time has come when the Government should give some consideration to the principle in accordance with which taxes are levied upon property owners, with the object of ensuring that justice shall be done. I hope that the Australian people are not coming to believe that property ownership should not be encouraged. I think it is fair to say that the property owners of this country are making a greater contribution than is any other section of the community to the maintenance of the standard of living in this country, because,, under the iniquitous laws of the States, they are compelled to make a gift to the people of millions of pounds each year. I agree in general with what has been done in connection with depreciation allowances upon machinery, but I think that an exception should have been made in the case of auxiliary power plants for the generation of electricity. In Sydney, and to a lesser degree in Melbourne, organizations have been encouraged by the State governments to install auxiliary power plants, not only to enable them to keep tlieir factories in operation during electricity black-outs, but also for the purpose of feeding electricity into the general electricity system for the benefit of the people as a whole. Surely organizations that have made an effort to help the country by installing auxiliary power plants should be allowed t.o claim such depreciation in respect of that machinery as will enable them to write off the capital cost of the machinery by the time when it will be of no further use to them. I am not talking about machinery becoming obsolete or wearing out. It is safe to say that there is a war on now, and, therefore, you in three years, or at the most four years, adequate supplies of electricity will bo available in this country. Certainly that is true of Sydney. The auxiliary power plants to which I have referred will not be worn out by then, but so many plants of that type will be available then that they will be worth, as it were, two a penny. It will be impossible to sell them. Therefore, the capital value of the machinery will have vanished. I urge the Treasurer to give consideration to placing machinery of that kind in a special category in regard to a depreciation allowance. I know how well organizations in Sydney responded, to the call to assist the State Government by installing auxiliary power plant, at considerable expense to themselves. If those organizations have to rely upon ordinary depreciation allowances, they will be treated unfairly. I have no doubt that the Treasurer will give sympathetic consideration to my suggestions. The Government's taxation measures are not so dreadful as the Labour party has tried to make the Australian people believe that they are. The taxes thai are now being imposed are not excessive. They are necessary for the welfare and security of this country. I believe that the people of Australia will, when they realize the true position, cheerfully accept the extra sacrifice that they are being asked to make. I am certain that tha. people are beginning to realize that the present rates of tax are necessary, and that they can rely upon this Government to reduce them at the earliest possible date. Silting suspended from 5.58 to S p.m. prior to the suspension of the sitting, we heard the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer), as, indeed, we had previously heard the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) and most of the Government supporters who have spoken in relation to financial measures, endeavour to excuse the fact that such measures are in direct conflict with the promises that the Government parties made at the last general election. Those honourable members said, in effect, "" You know cannot expect us to carry out promises that we made in 1949, and again in 1951"". They invited the House to .believe that when they made those promises they did not know that the cold war was on. Tbey now claim that the Government is justified in introducing this bill and kindred measures to impose heayy increases of taxes simply as a result of",65,Arthur Fadden
214,Mr Keon (Yarra) [8.0],"Justthe war in Korea. I am sure that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), who appears to be about to interject, will not invite me to believe that the leaders of his party, when they made those promises in 1949, and again in 1951, had not heard of the Berlin airlift, that Czechoslovakia had fallen to the Communists, that was taking place in Indo-China, that the Communists had gained control of China, and that bandits and Communists were busy in Malaya. Surely, supporters of the Grovernment do not invite the House to believe that when they made their election promises, in flagrant breach of which these heavy increases of tax are being imposed, they did not know that the Soviet bloc had decided upon a plan of world conquest by either a cold, or a shooting, war. I refuse to believe that they were not aware of the position that existed at that time, or that the Prime Minister, when he promised that his Government would reduce taxes, did not realize the seriousness of the international situation. I should hesitate to believe that any honorible member opposite could claim for lfirty political purposes-althoug h some c>f them have done so-that when the Government parties made those promises they were not aware of the seriousness of the world situation. aware of it? the position of the Labour party in that respect. To-day, Government supporters find that the realities of the situation do not permit them to carry out the promises tliat tihey made to the people at the last general election. In view of that fact, they stand convicted on either of two counts. If , when they made those promises, they sincerely believed that they nould honour them, they stand convicted of having lacked completely knowledge of world affairs and of the consequential defence requirements of this country. Or, if they had such knowledge they stand convicted of having made those promises solely for the purpose of gaining control of dends of from, say, 5 per cent, to 10 per the treasury bench, to the detriment of the morale and welfare of the nation. Is thern any wonder, therefore, that since the budget was introduced the Gallup polls have shown that support for the Labour party has increased from 46 per cent, to 54 per cent, and that, if a general election were to be held to-morrow, La'bour would be swept into office? honourable member to deal with the subfighting ject of taxation. that subject upon the basis on which supporters of the Government have discussed this measure. I agree with them that we must view taxation measures of the Government in the light of the expenditure that has been thrust upon us as a result of the cold war, and having regard to the world position and our consequential defence obligations. But if measures of this kind must be considered in that light, why has not the Government proceeded to honour the promise that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have made time and time again that it would introduce an excess profits tax? I believe in facing up to realities. We must prepare our defences; and we must approach financial measures from that stand-point. As supporters of the Government accept that view, I cannot understand why, when it is prepared to conscript youths of eighteen years of age for essential military training and is anxious that the workers shall do their share in relation to defence in order that the nation may prepare to meet the eventuality that the cold war may develop into a shooting war, the Government is not prepared to conscript wealth and profits that are being made as a result of its expenditure on defence preparations. Why has not the Government been prepared to deal with warprofiteers as strongly as it has been prepared to deal with other sections of the community? Obviously, as the Treasurer himself has enunciated in several speeches, it should attack this problem by instituting an excess profits tax. The Treasurer' now says that the Government has increased company taxation to 9s. in the f l . I point out that that tax really affects only companies that earn divicent.

Last year, it paid a dividend of 120 per cent, and for the first half of the current year it has paid an interim dividend of 80 per cent., which would indicate that its final dividend for this year will be 160 per cent. The Government should introduce a measure very different from that which is now before the House in order to deal effectively with company profits of that magnitude. no courage in that respect. of America is regarded as the best example of world capitalism, because companies in that country are supposed to be able practically to have their own way.

Under the American excess profits measure, tax on company profits was increased from 25 per cent, to 47 per cent, on the first 25,000 dollars of profit and a tax of 77 per cent, was levied on excess profits which were defined as earnings that exceeded 85 per cent, of the average profits for the three base years from 1946-47 to 1948-49, which were record trading years. That tax was made retrospective to the 1st July, 1950, in order to catch persons and companies that took advantage of the panic buying after the war in Korea had got under way and had made excessive profits because they were able to corner the market, which had been upset as a result of the outbreak of that conflict. Under that measure, the American Government took 62 per cent, of company net earnings in ordinary corporation and excess profits taxes. If the United States of America could take such action, having regard to the position in which it found itself, why cannot this Government follow a similar course? It will not be said that the Government of the United States of America is Socialist, or leftist, in character. Indeed, it subscribes more fully to the theory of capitalism and free enterprise than does any other country. However, that Government found, as the Australian Government will find, that it could not expect the ordinary man in the street to pay his tax, to do his part in any defence effort and to be conscripted for military service unless it also dealt with excess profits of companies. Supporters of the Government have said that the increases of taxes are justified by the fact that we are engaged in a cold war that is likely at any time to develop into a shooting war. On that basis, the Government has failed the nation. It has not taken the necessary steps to ensure that nobody shall profit by reason of its defence preparations, or because of the nation's necessity to obtain vital strategic materials. I hope that as a result of this debate, and also of the pronounced swing of public opinion in favour of the Labour party, the Government will examine its conscience in regard to this matter and that if it believes that we sive war it will be prepared to conscript wealth as well as youth. The second matter to which I wish to refer is the Government's proposal in respect of gold. The Treasurer, in the memorandum that he circulated to honourable members, statedThe -purpose of this bill is to exempt, from tax income that is derived by Australian gold producers from tlie sale of gold on overseas markets for industrial purposes. When I suggested, mildly, that the Government might, perhaps, explore the possibility of selling Australian meat",67,Arthur Fadden

220,Mr Keon,"No. The United Statesand other primary products on the dollar market in order to earn additional returns for primary producers and to benefit the country generally, the Treasurer metaphorically waved the Union Jack ancl exclaimed, "" You want to cut the painter"". He employed similar language in ah endeavour to smear the Labour party simply because I suggested that the Government should sell Australian meat and other primary products on world markets in order to ensure greater returns to Australian producers. Yet despite the charge of disloyalty that the Treasurer levelled at the Labour party when I made that suggestion, the Government now proposes not only to allow gold to be sold on the world market but also to exempt completely from tax additional profits that gold producers derive from such sales. He said tliat such action would provide an additional inducement to our gold producers. He conveniently forgets that the trade balance with Great Britain has never been so unfavorable since the end of the recent war as it is to-day. Therefore, it is strange, indeed, that the Treasurer sliould accuse persons of disloyalty because they suggest that Australian primary products should be sold on the world market. making an incentive payment to gold producers. profits that some companies are making, T. wonder whether they require any incentive. Eor instance, the Bulolo Gold which will benefit under the Government's proposal, has made astronomical profits which it will increase by selling its gold on the world market. It will now receive a price of 50 dollars .an ounce compared with the Australian price of 30 dollars an ounce. That company recently paid a dividend of 50 per cent, to by chance, they have any influence with its shareholders. It is not possible to obtain .much information about that company, because it is registered in British Columbia, although a large number of its shareholders live in Australia. I invite members of the Australian Country party to state whether they consider that l.hu Government should give concessions of this kind that are not deductions, but complete tax exemptions on the extra income that those interests will receive from the sale of gold on the world market. Would it not be better to grant tax concessions to the producers of butter, meat, onions and potatoes? Can we wear gold, or eat it? Everybody knows that we cannot do so. The people who should receive the tax concession to be given under this bill are those who produce the first requisite for human life on this planet-food-and I invite the attention of the members of the Australian Country party, and of the "" ginger group"" in the Liberal party, who deal with rural problems, to this matter, because the concession will mean millions of pounds to the persons who will receive extra income from the sale of gold on the world market. The price of gold in Australia is equivalent to 30 dollars per fine oz., but those interests will receive approximately 50 dollars per fine oz. on the world market. Like the original 30 dollars per fine oz., that additional money will be completely free of tax. I hope that the Government will rectify that anomaly before this bill is passed by thc Senate. Mount Morgan Limited is another producer of gold, although it also produces copper and sulphur. Actually its output is approximately 45,000 fine oz. of gold and 3,000 tons of copper per annum, and it pays the "" m i l d "" dividend of 80 per cent. That company will benefit from the tax exemption on the additional money that it receives from the sale of Company of New Guinea, its gold overseas. I again invite the attention of members of the Australian Country party to that concession, and suggest that if they have any influence with the Government have any influence with anybody. But if. the Government, they should demand that the bill be amended in the Senate in the manner that I have suggested. I realize that gold-mining is often a speculative enterprise, and that special provision must be made in cases in which the element of speculation exists; but no one can convince me that Mount",68,Arthur Fadden

Honourable members are well aware that Australia is vitally in need of increased supplies of copper, and members of the, Australian Country party should know that it is desperately short of sulphur for the production of sulphuric acid, which is used in the manufacture of superphosphate. Yet this Government, which believes in the principle of incentive payments, is giving Mount Morgan Limited an incentive to produce gold as against copper and sulphur. an effect upon the honourable gentleman. me to a state of considerable indignation, which is shared by the people who are affected by the Government's taxation proposals. The people have discovered that this Government is prepared, despite its pre-election promises, to increase the rates of income tax that are applicable to persons in receipt of small incomes, while granting tax exemption in respect of the earnings of a company that is paying a dividend of SO per cent. The effect upon the majority of the Australian people will be translated into electoral language at the next general election. Provision is also made in the bill whereby mining companies, particularly coal-mining companies, will be allowed to claim as a deduction for taxation purposes capital expenditure on equipment. Such a provision comes somewhat strangely cheek by jowl with the announcement by the Government of thc intention to sell to private coal-mining companies the life. plant and equipment of the Joint Coal Board. So far a3 I am able to judge, private companies which buy plant and equipment from the Joint Coal Board be greeted with laughter by Government will be able to claim tax concessions, so supporters, because they are never prethat in a few years they will have acquired pared to do anything for the workers. it for practically nothing. ber name any equipment that is common lo the coal-mining industry and the goldis not discussing communism, and I do mining industry?

But the honourable gentleman, when he attempts to discuss the sale of equipment by the Joint Coal Board, is out of order. provision which, in effect, will make a gift of the Joint Coal Board's equipment to tlie private coal-mining companies. The Treasurer has painstakingly attempted to justify the tax concession that is granted to coal-mine owners in respect of capital expenditure on plant. The right honourable gentleman has stated that those companies must be given an incentive to install modern plant and increase their efficiency. But I cannot help wondering why similar provision has not been made for the men who are employed in the coal-mining industry. After all, they have only one lot of machinery to wear out. They have only one pair of legs, one pair of lungs and one pair of hands, which are subject to depreciation. Government supporters interjecting..

235,Mr Speaker,"Order! The Housecan logically class a human being with machinery. with tax concessions in respect of machinery, but also with the tax that is imposed upon the incomes of individuals. I suggest that the employees who wear themselves out by working overtime in industry in order to increase production, should receive special consideration in the form of tax concessions. If the principle under which the Government is granting concessions to wealthy companies is carried to its logical conclusion, how can the Treasurer refuse to grant concessions to the workers to whom I have referred? Obviously, a man who is prepared to work overtime digging potatoes or lifting onions on a farm is entitled to such a concession. I realize that the majority of members of the Australian Country party are not farmers, but they should know enough about conditions in the primary industries to agree that the producer, if he is prepared to perbusiness is good, but when conditions beform extra work, which saps his bodily strength, is entitled to a tax concession. The Australian Country party should demand a concession from the Government for the section of the community that it claims to represent. Tax concessions should not be confined to wealthy mining companies and coal owners, but should be extended to the producers in the community-the people who do the real work. It is quite logical to apply the Government's own principle in respect of expenditure On coal-mining plant to the man who assists to increase production by working overtime. My last comment upon this bill is in relation to the provision under which money that is expended by mining companies on housing may be claimed as a deduction for the purposes of taxation. I am a little concerned at the willingness of the Government to allow coal-mining companies to claim that concession. I should like to be informed why it is not prepared to extend such a concession to the coal-miner who buys the house in which he lives. The Government grants a tax concession to a coal-mining company that provides a dwelling on the coalfields for a coal-miner. Therefore, I contend that a miner, who is prepared to buy a house for the accommodation of his family and himself, should receive a similar concession. The Government should be consistent in that respect, and extend that provision to the man who purchases a house. After all, a miner who owns a dwelling on the coal-fields is more likely to remain in that district than is a miner who lives in a cottage that he rents from a coal-mining company. At present, coal-mining companies, as a result of the shortage of labour on the coal-fields, are willing to provide accommodation for .their employees. But when conditions get a little tougher, as inevitably they will if this Government continues in office, the attitude of those companies will change. I , personally, do not relish the prospect of villages completely inhabited by miners who live in cottages that are owned by the coal-mining companies. Honourable members are doubtless aware of such establishments in the United States of America. The arrangement is most satisfactory when come tough the first economies that are made are effected at the expense of the employees, who are dependent for their livelihood and their accommodation upon the coal owners. This bill should provide concessions for persons who show a spirit of independence, and build their own houses. I should like to see, not villages owned by the coal-mining companies, but a condition of affairs in which miners own their homes, and blocks of land, so that when conditions become tough, they can keep a cow and grow vegetables. Such a diversion would be a welcome break from the coal-mining atmosphere. It would give to a miner an opportunity to work in the fresh air, and to provide for his family fresh food as a result of his own efforts. gentleman should join tbe Australian Country party. of policy was abandoned by the Australia.

239,Mr Speaker,"Order! the Austo the Government as one that embodies a constructive proposal. The Government is always complaining that the Opposition indulges in purely destructive criticism. I hope that a tax concession will be granted to the coal-miners in order that they may have an incentive to remain in the coal-mining industry. The Government, if it really believes that we are engaged in a cold war and that our financial policy must be designed to meet an emergency, should tax the excessive profits of companies to which I have referred. Let it tax the wealth as we'll as the man-power of the community. Let it show the people that it is fully aware of the position. J hope, but am afraid that my hope will be in vain, that the Government will take heed of the constructive suggestions that I have subquently to so-called excess company profits. mitted on this bill. The Government, I realize that some companies pay instead of confining tax concessions to dividends at rates as high as 20 per cent., wealthy coal-mining and gold-mining but the number is small. Occasionally a companies, and to interests that should company may declare a dividend of over be described as war profiteers, should ex100 per cent. The correct way in which tend the concessions to the real producers to assess company profits is to relate in the community. I refer to the men, dividends to the prices that are actually whether they be independent farmers, paid for shares by the public.

We have listened small incomes from investments, mainly to the imaginative wanderings of memin company shares, should be entitled to bers of the Opposition and have been receive dividends only at the meagre rates amazed by the absolute lack of logic in that have prevailed for many years.

Members of the did not make any original or constructive Opposition generally have referred on contribution to the debate this afternoon many occasions recently to the fact that primary producers are in exceptionally prosperous circumstances. In direct contrast to the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne was that of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), whose principal theme was based on an objection to high company profits and a complaint that the bill does not provide for an excess profits tax. I remind him and his colleagues that the proposal to levy tax on excess profits was referred -by the Government to the special committee that it appointed to inquire, into taxation problems generally. Many of the recommendations that were made by the committee have been embodied in the bill. Provision was not made for an excess profits tax because the committee did not recommend such a measure. Members of the Opposition refer freis also illogical on another ground. They continually argue that industrial workers The honourable member for Melbourne",71,Arthur Fadden

Naturally, all sections of the community are inclined to be critical of any taxation measure, and especially one that provides for higher taxes. gentleman quoted a comment by a Mr and to deal with the threat of inflation. Cameron, of Queensland, who first, referred to the sufferings of the graziers as a result of drought and fires and then went on to say that the Government was squeezing the life out of industry. It is regrettable that graziers in Queensland are suffering from drought and fires, but primary producers in other parts of Australia are in entirely different circumstances. The Government has the utmost sympathy for those who are experiencing hardship as a result of drought and fires, but it believes that the more fortunate majority of primary producers is under a considerable obligation to the remainder of the community. Graziers and. other producers who are receiving high incomes should be required to bear at least the same measure of responsibility as is imposed on other sections of the people. The honourable member for Melbourne -juoted a statement by somebody whom he . described as thc president of the Taxpayers Association. I do not know whether it was the federal president or a State president; that is immaterial. The fact is that it is unreasonable to refer to such the first schedule to the introductory an authority for the sake of criticizing this bill. That official represents an organization that has only one view. It contends that taxation should never be increased and, when rates are reduced, it invariably claims that the reductions are inadequate. The association, unlike the Parliament and the Government, has no national responsibilities. Therefore, its opinions are narrow and have little regard for the national welfare. The position of the president of the Taxpayers Association is not dissimilar to that of a barrister who receives a brief and goes into court to do his utmost on behalf of his client in that he merely tries to do the best that he can for members of tbe association. The honourable member for Melbourne also referred to the policy speech that was made by the present Prime Minister( Mr 96d. in the £1, which is exactly three Sfr. Hulme. Menzies) in 1919. That speech referred to tax reductions. The honourable member has betrayed his complete inability to comprehend the problems that confront the Government to-day. He has The honourable ignored the necessity to prepare for war The honourable member for Yarra said to-night that the world situation in 1949 did not justify the undertaking to reduce taxes that was then given by the present Prime Minister during the general election campaign. The truth is that conditions to-day are entireh different from those that prevailed in 1949, and that therefore the processes that must, be adopted by the Government are entirely different from those that the people might reasonably have expected to be adopted when they elected the Liberal party ancl the Australian Country party to power. The Labour party should have regard for the basic principles that mu?' be observed in order to solve the problems with which the community is beset. Since 1949 it has ignored those vital principles. In fact, after having listened to numerous speeches by its representatives in this chamber during the last twn years, I gravely doubt whether it has anv principles in relation to any subject. I shall refer now to details of the bill that we are considering. The rates of tax that will apply under it are set out in resolution, copies of whicli have been circulated to honourable members. The basic rates of tax on personal incomes wilj remain as they were for last year but there will be a 10 per cent, additional levy. I agree with the principle of maintaining the basic rate unchanged and increasing the charges on a percentage basis. Unfair discrimination often results from the use of a sliding scale. I remind honourable members of the Opposition that the sliding scale that was introduced by this Government last year was similar in most respects to the scale that was established by the former Labour Government. The schedule shows that the rate of tax on incomes of from £400 to £500 a year will be 32d. in the £1. The rate for incomes of from £l,SO0 to £2,000 a year will be limes as much. The 10.per cent, levy relation to private companies which will increase the charge on the lower scale have been subdivided into two or of incomes by 3.2d. and on the higher three different companies . so that scale by 9.6d., which again is three times they may be able to reserve a as much. This method preserves the greater amount of actual profit as proportion of the differentiation in the capital. The second loophole is in basic scale. The honourable member for relation to private companies that have Melbourne 8iiP"">e.5tod that, because there obtained tax benefits that were available p was no additional differentiation against to public companies. Where the actual higher incomes, taxpayers in the lower control of a private company is in the wage groups would not have any incentive hands of a very few persons we have to show initiative and enterprise. If a decided that the shareholding which inditax increase of 3.2d. in the £1 is going to cates where that control lies shall be the discourage initiative and enterprise, how deciding factor in the matter of whether much more will an increase of 9.6d. in it is a private company or a public comthe £1 discourage them?

Much of thp years, with the incomes of primary proincrease of volume has been caused by ducers on the rise, they have benefited the addition of special provisions to cover from the averaging system. Now loonholes that were. discovered by comlet panies. We intend now to close up more which, I believe, will begin to operate of those loopholes. One of them is in from this year onward. With incomes pany for the purposes of taxation. Another provision which I consider I believe that company receive tax-free an income of £234 a The basic rate payable by such as superannuation and dividends TheI suppose the most contentious portion of the measure is that which relates to relation to the averaging of incomes. Let us assume, first, that the income of have been, say £20,000, but applies to £20,000, but at the rate that us take the reverse position decreasing the average over a period of five years may be greater than tbe income of the last year of the period. That will mean that the primary producer will have to pay on the low income of the last year of the period at the rate that applies to a high income. He will therefore find himself in a difficult position in endeavouring to meet his tax liabilities. As the Treasurer has. indicated, the averaging provision has existed in our tax laws for about 30 years. of tax we shall find that the primary Eor the first sixteen years of that time it applied to all taxpayers, but from the 1st July, 1937, it was made to apply to primary producers only. This afternoon the honourable member for Melbourne said that it was included in the legislation to assist primary producers. The statements that I have made show that the honourable member was entirely wrong. Is it reasonable that primary producers with incomes of more than £4,000, and average incomes of more than £4,000, who will benefit without the proposed alteration of the averaging system, should be protected to a greater degree than is the rest of the community? Let us examine the statistics in relation to incomes earned by different sections of the community. I should like honourable members opposite to take particular note of these figures, in view of statements that have been made, particularly by the honourable member for Melbourne. 60,000 primary producers have an average income of £5,166. Three million taxpayers who are wage and salary earners have an average income of only £500. There are 450,000 taxpayers-business and professional people and small primary producers, sueh as poultry-farmers -whose average income is between £889 ancl £963. Do not these figures throw an interesting light on the peculiar attitude assessing tax the loss incurred in the prethat was adopted by the honourable member for Melbourne this afternoon? He proposed to give the utmost possible pro£25,000 but because there is still an excess tection to primary producers who, on those figures, have incomes in excess of £5,000. Yet members of the Labour party who sit with him endeavour to convince us and the people outside that they really represent the wage and salary earners. Is there any wonder that when more than 3,500,000 people have incomes Mr Huhne. of less than £1,000, trade unionists and wage and salary earners, on whose behalf no honourable member opposite has spoken during this debate, but whose interests have been championed only by this side of the House, this Government was returned to office in 1949 and again in April of this year ? I believe those people will a.gain return it to office at the next general election. If we analyse the figures in relation to the total amount producer with a high average income is to be subsidized to the amount of 7s. in the £1 on his tax by the wage and salary earners and by business and professional people whose incomes are less than £1,000 a year. I suggest that the line of argument that was adopted by the honourable member for Melbourne shows up rather poorly in the light of those figures. A matter which I believe is causing some concern relates to the tax concessions to sufferers from drought. A man told me recently that this measure would cause great embarrassment to sufferers from drought. He said that he had suffered a loss of as much as £80,000 iu one year. I refer honourable members to section SO (2.) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which deals with that matter. That section provides as follows:So much of the losses incurred by a. taxpayer in any of the seven years next preceding About the year of income as has not been allowed as a deduction from his income of any of those years shall be allowable as a deduction . . . That simply means that losses may be carried forward. I shall illustrate the possible effect of that provision. Let us assume that the actual loss in 1952 is £80,000. The taxable income for that year will be nil. In 1953 a profit of £30,000 is made, but for the purpose of vious year is carried forward and the tax liability is still nil. The profit in 1954 is of loss over income there is still no taxable income. In 1955 a profit of £20,000 is made and, because the profits of the three years have not absorbed the loss of £80,000, the taxable income will still be nil. Let us assume that in 1956 a profit of £20,000 is made. At the end of that period when the loss is subtracted from the profit, a net income of only £15,000 remains. The average net income over the five-year period would therefore be only £3,000 a year. The tax that the producer will be called upon to pay will not b'e at the rate applicable to £15,000. On £4,000 he will pay at the rate applicable to £3,000 and on the balance of £11,000 he will pay at the rate applicable to £15,000. SoI submit that a primary producer in such a position will have received the same protection as any other business undertaking. 1 foresee one difficulty that will face the primary producer this year. He will receive an ordinary tax assessment based on last year's income, plus a provisional assessment of tax. It is generally accepted that this year's incomes of primary producers, particularly of wool-growers, will prove to be considerably less than last year's. Because primary producers will receive an ordinary assessment, plus a provisional assessment, it is possible that their total tax liability will exceed the actual amount of their income in this current year. It is wrong that people should consider that they should pay tax on last year's income out of this year's income. I believe that taxpayers should accept a principle that was stated to me many years ago. It is, that a certain proportion of income does not belong to the person who earns it, but automatically belongs to the Government immediately it is received. So the high incomes of last year should be used to help to pay the high taxes of this year. I have had a good deal of experience with the Taxation Branch and I have always found it to be most sympathetic in cases of hardship, so I am sure that people who find themselves in difficulties because they receive high assessments in a year of low income will have no difficulty in arranging for time to pay. I say in conclusion that I believe that the people of Australia have accepted the Government's budgetary provisions, including increased taxes, in the spirit in which good Australians would be expected to accept them. Had it not been for the frustrating tactics that the Labour party has adopted for party political ends, and had that party been prepared to tell the people, as the Government has endeavoured to tell them, the truth about the causes of inflation, there would have been very little criticism from the community of the Government's tax proposals. can assure the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) that the Labour party does appreciate the causes of inflation and is doing its best to let the people know how inflation is operating, as well as to make it clear to them that the high taxes to be imposed by this legislation would not have been necessary had the Govermnent taken steps to check the inflationary trend. When Opposition members point out the harshness and unfairness of the taxation proposals of which they are asked to approve they are not actuated by party political motives. They do so in order to acquaint the people with the tremendous responsibility that will be placed upon them and the necessity for them to safeguard their interests by ensuring that the government of the country shall be carried on in a proper manner. Very interesting contributions have been made to this debate by the honourable member for Petrie and the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer). Certain comments must be made on the statements of those honourable members, which are not in accordance with the generally accepted principles of taxation. Probably unintentionally, their statement of the effect of the taxation to be imposed by this measure was unfair. For instance, the honourable member for Petrie took exception to certain quotations that were made by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in regard to the impact of taxation. One can readily understand the feelings of the people on this subject when one considers that in the year 1950 taxation was increased by £110,000,000, and that it is proposed to increase it in 1951 by the enormous sum of £160,000,000. Honourable members have been asked to consider the imposition, by means of this legislation, of additional taxation amounting to £100,000,000 in the form of income tax to be imposed on wage and salary earners, primary producers, and public and private companies. It is proposed that the high mark of £741,000,000, raised by way of taxation",72,Arthur Fadden
242,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [8.59],"Iin 1950. shall this year be raised to the higher mark of no less than £957,000,000. It is quite understandable that all sections of the community, whether in high or low income-earning groups, are gravely concerned at the position that is arising and at the ever-increasing burden of taxation that they are being called upon to bear. The honourable member for Petrie described as fair the 10 per cent, additional tax which it is proposed shall be imposed on the incomes of salary and wage-earners and others. ""With this statement other Opposition members and I disagree. The imposition of a10 per cent, increase on all income tax is not in accordance with the principles of taxation that are. accepted in most English-speaking countries. Honourable members on the Government side of the House, as well as Opposition members, have always advanced the view that taxation should fall most heavily on those who are best able to bear it. Although the amount of tax payable by those in the low income group may be regarded as small, a 10 per cent, increase will impose a much greater burden on them than on those whose high incomes are much in excess of their personal needs. Those people in the low income groups who will have to pay the additional 10 per cent, will also have to meet very heavy increases of sales tax on articles in everyday use which are not included in the basic wage regimen. Consequently, one can understand that the impact of increased indirect taxation plus the 10 per cent, increase of direct taxation will impose on them a burden that is unfair and unjust. The honourable member for Bennelong raised a number of matters. He suggested that the increase in relation to company taxation is in the nature of an excess profits tax. If the honourable member would give a little further consideration to the matter I believe that he would modify that statement. Again, in the case of company taxation, we find that it matters not whether a company earns a small profit or an exceedingly large profit which is considerably in excess of what might be regarded as normal earnings; the amount of tax proposed is the same in both instances. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr For instance, the basic wage in Australia Keon) named companies that have made Mr Clarey. abnormally large profits. When, as a consequence of the conditions that are operating in the community, a particular group is enabled to earn profits considerably in excess of those derived by others who are supplying the ordinary needs of the country, the community should be entitled to take a big proportion of those profits into governmental revenue in order to assist the nation during a trying period. It is neither fair nor logical to claim that the increased rate of company taxation is in the nature of an excess profits tax. Another point was raised by the honourable member for Bennelong and other honourable members opposite upon which some comments should be made. When the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) made his second-reading speech he circulated among, honourable members two statements"" A comparison of United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australian Taxes upon Income from Personal Exertion"", and "" A Statement of Income Tax and Social Services Contributions"". These documents have been cited with a great deal of satisfaction by Government members as indicating that taxation is levied at a much lower rate in this country than in New Zealand or the United Kingdom. If one examines the statement headed, "" A Comparison of United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australian Taxes upon Income from Personal Exertion"" one will observe that monetary figures are compared without taking into consideration the different conditions which operate in the countries concerned. They have been stated on the assumption that the income of similar classes of people in the United Kingdom and New Zealand are exactly the same and that a given amount has the same purchasing power in the two countries. In order to help the honourable member for Bennelong-who , I believe, desires to understand the Opposition's point of viewI point out that the figures in relation towages paid in Australia are much higher than the figures in relation to wages paid for corresponding work in Great Britain. is £10 a week. The average rate of pay",76,Arthur Fadden
243,Mr Cramer,The figures are relative.,77,Arthur Fadden
244,Mr Clarey,"They are not relative.for skilled tradesmen in Great Britain, excluding overtime, is between £6 and £6 10s. a week. In the statement, persons who receive between £6 and £6 10s. a week in New Zealand and whose cost -of living corresponds to those figures are compared with persons in Australia who receive the same amount in Australian currency, which has a lower purchasing power than has New Zealand currency. In order to make a proper comparison it would be necessary to compare the £300 to £450 income group in New Zealand with the £400 to £600 income group in Australia. Then one could observe the relative positions of those income groups in each country. Secondly, I point out to the honourable member for Bennelong that the statement assumes that the only tax payable in. Australia is income tax. Yet sales tax has been increased during the last twelve months by no less than £66,000,000. chase tax in England? England is not nearly so severe as is the sales tax in Australia. tax in England is 100 per cent. entirely with the statement of the honourable member. certain commodities such as wines, spirits and tobacco may be more severe in England than in Australia, but the people of England do not pay nearly so much in purchase tax as the people of Australia pay in sales tax. Because the Governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand do not receive as much revenue from sales tax as does the Government of Australia, that Government should be able to impose a lower rate of income tax than is imposed by the governments -of those two countries. It will be found that, after taking into consideration the dual taxation which is in operation in Australia, the people of this country are in a much worse position from a taxation stand-point than are the people of New Zealand or the United Kingdom. Government supporters have simply taken certain figures, put them next to others and contended that Australians are paying very little in taxation. They have endeavoured to establish a fine reputation for themselves in that way. They have forgotten entirely that since the present Government came to office it has in. creased taxation by £107,000,000 in one year and now proposes to increase it by a further £160,000,000, and thereby reach the high level of no less than £957,000,000. If Government supporters regard such a proposal as implementation of a policy of low taxation then their idea of what is low taxation is extraordinary indeed. The fact is that Australians are rapidly becoming one of the most highly taxed peoples in the world, and this measure will aggravate their position still further. I shall now deal with the averaging system, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Petrie. I believe that in departing from the system of averaging primary producers' incomes, although the departure might affect only those with incomes greater than a. certain sum, the Government is embarking upon a very dangerous course of action. It may be said that at present we are not living under normal conditions. It is quite true that our primary producers have been receiving recently very good incomes, but they have come in the nature of a bolt from the blue. They were never expected, but have been very thankExcise in respect of fully received. It is very dangerous for the Government to decide to reverse a taxation procedure that was adopted many years ago after very careful inquiry, merely because of those abnormally high incomes. At a time when incomes and conditions generally are abnormal the alteration of taxation procedures is fraught with peril. ""When the averaging system was put into operation it was pointed put that primary producers were subject to conditions that did not normally apply to other sections of the community. Eor instance, persons engaged in manufacturing, mining, transport or commerce, were not subject to the same degree as were the primary producers to certain natural hazards over which they had no control, such as the incidence of fires, floods and droughts. Those natural risks and the impact of world prices on primary products in any year could so affect the",77,Arthur Fadden

247,Mr Cramer,The rate of purchase,78,Arthur Fadden
248,Mr Clarey,"It is not. I disagreefarmers that their incomes would be either very good or extremely bad. The best illustration that could be given of that fact is the manner in which prices of primary products varied between 1929 and 1940. There is no need for me to tell honourable members of the very perilous position into which the primary industries of this country fell between 1929 and 1940, because the nature of the general economic conditions of that period is well known to all. When a country is producing more primary products that it can consume it must find an outlet for them on the world's markets. If those markets should collapse, in spite of hard work and considerable capital expenditure the return to primary producers could be very low. The whole principle of averaging was designed to take into consideration the abnormal conditions which prevail in r.he primary industries and which are not applicable to the rest of the community. Averaging of incomes was instituted to enable the primary producers to .pay only their fair share of taxation without being driven off the land. It may be a good thing to drop the averaging system in respect of some, people. That is a matter that could be debated. aspect of this measure, and the one that must receive most careful consideration from the Government, is that once the proposed change is made it is irrevocable. The primary producers cannot go back to the averaging system if once again the conditions should prevail that prevailed between 1901 and 1914 and again between 1.929 and 194.0. It may be that what is proposed to be done will cause a falling statutory retention reserve and because off of primary production and very great hardship among farmers, and will be bitterly regretted in the future by the Government itself. If this were being done for a trial period I could understand it, but the Government intends to make a change for all time; and 1 believe that it will do a great injustice to a very important section of the community. There are two other matters to which I wish to direct the attention of the House. The first concerns the taxation proposed to be imposed upon private companies. The la w is to be tightened up to Mr Clarey. protect the community against all sorts of devious ways of overcoming the taxation laws. In so far as the law must be strengthened to prevent people from evading their responsiblities, I agree with what is to be done. But there are certain ways that should be pointed out in which the impact of the law on some private companies will frustrate the national policy of endeavouring to. increase production and decentralize our industries. I am principally concerned about the effiect on private companies of the statutory retention reserve. In mi own electorate there are some small private companies that are performing excellent work by producing goods that are in keen demand. In one of the cities in my electorate there is such a company engaged in making doors, window frames and sashes, built-in furniture and other things required in the construction of houses. This firm is also engaged in the production of prefabricated houses. The company is not big, and it is not overcapitalized. At the present time it is experiencing many difficulties. It is suffering from a shortage of raw materials, a shortage of labour, high replacement However, the objectionable costs and the general restriction of credit. The result of all that is that this company, and other companies like it, have become hard pressed to find the necessary money to carry on their operations. They are unable to put back their profits into the business to the extent that they would like, in order to expand and to purchase raw materials. That is because the existing law provides for a the undistributed profits that can be retained in the business are specified in the schedule to the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act. This bill provides that the retention allowance shall now be the aggregate of 50 per cent, of the first £1,000, 40 per cent, of the next £1,000 and so on, plus 10 per cent, of the reduced distributable income over £10,000. Unless relief is given to small companies of this nature, they will find it impossible to carry on their manufacturing, to replace raw material and to get the financial assistance they need to produce their goods. Thev cannot get financial assistance or new plant to overcome their man-power shortage, and a lot of the small private companies have been placed in a difficult position. The Government should give consideration to an amendment of the statutory retention reserve provision so that in certain cases the additional profits may be used to enable the companies to get results which will benefit themselves, increase production a nd help to decentralize industry. The second matter that I desire to mention has reference to the taxation imposed on associations that may be regarded as charitable organizations, which I believe to be unfair. The existing legislation exempts certain societies from the provisions of the Income Tax and Social Services 'Contribution Assessment Act. I u the main, the exemptions operate in respect of wholly charitable societies or inexpended upon concessions to an. increasstitutions, trade unions, friendly societies, ing number of people, and others have -societies whose dominant and main objective is tbe furtherance of the arts, music, science and literature, and similar bodies. A number of clubs and institutions at present operate on a non-profit basis. They operate in a eommivnity sense and become a community means of giving charitable assistance. are wholly outside the exemptions specified in the act. organization which 1 believe you will agree is very important, Mr Speaker, the Maryborough Highland Society, brought under ray notice the fact that, although all the profits that it had received from carnivals had been distributed to charitable organisations, it found itself subject to taxation on its net proceeds. On New Year's Day the organization holds a very big carnival in Maryborough. Aftei deducting expenses-and very little is paid by way of salaries or wages-the balance is distributed to hospitals and other worthy bodies. This club recently received from the Taxation Branch a bill for £700, which was said to be the tax on the profits from carnivals for the last four years. The whole of the proceeds from its voluntary efforts had already been distributed, and although it has been in operation for about 90 years, its liquid assets total only £350. gentleman talking about what he That is an indication of how rapidly its profits are distributed. I suggest to the Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley), who is now at the table, that such a case should be investigated. The hardship provisions of the act might be put into operation and this club might be given credit for the work that it has done by not having to pay such heavy taxation. I hope also that the other matters that I have raised will receive the attention of the Government, because I think that it is most desirable that when heavy taxation is being imposed every effort should be made to ensure that hardship, injustice and unfairness shall not operate in the collection of it. [Quorum formed.] Members of the Opposition have advanced conflicting arguments. Some of them have urged that more money be stated that taxes are too high. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. Honourable gentlemen opposite have criticized the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) for having budgeted for a surplus of approximately £114,000,000. The right honourable gentleman has said on They many occasions, but his words do not appear to have sunk into the minds of Recently an members of the Opposition, that a part of the surplus will be used to supplement Commonwealth and State loans for public works. We are living in very troubled times. I believe that the Treasurer has acted correctly in having budgeted for a surplus as a part of the surplus will be available for use in . an emergency should one arise at any time. Honourable gentlemen opposite are at cross purposes with themselves. I suggest to them that they confer together and decide what their policy shall be. When the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is one of the foremost men in the ranks of the Labour party, spoke upon this measure, he abandoned logic for entertainment and the applause of his followers, for which he waited. He abandoned fact for the spectacular. I listened to the honourable described as heavy increases of taxes, and afterwards I heard the honourable member",78,Arthur Fadden
249,Mr Turnbull (Wimmera) [9.31],"for Yarra( Mr Keon) repeat, parrotlike, the cry that the Government is imposing heavy increases of taxes, irrespective of the earnings of the taxpayer. The honourable member for Melbourne, in support of his contention that taxes are too high, cited the cases of G. J. Coles and Company Limited, David Jones Limited, and other big companies. The honourable member for Yarra said that those companies should pay more iu taxes than they are paying now. The average person in the community is at a loss to know what the Labour party desires. He does not know whether it desires that the taxes paid by big companies shall be decreased, as the honourable at the 194-9 general election. member for Melbourne appeared to suggest, or increased, as the honourable member for Yarra suggested. The attitude of the Opposition to this bill is very confusing. I venture to 3ay that no other bill that has been discussed in this chamber has given rise to so much confusion in the minds of the public as has this one. Only last week 1 travelled in a train. Opposition members interjecting, very often. When I was travelling in a train last week, a man said to me that the budget was terrible for the primary producers. his reasons, and he replied that the budget would hit the primary producers very hard. I asked him to tell me the source of his information, and he <aid that it was the head-lines in the newspapers. When I asked him to say what he objected to in the budget as not being fair and reasonable, he replied that he could not say precisely what he objected £20 14s, a year in income tax, and will to; but, according to the newspaper head-lines, the primary producers would he hit heavily. gentleman did not say that he was a member of the Australian Country party. whom I have referred has been a 'personal friend of mine for many years. It was not necessary to tell him that I am a member of the Australian Country party, but it was necessary to inform him of the budget proposals and of the objectives that they are designed to achieve. When I had done so, he said that the position had been misrepresented to him. At my request, the editor of the Countryman printed a statement to the effect that I was aware that people in my electorate were being wrongly informed about the nature of the budget and that I had requested that meetings be held in order that I might explain the true position. In this Parliament and elsewhere, the Labour party has tried to confuse the issue, just as it did in relation to the wool sales deduction, which was so beneficial to one or two honourable gentlemen opposite who have returned to this House after having been defeated I have a statement in which the increases of taxes for which this bill makes provision are tabulated. There are very few people in f u l l time employment in Australia to-day who are earning only £350 a year, but that is the point at which the table begins. The tax payable at the present time upon an annual income of £350 is I63. a year, and under the new proposal it will be ISs. a year. There will be a tremendous increase of 2s. a year.. The tax payable upon an annual income of £500 is £8 14s. a year at the present rates, and under the new proposal it will I asked him to state be £9 l is . a year. There will be an increase of 17 s. a year. If the increase were 17s. a week, there might be some validity in the arguments that have been advanced by honourable members opposite, but the increase will be only 17s. a year. The income tax payable by a man who earns £600 a year will beincreased by £1 ISs. a year. He will pay be left with £579 6s. of his salary. The income tax payable by a man who earns £1,000 a year will be increased by £8 6s.. and he will have left to him £908 10s. A man with an income of £4,000 a year will pay this year in income tax £133 l is . more than he paid last year, and he will be left with £2,530 14s. of his income. Every honourable member would like taxes to be reduced. I do not favour high taxes, because I do not believe that they are in the best interests of this country. But neither do I believe that being unprepared for war is in the best",80,Arthur Fadden

The honourable member for Melbourne said, with a spectacular wave of his hand, that if the Labour party were in power now it would still be reducing taxes. If it were doing that, it would not be preparing this country for war. The honourable member for Yarra spoke disparagingly of the Government's scheme under which young men are required to undergo military training. With one or two exceptions, there has been in the speeches delivered by honourable members opposite an undercurrent, the implication of which is that, in their opinion, young Australians should not be compelled to undergo military 1182.000,000 that this Government is raising by taxation for expenditure upon defence will be an entire loss. If everybody in this country subscribed to that view, there would be no insurance policies in force; yet money expended upon insurance premiums cannot be regarded as having been lost if the motor car that is insured is not stolen or the house that is insured is not destroyed by fire. Expenditure upon defence preparations is an insurance of the security of this country in the event of war, which may occur at auy time. Let us hope that it will not occur.

The honourable member for Melbourne said that the Labour Government left a sound economy and left money in the coffers of the Treasury. What the people are thankful for is that the Labour party left the treasury bench. The Labour Government was supposed to have left enough money in the coffers of the Treasury to pay the war gratuity, but everybody knows the actual position. The economy that the Government left had been riddled with socialism for eight years. Young men in this country were led to believe that the Government would look after them from the cradle to the grave. As a result, we cannot exert the effort that we could exert in more virile days. The honourable member for Melbourne cited the president of the Australian Taxpayers Association in support of his case that taxes are too high. He said that that gentleman is not a Labour supporter. The president of the Australian Taxpayers Association, no doubt, is eager that the taxation system of this country shall be a fair training and that the one. If he believed that the Labour party would be fair in its taxation measures, doubtless he would be a Labour suprxn-ter, but the honourable member for Melbourne, knowing that the Labour party has never taxed the people of this country fairly, realized that he would not be a Labour supporter under any circumstances. The budget has been, criticized because it is designed to raise £1,000,000,000 as revenue. When honourable gentlemeu opposite talk about increases of pensions, they say that £1 is now worth only 5s. If that argument were used in relation to the budget, we should talk about not £1,000,000,000 but £250,000,000. Members of the Opposition, when it suits them to do so, say that the value of the they criticize the Government's taxation proposals they conveniently forget what democracies prepare for war. they have said on those occasions. Their attitude is illogical. I am certain that they have caused more confusion in the public mind in relation to this bill than in relation to any other measure. Inflation in world wide.

255,Mr Speaker,Order! The honor,83,Arthur Fadden
256,Mr Turnbull,"I shall now referby the modification of the averaging system. That proposal will affect only those in the higher ranges of income. It is strange that on this occasion members of the Labour party, for party political purposes, should defend those producers. WhilstI believe that the abolition of the averaging system will affect some primary producers rather harshly in respect of the tax that they will be called upon to pay in this financial year, they will, during the following four years, actually benefit under this proposal. That system is of advantage to them only when prices are rising. After prices reach their peak and begin to fall, the producer loses that advantage. Producers in my electorate are now enjoying their sixth successive good season and prices are still high. Many of them whose average taxable income is less than £4,000 a year have stated to me that they will take advantage of the Government's proposal and will withdraw from the averaging system. I have advised such persons to examine closely their financial position before they actually take such a step. Members of the Opposition have claimed that producers generally will be obliged to pay a tremendous amount in tax during the coming financial year. Much of that tax will be provisional tax the payment of which is not in any way related to the budget proposals. The fact that one may disagree with the system of provisional tax is quite different. Provisional tax would have had to be paid regardless of what government happened to be in office. The rate of provisional tax for primary producers will decrease only when prices fall or as a result of bad seasons. However, I do not tliink that any man on the land would like to have had a bad season last year merely in order that his provisional tax for the current financial year would be reduced. Furthermore, before producers vvill be called upon to pay provisional tax and normal tax this year, they will have received their wool cheque, the first payThe three most interesting features of ment of 7s. lOd. a bushel on wheat; an this bill are the modification of the averearly second payment to bring the amount aging system, the alteration of the rates,, up to the full cost of production; payand the alteration of the initial depreciament of an increase based on the tion allowance in relation to industry. difference between the home-consumpThe modification of the averaging system tion price and the International Wheat in relation to the primary producerAgreement price for feed wheat, and has been dealt with most dishonestlyrepayment of contributions they have made to the No. 12 pool. Thus many producers, after having paid their provisional tax this year, may find that such payment is sufficient to meet their tax liabilities in respect of the following year or two. Eventually, they must come out on top as far as this legislation is concerned because,, as a result of the Government's policy,. the purchasing power of the £1 should be much greater a few years hence than it is to-day. Members of the Opposition have had a lot to say about the failure of the Government to reduce taxes and put value back into the £1. As I have said on previous occasions in this chamber, one cannot expect a boxer to win a fight in the first round. The Government has been in office for only two years.. and during the life of the Nineteenth Parliament its legislative efforts were frustrated by a hostile majority in. the Senate. Yet, already, production is beginning to increase in the coal mining industry and in other basicindustries. The Government will be enabled to reduce taxes as economic conditions return to normal and as the purchasing power of the £1 increases correspondingly. I firmly believe that before the next general election comes round the Government will havereduced taxes substantially. Whilst it must make provision this year for an expenditure of £182,000,000 on defencepreparations, it is likely to be enabled to reduce expenditure under that heading within the next few years.

257,Mr Beazley (Premantle) [10.0],"by the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), and, indeed, by other members of the Australian Country party. I shall summarize the position of primary producers over the last five years, and, for that purpose, shall take the most spectacular primary industry, namely, the wool-growing industry. My figures are those of the actual gross incomes of wool growers, and their gross incomes under -the averaging system. They are as follows:Year. Income. Averaging System. £ 1946-47 1947-48 1948-49 1949-50 286,000,000 158,000,000 1950-51 . . Of course, the financial year 1950-51 was income.

The Treasurer ( Sir ments in advance. Arthur Fadden) examined the position, and, while ill in bed, told a deputation of primary producers that they had represents an advance payment of tax been generously treated during the presimilar to the wool sales deduction. An exvious five years. I remind the House, in tremely dishonest feature of it is its passing, that the Chifley Government, relationship to what the Treasurer prewhich he had denigrated throughout the tends is his refund to wool-growers after Commonwealth as the enemy of the primthe rejection of the referendum on a wool ary producers, had been in oflice during reserve price.

That is the real purpose of the he altered the averaging system this year, Treasure]in altering the averaging a further benefit of £62,000,000 would system at the present time. accrue to wool-growers in respect of the financial year 1949-50. It is fascinating to find the Treasurer by an amount of £77,000,000 from the referring to the concessions that were averaging system over the last five years, granted during five years of the Chifley it is most important that we should note ilr. Beazley. regime as a reason why he should not make concessions now. That is a most interesting deviation for a Treasurer who is a member of the Australian Country party. Buti f we analyse the falsity of his argument in favour of change from the averaging system, we find the extremely interesting fact that he is repeating what he did last year: he is taking in advance payment of taxation. The proceeds of the wool sales deduction represented a drawing on the following year's revenue, and he has deGross prived himself of that amount in this Qross Income under financial year. Therefore) he has to alter the averaging system in order to draw on revenue that is really due to Treasurers £ in the future. It is true to say that, over 9C,000,000 73,000,000 the era of rising prices, the primary pro157,000,000 90,500,000 ducer has benefited from the averaging 194,000,000 114,000,000 system. If that system remains un636,000,000 274,000,000 changed, and if prices take a downward trend, the primary producer will pay tax at a rate applicable to a higher I emphasize that the present proposal Whilst it may appear unjust that the primary producer should have benefited the extreme probability that tbe treasury benefited by more than that sum. I mean, by that statement, -that while prices were rising and taxable income was the average paid for the previous five years, the primary producer paid less tax than he would have paid in other circumstances, and had moTe money to reinvest in his farm. Some of that money, of course, was not used to increase production, but some of it was devoted to that purpose. The overall picture of that concession is probably that of an -expansion of primary industrial activities and of all incomes, and, through the income tax, an increased return to the Treasury that wpuld nullify, at least in part, the temporary -concession of £77,000,000. It would not be a concession at all when a primary producer's income was falling. The honourable member for Petrie( Mr the tables that were circulated by the JIulme)., who attacked the Labour party, said that we were concerned not about the man in receipt of £500 a year, but about the primary producer in receipt -of £5,000 .a year. Of course, a producer in receipt of £5,000 a year is an """" average"" person, and that average i -struck after taking into account some high incomes and some moderate incomes. primary producer over the last few .years has been such that, without the authorization of this Cabinet, a food -committee has been formed in the Government parties, the purpose of which is to alter the policies of the Government in relation to primary industries. The 40 per cent, initial depreciation .allowance has not actually been altered nnder this .bill, but the Treasurer has threatened a possible alteration .of it in .a year's time. That concession was made by the Chifley Government ""to persons who were equipping industries with machinery. The fact was recognized that some machinery was not of the high -quality that is now being manufactured, and that depreciation would be more rapid. Many orders for machinery had -been delayed for years, during which the prices rose considerably. In order tc -encourage the re-equipment of Australian industry, the Chifley Government introduced the provision that the 40 per cent, depreciation allowance could be claimed member for Bennelong was that this I as] in the initial year of purchase. The Treasurer now threatens to alter that system a year hence. He has given advance notice of that possibility, and is leaving industry in a state of confusion. The business community deserves from the right honourable gentleman a clearer declaration of his intentions. This afternoon, the -honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) made a loug speech, in the course of which he compared Australian rates of tax with those of New Zealand. He also claimed that this Government had reduced expenditure, and that the 10 per cent, increase of income tax during the current financial year would yield an additional £25,000,000. Those were the three central features of his speech, and every one of them stated a falsehood. The comparison with New Zealand, which he made from Treasure, was true, but the intention behind his comparison was to suggest that this Government had reduced rates of tax in relation to those of New Zealand. Of course, Australian rates of taxation are spectacularly lower than those of New Zealand and substantially lower than those of the United Kingdom; but the suggestion that those lower rates But the position of the are an achievement of the present Government is false, because the same relationship existed between Australian tax rates and those of New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the last year of the Chifley Government. The present Government merely inherited a situation in which Australians pay the lowest rates of tax in the world. The honourable member for Bennelong could not stand in his place, and declare that he had made a similar comparison during the general election campaign in 1949. Indeed, no Government supporter could honestly say tliat, in that campaign, he had compared Australian rates of tax with those of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. That, matter has no relevance to the .achievements of this Government, because it was a situation that existed under the Chifley Government. This government must justify the manner in which it has increased rates of tax since it has been in office. The second claim by the honourable Government had reduced expenditure. tribution. What is meant by "" war-time He described this Government as an rates "" ? Rates of tax were not constant "" expenditure-reduction government"". It throughout the war.

Therefore, the audience that conditions looked very figures are described as tax at "" war-time different from the "" inside"" than they rates "". appeared to be when he made promises during the general election campaign in for the emergency of war. 1949. The right honourable gentleman's admission was really a confession of ignorance; but when the honourable member for Bennelong said that the Governand ment had reduced expenditure, as though of 1943. The honourable member for the Prime Minister himself had not Mallee said that a man who earned £350 repudiated such a claim, the statement a year would pay 18s. this year, compared was not made in ignorance but was a with 16s. last year, if he had a dependent falsehood.

The reductions have not involved real concessions to the taxpayers concerned. A very weak argument advanced by the Government and its supporters in favour a special levy on wool. The right honorof the flat rate levy is that it is easier able gentleman also has not been honest to use this method than to effect a about the 40 per cent, initial depreciagraduated increase, beginning with 1 per tion allowance.

The GovernMany strange events have occurred in ment's method is an extremely bad evasion the world recently, but none has been of tbe principle of graduating income tax stranger, in my opinion, than the rapidity rates. Another objectionable argument used to ask Avhether these honourable gentleby Government supporters is that the men have changed their opinions because overall increase is necessary in order they have been redeemed or merely beto provide for heavy additional defence cause they hope to gain party political expenditure. The budget provides for a advantage by their manoeuvres. I have surplus, but nobody in this House really been a member of this House for a numbelieves that the eventual surplus will be ber of years, and I have noticed during only £11-1,500,000. If the Treasurer has that period that members of the Labour correctly forecast the trend of inflation party have been fairly constant, when in and the consequent increase of revenue Opposition and when in Government, from income tax, it will be the first time in their criticism of the wool-growers. in five or six yearjs that this has been Until recently I had never heard them done. It is extremely probable that the utter even one word in favour of the surplus £200,000,000. Therefore, the Governthey have suddenly reversed their former in en t spokesmen who use the defence attitude. ""Why have they done so? Is argument and then declare that the surit because they sincerely believe that plus has been designed to counteract the wool-growers are worthy citizens, or inflation fail to state any valid reason is it because they hope to curry favour why that surplus should not be derived by raising fictitious injustices and from a more just graduation of tax appearing to defend the interests of the rates under which the increase? would primary producers? fall most heavily on luxury incomes. In the City of Perth alone, according to the Treasurer's statistics, there are 697 listened to a speech that was made by a persons who earn more than £15,000 very prominent member of the Laboui a. year.

I repeat that he said on the occasion to which I have referred that he was not interested in turning the workers into little capitalists by letting them own their own homes. Earlier in this debate the honourable member for Yarra( Mr the dependence of this country on coal. Keon) and the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr W.. M . Bourke) said, I hope with sincerity, that the reason why they criticized the Government's, proposal to grant tax concessions to mining companies in respect of expenditure on house construction was that the concessions were not to be extended to the miners. reason for theircriticism-and I hope that it is-bot h honourable members must have experienced a great change of mind for the better. Every honourable member on this side of the House would be happy if every family in Australia could own its own home, and I shall be delighted if the view that the two honourable members expressed is the view of the Opposition as a whole. I wish to refer to two special features of this bill. The first is the provision for the exemption from income tax of the pay and allowances of men engaged on war service. I am sure that no honourable member will, object to that provision. However, I point out to the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) an omission that might well be remedied. Many Australians who are not members of the armed forces are working in the field in Korea and other operational theatres. I refer particularly to members of the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and a few other organizations of a similar character. Those people serve on practically the same conditions as soldiers do. try should also be applied to encourageThey are quartered and rationed by the Army, transported by it and receive medisuggest an overall encoui-agemcnt of prical treatment from it. To all intents and purposes they are on an equal footing with soldiers, and for that reason tbey should also be entitled to such tax exemptions as apply to members of thc forces. They are not highly paid, and those honourable members who have served in the field know what a high level of service they give. I am sure that the matter having been brought to the notice make the small amendment of the measure that is necessary to grant, these, concesr sions to those people who so thoroughly deserve them. I turn now to the development of tbe coal industry. We all realize how great isMy mind goes back to a speech that, was made by a man who is probably well known by name to many honourable members. I refer to. Mr Hilaire Belloc. He took part in a debate with Mr George Bernard Shaw and MrH . G. Wells in London many years ago on the subject, "" Our present civilization and what it If that be the real rests on "". George Bernard Shaw made an amusing speech and was followed by Hilaire Belloc, whose speech consisted of the following verse:Our civilization is founded on coal. Our civilization, that curse of creation, Our civilization, without any soul, Our civilization is founded on coal. I consider that that verse represents the views of everybody in this House, i'hc^ trouble is, however, that whilst we recognize the importance to our civilization of coal, it is not so well recognized outside the Parliament, particularly by thc people employed in the coal industry. For that reason I welcome the provisions in the measure for the encouragement of"" development of the coal industry and of the provision of amenities for coal-miners, which will be done, of course, by meansof the fiscal weapon. But coal, after all,, is not the only basic commodity on which any country depends. We can no morelive without food than we can prosperwithout adequate supplies of coal, and therefore the principle that is to be applied in relation to the encouragement of development in the coal-mining indusment of the rural industries. I do not mary industries, many of which are now in a prosperous condition, but I do say that some of them require encouragement.. The only, way in which the Government can give that necessary encouragement istbrough tax concessions. The measure proposes that the cost of houses built by the coal-mining industry",88,Arthur Fadden
262,' Mr Ryan,"It has been proved infor minors shall be an allowable deduction for tax purposes. The cost of coal mining plant will also be an allowable deduction. Certain selected rural industries require a similar concession. More housing is necessary in country areas, and if land-owners can be encouraged to build houses, and so make an increase of the rural work population possible, we shall have taken a great step towards increasing primary production. We have rightly, to some degree, abolished the initial depreciation allowance of 40 per cent, on plant, but I consider that in certain specified industries, such as potato-farming, an increase of the depreciation allowance in respect of such equipment as mechanical diggers aud loaders would lead to an increase of production. I recommend those two suggestions to the Treasurer, particularly that in relation to the exemption from taxes of auxiliary Avorkers with our forces in the field. I hope that he will give consideration to them. | .10.37] I desire to T h a t the question he now put. The House divided. (MR. SPEAKER-HON . ARCHIE CAMERON.) Ayes Noes ..lority AYES. Adi'i'inaim, C.

287,Motion (By Mr Townley) Proposed,"Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) [11.4] I desire to draw the attention of the House to the cases of several individuals who have heen affected by the Government's recent retrenchment decision. It will be recalled that on the 2nd October the Prime Minister( Mr he has been with my Department, he has had Menzies) made a statement to this House on retrenchment iu the Public Service. In the course of that statement he set forth a list of priorities in dismissal for members of the Public Service. The list, in order of first retrenchment, was as follows:-Married women, women over the compulsory retiring age of 65 years, men over the compulsory retiring age, single women and widows, persons qualified for permanent appointment, relatives of deceased soldiers, female ex-members of the forces, single men, married men without family, married men with family, male ex-members of the forces. The first case to which I desire to refer is that of MrX "". I so describe him as I understand that I am not allowed to mention names at this stage. nothing to prevent the honourable member from mentioning a name on the adjournment, although unless he has a definite reason for doing, so I do not think that unnecessary publicity should be given to the affairs of private citizens. Mr J. R. FRASER,I thank you, Mr Speaker. I shall continue to refer to this man as MrX "". I brought the matter of his dismissal before the House on the 4th October. He is a man of 62 years of age and had had 26 years' service in various government departments in Canberra. He is married, which puts him into the third last category for dismissal. He was dismissed. Following upon representations that I made in this House, and further representations that I made to the Prime Minister's Department, in which he was employed when dismissed, I received a letter from the Prime Minister. That letter readsI refer to your statement upon the motion for the adjournment on Thursday, 4th October, regarding MrX , formerly. an officer of my Department, whose services were recently terminated. I have looked into this case and find that MrX was a temporary officer of tlie Department of the Interior from 1st A p r i l, 1925, to ment of National Development. He 1st March, 1946, the Prices Branch from 4th March, 1948, to 26th September, 1948, and my Department from 27th September, 1948, to the date of his retrenchment. MrX is a man of 62 years of age and is suffering from heart trouble which very much restricts his activities. During the three years almost six months' sick leave. It has for some time been very obvious to the administrative officers of my Department that Mr X's efficiency was very much impaired and in ordinary circumstances his services would have been terminated. However, in view of his lonjL' services as a temporary officer, the Department sympathetically tried to fit him in where lie could perform some useful function. In implementing the decision to reduce the numbers of the Public Service, a reduction which was spread proportionately over all Departments, my Department, a relatively small specialized Department, examined the position w ith a view to determining how a T maximum efficiency oould be maintained with a reduced staff. In the interests of Departmental efficiency, the services of MrX had to be terminated. In view of these circumstances, I do not feel that MrX should be reabsorbed in my Department. That letter was signed by the Prime Minister, who had previously set out to the House and the nation the order in which public servants were to be dismissed. ' I repeat that in that list married men were in the third last category. However, this man, aged 62, after having had 26 years of service in various government departments, was summarily dismissed. ""With some help he was finally able to secure a position with another department in Canberra. It is ironic that on the morning he commenced work, and within an . hour of starting, he was served with a fortnight's notice of dismissal. After some telephone conversations that notice was withdrawn and he is still employed in that department. The point is that had the Prime Minister's orders been obeyed that man would never have been dismissed. He should not have been uprooted out of the department in which he had been serving. The second case is that of MrY I mentioned his case in the House on the 11th October. He is a veteran of two world wars and an original ANZAC. He had been employed for six years in a professional capacity in the Depart-",96,Adjournment Public Service Commonwealt H Motor Vehicles Immigration
288,Mr Speaker,"Order! There isis not to be dismissed, bnt is to be reduced in status while preference is being given to German immigrants in that department. In response to representations that I made to thc Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) I received the following letter:I refer again to your representations to my colleague, the' Hon. HaroM Holt, Minister for Labour and National Service on behalf of Mr Y, of 2 Leslie-street, Ainslie. You will appreciate that tlie retrenchment? necessarily involve the discontinuing of certain been given preference over many activities. This applied to the work on which MrY was engaged. The fact that the department is continuing to employ German migrants is not relevant to Mr Y's case. The migrants are expert cartographers who have been brought to Australia to undertake the preparation of special maps of resO\irces. This work is for publication and must he of a very high standard. Unfortunately Mr Y's qualifications and experience do not fit him for this task. As you know, although MrY has been employed as an acting draftsman for some years, his permanent classification is that of Assistant, Fourth Division. The possibility of continuing to employ Mr members. Recently the arrangements V in suitable drafting work in some other section of the department is being examined. If this cannot be done MrY will still be employed in the Department but it will be necessary for him to revert to his permanent classification. I repeat that that man was a returned soldier of two world wars, an original ANZAC, and therefore a man who was in the last category to be affected by this system of retrenchment. The third case is that of Mr"" Z "". He is 64 years of age, and I mentioned his case in the House on the 11th October. He w ill be 65 in March next year. He is a returned soldier of two world wars and also an original ANZAC. For three years he had been employed in the housing division of the Department of National Development. He was dismissed under the retrenchment scheme. After representations had been made, I received the following letter from the Minister for Labour and National Service:I promised to let you know what assistance in obtaining employment could be given to Mr Z, of 8 Bougainville-street, Manuka, about whom you wrote to me on 12th October, 1951. I am now writing to say that following his discharge from the Commonwealth Public Service, MT. Z did not ask the help of my Commonwealth Employment Service in finding other employment. However, he was invited to do so if he had not already secured a suitable position and as a result he registered at the District Employment Office, Canberra, on 31st October. Efforts are now being made by my Canberra Office to find him suitable employment and I hope that they will soon be successful. Each of the men whom I have mentioned was in one of the lowest categories mentioned by the Prime Minister when he made his statement in this House. Each should have others who have been retained. I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of his announcement to the House and the nation of the order in which dismissals would be made, he is giving the orders and issuing the instructions or whether his orders and instructions are being flouted by Ministers of his own Cabinet, or by heads of departments? I desire to raise a matter which I think will be of concern to all honourable under which transport has been provided for members of the Parliament have been extended. Ex-Ministers are now provided with a car from the airport to their homes and from their homes back to the airport when proceeding to or from Canberra. Car travel is provided for members travelling before 8 a.m. in the morning and after 8 p.m. at night. I understand that the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale), who is in charge of the motor car pool, is instituting a system of spying on ex-Ministers and members of the Parliament who use cars. Each driver is required to report personally to the Minister upon the persons who use his car. By that I mean that his report goes to the officer in charge at the car depot, but it is for the personal information of the Minister. The driver must report the names of those who ride in his car and their particular destinations. I should have no objection if the system were intended to apply to the use of all Commonwealth cars, but it is not intended to do so. I shall be quite willing for reports upon my use of a Commonwealth car to be submitted, provided that reports of the same type are submitted in respect of the use",97,Adjournment Public Service Commonwealt H Motor Vehicles Immigration
289,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.13],"of cars by every member of tbe Parliament and by Ministers themselves. departmental heads. mental heads. When the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) asked to be allowed to peruse the running cards of these cars, he was told that he could not be permitted to do so. If the Minister wants to deprive me, as an ex-Minister, of a car for my personal use, I shall not object. In my opinion, it is ridiculous that an ex-Minister, on arrival at an airport, should have the sole use of a car to take him to his home when other members of the Parliament have to travel to the city in the bus provided by the airline and then make their own arrangements for travelling to their homes. It would be proper for Commonwealth cars to be shared by honourable members who live in more or less the same area. It is wrong that a car should be used to take only an ex-Minister to his borne. I was criticized because I asked a quesvice, that reply is very significant. The tion in this Parliament about the use of a government car by the wife of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). I was criticized also because I wanted to know how it was that a government car had both a Victorian number-plate and an Australian Capital Territory numberplate. Why is there all this secrecy in regard to the use of government cars? As this concession has been given to exMinisters and members of the Parliament, why should there be a system of spying upon them? Is the object of the system to enable the Minister to make the terrible revelation that when I travelled from an airport in a government car I took in the car with me, say, the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Fitzgerald) and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Anderson), who wished to travel in the same direction as I did, and that the car, in taking those honourable gentlemen to their homes, travelled for half a mile or a mile further than it would have done if it had gone only to my home ? I suggesl to the Government that this matter should be reviewed and placed upon a sensible and proper basis. desire to refer to the matter that wat> Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser). It is obvious from the case? that the honourable gentleman mentioned that the Government does not know whert it stands in connection with the retrenchment of public servants. The dismissals have been made, not on a selective basis as was promised, but in a haphazard manner. Some time ago, I directed to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) some questions upon notice about dismissals from various Commonwealth departments. I received the replies to them only to-night. The first question that I put to the Prime Minister wasHow many Communists are included in thc list of public servants who, during the months of September and October have received notice that tlieir services are no longer required? The reply was that the details are not known. In view of the allegations that members of the Government parties made about the policy of the Chifley Government in connection with the Public Serbest tribute that couid be paid to the Chifley Government, in this connection, is that this Government is not aware that there are any known Communists in the Public Service, and cannot say whether any known Communists are included in the publicservants who have been dismissed. Ex-servicemen were supposed to be the last of the public servants to be dismissed. I asked the Prime Minister how many returned servicemen of World WarI . and World War II . , and ex-servicemen generally, were included among the dismissed public servants. The reply that I received to that question is as follows:This information could be obtained only after detailed analysis of departmental records The administrative effort and expense involved in extracting tlie information would be excessive. Apparently the Prime Minister does not know how many ex-servicemen were dismissed from the Public Service recently. It is obvious that the Government does not know where it stands in this matter, although it stated that the retrenchments would be made on a selective basis.

Doubtless the f u l l story will be known in due course, but the Government ought to know it now. It formulated a policy, and it should have the whole picture before it . Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [11.22] I shall not attempt to follow the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) over the country that he chose to travel. During my experience of this Parliament, which now extends over many years, I have never known the transport services of the Commonwealth, outside of Canberra, to be run more efficiently than at the present time, nor have I known more sympathy to be shown to members of the Parliament in connection with them than is being shown now. I do not intend to reflect upon the transport services in Canberra. them from my remarks only because they do not come within the jurisdiction of the Ministerf o r Supply( Mr Beale). When the Minister assumed office, there was a slap-dash, casual atmosphere about the transport sei vices. When we recall the kind of uniforms, or the lack of uniforms, that were worn by the men who drove Commonwealth cars, and the lack of dignity; and when we contrast the position that existed then, with that which exists to-day, we can come to no conclusion other than that great credit is due to the Minister. I know that he regards the needs of members of the Parliament as a very real consideration. I do not remember any period in the history of the Commonwealth when private members of the Parliament, Ministers and exMinisters, had greater privileges in relation to motor transport than they have at the present time. I deny categorically the allegation that the Minister is indulging in sneaking and pimping. I know him as a man. That is not his character. Mr Ward for East Sydney has made denials in various places which were not believed by his peers in this country, and they said so very emphatically. I shall bring this matter to the attention of my colleague. I suggest that any honourable member who views this matter objectively w ill agree that the Minister is doing a most efficient and thorough job in connection with motor transport. I respect the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr. J. R. Fraser) and the views that he expresses. I say that quite sincerely. But to-night, in seeking to champion the cause of ex-servicemen who have been retrenched from the Public Service he said, by implication and by direct statement, that this Government has no regard for the rights of ex-servicemen and that, as a matter of policy, it is giving preference to German immigrants as against Australian ex-servicemen. I have personal knowledge of only one of the cases that the honourable gentleman mentioned. I gathered from what he said that the man whose case was referred to me has now been offered alternative employment. It I have excluded is not easy in Canberra, where opportunities are limited in comparison with other capital cities, to place a clerical employee overnight in another clerical post. I gather that the man has been offered a position in one of the other Commonwealth departments and, for all I know, he has accepted it . The charge has been made that this Government ^as no regard for ex-servicemen. I do not presume to speak for the ex-servicemen, but I say that on the Government benches of this Parliament there is a greater proportion of ex-servicemen than in any other parliament of the British Commonwealth. I challenge honourable members opposite to disprove that statement. The ex-servicemen of this country know that this Government has a genuine regard for their interests. I emphatically deny that preference is being given to German immigrants. During recent weeks, there has been a lot of sniping from back-benchers of -the Labour party in connection with German immigrants admitted into this country. I interjecting, challenge the leaders of the Labour party to say where their party stands upon that matter. Are they prepared to accept",99,Camebon And By Raised By The Honourable Member For The

294,Mr Holt,"The honourable memberinto this country immigrants from Germany who have been screened by an organization that was established by the Labour party when it was in office, or do they say that they will not agree to the admission to this country of any German immigrants, no matter how carefully they may be screened ? I am becoming a little tired of back-benchers of the Labour party sniping at the Government on this issue, while those who claim to lead the party remain silent. Mr J. R. FRASER I rise to order. I take exception to the Minister's remark that I , as a back-bencher, have been indulging in sniping on this issue. I direct your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that the question relates not to immigration, but to the employment of returned servicemen. is any substance in tbe point of order raised by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory. On the motion for the adjournment of the House, an honourable member is entitled to talk upon any matter that comes to his mind. If the Minister wishes to avail himself of that right, it is not my affair. If thc Minister said anything to which tiie honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory could take exception, I did not hear it. I admit frankly that, having regard to the noise in the chamber, it is somewhat difficult to keep check upon what is said. opposed to the policy of the Government, in connection with the admission into Australia of German immigrants, let the honourable gentlemen who have authority to speak for the Labour party say so. .A policy that they claim to support should not be destroyed by back-benchers, apparently irresponsibly and without reference to their leaders, sniping at it. Ex-servicemen in tlie Public Service have enough good sense to know that tbey can look to this < >--> vernment and its supporters in this Parliament to treat them with a .measure of justice that certainly will be no whit inferior to that which they could expect .from the Labour party. Question resolved m the affirmative. House adjounied at 11.29 p.m. The following answers to questions -were circulated:General, upon notice1. How many professional musicians were deprived of their employment by tlie action of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in terminating its military band? 2. How many of these men were 50 years of age or over'and how many are ex-servicemen? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The band consisted of a conductor and 31 musicians. Alternative employment was found for the conductor and six musicians. 2. (a) The ages of members of the band were not recorded by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. (6) The only military service recorded was in respect of a member who was granted war service leave in the Second World War. the honorable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) asked me a question about a report that Communists in Korea had committed atrocities against prisoners of war. The honourable member stated that he had directed attention to the report on the adjournment of the House on the 16th November and that in replying I had made a limited statement on the subject. He asked whether I had received any further information about these alleged breaches of the Geneva Convention. I informed him that I had followed up my original signal to Lieutenant-General Bridgf ord by sending him a reminder and that when his reply was to hand I would make it available. I now advise the honourable member that I have received a reply in the following terms:No evidence available that victims include Australian personnel. Prisoners of war and missing casualties to 21st November. 1951, are as follows:-Tw o prisoners of war, 21st January, 1051; three missing, 24th April, 1951.

I now in for m the honourable member as f o l l o w s : It has for some time heen considered that the publication oi this bulletin being chiefly related to adult education is not properly a function of the Commonwealth Government and it has now been decided that the Commonwealth should discontinue its activity in this field. Because of the undoubted value of the booklet to discussion groups and teaching staffs, the Government has no desire to see the publication cease entirely and has accordingly made arrangements -with the University of Sydney' for the continued publication of the Current Affairs Bulletin by the university. The Commonwealth Office, of Education and the Department of Tutorial Classes of the University of Sydney are at present arranging the transfer. It is expected that there will be little, if any, interruption in the publication of the bulletin.

F u r t h e r to the answer then given by the M in is t e r , I have ascertained the f o l l o w in g facts r e l a t in g to the honourable member's question:(a) The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is not itself taking any steps to increase mosquitoes in Australia witli a view to promoting tlie spread of myxomatosis. (li) There is no direct proof that the mosquito is responsible for the spread of encephalitis although the available evidence supports this theory. The question of a campaign in the Murray S'alley to eradicate mosquitoes is considered to be a matter of State administration. G ov EIINOR GEN EK A i . . -upon I .

The conversation was continued later at his flat in the company of others. Senator O'Sullivan informs me that such was thc one and only occasion upon which he had any conversation with the gentleman.

Has Mrs. Jessie Street gone to Paris to attend United Nations organization meetings? 2. What passport did she use far the .trip and how was it obtained? 3. Is her Australian passport cancelled? able member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. I am not aware of Mrs. Street's movements and cannot say whether she is now attending United Nations meetings in Paris ov not. In any event, she would not be there in any oflicial capacity ou behalf of the Australian Government. 2. The last 'Australian passport issued to Mrs. Street was issued at Sydneyi n March, 1049. It was made valid for a period of five years, and for travel to all countries. On the 27th Decemoer, 1950, Mrs. Street secured a United Kingdom passport from the Loudon Passport Office of the Foreign Office. This she was able to do because, as well as being an Australian citizen, she is a citizen uf tlic United Kingdom and Colonies, by reason of her father's birth in the United Kingdom. In connection w it h Mrs. Street's application for a United Kingdom passport, some one in London telephoned the United Kingdom Passport Office, representing himself to be the High Commissioner for Australia in London, and asking that the Passport Office should help Mrs. Street. It is perhaps hardly necessary to say that the High Commissioner did not make such a telephone call. It must have come from some person interested in ensuring that Mrs. Street's application for a United Kingdom passport was successful. Mrs. Street apparently desired thc passport for travel behind the Iron Curtain and subseTreasurer, quently visited Moscow. She had attended tlie so-called "" Peace. Congress"" in Warsaw in November, .1950, and was aware that the Commonwealth Government had directed that her Australian passport, upon coining under notice, was to have the Iron Curtain countries excluded from its validity. 3. Mrs. Street's Australian passport is still in her possession. As soon as it became known that she had also secured a United Kingdom passport, instructions were issued that her Australian passport should be impounded upon her return to Australia, it being the view of this Government that no Australian should hold two Brjtish passports at once. Mrs. Street has net since returned to Australia and action to require her to surrender her Australian passport has not so f a r been possible. Arrangements have been made with the United Kingdom authorities to ensure that, in future, any holder of an Australian passport who is about to be granted a United Kingdom passport w i ll first he required to surrender the Australian document.",103,Housing
