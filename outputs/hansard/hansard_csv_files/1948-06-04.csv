The pipe line to Haifa brings over 2,000,000 tons of petrol a year to the port normally, .bnt there have been intermittent closures of the line recently. Of course, there is anxiety about the general problem of petrol supplies. I am not able to give the honourable member any details because the subject is related to negotiations affecting other countries as -well as Australia. However, the problem is causing some anxiety in sterling countries. Post-war Reconstruction whether the Secondary Industries Commission has received a report from the Plywood Industry Advisory Panel recommending the granting to a company of the lease of timber and gold resources in the Bulolo Valley. Would the granting of such a lease establish a monopoly control of plywood through the Queensland Plywood Board, dominated by two major interests ? Will the Secondary Industries Commission take thu necessary precautious against the creation of monopoly control of building materials? Is there any record of a timber lease covering the Bulolo Valley heing recommended about 1939, and, if so, to -whom? the Secondary Industries Commission has anything to do with this matter, but at least one report has been considered by the Industrial Development Division of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. ' Consultations have taken place between the Minister for External Territories and myself regarding that report. I am not in a position to give the honourable member any detailed information at present, but I shall consider the matter and, if there is any information which I think he ought to have, I shall lot him have it. The Department of Post-war Reconstruction -was not in existence in 1939, and unless it has been able to obtain a report from another department on the subject, it would not have any information relating to a report made in that year. to the Minister representing thc Miuister for Shipping and Puel a question relating to shipping services to Queensland ports, particularly the port of Maryborough which, before the outbreak of World War II . , had at least two calls by vessels each -week. Now, despite a greater population and an increased number of industries, Maryborough has had only five calls by Birriba since the 17th Pebruary last. As the lack of shipping has caused much congestion and loss at the port, will the Minister take action to improve shipping services to Queensland ports such as Maryborough? pointed out that the Australian Government no longer controls interstate shipping. If Maryborough is being neglected, the fault does not lie with this Government. I am sure that the Minister for Shipping and Puel will make representations to the shipping company concerned for the purpose of ensuring that the needs of the port of Maryborough shall be met. However, I repeat that interstate shipping 'is no longer under the control of the Australian Government. Mrs. BLACKBURN I preface a question to the Minister for Repatriation regarding patients in mental hospitals by reading a paragraph from a letter which I have received from the Brunswick Sub-branch of the Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and WomenThe members of our branch take a very keen interest in the welfare aud comfort of ex-service personnel confined to hospital, and one of the hospitals, visited regularly is Bundoora.

There is, ancl probably always will be, some conflict of opinion between persons who are interested in patients in mental institutions. I shall examine the representations made by the Brunswick Sub-branch of the Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and Women regarding Bundoora, but I point out to the honourable member for Bourke that the handling of this kind of case is partly a responsibility of State health departments. In the past, mental cases came within the ambit of legislation of the States in which they were located. To provide a half-way house presents some difficulties. However, the psychiatric section of the department, which is administered by an expert, hus segregated mental cases more satisfactorily than was done previously. I shall discuss this matter with the chairman of tlie Repatriation Commission at an early date and inform the honourable member of the result of my inquiries. been drawn to the fact that large numbers of Royal Australian Air Force uniforms have been sold by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission in Brisbane, where they have been purchased by second-hand dealers, many of whom are Jews, and resold to the public with Royal Australian Air Force buttons attached to thera. Does not the Ministeifor Air consider that that practice may lead to persons masquerading as members of the Royal Australian Air Force, which would be unfair to that service and dangerous to the public? Does the Minister also realize that uniforms may be purchased in large quantities for use outside Australia, with possible harmful results to our goodwill abroad? Does he not consider that action should be taken to .remove all means of identification from uniforms before they are sold by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission? knowledge whatever of the matter mentioned by the honourable member, but I shall make inquiries to ascertain whether his statements which apparently he has made in good faith, are correct. correct. able member vouch for their correctness? the Royal Australian Air Force do not tell untruths. do not, but I should like to have some verification of the allegation before taking action.

16,Mr Ohifley,"The honourable memdemands on our dollar pool in order to remit the money to the United States of America, so that Australia does not escape its dollar commitments. However, I do not propose to elaborate that aspect of that matter; I prefer to deal-with individual cases on their merits. If equipment for the manufacture of luxury and non-essential goods comes into the country from dollar areas and if, as a result of the manufacture of those goods, dollars have to go to those areas by way of dividends, even though the capital equipment cost us nothing directly, we should be building up a dollar liability. The honourable member referred to gifts made by residents in America or other dollar areas to people in this country. That matter was considered in dealing with the dollar problem. Discretionary power has been gvien to the Minister for Trade and Customs to deal with the particular cases on their merits. I am referring not to very small gifts but. to ones of considerable value. In the normal course they will be dealt with by the Department of Trade and Customs, but, where there is anything requiring particular attention, the Minister will exercise his discretionary power, after consultation with me, if necessary. ing announce "" a cut in dollar imports "" and the intention of the Government to place a ceiling on dollar imports for 1948-49. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture how this will affect the importation of American tractors and spare parts for tractors and machinery generally, which, as the honourable gentleman knows, are urgently required by primary producers in Australia? question because it refers to the general dollar position. I recently intimated to the Leader of the Australian Country party, who asked a somewhat similar question, that no restriction was being placed on the importation of spare parts for American-produced machinery already in Australia because it was essential that transport which Ave already have should be kept going. The same position applies to tractors. We have endeavoured to obtain from the United States of America all the agricultural tractors possible. The importation of high-powered industrial tractors has been somewhat limited, although we hope to import a fair quantity of tractors of that type. Apart from the importation of tractors direct from America, we have purchased heavy industrial tractors worth about 400,000 dollars from the American Liquidation Committee in Japan. We are trying to get as many agricultural tractors as we can, but their availability is limited. It is hoped that AmericanAustralian tractor companies will be producing in fair quantities next year. One company at Geelong, the International Harvester Company of Australia Proprietary Limited, is making progress with its programme. Chamberlain Industries Limited, in Perth, has met with hitches caused by the lack of material, but, later, it should be able to produce 35 to 40 horse-power tractors. That applies also to the International Harvester Company of Australia Proprietary Limited, which is extending production. Every endeavour is being made to obtain all available supplies of agricultural tractors. In addition a certain number of Ferguson tractors are being obtained from the United Kingdom. These machines are of a lighter type, and are more suited to orchard work than to heavy agricultural work. Unfortunately, they are heavy .petrol consumers. The United Kingdom, of course, is endeavouring to obtain money from markets other than the Australian market, and is exporting tractors to various countries. At the moment, I am unable to say exactly what number of tractors will be available. The figure of 5,000 has been mentioned, but I am doubtful whether that target can be reached. I may summarize by saying that we are trying to get as many agricultural tractors as possible. We are also seeking sufficient industrial tractors to meet the essential needs of the community. In addition, a certain number of light tractors are being obtained from the United Kingdom. As, however, the United Kingdom does not manufacture some of the heavier types of tractors for agricultural or industrial work, we have to look elsewhere for these machines, but every endeavour is being made to meet essential needs.",14,Dollar Deficits

If not, will he request his colleague to inquire whether supplies are available in that country so that, if they are, negotiations which were in hand when the Comcan be entered into for the importation of sufficient quantities to alleviate the present acute shortage in Australia? Supply, and Development is doing his utmost to encourage the greater production in Australia of tyres for tractors and trucks. I shall ask him to inquire as to the availability of supplies in the TJnited Kingdom. The honourable member will be supplied with the information for which he asks as soon as it is available. applicants, and advise them that it was Transport inform the House what the policy of his department is in connection with the distribution of new motor cars, compared with the policy pursued when administration of this matter was in the hands of the States?

Are cars still being allocated for private use instead of to professional men and others who are rendering an essential service to the community ? States concerned. I refer, for instance, to the dentists who are hospital honoraries and are sometimes called out at night to attend patients. If cars are being so allocated, will the Minister alter the policy to give priority to those members of the community who are providing essential service? between the States. As honourable members are aware, the States formerly administered the allocation of new cars. However, at the request of the New South Wales and Victorian Governments, control has been handed back to the Commonwealth. In each of those States, there has been 'set up what is known as a New Motor Vehicle Releases Committee which, in the case of New South Wales, consists of a representative of the State Department of Transport, the secretary of the Automotive Industries Association, and a Commonwealth appointed chairman. In Victoria we have been unable to secure the services of a representative of the State transport authorities because the Victorian Government has refused to co-operate by appointing such a representative. These committees deal with allocations. Those applications monwealth took over were not rejected, although applicants were required to fill in a new form. The old form was retained, and consideration is given to the date upon which the application was originally lodged when allocations are being made. notified ? were supposed to communicate with the necessary to -fill in a new form. It is impracticable to enforce a rigid system of priorities as between various sections of the community because, if that were done, all the available cars might be taken by those in the first group. However, the oflicers administering the allocation of cars have been advised that the highest priority should be given to certain classes of citizens. I am not aware that pleasure purposes only. If the honourable member can cite examples to prove that this is being done, I am prepared to take the matter up with the authorities in the of the Prime Minister to recent press reports which indicate that Great Britain is in desperate need of scrap iron, a commodity that Australia exported to Japan at one time, in order to boost its export trade. In view of the fact that recently a licence was granted foT the export of about 500 tons of this material to America, I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the Government will consider making a drive for scrap iron for Great Britain?",15,Dollar Deficits

There is a considerable demand for scrap iron in Australia by BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, and Australian Iron and Steel Limited. The price paid by those organizations is not as high as that which would be paid by other countries, which claim that they ueed scrap iron urgently, but in considercussing? Does the Government propose ing what price is to be paid for this material in Australia the price of steel has to be taken into consideration. I do not know of any urgent request for scrap iron from Australia being made by the TJnited Kingdom. Requests have come from Canada and also from United States of America commercial sources. The question of allowing the export of some scrap iron to dollar areas has been considered. I need not elaborate that point, because honourable members are fully aware of the desperate world dollar position which, despite Marshall aid, is deteriorating and not improving. With respect to licensing, a suggestion has been made that steel might be supplied . to the United Kingdom from European countries. Although steel production in Britain has increased by 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 tons a year, present production is not sufficient to meet requirements. The suggestion that the United Kingdom should obtain supplies of steel from certain European countries is now being discussed. I have had requests from private firms for licences to export scrap iron, but, as I have said, I do not remember any particular request having been made by the British Government. I shall examine the matter further and supply an answer in detail. ter, in the absence of the Minister for the giving consideration to the subject, with Interior, a question relating to the publication yesterday of the names of the electora] re-distribution commissioners appointed to determine the boundaries of electorates in respect of the new parliament to be elected, in 1949. It would appear from informal lobby discussions during the last few days that some members of the Labour party are surprisingly well informed as to the new boundaries likely to be drawn in respect of their own electorates. Can the Prime Minister say whether any information along those lines has been made available to individual members of the Labour party? Have these commissioners yet held any meetings ? If they have not, and no such information has been supplied, whence would come this information which honourable members opposite are freely disto bring down a plan for the determination of electoral boundaries by the Parliament in the course of this session, or the forthcoming budget session? people must be much better informed about the re-distribution of electorates than I am, because I have not the faintest idea of what will happen under the re-distribution in respect of my own electorate. As honourable members know, two of the three members of each commission automatically qualify for appointment because of their official positions. The Minister for the Interior made certain recommendations to Cabinet regarding the third commissioner to be appointed in each instance; and I understand that in that respect he was guided by the Chief Electoral Officer who submitted the names of men he deemed to be qualified to undertake the work. The only part taken in the matter by the Government, Cabinet or myself is that following upon that recommendation the names of the commissioners have been gazetted. It is true that certain amateur commissions have been at work suggesting among themselves what might be suitable boundaries in particular States. That observation does not apply particularly to members of the Labour party; I believe that other honourable members have been purely unselfish motives, of course. I have been spoken to on the matter by honourable members on both sides of the House who have ideas as to whether representations could be made to the commissions. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is relieving the Minister for the Interior at present, is considering the matter. No member of",16,Scrap Iron

After the commission has considered any objections that may be lodged, it will submit its report to the Governor General. The report will, of course, come to the Parliament for final decision. I understand that the practice is that any persons or parties interested in the matter of electoral redistribution are entitled to make suggestions in writing at any time to the Oommonwealth Electoral Officer in each State and ask that they be placed before the commission. tion of the proposals? made through the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in each State for submission to the commission at any time by people interested in the matter, but the commission cannot be seen personally in that respect. JUTE. the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture gave me an assurance that ample supplies of jute would be available from [ndia to meet the needs of primary producers in respect of summer-grown crops, which are now being harvested. Can he explain the jute position and say why that assurance is not being fully carried out? Supplies of new bags are very limited, at least in Queensland. I. hoped that there would be ample supSUPPLY (WORKS AND SERVICES) plies of jute available for all Australian requirements. No one could guarantee the availability of ample supplies because we are dependent on the Indian jute reported. exporters and the Government of India, but every step possible to assure adequate supplies is being taken. PIG MEATS. other pig meats are urgently needed by people of the United Kingdom. At a meeting of primary producers which I attended recently in my electorate, complaints were made about the price received under the current contract with the Government of the United Kingdom. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether a new contract is being negotiated to take the place of the one which expires in September next? Are the representatives of the primary producers being consulted on the matter of price, and, if not, will the Government consult them? ago this Parliament passed legislation to reconstitute the Australian Meat Board, upon which there are now repre; sentatives of those engaged in the produc-. tion of beef, mutton, and pig meats. There is in force a contract with the Government of the United Kingdom for the purchase of those meats, and the time has now arrived when the terms of that contract are to be reviewed. The Australian Meat Board, as the properly constituted authority, has indicated to the Australian Government the range of prices which it believes ought to be paid by the Government of the United Kingdom. The Australian Government has considered that recommendation, and has in turn advised the Government of the United Kingdom what prices ought, in its opinion, to be paid under the new contract.

42,Mr Mcleod (Wannon) [11.15],"protagonist of the primary industries of Australia, is more concerned about the interests of the speculators than the well being of the man on the land. Therefore, we are amazed when we hear the honourable member for Indi and his colleagues complaining that, under this -agreement, wheat-growers will be forced to forfeit the advantage of high current prices. The honourable member declared that the growers could obtain f l a bushel anywhere to-day. He was supported by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull). That statement is not correct. The honourable gentleman referred to a world parity price for wheat. There is no such thing to-day. A few small shipments of wheat have been sold to some countries at a price of about Â£ l a bushel, or perhaps % higher, hut it would not be possible to obtain that price for Ihe whole of Australia's export surplus on the world market to-day. Anybody who studies futures on the Chicago speculators' -market knows that the world price to-day is about los. a bushel. Therefore, it -does not seem that a price of Â£1 a bushel, -or even higher, will be obtainable for many years. This Government realizes that fact and is planning for the future .accordingly. The practical wheat-grower also looks should not judge other nations by the to the future. He knows that the present standards which they apply to themselves. price is fantastic and must fall. We are not prepared to say to him, "" Leave things as they are, and you can hoe your own row when the price comes down to 3s. a Saturday. bushel again"". The farmers have had bitter lessons in the past.

What would happen to us if we were not a party to this international agreement and had to try to find our own markets in the world? Where would we find ships to carry our wheat overseas? Great Britain, one of the greatest purchasers of wheat under the agreement, virtually controls our shipping resources. The members of the Australian Country party have not explained their motives in opposing this measure. I am honest, and I have no hesitation in explaining the Government's motive. Our object is to avoid any future depression in the wheat industry. The Australian Country party does not caro what happens to the wheat-farmers. It is completely irresponsible in these matters. It always has been, and always will be, irresponsible. Its members have employed puerile arguments in an effort to justify their opposition to the agreement. They say that we cannot trust the other signatories to the agreement. That is ridiculous. How could nations make agreements amongst themselves if that were so? Can we trust nobody? Members of the Australian Country party have suspicious minds simply because they themselves are not trustworthy. They have betrayed the wheat-growers time and time again.

46,Mr Mcleod,"The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) did not rush to the aid of the wheat growers when he said, a few years ago, that he would not give them anything. He ought to pipe down. There are two sides to any agreement. Great Britain, one of the buying countries, was not anxious to join in the agreement last year. It looked upon the matter as a business proposition. It knew from experience that high prices for wheat could not continue and, therefore, it was not anxious to commit itself. Its Government considered at that time that a price of even 12s. a bushel was too high, because it expected a considerable reduction within a few years. Honourable members opposite ignore the inevitability of a price reduction. Posing as the champions of the wheat-growers, they urge the farmers not to enter into an agreement that will stabilize their industry for the next five years. The buying countries, realizing the uncertainty of future events, were quite willing to gamble and allow events to take their natural course in the hope that they could get wheat cheaply a few years hence. However, after considering all aspects of world economy, they decided that the wisest course would be to reach an agreement and reap the reward of any concessions they might make through the channels of reciprocal trade. They realized that, if they bought wheat cheaply, they would not be able to sell their ownproducts to the exporting countries. Members of the Australian Country party do not understand the views of the farmers because they are not practical men. The farmers now know what to expect for the next five years. TJnder this agreement they can look forward to a price of 12s. a bushel. story that the Australian Country party tells. The farmers will be able to get that price over the full period of five years if world prices remain high. Furthermore, they know that, during the first year of the currency of the agreement, they cannot receive less than 9s. a* bushel. They also know that, during the second year, they may continue to get 12s. a bushel if world prices remain high, and that they cannot get less than 8s. 6d. a bushel. In the third year, the guaranteed floor price will be 8s. a Bushel. It is comforting for a wheat-farmer to know that he can rely on those prices. In the old days, the producers always felt insecure because they could not foretell what returns they would get for their crops. They had no sense of security in the days when they received a first advance of Is. 5d. a bushel from the Menzies-Fadden Government To-day, they can look forward to five years of reasonable prosperity. A great deal can happen in five years. Probably at the <md of that period the world price will he down again to 3s. or 4s. a bushel. Nevertheless, the growers know that the lowest price they will receive under the agreement will be 6s. a bushel. The Opposition has not employed any legitimate argument against the agreement. Its terms are wise and necessary for the welfare of all countries which are parties to it. I hope that the system of fixing guaranteed floor prices for primary products will continue to operate. It has already benefited the wool industry, to which it was introduced by a Labour government. The knowledge that their returns cannot fall below a certain level enables producers to work on a business like basis. I recall when wool was sold in 1939 at lOd. a lb. The producers were not consulted then by the honourable members who now complain that the wheat-growers were not consulted about this Government's stabilization plan. I should like to test the sincerity of honourable members opposite. The honourable memher for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), for instance, said that the growers were not consulted about the wheat agreement. Will he tell me who represented the Australian wool-growers at the conference at which an agreement was made to sell Australian wool at lOd. a lb? I have asked that question many times, but the honourable member and his colleagues have remained dumb. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) will be able to tell the House about the consultations that preceded the making of the wheat agreement. High prices are always welcome, but they have always proved to be a weak reed to those who have placed trust in them in the past",20,International Wheat Agreement Bill 1948 Second Reading

The honourable member for Barker'must refrain from interjecting. whether Japan ever paid for that wheat. I now propose to test the sincerity of honourable members of the Australian Country party by referring to their political record. Why should they always oppose any plans for the stabilization of the wheat industry? The present agreement is a great international plan for stabilization. I realize that members of the Australian Country party do not, like to be reminded of their murky record, and their lack of concern for the welfare of the primary producers. moments, I shall read some remarks of a man who is typical of the genuine Australian Country party representative in the early days of the history of this political organization. Stewart, who formed the Australian Country party, was really a Labour man. After a few years, memhers of the Australian Country party, like the right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden), sold out the farmer. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) said last night, the Australian Country party is financed by vested interests. That is the simple truth. dence of it . ber does not drive around in a gig, as Mr P. G. Stewart did when he was organizing the farmers to support the Australian Country party. No t long after the formation of this party, the big vested interests secured control. There are still many primary producers who believe in the original Australian Country party. They are the genuine men. I propose to read some of the remarks of a typical old-style member of the Australian Country party, Mr. G. C. Marshman, as reported in The Wheat-grower on the 19 th June, 1946. Mr Marshman was a delegate of the Association at a conference of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation held representative on the Wheat Quality Oommittee in Victoria. He speaks the truth, and I like a man who does so. He recalled some of the experiences of am doubtful the wheat industry, and warned growers against those who, he said, "" n o w piped a different tune andposed as growers' representatives "". He statedAt the last Country party conference I listened to the debate on the wheat stabilization plan when thc resolution was carried asking for os. 2d. a bushel at growers' speech in favour of this motion. As I listened, my mind went back a very few years and I reflected on a visit that 1 paid to Canberra with a deputation from the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers' AssociaI n a few tion, when we requested the MenziesCoun try party Government to make a payment of 3d. a bushel to growers on wheat that had been delivered to the 1939-40 Pool. A request for 3d. a bushel was very Mr P. G. modest. Mr Marshman continuedDuring that visit, we interviewed Mr Cameron, the then Minister for Commerce, and were in no way encouraged by his attitude towards us Evidently the honourable member for Barker was in one of his Scotch moods",21,International Wheat Agreement Bill 1948 Second Reading

The reply we received was: "" I refuse to embarrass the Government on such a matter at this time"" . The criticisms of members of the Australian Country party, which I have uttered to date, have been mild compared with those spoken by Mr Marshman who also saidI t so happened that a short time previous to this visit to Canberra, the association had written to all Victorian members of the Federal House requesting that each should declare his attitude towards the association's efforts for just treatment for the growers, pointing out in this circular that, if support was not offered we would be compelled to pledge our support to a candidate who would foster our claims. I invite honourable members to listen to what the honourable member for Indi said according to Mr Marshman, who statedmenibers of the deputation were in his room at Parliament House, Canberra, he referred to this circular, which was on his tabic,, and angrily remarked that be resented such an approach to hiin and would ignore tlie circular and the body that sent it . Now he poses as the growers' champion Yet the deputation asked for only 3d. a bushel. Mr Marshman went on to sayAnother Anstralian Country party member interviewed on this occasion was Sir Earle Page and, when he learned the nature of our mission, calmly and deliberately told us tliat we would need to decrease our wheat production, and, to augment our returns from wheat-growing, turn to dairying. The right honourable member for Cowper advised the practical wheat-growers of the Wimmera to reduce their wheat production and to engage in dairying. It was a toss-up at that time whether a primary producer would lose more money in wheat-growing or dairying. Mr were opposed to the agreement. I propose Marshman continuedHe instanced several districts from his elecis a newspaper circulating in the torate where men had gone in extensively for dairying on river frontages and made good. Honourable members should see the number of river frontages in the Wimmera! The truth is that there is only one river man continuesI am citing these eases in order that growers may see very clearly that the guaranteed price as set out in the present scheme is being used Mr Marshman proas a -political football. The government of the day, when our wheat pool was brought into operation, and a Wheat Board appointed, did not seek the assistance of growers, but made the appointments from firms and trading companies who had long been making money out of the growers. We must not disturb the profits of thevested interests which so substantially support the finances of the Australian Country party! I agree with the followThe explanation given was that it was desired' that the ordinary channels of trade should not be disturbed more than was absolutely necessary. I find it particularly difficult to reconcile the men that were and the men that are, and would warn growers to be most cautious about taking action to destroy a substance whilst they go out to chase a shadow. Those statements prove that the opposition which members of the Australian Country party have expressed to the International Wheat Agreement is consistent with their disregard of the interests of wheat-growers over the years when the growers were experiencing severehardships and were in a seriousfinancial position. By ratifying the International Wheat Agreement, the Australian Government is endeavouring to prevent a repetition of thoseconditions, but vested interests and their representatives in this House, who have never exhibited any concern for the welfare of wheat-growers, are opposing it. LaterI shall read more extracts from Mr Marshman, because the Australian people., and particularly the wheat-growers, some of whom still placetheir confidence in the Australian Country party, should be told about them, but I wish first to quote from another newspaper report. Last night, the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) said that 90 per cent, of the farmers in his electorateto quote from the Kaniva Times, which Wimmera district. newspaper. because it does circulate in the Wimmera district.

65,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr,"Unlike members of the Australian Country party, he kas the courage of his convictions and speaks the truth as he sees it on every occasion. He voted against the proposal for organized marketing and against the social services proposal, and is at least honest and consistent in his attitude. However, I propose to deal with the attitude adopted by some members of the Australian Country party. The honourable member for Wimmera contended that the Government proposed to ratify defiance of the wishes of the wheat growers. a government? The function of the Government is to protect the people, and, in the case of the wheat-farmers, to protect them from the Australian Country party. Members of that political party have had their day, and we know what they did when their party was represented in a former government. The wheat-growers who were operating on a small scale were never in so bad a plight, and, as the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Langtry) explained so graphically yesterday, members of the Australian Oountry party would like to see such wheat-growers placed in that plight once more. According to the honourable member for Wimmera, the Government has no right to do anything to benefit the industry. suffers when the price of our primary produce falls. He mentioned the world parity price of wheat, but I do not think rhat he really knew what he was talking iibout, because there is no such thing as a world parity price. Of course, if the price of wheat fell to 2s. or 3s. a bushel, he would be among the first to cry out for the introduction of a stabilization plan. He inquired rhetorically whether the Australian wheat-growers were the envy of the world under the present Government. [ believe that I can demonstrate that they are. He complained of the high taxes which Australians have to pay, but, after all, taxes are not as high in this country as they are in Great Britain or in New Zealand. The Australian Â£1 will purchase more in this country than will the English Â£1 in Great Britain, and I think that that is one of the best answers to the honourable member's criticism. Why are millions of dollars of American capital being invested in this country I Surely that does not indicate that other countries regard us as being down and. out. Are we a contented people? The honourable member mentioned that women have to stand in queues. I do not know of any queues, except perhaps cigarette queues, in which there is any need for women in Australia to stand to-day. I remind the honourable member of the dolequeues that were in existence when anti-Labour governments were in power. They the agreement in do not exist to-day and we do not want to see them again. The honourable member What is the function of said that any one who supports the Labour Government must be in its pay. I do not propose to reply to that remark,, because the honourable member obviously does not know very much about it. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton) showed in the speech he madelast night that he has not the courage of his convictions. He said that hebelieved in the International Wheat Agreement "" in principle "", and, having said that, he proceeded to make a vicious attack upon it. I ask honourable members to contrast the attitude of the honourable member for Swan with that of the honourable member for Barker. The latter has the courage to stand up for his He forgets that every one convictions, but the honourable member for Swan is afraid to state his convictions or to stand by them.. He wishes to pose as a farmers' representative. A few years ago he was himself down and out. He was kicked, but to-day he is licking the boots of those who kicked him. My advice to the honourable gentleman is to stand up and fight those who kicked him then. They kept him down for a time, but now they have picked him up; in consequence he licks their boots and is their best servant. The standard of the Australian Country party was never very high, but the honorable member has'lowered it. He cannot speak the truth except by accident. That is the type of man that he is. Last night, when the honourable gentleman was congratulating the deputy leader of his -party, probably in the hope that he would, be promoted, although I think that that is unlikely, I interjected to say that the honourable member for Indi had stated the case for the speculators and growers very well, whereupon he implied that I",24,Speakee Mr In Perth He Was Also The Growers
66,Mr Mcleod.,"was referring to the flour-milling industry. That is the type of man he is. In attempting to reply to the remarks made by the Mmister for ""Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon), he suggested that the Minister wanted to hand over the co-operative bulk handling organization to a Labour government in Western Australia. That was a deliberate lie, as the honourable member realized, but as he belongs to the Australian Country party we are not surprised. I propose to quote from a report of the directors of Cooperative Bulk Handling Limited (1945). May I be informed what bulk handling of vilifications of members of the Aushas to do with the International Wheat tralian Country party. It ill becomes an Agreement? I have listened to the honourable member who rarely speaks in speeches of honourable members opposite, this Parliament to make a speech of that and they have hardly touched upon this kind. I particularly deplore his attack agreement.

We have seen that happen in Europe, when Russia has offered wheat to France, Hungary and other countries in an attempt to sap the loyalty of the democratic members of their governments. There is .a serious flaw in this agreement. I believe that if we can achieve international accord we should do so, but we must not be simpletons and accept anything that is put up to us. If we do, we may regret it later. The article in the North-West Miller continues. . . and the second because, having welshed on the quasi agree7nent of several years ago, and played a lone hand at enormous profit to its Government through the years since then, it characteristically, and doubtless wisely, refuses to permit itself to be shackled in the years ahead. That report refers to a previous attempt to conclude a world wheat agreement, to which Australia was a party. attempt failed because one of the signatories, Argentina, which was one of the great wheat-producing coimtries, broke away. That can happen again. We can happen again. We must not be foolish. We should examine this proposal with our eyes open. Briefly, this scheme is to sell the wheat of the three nations, of which Australia is one, to 38 other nations, which have some 83 colonies and dependencies, at the rate of 500,000,000 bushels a year for five years Will the scheme work? We know that bureaucrats representing the different nations who go to these conferences make what they consider at the time to be the best arrangement possible; but our experience in this matter is in line with what has happened at recent conferences at Geneva and Havana, where our representatives, lacking proper background or knowledge of the long history of preferential trade, bartered away our traditions in that respect. In doing so they whittled down the preferences which we enjoyed under our Empire trade system which strengthened our economy in the past ani could help immensely to get Great Britain out of its present difficulties. Similarly, our representatives went to this conference and were influenced by representatives of other nations. shall quote the opinion of Mr H. G. L. Mr WJiite. Strange, of Winnipeg, a world authority on wheat who, probably, kjnows more about wheat than any half dozen of the representatives of the nations who signed this agreement. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) to ponder this opinion. Mr Strange saidThis pact is a weird document, reading like a super-planner's rosy dream, full of indefinite clauses aud loopholes. How that would suit the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), the super-planner who, given a pencil and a piece of paper, believes he can plan so as to resolve every one's difiiculties, or write down a form of government or administration that would satisfy every one! Enthusiastic bureaucrats of his type fail to pay regard to the human elements in problems of this kind; on the contrary, their attitude brings nations to disaster. Hitler was a socialist and beThat came a dictator. Mussolini, Lenin and Stalin also were socialists and followed a similar pattern; all were imbued with the coffee-house vapourings of Karl Marx. We shall drift in that direction if we continue to send to overseas trade conferences delegates with half-baked ideas who are carried away by the enthusiasm of bureaucrats from other nations. Mr Strange continuedThe preamble states that the authors regard it as an important milestone on the road to world peace. How often have we heard that? One honourable member opposite said that we had fought two world wars for world co-operation. Did we? I thought that we fought those wars for our self-preservation and the preservation of the Empire to which we belong. Of course, the Communists think first of world cooperation and one world government. I recall that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, when speaking recently at Ballarat, said that we were gradually drawing' nearer to a co-operative Commonwealth, under a socialist mandate. Such statements are the outpourings of theorists completely out of touch with realities. Mr Strange continuedWe are obliged to differ. The pact leaves out the Argentine, Russia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, I Roumania and Bulgaria, all of which countries ordinarily export considerable quantities of wheat. It would appear, too, that the share of world trade usually enjoyed by the Argentine is divided up amongst the United States, Canada and Australia. This, of course, would impose considerable hardship on the Argentine and on some otlier exporting countries, which kind of thing, we suggest, is tending towards the road to world peace or to goodwill among the nations. Commenting on Mr Strange's statement, the North-Western Miller saidLater in his analysis hequite properly directed attention to tlie fact that the committee, concerning itself solely with wheat, completely overlooked the inevitable effect of controls of that commodity upon other products of agriculture-rye , barley, oats-, flaxseed, beef, mutton, pork, bacon, eggs, cheese and innumerable other commodities, with the accompanying inevitable disturbing changes in production ill every country in order to adapt itself to free markets in all things save wheat alone. It must be obvious to all honourable members, whether they be primary producers themselves or possess only a cursory knowledge of primary production, that we cannot pick out one primary product and make a world agreement about it without disturbing the internal economy of all the nations concerned, be they buyers, or sellers, of the particular product. I come now to the only point which I intend to discuss at length. I make the .following quotation fro m the North-WesternM ill e r : Numberless points, in themselves minor, but of great importance to those certain to be affected by this surrender of control of the world wlieat crop to an international council, are not made clear in the text of the agreement. Notable among these is the clear implication that any country may elect to take all of its allotment in wheat. While this is not specifically covered anywhere in the agreement, it is clearly implied in a footnote (.page 3) reading, ""Without prejudice to the preference of any country for imported flour of any extraction rate, &c. "", which can mean nothing but that any and every country could take all of its allotment in wheat, leaving the future of America's export flour trade wholly subject to rulings by the council. When this agreement was mooted I asked tlie Minister for Commerce and Agriculture the following questions notice:1. Does the International Wheat Agreement stipulate that a percentage of Australia's wheat export will be exported as flour; if so, what is the percentage per annum? 2. Will the remainder of the flour available for export be completely free of control, so that millers may regain markets formerly held before control was established? The Minister replied1. No percentage is stipulated. Four will be exported, and the guaranteed sales cover wheat and flour in terms of wheat. Seventytwo tons of flour are computed as 100 tons of wheat. 2. Sales of flour under the agreement, plus other sales provided for, are expected to keep mills operating on higher production. Some form of control of export of both wheat and flour so as to comply with the agreement will be necessary. That is a very indefinite and nebulous reply"" some form of control "". Flourmilling is a very important industry in Australia. The Minister may not know that last year flour exported from Australia was valued at Â£22,675,000; or that the industry gives employment to thousands of men in mills throughout the Commonwealth. In addition, its bi-products,. branand pollard, stock feed and the like, and the assistance it has given to dairying, pig-raising and poultry-farming, must be taken into consideration. I remind the Government that we have Empire family commitments of much greater importance than those involved in this agreement. I refer to our responsibility to increase supplies of butter and eggs to the UnitedK in gdom. Our butter exports to the Mother Country have seriously declined. Yet, we are now asked to embark upon this international venture without being given any guarantee regarding the purchase of to the agreement w ill be at liberty to take the whole of their quota in wheat. Australia undertakes to supply 85,000,000 bushels of wheat during the next five years. That is ahout the l i m it of our capacity. Of our total production, 70,000,000 bushels is turned into flour, of which 33,000,000 bushels are consumed on the home market and 37,000,000 are exported. We have developed a very valuable export trade. by the .honourable member are not the limits we can supply. A f t e r we have upon met our obligations under the agreement we can supply outside of it . Minister thinks that we can supply more than 85,000,000 bushels a year.

72,Mr White,"I do not believe that thethat the Government will be able to maintain our present export trade while, at the same time, fulfilling our obligations under the agreement.

It is the duty of the Minister to see that our exports go where they are intended to go. At due time, we had an important trade in flour with Mauritius, the Netherlands East Indies and China, but it is now jeopardized. During the last two years, we have lost millions of pounds worth of trade with the Netherlands East Indies because the Government was not -strong enough to discipline the Communist-controlled Waterside Workers Pederation when its secretary, Mr Healy, said that no Dutch ships could load -cargoes in Australia for the Netherlands East Indies.

We are to produce only raw materials, and sell them at coolie rates. The International Wheat Agreement is just another melancholy instalment of the master plan. No consideration is given to maintaining existing living standards, or to actual costs of production. Our economicsovereignty is being bartered away by this Government. It rushes headlong into every conceivable international gathering, and offers the assembly large chunks of our national assets. At one gathering, it is wheat. At another, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has other Australian industries on his list. Nothing is too large, and nothing too small, to barter away. This kind of thing was done first at Bretton Woods. As a result of the agreement at that conference, we lost, a large portion of our dwindling gold reserves, and committed ourselves to back the loans of all kinds of mendicant nations. But we are too proud to ask for dollars, despite our favorable overseas balances. Then came the International Trade Agreement under which whole sections of Australian industry are to be sacrificed.

I have listened carefully to the contributions that have been made to the debate, including those of two Ministers. The Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) referred to the agreement as the charter of the wheat industry. I am afraid it is a charter that has a dark side, which is exemplified by the money that is to be taken from the wheat producers.

90,Mr Adermann (Maranoa) [12.48].,"Whilst reference was made to the history of the industry during the early 'thirties there was no reference to that of the Scullin regime. ""While the Vice President of the Executive Council was Minister for Commerce, there was poverty amidst plenty in the wheat growing industry because individual production ""was restricted to 3,000 bushels. Reference has been made to the hardships of the 'thirties. In those days wheat-growers were allowed to grow as much wheat as they wished. As the honourable meinber for ""Wilmot( Mr Duthie) said, if they wished to do so they could switch over to dairying and other forms of primary production, but they could not do that when the Vice-President of the Executive Council controlled their destiny, because, at that time they were under industrial conscription for war purposes. The honourable gentleman forbade them to grow sufficient wheat to make a living for themselves and their families. The gross income which a farmer oould then earn from his 3,000 bushel crop was Â£600. Of what use is it for the honourable gentleman to deny that he imposed restrictions? restrictive legislation which he was responsible for placing on the statute book represented one of the greatest tragedies in Australian legislation. In the first year of its operation the crop was reduced to 143,000,000 bushels, in the second to 93,000,000 and in the third to 57,000,000 bushels. The Government has now contracted to supply home-con.sumption needs, to ship85,000,000 bushels overseas, and in addition to place 25,000,000 bushels in a pool. ber has overlooked the fact that not in any existed in the wheat industry as the one year did growers fully sow the acreresult of the Scully restriction plan age which they were allotted.

During the whole of the period of the operation of the Queensland Wheat Board, a grower-controlled, co-operative marketing body, the return to the wheat growers averaged 4s. 9d. a bushel, yet the honourable gentleman refused to allow individual wheat-growers to grow wheat in excess of 3,000 bushels under the 4s. quota at a time when 'he admitted that every bushel imported into Queensland from the southern States cost more than 5s. 7d. lionorable member knows it. those restrictions the consumption of wheat in Queensland was reduced. Chronicle characterized the Scully restriction scheme as a tragedy. It was certainly a tragedy to reduce production at a time when we could have laid the foundations for future markets and have The helped countries in need of our wheat. The honourable gentleman, however, restricted production and forebade the growers to grow more wheat. Let him face up to the follies of his own administration. Let this so-called champion of the wheat-growers answer this indictment if he can. Honourable members opposite well know how dissatisfied were the wheat growers at that time.

Out of that amount the wheat-grower had to meet the cost of machinery, lahour, .superphosphate, seed, bags and twine, and he and his family had to live on what was left over. The total production of wheat was scaled down to 57,000,000 bushels at a time when the normal Australian consumption was 70,000,000 bushels. In challenging a statement made by the honthat Australian wheat-growers would lose between Â£12,000,000 to Â£13,000,000 as the result of this agreement, the Minister for ""Works and Housing( Mr guarantee of maximum prices, particuLemmon) said that we could not look far enough into the future to gauge what losses may occur under this scheme. ""We clo not need to look into the future in respect of the contracts made with the United Kingdom and India. The loss will be even greater than has been stated by the honourable member for Indi. Australia has made two major wheat contracts, the first with the United Kingdom to supply S0,000,000 bushels at 17s. a bushel and the second with India to supply 20,000,000 bushels at ISs. 6. a bushel, Australian ports, freight in each case to be provided by the purchasers. The Australian Wheat Board hopes to be able to ship one-half of the wheat covered by these contracts by the 1st August, the date upon which the agreement is to come into bffect if it is ratified by the countries consuch a reduction becomes absolutely essencerned. The loss at the minimum differences would be the sum involved in 40,000,000 bushels at l is . instead of 17s., amounting to Â£12,000,000 and 12,500,000 bushels at l is . instead of 18s. 6d. amountneeds, we shall have to secure the support ing to Â£4,687,500, or a total loss of nearly Â£17,000,000. That represents 2s. a bushel on 170,000,000 bushels, which is equal to two years' delivery to the International Wheat Council of 85,000,000 bushels each year. These figures show that the statement made by the honourable member for Indi was factual. I am not averse to ""-ranting concessions when prices are exorbitant. I am quite frank about that. [ do not think we can regard present prices as being stable. They are extravagant and will not continue at the existing high level. When, however, we grant concessions, we expect some compensating concessions in return. During this debate much has been made of the need for stability in the wheat industry during the next five years. My opinion may not matter to members of the Government, but I consider that shortages of commodities in the world would ensure stability for the next five years in any case. Production will not overtake demand for at least three or four years. After analysing the concessions in the agreement, I submit that the guarantees should apply for much longer than five years in order to secure stability in the wheat industry. The agreement gives no larly after the expiration of the first two years, because the council that is to be established will have the right to revise the maximum and minimum price levels, subject to certain limitations. We may as well accept the fact that the growers will be expected to work on the minimum price level. That is the only safe basis that we can use. Government spokesmen have frequently stated that the minimum price will be 6s. a bushel. Mr PO-LLAKD -The price levels can be altered only by a two-thirds vote of the exporters and importers, voting sepa-' rately. That means that a reduction of the minimum price level can be effected only if two of the exporting countries agree to it. That will not happen unless tial. tion becomes necessary to meet Australia's of the other two exporting countries. Those two coimtries together could outvote Australia and prevent a variation. 1 ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

104,Mr Harrison Asked The Prime Minis,"11. Iri view of. thc statement of the Attorney General already referred to, will the Prime pany for the carriage of mails nor is the negoMinister state the attitude ot the Governmeut . tiation of any such contract contemplated. towards the formation of this company? honourable member's questions are as answer to question No. 1, was altogether a follows:1. On the 21st May, 1B47, the Attorney General did, in reply to the honorahle member for Wentworth, describe as utterly fantastic the story published in a Sydney weekly paper of that date that Australian Communists, in partnership with the Indonesian Government, were planning a huge company to monopolize trade between Indonesia and Australia. Thc Attorney-General further stated that before any trading monopoly of that nature could be granted, the Commonwealth Government would have to be consulted. On the following day, the Attorney-General, in reply to a further question by the honourable member, stated that the story about the formation of such a trading company was almost certainly part of a pretty elaborate hoax. Subsequent events have proved thc Attorney-General's view to have been entirely correct. The other questions now asked by the honourable member relate to R different matter altogether. 2. A company known as Asian Airlines Proprietary Limited has been registered in Sydney, tt is an ordinary trading company and has no connection with the imaginary trading company referred to by the honourable member. 3. Yes. 4. (a) Yes. The four associates mentioned arc Australian ex-servicemen and state that the establishment of this company was a rehabilitation venture, (b) I believe not. 5. Mr Campbell claimed such designation, but was uot recognized as such by the Commonwealth Government. He was reported as being a potential director of the non-oxistent company referred to in thi* answer to question No. 1. 6. Mr Campbell purchased nine Catalina aircraft from the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. These aircraft were advertised for sale by public tender and Mr Campbell's tender, being the highest individual tender received, was accepted. Mr Campbell's tender was 9igned by him personally and contained no reference that it was submitted on behalf of other parties. It appears, however, from an agreement filed in the Registrar-General's Office, Sydney, that the persons named by the honorablo memher were the actual purchasers of the aircraft and that -they subsequently sold the aircraft to Asian Airlines Proprietary Limited for the consideration stated. 7. The sale was made by the Commonwealtb Disposals Commission and it is not the practice of thc commission to inquire into the political background of persons in the Commonwealth to whom surplus property is sold. 8. Ko. 0. No application for approval to operate an airline service either inside or outside Australia has been submitted by .the company. 10. Ko contract has been given to the com11.
