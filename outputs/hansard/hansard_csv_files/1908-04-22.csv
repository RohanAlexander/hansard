My sole object is to The persons who made raise the constitutional issue, and to obtain a ruling from you, sir, in regard to the power of the Senate under the Constitution But the railways were to make suggestions to this House for increases of duties. I contend that the action of that Chamber in requesting this House to increase duties is a proposal to increase I desire to ask the the burdens upon the people, and that the power to increase "" any charge or burden on the people "" is denied to the Senate under section 53, paragraph 3, of the Consti-",15,Naval Shipbuilding Yards

20,Sir John Forrest,"In the first place,tution. I submit, too, that the words of paragraph 4 of that section, "" omission or amendment,"" do not confer power upon that Chamber to request this House to increase duties, which would be increases of "" a n y charge or burden on the people."" If the Senate can, under the Constitution, request this House to increase a duty, it possesses a greater power than it would have possessed had it been granted the power to amend a B ill , such as this, imposing taxation, because in the latter case it would not have had power to increase, or to request this House to increase, Customs or Excise duties. When the Senate was empowered to make requests in Money and Taxation Bills-whic h it was forbidden to amend -by the framers of the Constitution, it was intended that it should be a lesser power than that of amendment. That being so, I contend that, under this lesser power, it cannot do what it could not have done if it had been granted the greater power of amendment. I also contend that if the Senate has the power to request this House to increase duties, thereby, in effect, increasing the burdens on the people, it has a greater power than this House possesses; because this House cannot increase any duty unless the increase is proposed by a Minister of the Crown. sage. Sir a Minister of the Crown alone can move for the increase of any item in a Bil l imposing 'taxation. tend, therefore, that the Senate has a greater power than this House possesses if it can make suggestions to increase duties, since we cannot even make a suggestion to that effect. It may be argued that the proposals of the Senate are only "" requests "" to this House. But I contend that a great principle is involved. Senate might result in a deadlock between the two Houses of the Legislature. means anything at all it is a declaration by the Senate that it has practically the right of compelling this House to increase the burdens on the people, notwithstanding that such right is specially denied it by the Constitution. that you, Mr Speaker, have already decided this question by a ruling given some years ago. But I submit that the question which I have now raised has not been previously raised in the form in which I now bring it before this House. I therefore beg to submit, for your consideration and ruling, whether the Senate, under the power conferred by section 53, paragraph 4, of the Constitution, has power to make "" requests "" to increase Customs and Excise duties, and thereby to increase the charges or burdens on the people. the merits of the question raised by the right honourable member for Swan, important though it be, I rise to suggest that my right honourable friend has not proceeded in a proper way in this matter. While you, Mr Speaker, have important duties ""to perform in connection with the interpretation of the Standing Orders, I know of no law which imposes upon you the duty and obligation of interpreting the Constitution for us. an abstract question. an abstract question. It is concrete enough, as the honourable member will observe if he looks at the schedule of requests that have come from the Senate. My right honourable friend is, I think, following the practice of the House of Commons with regard to the relations existing between the Commons and the Lords. But in Great Britain they have no written Constitution, and,I upon messubmit that that makes a very radical difference between their attitude in regard JOH N FORREST -In this House to such questions and ours. All the powers possessed by the Senate are contained in our Constitution. Neither our StandingI conOrders nor, I submit with great respect, anything that you, Sir, can say regarding those powers, can alter this Constitution in any way whatever. I know of nothing in the Constitution which imposes upon you rhe obligation to interpret for us what the powers of the two Houses are. I should think that if the right honourable member This action of the for Swan proposes to proceed further in this matter, he ought to proceed by resoluI f it tion ratEer than upon a point of order such as he has now raised. Regarding the merits of the question' itself, I do not now propose to say anything. member for Swan was good enough, two It may be said weeks ago or thereabouts, to wait upon me and inform me that he intended to raise the question which he has raised this afternoon.

25,Mr Speaker,"The right honorablematter relating to it, before it was actually Bill-o n the motion for its initiation, when raised in,the House, with a view of determining what my ruling ought to be. I am therefore prepared to give a ruling at once, which may be of service to the House. First, in regard to the point raised by the honourable member for Parramatta, it-is true that the obligation does not rest upon me to interpret the Constitution. I have ever striven,. as far' as possible, to avoid doing anything of that nature. I re-cognise that the only body fully entitled to interpret the Constitution is the High Court; arid I should be sorry even to seem to assume any of the functions which pertain peculiarly to it. Not even this House has the power finally to interpret the terms of the Constitution. Further, on three or four occasions I-have been asked, before to-dav, to rule as to what the privileges of this House are in regard to certain messages which have come before us-as to whether such messages ought to be received, and as to whether we ought to consider them. To rule on such points is surely part of my duty;' and, hitherto, I have striven to perform, that duty with a sense of the responsibilitv which rests upon me. In the same way to-day, I am asked whether a message which is about to be remitted for the consideration of the Committee is one that ought to be received by this House, or whether our privileges are in any way entrenched upon by suggestions for raising certain Customs duties. I propose to ""deal with the questions raised by the right honourable member for Swan in the reverse order from that in which he has raised them. He has pointed out that if some of the suggestions made by the Senate were allowed, one result would be that the Senate would prove to be possessed of powers that are not possessed by this House. He has pointed out that this House has not-the pqwer, except on the motion of a Minister of the Crown, to raise duties proposed by any measure before the House. I suppose that the right honourable member was ""referring to standing order 171, which reads as followsNo amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax rate or duty shall be pronot make >any amendment;. it may posed by any non-official member in any Commerely make suggestions or requests mittee on any B ill . If we were, at any time, in Committee on any Bill it would be impossible then to receive or make any proposal for the increase of any ""tax rate or duty,"" unless that increase were moved by a Minister of the Crown But on the eariier stage of a Mr Sfeater. t the House is not in Committee on the Bill, but is dealing with preliminary resolutions relating to the imposition of duties-it would be competent for any honourable member to move for any increase which he might desire, at that stage. So that the contention that the practice which is sought to be followed by another branch of the Legislature to-day, would give that branch of the Legislature larger powers than this House possesses, is not quite correct. We are only estopped from taking such action as would increase a ""tax rate pr duty "" at one stage-that is, when the House is in Committee on the Bill. The next point raised by the right honourable member for SwanI am' still taking his points in the reverse order-wa s as to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution itselfwhether it was intended to give to the Senate such powers as it claims. That is a matter as to which my ruling can be asked, but not a matter upon which I should be prepared to rule. Whether the practice which has been adopted does or does not confer upon that branch of the Legislature larger powers than the authors of the Constitution intended is not, I think, a question upon which my ruling is really sought. Then conies the next point to which the right honourable member has referred, and concerning which he has kindly given me, in writing, a statement of his contention. The right honourable member submits thatIt is not competent for the Senate to make a. suggestion under section 53, paragraph 3, of the Constitution, that any item in the TariffB ill , as sent to it by the House of Representatives, be increased. T h a t paragraph provides thatThe Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. In this case the Senate has not made any amendment. It has simply sent to this House a message inviting us to amend it if we think fit. The Constitution clearly provides that in the case of measures for certain specified purposes, the Senate may for amendments. If the Senate had power to amend fhe Customs Tariff Bill, an amendment made by it would he obeved by the Department of Trade and Customs, precisely as it instantly obevs any amendment made by this House whilst the schedule is under consideration'.' It is, therefore, clear that the Senate makes nothing in the nature of an amendment by making a request to this House. The making of a request by another place is not followed by action on the part of the Department of Trade and Customs until that request has been considered by this House and agreed to. the amendment requested the Department takes no notice of the decision of another place, and that decision has no operative value. It is simply a request to us to make a certain amendment. The next point arising under section 53 of the Constitution relates to the paragraph immediately following that which I have just readThe Senate may at any stage return to the House of Kepresentatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. . . . Those words contain no. limitation precluding the Senate from making a request for an amendment which may mean an increase of taxation. previously been directly ruled upon by me, but it has come before the House on two or three occasions. 1, page 385, of the Parliamentary Papers for 1905, Honourable members will find a detailed reference to all the cases in connection with which points similar to this have arisen. was before the Senatej certain requests were made, including one that the Excise duty on tobacco should be increased. message from another place, embodying those requests, came before this House, and was considered. was raised; the request for the increased duty was considered, together with others, and a vote of the House was taken. point raised to-day by the right honourable member for Swan was nearly touched later on, when the Sugar BountyB ill of 1903 was before Parliament. nexion with that Bill, the Senate made a number of amendments-no t requests. Sir WILLIAM LYNE '(Hume-Trea amongst those amendments being one surer) [3.36] I propose,' with the concurwhich clearly involved an increased burden rence of honourable 'members, to make a upon the people. message was called on in the same way which the Government propose to ask the as that now before us was called on to-day, Committee to accept, and those which we I stated that, in my opinion, the Senate shall ask honourable members to re-had gone too f a r . ' that we ought not to consider an set, to say that, like other honourable amendment of the Senate which clearly members. I have noted the keen ininvolved an increased burden upon the terest displayed by. another place in dealpeople. . I concluded by stating that ing with the schedule to the.Customs Tariffi f ' the Senate had desired that this B ill as it left this House. I do not think amendment, should be made, its proper course, under paragraph 4 of section 53 of the Constitution would have been not to make it but to send to this House a request that it should be made here. The present Prime Minister, as Attorney-General, moved that the Bill be returned to the Unless this House makes Senate with a statement that the amendment could hot be received in the form sent, since it was not competent for another place to make it, but that, if it desired, it could make a request to this House, in respect to it.^ The Senate forthwith sent a message to this House requesting that the amendment should be made; the House proceeded to debate the matter, and"" the incident was closed by this House making the amendment desired with a modification. If honourable members examine the debates on the Sugar Bounty Bill of 1903 they will see that the point now raised by the right honourable member for Swan was then practically ruled upon. We come now to. the next point raised by the This question has not right honourable member, that the words "" omission or amendment,"" in paragraph 4 of section 53 of the Constitution, give no On turning to volume authority to the Senate to suggest an increase of any proposed charge or burden' on the people. It seems to me that, there being no limitation in that paragraph precluding the consideration of a request for When the first TariffB ill an increase of taxation, we have no right to refuse to consider such a. request. Such requests may be considered entirelyvon their merits, . and we have power to -reject, A modify, or accept them. Honourable members will find reference to this question in Hansard for 1902, pages 14885, 14892, No point of order 14918, and 15676. I rule, finally, that the message which we have received from the Senate is one which it is within.the power The of the Senate to send, and one which, f o llowing the precedents we have laid down on two or three occasions, we may well consider and deal with upon its merits. In . conI n CommiUee : When the Senate short statement indicating the requests I took, the view ject or modify. I desire at the outthat greater interest has been displayed by the Senate in any other measure which has been transmitted to it, and I feel sure that in making certain requests to us it has not been actuated by any desire to ^interfere with the proper functions of this Chamber. The Senate commenced its consideration of the Tariff on. the 22nd January, and completed it only on-the 2nd April. In the interval, every item was considered in detail from the point of view of honourable senators, and the Hansard reports of the debates on the various items in the Senate contain a great deal of information which may possiblv be of use to honourable members. Out of a total of 238 requests, it is the intention of the Government to propose the rejection of 51, and the acceptance of 187. information of honourable members, the requests which the Government propose to accept, and also those which we propose to reject or modify, in order that before each is dealt with they may know what course the Government intend to take. Mr W. H . IRVINE gentleman supply the numbers of the items to which the requests apply ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE do so. I hope to have the lists printed by to-morrow, but I wish to guard myself to this extent: It is possible that, m a few cases, we may not find it advisable to follow the lists in every particular, and I therefore reserve to myself the right to make certain alterations in the case of items in connection with which I am still making inquiries. So far as I can at the present moment give definite information as to the intention of the Government, I shall do so. It is proposed to accept the Senate's request No. 2. cepted are rejected, I presume ? fied. cepting all the requests for increases of amongst the"" requests which the Governduties ? about that.

Sydney) [5.2] I point out that the duty which the Government desire to retain means a tax of 30 or 40 per cent, on an article of diet which is used very largely by the poorer classes. -We ought to hear from the Minister whether sago or tapioca are being grown in Australia at present, or whether there is any prospect of their being produced in saleable quantities. If there is evidence that they can be grown in quantities, or that some one is willing to embark on the industry of producing them, there may be a reasdn for a duty; but otherwise I can see no reason for dissenting from the request of the Senate. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [5.4] A duty was imposed on sago and tapioca in the 1902 Tariff, when the rate was'4s. per central, which is equal to Jd. per lb. I am not aware that sago and tapioca are grown in large quantities in Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE some of the Queensland members could give us some information on that point. I 'do not assert that any large quantity is produced in Australia, but sago ought to be grown here. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The Treasurer had better accept the request. for Flinders is advocating the abolition of what he would call a revenue duty. in operation under the first Federal Tariff, and I have not heard any great Outcry against it. I should not like to say that we ought to obtain revenue by means of duties on goods in respect of which there is no necessity for a tax, but the States are certhe acceptance of the requests made by tainly crying out for increased revenue, and if we cut down the duties the smaller States will suffer. acceptance of this request would mean the loss of a whole £ 5 0 0 to Tasmania. of this request and others involving a reduction of duties would affect the returns from the Tariff. has increased by £1,750,000. States will be none too well off. What would have been their position if the Tariff had not yielded an increased revenue? We may not always have seasons of prosperity, and we must be prepared to meet any depression that may occur. I think it would be unwise to accept this request, and I would remind honourable members in the Opposition corner that the honourable member for Balaclava said that he would support the Tariff as it left this House, so that I should at least be able to claim his vote. The Treasurer admits that this is a revenue duty, and to support his contention that it should be retained he falls back on the general statement that the States are anxious to secure as much revenue as possible. That argument would apply to every proposal to amend the Tariff. It seems to me that the point we have specially to consider in this connection is that tapioca and sago are not produced in Australia, and that this is therefore a purely revenue impost on articles of food. The Treasurer has said that there has been no outcry against it, but I would remind him that, speaking generally, the consumers of tapioca and sago do not own I think that newspapers, and have no means of making vigorous protest against the duty. Sago and tapioca are wholesome foods for children, and in the circumstances I think that the Treasurer would be well advised in asking the Committee to agree to the request made by another place. Treasurer was speaking I interjected that it was to be regretted that he had not given the Committee an indication of the effect which the acceptance of the requests made by the Senate would have upon the revenue. We should have no difficulty in determining what stand we. ought to take in respect to proposals of this kind if we knew what would be the effect on the revenue of the Senate, and what would be the effect of the increased duties requested and likely to be agreed to. That the I believe that the Minister thought that such information ought to be given is suggested by the fact that it was pointed out in the Senate that the amendments made by the House of Representatives in the schedule as introduced would involve a loss of revenue amounting to about £ 4 4 0 , 0 0 0 per annum.",28,Batchelor Orde R

If I remember rightly, the Treasurer, in submitting his Budget statement, said that this Tariff would yield £ 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of the amount derived last year under the first Federal Tariff, but that as against that increase we should have to make provision this year for an increased expenditure of nearly £1,000,000. impossible to incur even half of that increased expenditure during the present financial year. The bulk of the votes which are to absorb the increased revenue will lapse by the 30th June, so that we shall have a much bigger balance than was anticipated. Sir WILLIAM LYNE will not lapse. proposed by the Government in respect of immigration, defence, and many other items which I could mention will not be incurred this year. Sof a r then as we are to consider these items from the point of view of this year's revenue we ought not to hesitate to make this item free, since the freeing of it can have very little effect upon the large surplus we are likely to have at the end of the present financial year -may seriously diminish the revenue from Honourable members have stated that sago and tapioca are produced in Queensland. I do not think that they are produced to any extent there, but it cannotJ>e denied that they can be, and I dare say that they will be produced in larger quantities. I think that the request should be agreed to. Sago is a most nutritious substance. It is the principal food' of the natives of New Guinea, and by making it free we shall give those who are producing it in our Northern Possession-Papuaa convenient market. A great deal of sago is produced in Papua, and the fact that it is not of the best quality is due simply to defective treatment. The Treasurer would be making a great concession by agreeing to the request. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [5.16]. -The honourable member for Angas has raised a very important question to which the Government should make a definite reply. He has pointed out that this is the first item which raises distinctly the question of what is likely to be the effect upon the revenue of the acceptance of these requests. We are told that we shall suffer a loss of £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 per annum if this item be made free, but in order to be in a position to effectively discharge our duty in dealing with these requests we should have from the Government a statement as to what will be the effect on the revenue generally if the requests made by the Senate be accepted. I presume that the Treasurer has the information before him. The Government, in order to determine what requests the House should be asked to accept and what it should be asked to reject, must It will be have had before them the figures for which I ask, and the statement which is to be published should give an indication of how the revenue will .be affected by the acceptance of, the requests. will be given the information as we deal I hope that they with each item. MrW i H . IRVINE T h a t is not sufficient. I believe we all desire, if possible, to make this item free; the only question is whether it is wise to agree to a request involving a considerable loss of revenue before we know how the revenue from the Tariff generally will be affected by the other requests that we are to deal with. I am in favour of accepting the request providing that the amendment can be made without adopting a principle that, Customs and Excise. The honourable member for Laanecoorie interjected a few minutes ago that honourable members on this side were in favour of revenue duties, and should therefore be in favour of this impost. That statement' involves a misconception of the position. I am in favour of revenue duties in the sense that I believe that for a very large number of years we must derive the great bulk of our revenue from.Customs and Excise duties, and that therefore we must always regard"" the duties imposed from the point' of view of their returning a large revenue. In that sense we look upon all imposts as revenue duties. I should like to see the Commonwealth obtaining revenue as f a r as possible from duties which will also have a protective incidence, where such duties can be fairly imposed. We are asked to remove a revenue duty, which will returnonly £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 a yeara duty which I am assured is equal to 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, upon articles of food used largely by the poorer classes'.",29,Batchelor Orde R

I do not agree with the honourable member for Nepean that it is used as a substitute for fruit ; but sago and tapioca are valuable foods in health or in sickness, and in the circumstances, I hope that the Government will see the advisability of accepting the Senate's request. The honourable member for Herbert advanced an argument, I am not in favour of rewhich should have weight with the Committee.

I admit that articles of food should be made as cheap as possible, but the first Parliament decided to impose a duty of Jd. per lb. on this article, and there was no great outcry as the result of that decision. I can see no real reason for the abolition of that duty. I should like to repeat the request made by the honourable members for Angas and Flinders, that the Ministei should submit some statement showing the financial result of accepting or rejecting the requests made by the Senate. that it would be immaterial. the honourable gentleman estimates that the result of the adoption of the Senate's request in this case would be a loss of revenue to the extent of £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 . I should not describe that as immaterial. If honourable members endeavoured to induce the House to agree to an expenditure of £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 for any purpose, they would find that the amount would not be regarded as immaterial.

I find that practically it is not grown -at all in the Commonwealth. AlthoughI am here as a high protectionist, I cannot agree with the honourable member for Fawkner that this House was returned to vote all-round increases in Tariff duties. some of the honourable member's colleagues in the Opposition corner will have some difficulty in explaining some of their votes to their constituents. heard, I am quite satisfied that this is purely a revenue duty, and, as I stated in discussing the Tariff ""before, I am opposed to revenue duties.

The greater part of the labour in[374]-2 ' I am not.chalvolved in the making of candles relates really to the production of stearine and its by-products, on the one hand, and to paraffine as a by-product of oil production on the other.

I do not deny that paraffine wax is used in the manufacture of composite candles here, because the Customs statistics show that, as the local production of candles has increased, our imports of paraffine wax have also increased. . I'desire to do away with that -importation. It is difficult, by looking at them, to distinguish between a pure stearine candle and one made chiefly of paraffine wax, but as soon as one of the latter is placed in a buggy lamp or in a mine, and are such subjected to any heat, it bends, and may be tied in a knot. Many people buy comare being posite candles, believing that they are made of stearine. I should like to see stearine more generally used.

I am not anxious to be poisoned by confectionery which comes in either under a 4d. duty or free, or to see Australians poisoned by it.

If I agree to the Minister's motion, is it the intention of the Government to prohibit the importation of these articles? cannot be prohibited unless they are considered injurious under the Commerce Act. It can be prohibited under that Act. who has spoken has admitted that these substances are deleterious in confectionery. I am invited to vote for the motion on the ground that their importation will be prohibited.

Are we to say that the local article can be made from any ingredients which the manufacturers like to use, but that goods which come from reputable firms like Fry's and Cadbury's, in the United Kingdom, are to be shut out because they contain the same ingredients? local manufacturer by' an Excise duty. posing an Excise duty has passed. The idea in the Senate, when this request was agreed to, was to impose an Excise duty also, so as to reach the local manufacturer. The Minister has all the power necessary to prohibit importations, but I do not want him or the Committee to fall into the I am not the Mintrap of preventing the importation of certain goods because they contain ingredients the use of which is allowed in Australia. Thatwould be placing a dangerous weapon in the hands of a keen protectionist, such as the Treasurer is, but I do. not think that he would use his .power to that extent. The Minister's motion should be agreed to. The State authorities can if they like deal with the sale, not only of locally-made, but of imported confectionery containing these substances. Victoria has done so, and other States can do the same. the present stage of the manufacture of sweets, glucose is absolutely necessary in many of them. Chocolate creams and confections of that kind could not be made as a commercial commodity without it. It prevents them from getting hard. We are all at one in not wanting ourselves or our children to be poisoned with plaster' of Paris or paraffine wax.

If we do not make this provision in the Customs Tariff Act, the Minister of Trade and Customs, if convinced that the articles are deleterious, can prohibit their importation under the Commerce Act.

It only creates confusion to have the difference between the duty on an article which costs is. and on an article which costs is. oJd., not merely one of amount, as under an ad valorem duty, but the difference between a fixed rate and an ad valorem rate. It only complicates the Tariff and makes the difficulties greater for the Department and the importers. either an ad valorem or a fixed rate throughout. ' I am not suggesting to him what that rate should be. of cases where the ad valorem system is departed from. very few instances of the kind now proposed. cheaper grades of liquorice is very much more per cent, than is a duty of 25 per cent, on the dearer grades. Is that desirable? In the interests of the Department, as well as of the importers, the Minister should consider the advisability of either preserving the old duty, or imposing an ad valorem duty all round. I think that all kinds of liquorice should'be subjected to a similar duty, whether it be ad valorem, or per lb. should like the Minister to state one or two of the reasons why he wishes the Committee to disagree with the Senate's request. As regards liquorice, the Tariff Commission made a unanimous recommendation.

But in the case of liquorice,' a different method is adopted, and what is a comparatively small item as compared with confectionery, The Minister should adopt is divided into two classes, one class being subjected to a fixed duty, and the other to an ad valorem duty. No necessity has been found to deal in that way with the much larger item of confectionery. The Minister is seeking to make a difference, which, I assure him, will prove very often inconvenient to the Department, and often puzzling to the importers.
