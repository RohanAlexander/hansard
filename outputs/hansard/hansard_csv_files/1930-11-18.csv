An investigation covering the wide range of subjects mentioned would occupy the time of the Tariff Board for many months^ to the exclusion of its normal duties, and without any assurance of compensating advantages in the value of the results likely to be achieved. TAX ON WHEAT OR FLOUR, asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice1. Whether, he w ill inform the House as to the Government's decision regarding the request of the representatives of the wheat growers the imposition of a tax on wheat or flour fpr local consumption, with a view to creating an Australian price for wheat required for local consumption? 2. In the event of the Government giving favorable consideration to the request, w ill the necessary legislation to give effect to this decision be introduced before the House rises? tion of the recent"" conference, held at ""AUSTRALIA'S NOBLEST SONS."" Canberra, that a sales tax be imposed on all nqur sold by millers for local consumption, and that the proceeds of the Minister, upon noticetax be distributed amongst wheat growers in proportion to the quantity of of creating an Australian title such as wheat supplied .by them, received the Sons,"" careful consideration of the Government, citizens who have distinguished themselves and it was decided that the proposal was open to a number of serious objections, and, therefore, could not be adopted. The discussion at the conference showed that a sales tax of Â£7 4s. per ton on flour, sufficient to return an additional amount of 7 l-5d. per bushel to the grower, as suggested in this proposal, if added to the present price of Â£8 10s. per ton in, say, Sydney, would l if t the price of flour to Â£15 14s. per ton, and would sumer by anything from l d . to 2d. the 4-lb. loaf, because the Commonwealth Government has no power to prevent the miller and baker from passing the tax on to the consumer. This additional impost on the people by direct government tax at the present time, with large numbers out. of employment and the reduction of incomes generally, could not be supported by the Government. Further,. the collection of the sales tax and its distribution amongst the many thousands of farmers throughout Australia would be very costly and extremely, difficult to administer. Another objection to the scheme was that the price of flour for home consumption would be increased from 40 per cent, to 80 per cent, above export parity by direct action on the part of the Commonwealth Government. This, it was believed, would, probably lead to the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Australian wheat' and flour in overseas countries, which would not be nearly. so likely to happen if an Australian price were fixed by State wheat boards in consultation with an Australian wheat board, as provided for in the recent Wheat Marketing Bill rejected by the Senate. The export trade at the recent cdnference, for in flour, which is a very valuable one for Australia, is now subject to very serious competition, and any further restrictions"" by overseas countries, wpuld give a serious set-back to the flour-milling industry in Australia, which provides considerable employment.

It is pointed out by the board that, in view of the preference for employment accorded them by the Public Service Act, the bulk of the temporary employees are returned soldiers, and that, therefore, any termination of employment largely affects returned soldiers. The number, as> shown above, whose services were terminated includes many whose engagement was for a specific period, in some cases relatively short terms. The employment of a large number of the temporary employees arises from tlie fact that, at times due to emergencies, temporary pressure.of,work, &c, the permanent staff is unable to meet requirements. The engagement of the temporary employees must necessarily be terminated when the need for assistance no longer exists. Information-.regarding employees other than .those subject to the, Public Service Act is being obtained from the several Commonwealth activities concerned, and will be. made available to. the honourable member as soon as possible.

I 3hall respect your ruling, Mr Speaker, as well as the rights and privileges that I possess in this House; but I shall never manifest a desire to accentuate man's inhumanity to man. It is the object of the party to which we are opposed to lower the standard of living in Australia. That would be the effect if the House were to pass the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr advance, as we suggest that it should, even Latham), which proposes action in accordance with the decision arrived at in Melbourne by the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the States. An attempt is being made to compel our working class girls to work for 10s. a week, and thus to have them clothed in hessian instead of crepe de chine, marocain or Other equally attractive dress materials. I shall not support any proposal that will permit our women to be made the victims of woman's unwomanity to woman. In 1928, after the late Treasurer had brought down his budget for the year the press of Australia, with considerable flamdone merely by making a book entryooyancy, announced that both income tax and land tax were to be reduced by 10 per cent., that the sum of Â£20,000,000 was to be made available for a Commonwealth housing scheme, and that other similarly expensive proposals were to be brought forward, although at that particular time the financial position was steadily becoming worse. In that year the Commonwealth Sank made a profit of Â£580,987. into the sinking fund. Commonwealth Bank he made to function in such a way that its profits would be so increased that it would be able to help this country out of its present position? The Commonwealth Constitution makes provision for a two-cylinder legislature-thi s chamber and another place. In other days, when the Labour party was iu office, it had control of both cylinopposite-thos e gentlemen for whom I ders, the operations of which, consequently, synchronized, with the result that the country was able to make progress. Now, however, one cylinder is backfiring and is out of harmony with the other; consequently, progress cannot be made. That cylinder is due for au overhaul. The country is prepared to give it that overhaul at any time, and to bring it into harmony with this chamber; but the Constitution requires that both shall be pulled down. We must see that the electors have an opportunity to overhaul both cylinders and place Australia on the road to progress. If the Commonwealth Bank were to up to Â£1,000,000,000, what would be the effect? The security that Australia has to offer is sufficient to cover such au advance. Even in Queensland there are persons with ample security who cannot obtain an advance from the banking institutions in that State. Such being the case, what objection could be taken to the Commonwealth Bank advancing up to 50 per cent.' of the value of the security ? If the security depreciated, the property would revert to the Crown. It is the opinion of many of our citizens that Crown lands ought never to have been alienated. If Â£1,000,000,000 were advanced in that way-and it could be we should obtain from interest at something like 5 per cent., an amount in the vicinity of what we need to discharge our interest bill of Â£55,000,000. annually. I support what is known as the left wing of the Labour party. I do not know whether there are two wings of the party. The press of the country is anxious to create another wing, but I do not know that it will succeed. There may be a right wing, but, if so, it is so denuded of feathers that it could not possibly help the Nationalist party to fly. It might, of course, assist that party to crawl to Sir Otto. I recently noticed in the press that the city of Lyons in Prance-in sympathy with our Acting-Treasurer, who has the same name-ha s suffered from convulsions, and that portion of it has subsided into the river. Evidently, it was a kind of gesture of resentment against the actions of the Nationalist party.

It is much better to have inflation than deflation. If one were to peep into the Labour caucus room, one would see inflation, but if , on the other Commonwealth. Then if the Postal hand, one peeped into the Nationalist room, one would see deflation in its worse stages. Deflation is to me anathema and T prefer at all times inflation. There are many factors to be considered in regard to currency and its use upon recognized lines. I know of one woman who had no confidence in banks, either private or government, and, for some years, she kept Â£600 in her house. One of her relatives found out, and stole the money. That was deflation, because she kept the money out of circulation. If one-sixth of the population did the same thing it would be necessary to have 600,000.000 Â£1 notes printed to meet the demand of that section of the community alone. man so he kept Â£30 in a tent. Unfortunately for him the tent was burnt. That was deflation again. Money has to be kept in circulation. Most of the so-called political economists on the other side of the House have the idea that once Â£40,000,000 or Â£50,000,000 worth of products is sold, that is the end of the transaction. Nothing of the kind. The money circulates throughout the country. Let me, illustrate how Â£1 can produce a revenue of Â£3 in half-an-hour. It is a simple enough process, and shows what can be done with money in circulation. decent wage to the worker and its continual circulation that makes a country prosperous. Â£1 for one year, it would be of no benefit to the community, but if I bought Â£1 worth of rum from an hotel, that transaction, so soon as the Â£1 had passed over the counter, would mean at least 10s. revenue to the Commonwealth Government. If the hotel keeper at once paid that Â£1 to one of his employees, who, in turn, purchased with it Â£1 worth of whisky, that would mean another 10s. revenue to the Commonwealth Government. Theni f the hotel keeper's daughter were about to be married and he joy for ever. That would expended that Â£1 at the post office for instance of the benefit post cards, which cost the department practically nothing, on which to issue invitations to his guests, that would mean a revenue of almost 20s. to the Department required change of that Â£1 and sent it to the hotel keeper, he would change it for silver. That would be a dud transaction and no revenue would result, but if the hotel keeper immediately gave that Â£1 to his son to enable him to see a football match, as soon as the boy exchanged that Â£1 for a piece of paper called a railway ticket that Â£1 would become 20s. worth of railway revenue, so that in half-an-hour Â£1 will, if kept in circulation, produce a revenue of Â£3. If we accept the advice of political economists opposite, and our money is not put into circulation, depression must follow. I am heartily in agreement with the statement of the right honourable member for North SydneyI knew a working ( Mr Hughes) that a reduction of wages who had no trust in banks would be disastrous. If we continue to pay good wages the money will be kept in circulation. Most of the political economists on the other side of the House have the idea that once Â£1 has been made or produced that is the end of its career -lik e a bee's honeymoon. But Â£1, if kept in circulation, will produce considerable revenue. Let me show how it is possible for a Â£6 cheque of mine to constitute an annual income of Â£300 for one man, and yet never go out of the hands of three persons or even reach the hank. I pay, on the first week in January, a Â£6 cheque to. one of my It is the payment of a employees as his wage.

To the latter statement, honourable members opposite may object, but that is the impression their remarks left on me. I do not suggest that they favour final repudiation, but that there should be a temporary repudiation of our liabilities. The honourable member for Fremantle said that our biggest problem is that of wages. ""While he did not suggest that there should be repudiation, he said that if it were a question of interfering with the wage standard of the country, or of allowing the bondholders, to whom we owe Â£55,000,000 a, year, to wait for their money, he had no doubt which coursehe would follow. A study of history reveals that on the many occasions on which repudiation has been proposed, it has always been considered in conjunction with inflation. It is our duty, as legislators, to consider the outbut that there is every prospect of it lastcome of the adoption of either of these proposals. If any honourable members opposite can point to an instanceeither recent or remote-in which either inflation or any measure of repudiation of national obligations has resulted in ' ultimate good to the community, I shall be glad to hear of it. It is a tempting line of least resistance, this'is due to the general decline in world and, unless a great change occurs in public opinion iii Australia, I am afraid that this country will venture along that dangerous path. We are face to face with problems that confront no other country, and there is no guarantee that we could escape more or less unscathed from experiments with inflation and various forms of repudiation, even if some other countries have done so. I disagree with the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) when he says that Australia's problems are practically the same as those of all other countries, although, so far as the general economic depression is concerned, they are. I hav<>, this at the expense of British investors. before me a cablegram published in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday, which gives reliable statistics showing the enormous decline in the exports of all countries, except Italy and Russia. Russia's exports have been maintained by the dumping of wheat into Great Britain. The United States of America suffered a decline in the value of its exports to the extent of Â£54,000,000 in the second quarter of last year, as compared with the same quarter of the previous year, and a drop of Â£62,000,000 in the value of its imports. A ll other countries, particularly Great Britain, .have practically the same story to tell, so that in that respect Australia is in good company. We know that unemployment is world-wide. Various opinions have been expressed regarding the causes of thisevil and the best remedies to apply, but no nation has yet discovered a solution of the problem. We should pause and consider this fact before plunging into experiments that may have a disastrous reaction. . A recent issue of Public Opinion gives authoritative statements by leading journals showing, not only that the present depression is Avorld-wide, ing for at least another two or three years, and becoming worse before the position improves.; Unemployment has steadily grown in' Great Britain, notwithstanding .the fact that the British Government has poured money out like water in' an effort to relieve the situation. In the opinion, of the .journals quoted, trade, and. the general slump in production values. Germany has now over 4,000,000 unemployed, although that country is supposed to be on the high road to prosperity. The' United States of America, which is said to be bursting with money, also has over 5,000,000 unemployed, which, of -course, represents a small percentage compared with the Australian figures. We are informed that the only country without an unemployment problem is France. That, I point out, is due largely to the fact that France has been able.to ""get away"" with one of the most remarkable pieces of repudiation in the world's history, and But for the friendship of Great Britain towards, France, and her desire to enable France, Germany and other countries concerned in the late war to make an early'economic recovery in the interests of general post-war prosperity, it is probable that the conditions in France would have been very different from those obtaining to-day. At one period, Prance, owing to the inflation of its currency, was in a similar position to that of Germany. It seems almost incrediblethat, not long ago, a paper worth 58,000,000 marks was worth only 6d. in English money. It took 58,000,000 marks to put a 6d. stamp on a letter, although in normal times the value would have been Â£239,000 in hard cash! If Australia ever got into a similar plight, it would require a fortune amounting to about half a million sterling to pay a porter a tip of a shilling. Australia should get into that position. have done it, through the inflation of their we shall find it necessary to keep on issucurrency, what can prevent Australia from having a similar experience? In times of national stress, inflation has commonly been resorted to, but when reaction sets in, the people do not know which way to turn to restore economic equilibrium, and the results are always disastrous. dangerous path it will assuredly suffer the same pains and penalties as have been visited upon the people of every country in which inflation has been tried, and Australia, because of the fact that conditions here are entirely different from those overseas, may suffer for a longer period than any other country. Some honourable members opposite appear to imagine that the establishment of a central reserve bank would facilitate recovery from inflation; and if we increased our paper currency we could overcome the evil effects of inflation, so long as we had such a bank. But Australia is one of the few countries that has no such institution, and there is no guarantee that even if such a bank were established, it would prove a panacea for all our financial ills. Once we seriously dabbled with inflation we should find its effect similar to that of morphia on a sick person. The practice of medical men, in some cases, is to administer morphia to improve the heart action of their patients; but that treatment often starts the sick persons on the road to death. After a while the doses have to be increased, and eventually the patients are unable to do without them. I admit that if we could regulate the effects of inflation, as honourable members opposite seem to think possible, something could be said in favour of such a policy; but experience shows that the final outcome is a terrific collapse of the economic structure,, and the nation is forced to tread the slow and painful path to recovery. If the suggestion of some honourable members opposite were adopted, and we began with the issuing of additional notes to the value of Â£20,000,000, it might relieve the immediate situation and make possible the provision of a certain amount of employment for our people; but it would do nothing to meet the real difficulties that confront the country. ""We must tackle the unemployment problem in a scientific way, or ing additional notes. If we start travelling along this road, we shall soon have to travel upon it at an accelerated pace. It would not be long before similar issues of Â£50,000,000 and Â£100,000,000 would have to be agreed to, and finally the country would not know where it stood. If Australia treads this Our troubles cannot be settled by inflating the note issue, or by repudiation. A good deal has been said recently about repudiation. I do not desire for a moment to cast any slur upon honourable members opposite in this connection. I realize that the Government and honourable members who support it must canvass every possibility of meeting the existing situation. Certain honourable members opposite, however, are looking at the problem in a more or less academic way. One of the troubles about repudiation is that if it is talked about for long enough the idea of it ceases to shock the public mind, and the word loses its repulsiveness, If repudiation continues to be talked about as it has been talked about in recent months, we shall find ourselves unconsciously drifting into it. If honourable members opposite go on suggesting that, if the worse comes to the worse our bondholders, whether they or we like it or not, may have to wait a little longer for their money, the time will come when these will be told that they must wait. The honourable member for Fremantle said the other night that it would be impossible for us to go on year after year providing in our national budget for the payment of Â£55,000,000 in interest to bondholders. My reply is that we must do so, because the financial security of",20,Lyons
67,Mr Lewis,There is no reason why,22,Lyons
68,Mr Thompson,"If other countriesAustralia rests upon tke honoring of this undertaking. National contracts and undertakings must be honored, or the nation will lose the reputation which it has earned for honest dealings. Wages have no logical relation to the real issue. holders may have to wait for their money longer than a specified term is when people are being asked to accept bonds for their money. If the Government desires to practice the theory which the honourable member for Fremantle has had the audacity to advocate, it could begin with the Â£28,000,000 loan which is now on the market. It could tell prospective bondholders that they may have to wait longer than the agreed term for their money. If it did so, it would, of course, fail to secure do not know how we are going to remedy a penny piece. Any statement of that kind in a loan prospectus would result in the complete failure of the loan. That, I submit, disposes absolutely of the proposal of the honourable member for Fremantle which was supported, to some extent, by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Although temporary measures, such as Keane). Whatever else we may do to meet the world conditions from which we are suffering, we cannot touch the bondholders. If we tinker with the traditional reputation of the Government for honoring its, contracts, we shall merely postpone the day of our recovery to normal conditions, and undoubtedly suffer severely in the meantime. After all, inflation and repudiation are, at the best, mere expedients, though they have been looked at closely by some honourable members opposite and by a considerable section of the outside public. In the recent election in New South Wales, these two aspects of public finance almost monopolized the thoughts of the public; in fact the public mind became utterly confused over the real issues of the election because of the prominence given to these two subjects. We must not forget that even if the present depression disappeared in the next year or two, and if the price of wool and wheat rose substantially and we were able to sell the whole of our exportable surplus, we should still have to face the problem of how to find Â£55,000,000 per annum in interest. This expenditure would remain the first item on our budget. We are faced, in my opinion, with problems which face no other country in the world to the same degree. Our taxation is higher per headthan that of any other country, and our national debt is the highest per head in the world. national debt is a little higher per head The time to suggest that bondthan ours. no exaggeration to say that our debt is practically as high as any in the world. Taking it all round, our tariff duties are the highest in the world. On top of all that our wage standard is as high as that of any other country. All these conditions, combined with the slump in the value of our exportable products, have made our position more difficult than that of any other country. Frankly, 1 our troubles. They appear to me to be absolutely insoluble. At any rate, we shall have to apply a new line of thought to them before we shall be able to solve them. increased taxation, may do something to relieve unemployment, it must be apparent to everybody that before long we shall exhaust all possibilities in this direction. It is preposterous to suggest that Commonwealth and State Governments can go on year after year adding to the burdens of taxation which the people are carrying. If that policy is pursued a revolution will occur. It will not be the kind of revolution that will make our streets run with blood; it will be a bloodless revolution. The majority of the taxpayers will simply refuse to pay the taxes imposed upon them. They will say when they get to their last shilling, "" We will keep it and let the governments take it from us if it can"". That, it seems to me, will be the kind of revolution which will eventually bring matters to a head in Australia, and it does not appear to be very far off. Let us look at the actual financial position for a few moments. A mere casual glance at the fact will be sufficient to show us how utterly impossible it is for us to travel much further along the road upon which we are at present moving. In the ten years from 1919-1920 to 19291930, the revenue collected by the Commonwealth and State Governments increased from Â£96,000,000 to Â£193,000,000..",22,Lyons
69,Mr Patekson,The New Zealand,23,Lyons
70,Mr Thompson,"A t any rate, it isA stupendous increase thus occurred in that decade in the taxation burdens of our people. during the regime of Nationalist Commonwealth and State Governments. with accelerated rapiditv now. this increase of over 100 per cent, in the revenue which has been taken by the .Commonwealth and State Governments from the' people of Australia in the last ten years, there has been a commensurate increase in Commonwealth and State expenditure from:Â£97,500,000 in 1919 to Â£193,000,000. From this it will be seen that for those ten years the Commonwealth and State Governments had to depend on excessive taxation to balance their budgets. increase in per capita taxation in that period ? head has increased in the ten years from Â£S 16s. 9d. to Â£15. With the extra taxation which has been introduced recently by this Government and the various State Governments, the people of Australia are taxed more heavily than the people in any other country; more heavily even than those in Great Britain, where the per capita tax is Â£15. In the ten-year period mentioned our public debts also have grown enormously. In 1919 the State debts represented a charge of Â£74 16s. 8d. per head; to-day it is Â£116, and Commonwealth and State debts combined amount to Â£170 per head. The States increased their indebtedness by Â£300,000,000, whereas the Commonwealth debt remained practically stationary. In some years it was actually reduced. Because of the prodigious increase in taxation during those ten years, oiir people have had no chance to consolidate their position. An inflated price for our primary products enabled us to carry tlie debt burden, but the recent steady decline in commodity prices has now brought U3 face to face with our present financial difficulties. included in the figures relating to revenue given by the honourable member? sent merely the total amount taken by the Commonwealth and State Governments in the form of direct and indirect taxation from the people of Australia. Because of the fall in export values for our surplus products, and the high rate of taxation, I doubt that we shall be able to carry on much longer. The incidence of the tariff has been totally unsatisfactory in many ways. Honourable members opposite some time ago appeared to think that the tariff would revolutionize the economic position of Australia; that if , as the result of greater protection, we could manufacture most of the commodities that .were being imported, it would be possible to so improve our position as to make us almost independent of the returns from our primary industries. They have been sadly disillusionedI n spite of the fact that we have the highest tariff in the world, been the despite also the further assistance given to our manufacturers by embargoes on certain commodities, our secondary industries are unable to carry this country through this period of record financial depression. As a matter of fact they have been .the first to let us down. By increasing the prices of secondary articles to the consuming public, they have proved a contributing factor in raising the cost of living, and notwithstanding the excessively high protection given to them, they have not had any appreciable effect upon unemployment, which has increased from 12 per cent, to over 20 per cent, in the last eighteen months. This increase in unemployment proves conclusively that the manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth, whatever other advantage they may have as a national asset, are a frail reed to lean uponin a time of depression, when the bottom falls out of the market for our export industries. For the means to extricate the Commonwealth from its difficulties we must look in some other direction. Honourable members opposite declare that the wage standard must be maintained. But in spite of tariff assistance to secondary industries, the wage standard is falling, and the number of people who join the ranks of the unemployed is increasing from year to year. It is obvious that, if this movement continues, there will soon be no wage standard in Australia. at all the position would be unaltered.",23,Lyons

This is a very important matter, because the people of Australia are anxious to learn by what authority they are being taxed. A conference of State and Federal authorities should be convened as early as possible, with a view to defining the field of taxation in which each shall operate. It is common knowledge that the States have not the power to tax interest that is derivable from Commonwealth loans. Treasurer has stated that all fixed income from property, including interest, is in a relatively better position to-day than it was last year, because of the reduced prices of commodities, and that, therefore, The efforts are distressing and far-reachit should bear additional taxation.

The existing unemployment is a blot upon Judging by their the history of Australia, and the remedy for it is one of the most important questions that confronts this Parliament. I agree with those honourable members who hold the view that Parliament should not attempt to grapple with the situation. The slogan "" Back to work"" appeals to me. I should very much like to see Australia in such a position that every man was able to obtain employment. It is the duty of Parliament to devise means for bringing that about. Unfortunately, unemployment is rampant in nearly every country in the world. The economic disturbance of one market causes a similar disturbance on others, with the result that employment is scarce practically everywhere. In some quarters, it is conLast week 1 asked the Acting tended that the present world-wide depression is due to the drop that has taken place in commodity values, while other causes assigned for it are, mass production, over production, and the rigging of the money market. I was interested in a paragraph that appeared a little while ago in the Melbourne Age, in which it. was pointed out that international gold movements have a bearing on this question. The paragraph reads-The international working of the gold standard has been rendered impossible by reparations, and by the American debt settlements.

I regret that in this House there are many pessimists. somewhat optimistic turn of mind, and even though Australia is passing through a critical period, I do not think that our financial position is as bad as it has been painted by many people both inside and outside this chamber. I believe that, given reasonable time, Australia will find a way out of its financial difficulties. This country, in common with many other countries, is faced with financial stringency, but we have no cause to be dismal or pessimistic. The more hopeful we are, and the more we seek a silver lining to the cloud of depression, the sooner will we prosper. Australia has many problems to solve, and we must tackle them one by one. believe that they can be solved satisfactorily and honestly.

That table shows that over a period of ten years there has been an enormous trade in favour of America. It is, therefore, up to this Parliament and the I shall always endeavour people of Australia to give serious consideration to the position. We must ask ourselves whether we are getting a fair deal from the countries with which we I myself am of a are trading. Most of our trade with America is in motor cars, petrol and oils, and other commodities. It is time that we took action so that in the near future the trade balance may, to some extent,, be restored. The proposal of the Federal Government and the Loan Council to raise in Australia Â£28,000,000 by means of cash and conversions has my support. It is now the middle of November, and the greater part of the loan falls due on the 15th December, 1930.

Those figures show the serious financial position of South Australia, and I am glad that the Commonwealth is coming to its aid.

At the last election, the Labour party received the support of the majority of the electors of Australia because those -electors believed that it would deal honestly and fairly with all sections of the community. The mission of the Scullin Government was-to quote the words of the Prime Minister"" To .straighten out the finances of Australia."" -One section of the Cabinet is willing to Adopt the measures necessary to perform that task;but, unfortunately, another section is travelling a different road. Their action has led many people to believe that the Government was not sincere in promising to balance its budget this year. [Quorum formed.] Both the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and his -deputy in Australia ( Mr Fenton) have said, on several occasions, that our national obligations will be met, and public expenditure reduced; but the financial .statement before us is evidence of. a failure to honour that promise. Weeks And months of valuable time have been Allowed to pass by on the plea that time was required to draft a suitable scheme to provide for a reduction of departmental -expenditure. I was pleased to hear the ^honourable member for Boothby( Mr public debt of over Â£1,100,000,000 is Price) say that, in his opinion, Parliament should have been called together -earlier. It is clear that the real reason for the delay in calling Parliament together was the approach of an election in New South Wales. It has been stated that six Commonwealth Ministers and 29 Â«upporters,of the Government par ticipated in that campaign, in which, according to press statements, the good name of Australia was slandered. Every day of that -delay cost this country Â£30,000. Instead -of Ministers having given a lead to the people in this time of crisis, they have weakly accepted dictation from outside -organizations. The Government has, undoubtedly, repudiated the solemn obligation entered into at the Premiers' Conference held in Melbourne in August last. I regard the proposals of the Government as set out in the financial statement before us as a humiliating failure to recognize the seriousness of the problems confronting Australia. All the State Governments have taken action to balance their revenue and expenditure; they have shown a willingness, even at the risk of their political extinction, to carry out their pledges. The Commonwealth Government is the only defaulter. I remind honourable members that the financial depression which has overtaken us, has not come upon us as a thief in the night. For five years bankers and economists, as well as the public press, have warned the people of Australia that a financial collapse was inevitable if the cost of production in our primary industries continued to increase. The fall in world's prices has now compelled Australia to face facts. But even to-day many people seem not to realize that the national income is much less than it was previously. Various estimates of that reduced income have been given. Generally, it is admitted that the income of the people this year is between Â£S0,000,000 and Â£100,000,000 less than it was last year. The reduction of income has necessarily affected industry, but instead of making a courageous attempt to meet the position, the Labour party talks of repudiation and an inflation of the currency. Various men prominent in that party have publicly expressed the view that all that is needed to set things right is an expansion of credit. Our sufficient evidence that we have mortgaged our credit for a generation ahead. The money-spenders rather than the moneylenders, are to blame for the present state of affairs. It is well to remind those who talk of inflation that the holders of Australian bonds did not force their money on the various governments of Australia, and for that reason to attempt to vary the contract entered into with them would be to commit a crime against tens of' thousands of the best citizens of Australia. people to starve?

The position would need to be extremely desperate before the adoption of that course could be justified. It was never contemplated that money received from amounts, totalling nearly Germany to reimburse us to some extent for the tremendous expenditure caused by the late war should be used for revenue purposes.

The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) said that if all omcers in receipt of more than the basic wage were taxed, it would mean an unnecessary hardship on about 82 per cent, of the members of the Service who were engaged in post and telegraph work. I do not know whether or not those figures are correct; but the total amount paid by the Government to its ofiicers is about Â£10,000,000, and it is proposed to impose the special tax only on officers drawing salaries totalling less than Â£500,000. I submit that the Government should take a percentage tax on all salaries above the basic wage. We on the Opposition side of the House have no objection to the proposed 10 per cent, tax on members' salaries; but I believe that it should take the form of a straight-out reduction. The amount of the reduction will be exempt from Commonwealth taxation, but not from taxation by the State. I suggest that this should not be the position. I submit that under the usual procedure every member will have to show on his returns to a State Commissioner a salary of Â£1,000, and he will have to pay tax on the f u l l amount. Such an anomaly should not be permitted. I regret that the Government has not more boldly faced the position by adopting the suggestions made by the Leader of the Opposition in August last. He then pointed out that it was possible to save tbe sum of Â£4,000,000, which was mentioned at a later date by the Acting Prime Minister, and which would not inflict great hardship on any section. The Government, for reasons best known to itself, has declined to deal, for instance, with the maternity allowance. The annual payment of about Â£600,000 might well be reduced by half, because quite half those to whom it is paid are not in need Total Deduction. of this special assistance.

It is regrettable that responsible Ministers of the Crown have not done all that they undertook to do under the agreement that was signed at the conference with the State Premiers.

Those who talk of inflating the currency, or of repudiating the country's obligations, should be given no consideration. The surest way to restore confidence in Australia would be to keep down governmental expenditure, and to live within our income. There is a growing section of the community which is tired of the waste and extravagance associated with governments, both State and Federal. We need not look further than Parliament House to see how much money is frittered away, regardless of the services rendered. There is similar extravagance in most government departments.

109,Mr Mackay,"We do not need toI believe, to Â£50 a sitting, here is one direction in which a considerable saving might be made in the course of twelve months. One way to solve our financial problem would be to build up our lost productive enterprise. Then we might hope to find a solution of the great problem of unemployment, whereas the present policy of the Government will increase the difficulty of finding work for the unfortunate people who are now unemployed. Only by united action by all classes of the people, and a realization of this responsibility by every member of this Parliament, will the Commonwealth emerge triumphant from its present troubles. In conclusion, I shall refer to the untralia. We were faced with a seriousgenerous treatment of a guest of the Government in the person of Sir Otto Niemeyer. It is a matter of eternal disgrace to Australia that this distinguished visitor was treated in so discourteous and cowardly a manner. We have been told by the Acting Prime Minister himself that this gentleman was requested to come to Australia to assist the Government with his advice on a most difficult situathe value of our exports was greater than tion. My complaint is that members of the Government sat down quietly and allowed certain Ministers to travel through New South Wales and ""defame Sir Otto Niemeyer. I can only say that it is a matter for deep regret that a man of his 'attainments should have been treated in this way, particularly having regard to the fact that the.object of his mission was to help Australia. -Honorabl e members who have participated in this debate have addressed themselves to almost every subject in the political arena; but the main complaint by honourable members opposite has been that the Government has failed to balance its budget. That is apparently the only song that the Opposition can sing. Unfortunately, owing to the fall in the price of our commodities, and to the huge interest bill we have to pay, the Commonwealth Government, like all the State Governments, has been unable to balance its budget. But I remind honourable members opposite that this Government is not responsible for the financial position of the country. Wheni t assumed office it found that Australia had a floating debt of Â£36,000,000 in London, Avhich had been accumulating for a number of years. It also found that an overdraft of Â£9,500,000 was due to the Bank of Westminster. This Government was not responsible for that. During the twelve months the Government has been in office two loans have had to be raised to* provide many millions of pounds to meet the liabilities incurred by previous governments, and it is now faced with theresponsibility of raising a redemption loan of Â£28,000,000. In addition to that, theprevious Government left a deficit in the Treasury of Â£5,000,000. The first thing that the Government did upon assuming office w.as to try to stopthe flood of importations into Ausadverse trade balance. No less than Â£140,000,000 worth of goods was being imported' into Australia annually. The Government wisely decided that it would prevent the importation of some, at least, of these goods. This naturally has caused the reduction of our customs receipts. For the first time for very many years the customs returns for October showed that the value of our imports. It will be seen, therefore, that the Government's endeavour to prevent the importation from abroad of large quantities of goods which could be made here by our own people has been successful to a considerable extent. The Government is entitled to the confidence of the people for its tariff policy alone. One of our main troubles has been that we have"" borrowed. too freely. in recent, years. It is true that, speaking by and""' large, the money borrowed has been well spent. I do not deny that some money may have been wasted; but in the expenditure of huge sums of money on public works it is inevitable that mistakes will be made. The point I ' wish to' make is that the expenditure of this money has resulted in the development of the resources of the country. To-day our assets are greater by far than our liabili-. ties. Some people seem to think that the bottom has fallen out of Australia, and that her indebtedness Has overwhelmed her. I disagree with this view. I believe that if we face the position with courage, we shall be able to rectify our troubles. The Labour party does not advocate the",35,Subsidies Received Through Protected Commodities 1925 26
110,Mr E. Riley (South Sydney) [5.50].,"borrowing of .unlimited money from abroad. The wealth of Australia should be sufficient, if wisely directed, to develop her resources. The Government has been left a legacy by its predecessors in office, and it is prepared to meet its obligation. All the talk that is being indulged in about repudiation is so much political window dressing. An attempt is being made to hypnotize the people. The Labour party, and I as a member of it, stand for the meeting of our obligations in every sense. The Labour party has always stood for that policy. But because certain propositions have been considered in the hope that they might lead to an improvement of our position, it has been alleged that we should all face this vital subject, and desire to repudiate our obligations. nately, the public thinks so. the public who hold that opinion have been misled. I know that tbe newspapers and the Opposition have contended that the Labour party stands for repudiation; but such a contention is entirely false. We realize that the raising of Â£28,000,000 is necessary in the near future to meet our obligations. The question .is: which is the best way to raise the money ? I consider that we must get away from the old orthodox methods of finance. Speaking for myself, I think that the Commonwealth Bank should have accepted full responsibility for this. Â£28,000,000 loan, and paid the bondholders in full, both principal and interest. The Commonwealth Government could have given the bank 5 per cent, government bonds as security for the money so advanced. If this had been done, the currency would not have been increased. The bank could have paid the bondholders in cheques or notes as required. If the Government had underwritten the loan and taken the whole responsibility for it, the country would have been saved Â£3,000,000 annually in interest payments, and Â£200,000 in flotation Costs. The bank could have paid to the bondholders the same class of money as the bondholders originally paid to the bank. The Labour party considers that the credit of Australia far exceeds a mere Â£^8,000,000.. At present, we are paying 62 per cent, of the value of our produce in interest, and the country cannot stand it. A population of about 6,500,000 people cannot possibly continue paying Â£55,000,000 a ' year in interest. Unfortunately, the raising of every new loan increases our obligations, because the interest rate is constantly increasing. credit is so low. which will fall due in the near future were raised at from Si to 4^ per cent.; but to convert them we may have to pay as much as 6 per cent. That is not in the best interests of the country. We attempt to solve it apart altogether from party considerations. dodging, not facing, it. loan is raised, the interest rate goes up, and heavy flotation costs are incurred. This is adding to the burden of the people. Those who control the finances of the country control the life of its people. Currency is undoubtedly the lifeblood of a nation. I have no complaint to make against the banks for engaging in their ordinary business operations; but the Government should bring about a change in its business relations with these institutions. Unemployment is another great problem which we have to face at present. This is not a question of governments but of economics. The advent of labaursaving machinery has resulted in the displacement of a vast amount of Human labour. A visit to a country town shows very clearly that human labour, as we knew it years ago, is, to a large extent, a thing of the past. This has caused a glut in the labour market. I visited a number of country towns during the recent New South Wales election campaign, and was struck by the degree to which human labour had been displaced. Years ago, every blacksmith's shop in a country town rang with the sound of the hammer on the anvil. Two or three men, at least, were employed"" in every shop, shoeing horses and doing other work of the kind; but to-day a blacksmith's shop provides hardly enough work for one man.

The coach and buggy builders have also practically disappeared from the country. The result of all this is that money, which formerly circulated in the country, now does not circulate there. It is spent on motor cars, traction engines and petrol, and most of it eventually finds its way to the United States of America. The same kind of thing is hapoening on the farms.

This revolution in primary industries has caused the population of rural areas to fall by 10 per cent., although the population of Australia has, in the last 22 years, increased by 2,500,000 people.

The Labour party does not object to the primary or secondary industries, but it believes that the people should reap the benefit of its introduction. Mr Bavin, the former Premier of New South Wales, went to the country with a policy for the reduction of wages as a preliminary step to reduction of the cost of production.

The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) made a point of this, I think, and said that this Government was acting dishonestly. wholesale reductions in the salaries of public servants, and have asked why the Government did not bring down proposals to reduce salaries below Â£725 a year, as well as old-age and invalid pensions.

Sitting suspended from 6.14 to S p.m. not surprising to find that the financial statement submitted to the House by the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons), and which might be termed a supplementary budget, has caused a good deal of debate and aroused much criticism. I agree with the remarks of the Leader of the -Opposition ( Mr Latham) in his criticisms of the Government's proposals. In speaking to-night, I wish to be helpful, because I realize that we are faced with a serious, indeed, almost desperate, financial position. The Commonwealth is in a serious plight, and it is time for co-operation rather than criticism. I remind honourable members that the financial statement of the Acting Treasurer shows that past Governments have accumulated deficits amounting to Â£6,485,000. That, of course, is quite correct. According to the statements of some honourable members this accumulated deficit is solely due to the extravagance of past Governments.

Heavy outlays were made in con-nexion with the erection of war service homes, and in the construction of addinecessary equipment and material.

I am glad to see that honourable members opposite have adopted the proposal submitted by honourable members in opposition some months ago in regard to the reduction of members' allowances, and I hope that the remainder of our suggestions will be carried out in an endeavour to balance the budget. The statement. I have just quoted is plain enough, yet honourable members opposite, particularly the more eloquent, skate around the problems and speak of releasing credit and the extension of the currency, which is only another name for inflation. Any sensible person knows what inflation means, particularly those who travelled abroad during or since the termination of the great war* Honourable members opposite are aware of that. "" Economist"", writing in the Melbourne press recently, said on this pointLet everybody be enlightened about the horrors. whicli he wil l have to face when the Australian pound w ill lose its value day after day. All the savings deposits in the banks by the toiling people will be depleted, and nobody .will even consider the advisability of saving. Holders of Government stocks and bonds, and those who have invested their life's earnings in mortgages and long dated loans w i ll be plunged in impoverishment and misery. It is the w o r k in g people w h o w ill suffer as the result of in f l a t i o n . tinuesThen, w i ll come the tur n of the wage and salary earners, men and women dependent on their weekly pay. The"" flight from the currency "" w ill automatically increase the wholesale and retail index out of any proportion to the increase of wages and salaries expressed in paper money. Speculators and profiteers w ill gain by it . Men of financial brain and calculation w ill buy properties, shares and goods of international gold value for depreciated paper money most probably, on terms of deferred payment making provisions for covering their liabilities with further depleted paper pounds! Any interest in creative economic work w ill be lost, as the reward for iiidustrial diligence will be much less than for skilful machinations on the exchange in bonds, shares and foreign currency. Honourable members opposite must be aware of this, yet we read in the press that in caucus they actually carried a resolution for straight-out inflation. Federal Labour members come from all parts of the Commonwealth, and as some represent electorates in which there is a much larger industrial population than in others, their views may be well out of proportion to those of others; but the motion submitted to and actually carried by caucus favoured nothing less than straight inflation. A further motion moved by another honourable member opposite urged repudiation. In these circumstances we must ask ourselves what Parliament is going to do. The press has been most eulogistic concerning the Acting Treasurer's stand against caucus, and I am sure honourable members on this side applaud the Acting Treasurer for the attitude he adopted. But it is rather amusing to me to find that encomiums are necessary where a man merely wants to do the straight and honest thing and to honour an undertaking he gave to his leader. The motion moved in caucus by the Minister for Health and Eepatriation ( Mr Anstey) readsThat legislation be passed immediately compelling bondholders in the Â£27,000,000 .loan maturing in December to hold their bonds for a further period of 'twelve months, interest to be paid as usual, with a proviso that persons in necessitous circumstances may receive immediate payment of small amounts by cashing their bonds at the Commonwealth Bank, same to be held as non-interest bearing security, the onus ofproving that circumstances justify payment to fall on bondholders. If that does not mean repudiation what He condoes it mean? Call it default if you like. Australia should be able to look the whole world in the face withrespect to its overseas and internal debts. The honourable member for Fremantle, whose eloquence thrilled the gallery, but, who, I . am sure, did not convince a single honourable member in this House, moved an amendment to the motion moved by the Minister for Health and Eepatriation, which readThat a demand be made on the Commonwealth Bank Board to underwrite the Â£27,000,000 loan, failing whicli, Mr Anstey's motion be put into effect. In other words the Commonwealth Bank was to be asked to issue notes to the extent of"" Â£27,000,000, otherwise, the redemption of the loan falling due in December was to be repudiated. That was the policy submitted to caucus for an adjustment of our debts. . I am pleased to see that a section of the Government supporters was opposed to that motion, and has submitted to Parliament another which is not so radical but which, unfortunately, will not bear investigation. If we look into this in detail, especially tions. But the right honourable member, in view of the Government's taxation proposals, which will create further unemployment, it will easily be seen how unworkable it is. During the course of the debate on this motion honourable members opposite have introduced many subjects, including over-production and under-consumption. Others have said there is a maldistribution of gold, that the United States of America holds 32 per cent., France Britain only 7 per cent. Still others have said the present trouble is due to "" pegging"" the exchange, which is a fascinating term although one-half of those who use it do not know its meaning. One honourable member said that the introduction of improved machinery was responsible for throwing men out of work, and that it was deplorable to travel through the country and to see blacksmiths' shops which previously employed two or three men in shoeing horses and in general work now deserted or employing only perhaps one man and a boy. Those honourable members overlook the fact that in many of such towns there are now two or perhaps three motor garages, which, if the blacksmiths have shown any initiative, are being carried on by them. Similarly saddlers who were previously employed in harness-making should now be employed in motor car upholstery. machinery does not displace labour. AmericaMen are certainly displaced, but it is only a temporary displacement. They are hoarding of gold, the corralling of it in soon absorbed in other directions if the the United States of America and government of the country is right and France; perhaps if there were a sound. The right honourable member for North better for the world generally. In this Sydney( Mr Hughes), speaking of the connection I should like to throw out a present situation, drew a very pessimistic suggestion. Australia is one of the picture. He said ""Budgets should be greatest gold-producing countries in the balanced, but v -e cannot balance them""; world. Yet we have the tragedy of the and he left it at; thai. He was pressed for Mount Morgan mine, perhaps the richest a remedy. After all. we are here to find in the world, shutting down, after having remedies. We are not elected to Parliament simply to talk and talk and blame past governments for their misdeeds. We are expected to be intelligent and enterprising, and to put forward good suggesafter making a good speech, left the whole solution of the problem to the unpegging of the exchange. With others, he said, "" We must unpeg the exchange."" He said that we must, if necessary, allow the rate of exchange to go up to 30 per cent. But surely he realizes the difficulties of doing so. The exchange rate is merely a brake to the people of a nation who are buying too much from overseas and exporting too little. That country finds the 16 per cent., and Great exchange rate set against it until it is in a position to export gold to bring it down again. To increase the rate of exchange to 30 per cent., as the right honourable gentleman suggests, would certainly be an advantage to the exporter. It would give him something in the nature of a bounty. It would also act as a prohibition On imports. But the right honourable gentleman has forgotten that Australia has each year to pay nearly Â£40,000,000 overseas to meet the interest and sinking fund on our loans. If we were obliged to pay 30 per ceut. exchange on that amount, it would mean an additional expenditure of Â£12,000,000. Furthermore, as we cannot completely isolate ourselves, and must import some necessaries: we should be obliged to pay 30 per cent, exchange on the value of those imports, representing many million pounds per annum. The proposal to unpeg the exchange may have something to recommend it, but it In these circumstances certainly fails as a solution for our present difficulties; and in any case, the exchange is regulated from time to time of how a country or an individual is A great deal has been said about the freer circulation of gold it would be",40,Pabkhill The Y Transactions Were Conducted By One
139,Mr E. Riley,"That is going on in by the banks, who are the best judges",42,Pabkhill The Y Transactions Were Conducted By One
140,Mr White,"Yes, and elsewhere. trading.produced millions of pounds worth of gold, simply because it is no longer profitable to employ labour to produce gold. That is a strong argument against the payment of a bounty on gold. Gold, whether it is currency of the world or not, is not worth digging out when it costs Â£5 an ounce to mine. But if the Government were daring enough to suspend the industrial awards so far as they relate to the mining industry, even for a short period, as an experiment which other industries might watch, gold would be produced in sufficient quantities to help Australia very materially at a time like the present. Although gold is merely a measuring stick of values, and if it were dumped into the sea and replaced, say with pebbles, the world would still have to carry on; it is nevertheless the currency of the moment. was something in the suggestion of tbe honourable member bourne (Dr. Maloney) about the re-monetization of silver. Prior to 1ST 3 silver was currency, like gold, and as not interfere with the machinations of a throughout the centuries fourteen times more silver than gold has been produced, it would be a good thing if silver could again be made currency. But that would need to be done by international arrangement. I is interested in the unemployed. At any rate, any honourable member who does not take a heartfelt interest in the question, should not be a public man. The Government could give very. real work if it suspended the awards relating to the mining industry, so that gold could be obtained wherewith to pay our debts, and if it would mint some millions of silver coins, whether they were declared to bo currency or not. I merely mention this in passing when speaking on the maldistribution of gold. . I think honourable members will agree that interference with the currency will not solve our problems. Honourable members have spoken of over production, under consumption, currency, the shortage of gold in the world, protection, prohibition, and everything which they can blame for the present position. But they have avoided two fundamentals. The first fundamental is that the Government should balance its budget. This was realized by the Prime Minister at the Melbourne conference, where he associated himself with the Premiers of the States, and agreed that the Commonwealth Government should balance its budget. Some have tried to get away from that obligation, but it is something definite and fundamental that must be done. It is, therefore, useless to wring our hands and blame the currency, or the hoarding of gold in the United States, finding some scapegoat somewhere. Values are declining. We are getting down to pre-war values or, perhaps, something less, and we must face the position as business men would.' The other great fundamental is to relieve unemployment. If a business ou the report of its auditors was shown to have made a substantial loss on three There months' trading, would it hesitate to call its directors together? Yet, although this for MelGovernment on its treasury report discovered that it had lost over Â£6,000,000 in three months, it hesitated, and would rabid State leader who was taking part in an election. Sooner than upset that -gentleman in his plans, it faltered, deferring the calling together of Parliament. Finally, not because of any national concern on the part of honourable members, think every honourable member but because of the irresistible pressure of economic forces, we have met here to discuss the problems of the country. And shortly, we shall go away again. But before doing so, we should balance the budget. We should do something really definite to relieve unemployment. Australia has lost from Â£50,000,000 to Â£90,000,000 of its national income. If in one quarter a business discovers that it has not made a profit, it has two alternatives. If it loses some of its turnover it must get more turnover-it is revenue in the case of the Government and if it cannot do so because of competition-Australi a is feeling the competition of Russia, Canada, and otlier wheat-growing countries-it must cut down its expenses. The overhead must be cut down. The Government turns to taxation just as a business firm owning properties increases its rents. The solution of our Governmenta Labour Government-is to impose more taxation on the enterprising people of the community. In every respect it is grossly unfair.. Eor iustance, the increased income tax ou income derived from property is a distinct tax on thrift. The budget will certainly not be balanced by the taxation at present proposed, and I predict that Parliament will be brought together from month to month to deal with supplementary budgets which will be mainly additional taxation. Tbe next proposal will probably be one to tax savings bank deposits. It would be on a pur with the unfair taxation of income derived from property. Property-holders in the main are not very wealthy people; they are mostly persons who have been thrifty and have put their savings into the purchase of a home for themselves with the desire to avoid the stigma of having to draw an old-age pension, which really is the due of every aged person in the community. Perhaps a thrifty person has been able to build two houses, living in one and letting the other. The present Government, which professes to stand for the people and preferably for the working classes, has now proposed a tax that will force these people out of existence and compel them to accept a dole in the shape of an old-age pension. I have figures which will show what a class tax this tax on property is. There is too much class taxation in. Australia. The country is suffering from it at the present time. We ought to get down to the task of legislating for the whole of the people and dealing with the problems of all The following table shows how a resident of Victoria will be affected by the new taxation on incomes earned from property:Amount earned. Â£ 300 -800 1,000 L'iOOO 6,000 * Of the Â£73 increase Federal proposals are responsible for Â£45. To show how adversely the present Government's proposal operates against -tlie poorer people, I .point out that, on an income of Â£300 from property, the increase is 800 per cent, compared with 7S per cent, on an income of Â£2,000 und '50 jper ceut. on an income of Â£5y000. Wc mill see how the present Govern meant Mr White. is working in the interests of those whom they profess to represent in this Parliament I I admit that working men are averse to having their Avages cut. down. A reduction in wages seems a loss; at first it is a real loss and the representatives of the -workers will naturally fight for what the workers have gained. It has been their lifework to fight for increased wages. In their unions they have done nothing bnt fight, to increase the standard wage, and a definite cut in wages seems a shattering of all their hopes. But a sacrifice must be made and the workers must not forget, tliat capital is also making its sacrifices. I recently quoted in the House what is to be found in the preamble of every union book in the United States: that the interests of the employer and of the employee are coordinated and that both should work to tliat end. Unfortunately in Australia, employers and employees are in hostile camps and the best is not got out of either side. It may be news to many associated with Labour organizations to learn how capital has been hit during the present depression. Practically every firm has had its prices forced down through competition. Business people are not earning sufficient money to pay wages and meet their other commitments. A l most every trading firm has been rationing labour. Men have been working perhaps one week a month. Unemployment has jumped from 32 per cent, to over 20 per cent within twelve months. Yet the Premier of New South Wales Increase( Mr Lang), in a message to the people 1929-30. 1930-31. per cent. after he was elected said "" We shall never surrender our standard of Jiving"". Â£ Â«. d.

There is too much leaning against 1.400 0 0 2,174 0 0 50 posts, too much dependency on the Government. As a. community we .are getting flabby and initiative is being killed. What is the standard of living of the unemployed and their families-the 20 per cent.., who for months, and perhaps for years, have had no work,, and who, probably, voted for the Government at the lasi election, perhaps for the last time, because they believed that a Labour Govermnent would find work for -them. Capital, I repeat, has already made its sacrifices. Mr Oswald Bowdeii, chairman of the Melbourne Stock Exchange, gave evidence before the Arbitration Court recently in relation to the basic wageHe pointed out that since June, 1929, the decline in the value of the shares of all banks listed on the Stock Exchange, which did not include the Commonwealth Bank, the Bank of New Zealand, or the Ballarat Banking Company, was Â£34,222,032, or 38.2 per cent. In the same period the share values in a representative group of 23 investment companies had fallen from Â£29,018,024 to Â£19,161,805, OLby 51.6 per cent. An examination of the most recently published balance-sheets of 47 industrial companies showed that while the profits in L92SI-29 amounted' to Â£3,003,000, the profits vernment supporters on the fact that they iu the some companies in 1929-30 were Â£2,482,000, being a decrease of Â£611,000, or 19.7 per cent. Companies in which no profits had been shown, were not included. No two businesses are similarly organized or equally efficient. One that perhaps showed a profit of 15 or 20 per cent, in prosperous times 'now finds its profits reduced by 5 or 10 per cent. The sales tax, extra primage' dues, and other i mposts diminish the profits still further, and hundreds of firms are to-day aiiisciously facing the fact that they are on the road to bankruptcy. ruptcies haveoccurred during the last, twelve months thani n any year since the 'nineties, and firms> which have large overhead expenses and are carrying heavy stocks can see no escape from their difficulties,, except, by repudiation or bankruptcy.

Regarded only from the material point of view, the idleness of so many men is an economic loss; other men have to be taxed to keep them in idleness. Isi t not possible by sound government to find work for the unemployed? Could we not, for instance, by suspending arbitration awards make possible the mining of gold, so that an almost defunct industry might be revitalized? That policy might he extended to other industries also. I turn now to other taxation proposals of the Government. I congratulate Goat last have consented to tax themselves. We, of the Opposition, have long contended that tlie sacrifice necessitated by the reduction of the national income should be spreadover the whole of the people. We,, members of Parliament., should, make a gesture to the Public Service by first rationing ourselves; then we should apply the same policy to government employees. The Government has proposed to reduce the salaries of Ministers and members of Parliament., and to impose a special tax on public More bankservants receiving Â£725 or more per. annum. The Government says that this is not a wage reduction.

We have read of Ministers going cap in hand to the unions of government employees asking if they would allow themselves to be rationed. How ludicrous it is for the Government of a country to consult its own servants as to how they shall be dealt with. The Government is faced with a plain business proposition. The income of the nation has fallen by between Â£70.000,000 and Â£90,000,000 and the loss must be distributed over the whole of the people. Either the Government must accommodate itself to its reduced circumstances or it will cease to govern. The sheltered members of the Public Service are proportionately better off than they were a year ago because the prices of commodities have dropped approximately 8 per cent.; yet the Government refuses to touch them, notwithstanding that the ranks of the unemployed are growing continuously.

The Postmaster-General stated in answer to a question I asked last week that 1429 returned soldiers had been dismissed from his department since the 30th June last. Large numbers of soldiers have been dismissed from other departments also. The Government instead of finding work for men is increasing the problem of unemployment. Many of those who were dismissed were maimed, and that in some cases is the reason why they were temporary. Had they not enlisted for Avar service they might have been permanent.

Is it not obvious that if the Government has only a certain amount of money for wages it can employ more men if the rate of wage is reduced? That is the problem that is faciug every commercial man in the community. All could afford to employ more men if the burden of loss were more widely distributed. The Government refuses to recognize that plain ecouomic fact, and it is heartlessly sacking men who are temporary because they are maimed or infirm, or were too old after the war to pass an examination that The Governyoung men who did not go to the front were able to pass. Of qourse, the obvious answer is that we cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs, and Ministers have told us that we cannot have economy without dismissing men. But there are other alternatives.

I mention that in passing because the Government is so ready to act upon any suggestion to reduce defence expenditure. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) has asked numerous questions in this House respecting the cost of training students at Duntroon aud at Jervis Bay? Melbourne has a right to ask such questions. he ever thought of the trouble and anxiety that those students saved him during the war years when they were attached as adjutants to the units of the Australian Imperial Porce? Has he ever thought of what those men saved Australia ? The' honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr means to enable men to return to work. Watkins) said the other day that the war had caused most of our difficulties and that we on this side boosted the war. How laughable is such a statement to those who were at the war -One wonders if Australia did not pay too dearly, not by way of debt, but in the lives that were lost-the 60,000 men who are now so -sadly missed. What is lacking iu Australia is .'business leadership. During the budget debate I exhorted the Government to appoint a business or economic committee, and to obtain the advice of business men or economists as to how the ship of state should once more be placed on an even 'keel. Despite the views of the supporters of the Labour party, the Government should seek the advice of those who would act honorably and for the welfare of this country. It is not too late to do that. We are losing about Â£'50,000 a day. We sliould obtain the advice of the best economists and act on their opinions, so that we may make an honest attempt to balance the budget, and by so doing enable men to return to work. Sophocles, the Greek poet, wrote, "" No ordinance of man shall over-ride the settled laws of -nature arid of God "": We cannot overTide economic laws. We a.re_ .now 'approaching the pre-war level of values. If the prices of wheat and wool are dropping, all the bounties in the world will not prevent that taking place. We must face the situation and sell our goods at what we can get for them. The Government is attempting to balance the budget by imposing taxation that is forcing enterprising people out of business. To balance the budget we must lessen taxation, reduce Government expenditure and deal with the problem of unemployment. I put these suggestions forward in a helpful way. I am prepared to co-operate with the Government and to support any sane or rational proposal that is likely to bring prosperity to Australia. We are now on the verge of a national disaster of the first magniI admit that, but has tude. Such questions as exchange, inflation of currency, the falling off of the production of gold, and over production of primary produce are beside the point. The pressing problem which we, as members of Parliament, have to face, is to balance the budget and to find The public servants should be thankful that the Nationalist party is not now holding the reins of government. The whole speech of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has been a general complaint' against the Government for not taxing the public servants on the lower standards. He is most concerned about the hardships inflicted on those in receipt of incomes of over Â£725 per annum. He also took this Government to task for its "" brutal"" treatment of returned soldiers. Strange to say there is in Queensland a Nationalist Government which has indulged in wholesale dismissals, regardless of whether the men concerned belonged to the returned soldiers', or any other association. The honourable member argued that a reduction in wages would bring about employment. But that argument has not been borne out by the policy adopted by the Nationalist party in Queensland, and in some of the other States.' Does he argue that the change from the 44-liour week to a 48hour week has increased employment ?

If have wheat, meat, sugar and wool in we are to retain a decent standard of living, %ve must be prepared to pay a fair price for our own manufactured goods. Do the members of the Country party realize that the fall in the price of dairy .produce is the result of reducing the wages of the workers. Has the dairy farmer benefited because of the reduction of the wages of his employees? A grazier owning 6,000 sheep may employ one man. ""Will a reduction of that man's wages by 10 per cent, help the grazier out of his financial difficulties? The increase of 1 per ceut. in the bank rate is a more serious problem for the grazier than is the desirability or otherwise of reducing the wages of his employees. If the Standing Committee of the Loan Council is really desirous of balancing the budget it will take some steps to get the people back to work, instead of throwing more workers out of employment. The Acting Treasurer says that he is hopeful of an improvement. He is an optimist. An improvement will not be brought about by repeating pious hopes. We must evolve schemes by which our people will again be given work. It is idle for honourable members opposite to say that a reduction of wages will create employment. The policy of the Nationalist party is to keep men out of work. In Queensland, renewals of leases have been granted to pastoralists who do not make full use of the land, whereas by throwing the land open to application many families could be settled on it. That is one of the factors responsible for the fall in railway revenue. A vital issue for the consideration of this or any other Government is the problem of unemployment. The ex-member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), when a member of this House, said that the care of the unemployed was not the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, but was entirely a matter for the States. I maintain that the welfare of the people should, be the care of all governments. The leader of this Government should instruct the Loan Council to make provision for the absorption of the unemployed, by making land available to them, so that Australia might produce goods that it; now imports. I suppose that the present season is the best Australia has experienced for the last ten years. We plenty, yet many people are hungry. Wheat is being despoiled by mice, because the growers cannot find a market for their produce. Thanks to six years of administration by a Nationalist government, Australia lacks a proper marketing organization. would that make? difference. If the Wheat Marketing Bill had not been rejected by another place, that measure would have proved of great benefit to the growers this year. Despite the declaration of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank that they could not advance 2s. a bushel to the farmers for their wheat, the fact remains that four months ago they were prepared to guarantee a payment of 4s. a bushel. When the Queensland growers were receiviug as much as os. 6d. a bushel for their wheat, bread was cheaper in that State than iu any other. Under aprice-fixing system, bread was selling at 3d. the 2-lb. loaf iu far back country towns west of Richmond, Queensland. Despite the freight of Â£14 a ton on flour, bread is sold at Mount Isa, in the Gulf country, at the same price as in New South Wales. This shows that under a proper marketing system, price-fixing can be resorted to without hurting the consumers. The Wheat Marketing Bill was defeated by the party opposite, in the interests of the middleman. On the day when the second reading of that measure was moved in the Senate, middlemen from all parts of Australia were lobbying, with the result that the bill met its fate at the dictation of those who had been securing large profits for years at the expense of the real producers-the tillers of the soil ana the labourers who assist them. Yet the party opposite asks for a reduction in wages as the solution of the problem of unemployment. We should make an earnest effort to obtain our own markets for our products. times as much wheat as we can consume in onr own market, for the defeat of the Wlieat Marketing",50,Pabkhill The Y Transactions Were Conducted By One

Â£1.4,000,000 or Â£15,000,000. ber wanted to ""spend fifty millions bravely"" during a period of plenty. The Loan Council, in an effort to get over one of its difficulties, had a brain wave. South Australia had to be propped up again. Labour administration, Queensland lent Â£1,000,000 to South Australia, and then it furnished a Nationalist Government in New South Wales with over Â£1,500,000 to enable it to pay the wages of government employees. That money was provided by a State that has social legislation equal to, if uot better than, any to be found elsewhere. Let us examine Labour's policy in Queensland. Four or five years ago, for instance, the Tully River country was dense scrub; but today it supports 5,000 settlers, and the project is paying interest on the money invested. On the Dawson River and Castle Creek settlements the people are all prodticers and taxpayers. They are paying rent for their land, and the money invested in those undertakings is being returned to the State Treasury. That is why Queensland is in a more prosperous condition to-day than any other State. The completion in North Queensland of the railway system that links the Gulf of Carpentaria with Premantle, has proved a check on the coastal shipping companies, and has operated in the interests of the producers. I suppose that that Hue is the only railway in Australia today that is anywhere near returning interest on the capital outlay. That work was carried out under a Labour administration. One of the most important industries in the Commonwealth is that of mining. In the past it has given employment to as many as 70,000 men, but to-day it is closed down. standstill, because the prices of copper, tin, and other metals are very low. Mount Isa, Queensland, has 3,000 men employed as the result of Labour's activity in building a railway to enable that field to be worked. In the last five years, chased the company out of business. One-seventh, of our wheat is no less than Â£2,000,000 has been spent in the development of that field, which will be the principal lead and silver producing district in the world. These are schemes, not to throw men out of work, but to put them into employment. How they contrast with proposals to allow 20 per cent, of the workers to starve at the dictationof Sir Otto Niemeyer! Honourable members opposite talk of the safety zone in regard to advances from banks; but what After fifteen years of is the safety zone regarding unemployment? Isi t the desire of the people of the Commonwealth that, on account of lack of interest on the part of governments, the streets of our cities should run with blood? How long are men, women and children to bo left starving? Something must be done. The mining industry is one that could give much employment. With modern machinery, fields, now idle could be developed, as has been proved at Mount Isa. Our copper mines are closed to-day, because of the low price of ore, and the absence of modern machinery. If assistance were given in the establishment of suitable treatment plants we could produce for our own requirements. We are told that nothing can be done to assist the gold-mining industry, but gold is surely a commodity that cannot be over-produced. Is there not as much justification for a gold bounty to-day as there was when the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) gave Â£5 an ounce for it, at a time when the Argentine refused to take England's paper money? Gold is of no less value to-day, and in this time of emergency, when the industry could give work to 10,000 persons, immediate assistance is essential.

Have arbitration courts had any effect on the mining industry in the United States of America? merely have the honourable member's statement that compulsory arbitration is responsible for the position at Mount Morgan. A t Charters Towers and on the llodgkinson, Croydon, aud other goldfields, there is greater mining activity than ever before, despite the low price of metals. A grant is made by the Federal Government mining, and 1 think that Queensland's share is Â£7,000 a year, the whole of which sum has been expended this year i u prospecting for gold. Old fields will again be worked, but assistance is required to enable men to use improved machinery to treat the lower grade ores, so that these may be dealt with more economically than under the crude methods previously adopted. Australia was producing over Â£14,000,000 worth of gold, and between 1901 and .1910, 70,000 men were employed i u the industry. Between 1909 and 1923, over 20,000 persons wore engaged in mining in Queensland. To-day these men are on the bread line, and nothing has been done lo provide other work for them. The whole trend of the expenditure of the Loan Council, under the intelligent direction of Sir Robert Gibson, has been in the direction of erecting bank premises. In Queensland, the Commonwealth Bank building cost Â£300,000. also four or five private banks in Brisbane, ' which penditure of about Â£250,000 Extensions to the Commonwealth Bank building in Sydney are being made to-day at an estimated' cost of Â£500,000.

T h a t Government spent m ill i o n s of pounds in the m a k in g of concrete roads which enabled A m e r i c a n m o to r cars to r u n in c o m p e t it i o n w it h our government owned r a i l w a y s . It was, therefore, g u i l t y , p r a c t i c a l l y , of destroyin g i ts o w n assets. In m y o p in i o n , it was a scandal to b u i l d a concrete road from Sydney to N e w castle at the expense of the taxpayers of this c o u n t r y for the benefit of the j o y riders between those t w o cities. In addition to the newspapers to which I have already referred, From Loan. -' Â£ the Daily Commercial News and 555,557 Shipping List has criticized the .. 783.44(1 Bruce-Page Administration. In an . . 1.013.524 articl e w h i c h appeared in its issue of the l o t h J u l y last the f o l l o w in g views were expressed:When tbe Scullin-Theodore Ministry arrived . KN . T. it found that the financial obligations of AusÂ£ tralia had been increased from Â£284,000,000. 4.599,492 or Â£57 0s. Sd. per head in 1918 to the colossal .. 5.01.8,193 sum of Â£494,000,000, or Â£78 12s. 7d. per head. 3,995.787 The mess was so colossal that the Ministry almost regretted that it bad won tbe election. 14.213,472 The interest bill had increased from twelve and a half million sterling i u 1918 to twenty-five and three-quarter million sterling in 1928. whilst the population had increased by approximately a shade over one million souls. These figures refer to only the Commonwealth liabilities, and the position is infinitely more ghastly if the liabilities of the States are taken into consideration. . In fact, the total liabilities arc now over Â£1,200.000.000a sum altogether beyond the capacity of tbe population of six and one quarter million people. The position of the Government is desperate. particularly in view of the fact that in It has no alternative but to increase taxation. It can float no more loans if it wished to. Its sole resources now are what it can collect from Australian pockets in the form of taxation, loans and forced contributions. Week after week tlie Nationalist press of Australia urged the previous Government to reduce its expenditure from loans. The same press expressed sympathy with this Government upon its assumption of office because of the financial problems with which, it was faced. Honourable members opposite have alleged that the Labour party favours repudiation; but this party has never stood for repudiation. It stands for the honoring of all. our obligations. If the truth must he told, it is honourable members opposite who are the repudintionists. Did not the Bruce-Page Government promise to provide Â£20,000,000 for a housing scheme? That promise, like many others that it made, was dishonored. Long ago, in making an appeal to the people for support at an election time, promised that if it were returned to power it would jjrotcct the wages and conditions of the workers. But as soon as it was returned to the treasury bench, it completely forgot its promise. Did honourable members opposite accuse the British Government of . repudiation because it appealed to the United States of America for a reduction in the interest rates on its American war loans? The American money lenders acceded to the request of the British Government and reduced the interest rates. In view of this, surely there would be nothing wrong with this Government, asking Australian bondholders to forgo 1 per cent, of the interest due to them so that they might have a part in the general sacrifices of the community. If public servants are to suffer reductions in their salaries, and if the cost of production is to be cut down, surely fair-minded bondholders would be willing to join in the common sacrifice. A reduction of 1 per cent, in the interest payable on our national debt would mean a saving to the country of Â£15,300,000 annually. That huge sum would be sufficient to provide work for every unemployed person in the community. The Government might well make an appeal to the bondholders to make this sacrifice, consequence of the deflation of the currency the value of our bonds has increased. The bonds are worth more today than when they were issued; and the bondholders would not miss 1 per cent. Au appeal of this kind surely would not fall on deaf ears. A sacrifice of 1 per cent, in interest would greatly help the nation in this time of stress. The .amount so sacrificed could be paid into a special account in the Commonwealth Bank and used for some definite reproductive purpose, sueh as the encouragement of the cultivation of tobacco or cotton. Money invested in. these undertakings would return a substantial profit. The adoption of this policy surely could not be regarded as repudiation. I kiiow that it is always popular t.o attack the other fellow, but it seems to me that the bondholders could bear this sacrifice without feeling it very much. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) spoke to-night of the hardthe Bruce-Page Government ship that the new property tax would impose on property owners. But a man would have.to be in receipt of an income of Â£5 :i week from property before he would pay a penny in taxation. It cannot be said therefore that he would be suffering any severe hardship. It Inis been said that the Government is proposing to tax the thrifty people, but what about the thrifty people who to-day, through economic troubles, are walking the roads of this country? Are not they entitled to somo consideration? This Government should complete its banking legislation so that the Commonwealth Bank may go out after the business that is available to it. Under existing conditions, all those who are producing wealth for the Commonwealth are being exploited by the banking institutions of this country through being called upon to pay high rates of interest for their accommodation. This is the only country in the world with a truly national bank, and yet the Government apparently has not the courage to so strengthen it. that it may function iu the interests of the people. The Senate has beeu holding up vital banking legislation which this Government introduced some time ago. "" the honourable member to make reference to legislation in another place. that this Government, despite the attitude of another place, should insist upon the passage of the Central Reserve BankB ill , so that, producers may be able to get accommodation on reasonable terms. Are honourable members aware that, since the .commencement of this campaign for a reduction of the cost of production and for equality of sacrifice on the part of all sections of the community, practically every person with an overdraft has been called upon to pay an increase of 1 per cent? This is the equality of sacrifice whicli finds favour with banking institutions | The producers of wealth are being explpited by the banks. The people are being told that the trading banks have made advances to the l i m it of their resources. have made sacrifices to the limit, .of their capacity, with the result that' to-day the Commonwealth is in the clanger zone. creasing on every hand. Much has been said lately about an attempt by the Labour party to interfere with the. functions of our banking institutions. always heard the same complaint. In 1908, when MrK in g O'Malley, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr E. Riley), the honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney) and other Labour members in the Federal Parliament were fighting for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, the then Prime Minister( Mr Fisher) and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), were somewhat timid supporters of the proposal, because of the general belief that it would mean the destruction of the existing system of banking. So well organized was the opposition that certain members pf the Labour party were inclined to drop the scheme. But since its establishment in 1910 the bank has had ' -in uninterrupted record of success. To a large extent it financed Australia's activities in tlie war, and on the 4th August, 1914, it was the only national bank in the world doing business. For the first time in its history the Bank of England closed its doors. Throughout the war the Commonwealth Bank, controlled all war loans raised in Australia and saved this country millions of pounds in flotation expenses. The n I shall say There was then no talk of undue inflation. To-day we are told that Sir Robert Gibson, the Chairman of the Bank Board, must protect the interests of the people, and so w ill decline to authorize the bank to underwrite the flotation of further loans. Why did not he protect the interests of the people during the last sixteen years? But Sir Robert Gibson has not, so far. refused to do anything which this Government has definitely asked him to do. It is true that he baulked at the proposal to finance the Commonwealth wheat pool, but when lie was informed that it was the policy of this Government to finance a wheat marketing organization he very soon changed his mind. He also said that he could not underwrite a loan of .The workers also Â£18,000,000 for the States; but he did, and saved the people much in the way of flotation charges. As the resources of the bank, during the war, were Unemployment is in used to raise money for the purpose of destruction, so in this time of crisis they should be operated in the interests of production. From 1911 to 1920 the profits from tlie note issue amounted to We have Â£7,S05,094, and from the general banking business for the same period Â£12,000,000, or a total of oyer Â£19,000,000. The bank has rendered a distinct service to the people of this coun-' try. It is the people's bank.' In the early days of its history it was bitterly opposed by the "" diehards"" in the financial world. Sneering references were made to the bank and the note issue, the opinion being freely offered that Fisher's "" flimsies"" would not be worth "" two b o b"" a month after their issue. Sof a r from that being true, they saved the Commonwealth during the crisis following the outbreak of war. The history of the Commonwealth Bank is not an isolated one. In Queensland similar results havo followed from the establishment of the State Government Insurance Oflice, which was "" kicked off "" with a packet of envelopes, a pen, and a writin g pad. It was established",53,Pabkhill The Y Transactions Were Conducted By One

The following is a summary of its operations:The assets of the office increased by Â£364,191 while and you wil l see that he has not. -mor e than one-third of a million poundsand the premium income and interest exceeded the previous year's by Â£15,452. The growth of the office's trading in the last three years is shown in the following figures:Premium and interest income of all departments, 1927-28, Â£1,119,170; 1928-29, Â£1,187,779; 1929-30, Â£1,205,331. Claims paid in the three years were:-1927-28 , Â£683,806; 1928-29, Â£634,935; 1929-30, Â£607,859. The increase of assets was as follows:-30t h June, 1928, Â£2,634,087; 1929, Â£2,841,264; 1930, Â£3,195,445.
