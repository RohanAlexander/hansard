(Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Energy Market) Bill 2004) Wednesday, 16 June 2004 ----Immigration: Children bell ringing ceremony at Wollongong Town Hall with over 100 local residents of all ages, including lots of kids. The ceremony marked the end of the four-week deadline set by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission calling on the federal government to release all children from Australian detention centres and residential housing projects. The deadline was contained within HREOC’s 925-page report A last resort? National inquiry into children in immigration detention, which was tabled on 13 May 2004. In a rather pathetic, heartless move, the report was immediately attacked by the government, and its major findings and recommendations rejected. The minister labelled as ‘disappointing’ the report’s recommendation that there should be a presumption against the immigration detention of children and that family unity should be preserved. What a disgrace! The government attached the label ‘backward looking’ to a scathing report which actually brought it to account for its shameful treatment of children and their families in immigration detention centres since 1996. This report is a damning indictment of the mandatory detention regime introduced by the ALP in 1992 and expanded upon and made more harsh and inhumane by this government. More than 150 children remain in detention as we speak. These detention centres are nothing less than prisons, and they have had, and continue to have, a damaging effect upon the detainees. A last resort? contains numerous examples of the damaging physical and psychological effects imprisonment is having on refugees and asylum seekers of all ages, but of most concern is the long-term effect on children. At the bell ringing ceremony last week I spoke with local psychiatrist Dr Neil Phillips, who outlined concerns amongst the profession in Australia over the long-term psychological effects detention has on young people. During my visit to Villawood detention centre last year I saw aspects of this tragedy. I saw children in a prison, behind razor wire and high gates. These children are subject to shocking eventspeople on hunger strikes, others committing suicide or harming themselves, and individuals experiencing physical and mental breakdowns. The detention of children is a national shame-a national disgrace. The people of Australia know this, children in our schools know this, the world community knows this, and the thousands of Australians who rang bells last week know this. Yet the government persists with its heartless behaviour. And its excuse? The children are meant to deter people-smugglers. That is right: the government openly admits that it is using these children-abusing these children-in order to deter people-smugglers. This is nothing less than sickening. Until mandatory detention in Australia is abolished, until the present inhumane system is gotten rid of and until children, young people and others are released from these inhumane detention centres, where some people have been languishing for over five years, the bells must keep ringing. As the report revealed, the present mandatory detention regime is fundamentally inconsistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Request For Detailed

174,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (9.40 A.m.),"Last Thursday, 10 June, at 4.15 p.m. I attended aEnvironment: Hawkesbury River the past few months will have been appalled to see the massive outbreak of aquatic weed Salvinia molesta which is choking large reaches of the river, especially around Yarramundi, North Richmond, Windsor and immediately downstream. In addition to the obvious environmental problems, it is affecting recreation on the river and local tourism. Locals and visitors might also see two weed harvesters working on the river currently pulling out around 250 tonnes of weed a week from the river. The question is: why has this very serious problem developed? It has happened for a combination of reasons: firstly, high nutrient levels from a number of sources, but largely from the 30 or so sewage treatment plants along the river and its tributaries; secondly, the low level of water flow because of the prolonged drought preventing the river being adequately flushed out-this means that the bulk of the flow in low rainfall times is largely treated effluent; and, thirdly, the high temperatures over summer and autumn which allowed the Salvinia to grow so quickly, doubling in biomass every 72 hours. The fact is that the New South Wales government should have acted much earlier to address this outbreak. It was not until the Commonwealth committed $300,000 to assist in leasing two weed harvesters that the state government matched the offer. Anyway, at last, local state and federal authorities are working together with the catchment management authority to address the current infestation. However, this does raise longer-term issues of river catchment management. Firstly, while the drought has exacerbated the problems of low water flow, there are serious long-term questions about the inadequacy of Warragamba Dam to meet the water needs of Sydney’s growing population. This issue must be addressed or the low levels of flow in the Hawkesbury River will be a perennial problem with the associated impact on water quality, weed outbreaks and other issues. Secondly, the New South Wales government must seriously plan for Sydney’s long-term water needs. Thirdly, the 30 sewage treatment plants in the catchment must be improved to reduce the nutrient levels of effluent flowing into the river. Fourthly, proposals to allow large scale housing developments within the catchment must be deferred until these fundamental infrastructure issues are addressed. The 70,000 to 90,000 houses planned for the Bringelly area must not go ahead until acceptable infrastructure is put in place. It is not acceptable that the Hawkesbury River continues to bear the brunt of the long-term planning and infrastructure failures of the New South Wales government. Whichever party is in office in New South Wales, these long-term issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Roads: Sisters Hills Road First of all, I would like to talk about toast, seeing as I have just had some. I would like to congratulate the shadow minister for transport and infrastructure, Martin Ferguson, who was kind enough to come to my electorate on Sunday, 6 June-a very momentous day-and announce a $15 million commitment to the Sisters Hills Road, which is on the Bass Highway west of Burnie. It was the next day, of course, that the federal government’s much touted AusLink-or ‘AusShrink’, as was the case in Tasmania-was announced, but they did not announce the Sisters Hills Road as a priority for AusLink. They accused the state government of not prioritising it. MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Statements By Members

176,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (9.46 A.m.),"I would like to talk about roasts and toasts.In actual fact, I have seen the very documents that the state department used with the Commonwealth, and the state government did prioritise it as a road of strategic regional importance. The reason the Commonwealth did not prioritise it was that it did not fit the Commonwealth’s own criteria for what constituted the national road network or something equivalent to the national highway system. That was the very reason. Along with Kevin Jones and Trevor Duniam of the lobby group to improve the Sisters Hills Road, Mayors Roger Chalk, Ross Hine and Alwyn Boyd, and the very honourable minister Bryan Green, who is responsible for this portfolio in the state government, I was able to stand with Martin Ferguson and announce funding for this very important road. The state Liberal opposition caned the state government for not including funds for this road in this year’s budget. But, in actual fact, the alternative budget under the shadow Treasurer, Mr Brett Whiteley, from my local patch, did not include it as well. We have also had local Liberal Senator Colbeck running around saying he is a great supporter of this road, but he has done nothing-as is the case with wind power recently, in this so-called energy white paper-to lobby the federal government to fund this important road. So the only commitment of funding for this road is from federal Labor-like it did in 1998, like it did in 2001 and, I am very grateful to say, like it has done in 2004, with a pledge of $15 million. This will provide funding for the first five priorities of the 13 that were determined in a public consultative process to bring about the most important priorities for that road. So federal Labor is committed to that and I am very proud of that. I now call on this Commonwealth government to match those pledged funds. Environment: Policy ble announcement by our Prime Minister yesterday regarding energy use in this country into the future. There has been incredible frustration in the minds of miners and agriculturalists across this country with the fine print of the existing off-road and on-road diesel fuel rebate, and that has now been clarified once and for all. Agriculturalists know that they will get a rebate for the excise paid on diesel fuel used into the future, from this point on. Those who are using marine craft for professional charter work will know that, regardless of the fuel used in their vessels-and I know that some in my electorate are running on unleaded petrol-they will in future be able to gain an excise rebate for the fuels used in those vessels. They have not been able to do so in the past; it has been a total confusion. Agriculturalists involved in grain drying who use diesel fuel for that energy purpose have not been able to get a diesel fuel rebate on that energy so used. Quarriers, as opposed to miners, have not been able to get a rebate on the diesel used in the machinery in those quarries. Those involved in the construction industry have not been able to get a rebate on the diesel used in their industry. In the past, those using machinery on haul roads in the mining industry have not been able to get a diesel fuel rebate on graders under 20 tonnes or water trucks involved in that activity. From now on, they have certainty with regard to those areas. It is not before time that an announcement has been made that gives certainty to our energy rebates for mining, marine and agricultural use. It is a very welcome announcement. The feedback from my electorate has been overwhelming since the Prime Minister made his announcement, and my folk are absolutely satisfied.

They will in time realise the exact benefits that are in mind here-there will be no need, in the future, to check the fine print of the arrangements for rebating of fuels. It is also very pleasing to see that we have half a billion dollars invested in making our coal industry, into the future, a cleaner source of energy through the geosequestration of carbon dioxide. It is not before time that this move has been announced, and Australia will be better off for it. Agriculture: Dairy Industry Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (9.52 a.m.)-The dairy industry in Tasmania employs some 1,900 people in dairy farm production, as well as influencing the state’s broader agricultural manufacturing sectors. But dairy farmers in Bass and the rest of Tasmania are hurting. There has been considerable restructuring of the industry, resulting in changes that have placed stress on the business aspects of running a dairy operation as well as personal stress on families and the broader communities. In 2002-03, ABARE reported that dairy farm cash incomes fell by the largest amount in 27 years to around $31,000. This was the result of two principal pressures: increased costs of production and lower prices for milk. Of course, it is easy to label this aberration as a structural adjustment or a restructuring-terms that effectively dehumanise the pressure being applied to squeeze the little guys out. The uncertain future viability of the dairy industry has to be acknowledged, particularly in relation to milk prices, supermarket power, water entitlements and security, and the barriers to attracting younger people into the agricultural industry. The Australian food industry is big business. Total consumer expenditure on food is around $75 billion, or 45 per cent of total Australian retail spending. Food processing accounts for $55 billion of this, with dairy being 15 per cent, or $8.25 billion. Supermarkets account for 65 per cent of retail sales, or $48.5 billion. No wonder supermarkets are driving down the price paid for milk. Supermarket power, when used to drive commodity price lower than the cost of production, is market power misuse-and that is the message I am receiving from dairy farmers in my electorate. yet Australian milk production has more than doubled in the past 20 years. The average dairy herd size in Tasmania has doubled in the past 10 years, yet the number of farms in the Tasmanian industry has declined. Average dairy herd sizes are increasing and the number of small dairy herds is decreasing, so we have small farmers being squeezed out. The member for Murray told the ABC on 13 May 2004 that she wants Victorian dairy farmers to take their fight for better prices to suppliers and supermarkets. I do not dispute the need for this action, but I have to say that I am really disappointed that the member for Murray did not seek some kind of government backing for an industry round table, because dairy farmers in my electorate are after some level of government support-not just being told to go and talk to someone else about the problem. In May, the New South Wales Farmers Association said: ‘Current farm-gate prices aren’t sustainable. Many dairy farmers have had the same price for three years.’ The New South Wales Farmers Association often talk in code, so let me do a bit of translation. They are askMAIN COMMITTEE",154,Statements By Members
178,Mr Haase,"I suggest that the situation in Tasmania must be indeed bleak, because theying the government to jump out of the conga line and help suffering dairy farmers and communities. When dairy farmers are holding signs, as they did in front of the Prime Minister in April, saying, ‘Milk is cheaper than water; dairy farmers must survive,’ the government should take action, not tell them just to go off and fight their own battles. I urge this government to urgently undertake an immediate and comprehensive response to address these issues that are crippling the dairy industry, an industry that employs some 1,900 Tasmanians. Parramatta Electorate: Kingsdene Special School a.m.)-A few months ago, the 20 families of the kids with profound disabilities at the Kingsdene Special School in my electorate received letters from the council of Anglicare New South Wales saying that Kingsdene Special School would close at the end of this year because it is currently costing Anglicare just under $1 million a year to fund. By way of background: Kingsdene caters for kids with the most profound disabilities, including severe autism, uncontrolled epilepsy and Rett syndrome, which not only is an intellectual disability but also affects muscles, meaning that the kids require a wheelchair. Two of the kids have Angelman syndrome, which is a severe intellectual disability accompanied by lots of distraction behaviour, constant laughter and flapping of the hands. The central nervous system is affected and it requires lots of support in order to control those kinds of behaviours. The school has developed over the last 27 years as a dedicated, purpose-built residential and educational facility. The property has a bike track, a beautiful hydrotherapy pool-both the water and the air are heated so that kids with uncontrolled epilepsy can use it effectively as a therapy-an oval, two playgrounds and a residential facility for the kids with the highest needs of all. To close this facility would, in my judgment, be a tragedy. Let us look at the cost of its replacement. This piece of land, which is in the centre of my electorate, at Telopea, in metropolitan Sydney, is conservatively estimated to be worth $15 million. Anglicare could close the school and sell up tomorrow to make way for medium-density development. Anglicare are saying that they are prepared to continue providing that purpose-built infrastructure. The parents desperately want the school to stay open: they love their children, they love the teachers and they enjoy complete trust and confidence in each other. I know many parents of kids with serious disabilities do not take advantage of respite care opportunities because they do not have the confidence in the revolving door of carers that provide the care, whereas here you have a beautifully strong community. My parliamentary colleague Brendan Nelson has committed to sit down and host a roundtable with his state parliamentary colleagues Andrew Refshauge, the minister for education, and Carmel Tebbutt, the minister for ageing, disability and home care. Also at the roundtable meeting will be Peter Gardiner, the CEO of Anglicare; Gloria Boyd, the principal of the school, who will be ably supported by Mary-Lou Carter, who is a great agitator on behalf of the parents. A solution must be found to this problem, because closure of the school is simply an unacceptable and irrational outcome. (Time expired) der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded.

Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (9.59 a.m.)-BeforeI finished last night, I was talking about the problems that the cuts to the Commonwealth dental scheme have been causing in my electorate, and I was talking about a family who came to see me. The mother, Susan, came to see me just last week, pleading with me to get help for her 12-year-old daughter, whose teeth give her constant pain and cause her dreadful embarrassment, due to serious overcrowding that requires extensive orthodontic treatment. Susan’s family situation is typical of so many in the community. Her husband works in a sales job that pays a base rate plus commission so his income fluctuates from week to week, sometimes by hundreds of dollars. He also does security work on weekends when he can get some hours and, again, this causes the family income to vary from week to week. All in all, the family’s income is impossible to predict from one month to the next, much less a year in advance as they are required to do by the government system if they want to receive the family payments to which they are entitled. When Susan tells Centrelink that she cannot estimate her family’s income a year in advance, she is not trying to be difficult; she is being honest. I am sure that in a perfect world she and her husband would love to know exactly how many cars he will sell in a year and how many hours he will be called in to his security job. It would save them many anxious moments when business is slow. But this family, like millions of others, do not live in that MAIN COMMITTEE perfect world. They do the best they can in the circumstances in which they find themselves. Sadly, however, they are being penalised by the current system for doing just that. Susan tells me that her family has been hit with debts for overpayments of benefits three times, despite her best efforts to keep Centrelink informed of changes in the family’s financial circumstances. She has now taken the difficult option of overestimating her husband’s expected income for this year by quite a few thousand dollars. So, in those weeks when her husband’s income falls well short of the estimate-and that is not unusual, given the tight economic times facing Rockhampton-they are also receiving less Centrelink benefit than they are entitled to, just so they can live without the spectre of a debt at the end of the year. How could anyone say that the government system is working for this family? Even worse for Susan and her family has been this experience of trying to get their daughter’s teeth attended to in the public dental system. Their fluctuating income and the Third World waiting list have combined to deny this young girl the treatment that would end her pain and end the merciless teasing she has to endure at school each day. Susan tells me that her daughter has been on the waiting list at the Rockhampton Base Hospital dental clinic for five years. For most of that time, the family was entitled to a health care card, which would have allowed her to receive the orthodontic treatment that she so desperately needs free of charge. However, the family’s circumstances have changed, with two older children moving out of home, so they no longer have a health care card and have no way of paying for treatment they have been told will cost between $10,000 and $15,000. I guess you could say that we in Queensland are the lucky ones because at least our Labor state government has struggled on alone keeping the public dental health program going, even after the Howard government abandoned its responsibilities in this vital area. But that is of little comfort to this family, who languished on an impossibly long waiting list only to see their hopes of treatment vanish once Centrelink deemed their circumstances ineligible for a health care card. I would like to see the Prime Minister explain to this little girl why his government does not think a public dental program is a priority in this country, or perhaps he would like to accompany her to school to help defend her against the cruel remarks from other students that are making her life a misery each and every day. The second family I wish to mention is another example of the government’s failed family tax benefit scheme coming back to bite families when they need help the most. We have heard about the many thousands of families who have had their tax returns clawed back by this government to repay family payment debts that were incurred despite people’s best efforts to keep Centrelink informed of their changing income. Losing your tax return that you had banked on to get ahead on the mortgage or to pay off the credit card is bad enough, but this family had their baby bonus clawed back. So here is a family who had heard all the hype about the government’s baby bonus and were in that small group of families who are actually able to take advantage of it and, instead of the baby bonus coming along to help them get over the reduced income and increased expenses that usually come with a new baby, the baby bonus went straight to Centrelink to pay off family tax benefit debt. For three years now the government’s family payment system has not been helping families; it has been trapping them. The government knows that, and that is why it is going to such great pains to hide the results of its flawed system until after the next election. On behalf of MAIN COMMITTEE the families in my electorate, I am calling on the government to once again spare us the political fix and instead fix this system so that it works for families, not against them. I would like to use my remaining time this morning to speak up on behalf of the thousands of people in Capricornia who are forgotten in this highly political budget. I am talking about the 87 per cent of people in Capricornia who earn less than $52,000 a year and who this government has deemed unworthy of tax relief and unworthy of recognition for the hard work they do and the struggle that they face in making ends meet for their families. One of those families came to see me at a mobile office that I held in Rockhampton recently. They actually came to see me before the budget. When they told me their situation I assured them that they were exactly the kind of middle-income family who surely could expect assistance and tax relief in the budget. Surely the government would do something to help those families in the middle range of income who were being squeezed by all the extra burdens the government was putting on them in terms of health expenses and the increased costs of getting their kids educated. So there I was actually giving the government some credit in advance of the budget. Well, I will not be doing that again, because I was proved totally wrong. In the family I am talking about, the father earns $48,000 before tax. So he falls under that $52,000 threshold and there is no tax relief for him. The family routinely overestimate their income to avoid Centrelink debts because they have learnt from experience that they cannot trust the government’s hopeless family payments system not to trap them, like it has trapped so many others. This family have teenage children. The family complained bitterly to me that this government expects them to support those children financially until the age of 25; they are considered to be dependent on the family until that time. All in all, this family are struggling-and they are not the only ones, as any member on this side of the House can tell you. The mother of the family, Robyn, told me that their daughter has been forced to leave university because the family just cannot afford to keep her there. Of the group of six friends who started uni together, four have now dropped out for financial reasons. For example, I think she quoted a figure of $700 for this girl’s textbooks at the start of the last semester. It was just too much for the family to cope with, having three other children to care for as well. I gave the government a bit of credit before the budget, but there was nothing in there for that family. Fifty-two billion dollars of spending later, there were no answers for this family coming out of the budget. It just goes to underscore the point that, when there is an election approaching, this government, as we have seen time and time again, is happy to throw around billions of dollars in the interests of its own re-election. But because the government is so out of touch with the lives of ordinary people, the money does not go to those who need it the most. There are thousands of those people living in Capricornia and they have been badly let down by this government. I hope they will have the chance very soon to cast their judgment on this government that has abandoned them so comprehensively. budget is one of the best I have seen in my time in this parliament. To me it has the right mix of measures to help Australian families as well as business and community groups. I seldom disagree with my colleague the member for Capricornia. We are good friends and we are neighbours. But I would like to correct two things she said. Firstly, she implied that the need for a dental scheme was somehow the fault of the federal government. For 99 years of 103 years of Federation, dental health has been the responsibility of the states. Towards the end of MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Abare Reported That The Number Of Dairy Farms In Australia Has Halved Since The 1970s
181,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.07 A.m.),"I have no hesitation in saying that the 2004 federalthe Keating term the then government decided to give the states a four-year catch-up program. You would remember that, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, because you were a minister at that time in the New South Wales government. All the states were given this four-year catch-up. When the current government, the Howard government, came to power, we did not stop that program; we finished it. We finished the four-year program. It was never the intention of the ALP to continue that program, because there was absolutely no provision made for it in the forward estimates. It was made very clear to the states that it was a catch-up program. As the Commonwealth puts the money in the top of the bucket, some states inevitably take it out of the bottom of the bucket. In this particular instance you could not say that this government or the Commonwealth in general did not fulfil its obligations. Neither the Keating nor the Howard governments failed to complete what they said they would do. I ask a question of the Queensland government. With a budget surplus of $2 billion and a responsibility for dental health care resting with the state government, why in heaven’s name would Mr Beattie not put appropriate funding now into the dental health scheme that he and the Goss government neglected for so many years? The second point I would makecatch-up program. It was never anything else but that. Your government did not intend that it should go any further. You did not even include it in the forward estimates. The second point made by my good friend and colleague the member for Capricornia was that somehow the federal government was cruel to the people earning less than $50,000 a year and that somehow they had missed out. Let me remind you that everyone earning from $20,000 up to $52,000-and now, in the coming year, as a result of this budget, it is up to $58,000-of income will be taxed at 30 per cent. I remind my ALP colleagues that when they were in power that same group was taxed at 34 per cent and 43 per cent. While you might argue that that group is not appreciably better off in terms of taxation, you cannot argue that they are any worse off, because clearly they are not. And if you add the family tax benefits to it, they are appreciably better off. TodayI would like to particularly address what is perhaps Australia’s most pressing problem-that is, the ageing population. We all know we are an ageing population. It is not something to be afraid of, but it is something to make provision for. That is something that this government has done from day one: it has taken aged care very seriously. Since we came to power in 1996, we have increased aged care funding from $3 billion to $6 billion. Over the next four years, we will be investing $30 billion or, if you like, an average over those four years of $7½ billion a year. That is a massive increase over what the previous government was doing and way in advance of anything like inflation or MTAWE. A big part of that expenditure is increasing the number of available aged care beds for older Australians. When the Keating government left power we were woefully short of aged care places, with only 149,000 beds for the whole of the country. That was even 10,000 short of the then ALP government’s own targets. We inherited a system in dire straits. Since 1996, we have set about remedying that appalling situation by putting more beds and facilities into the aged care system. The number of aged care beds has grown by 37 per cent to 204,000. Our latest aged care package, Investing in Australia’s Aged Care: More Places, Better Care, is the biggest ever investment in aged MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
182,Mr Danby,It was a federal scheme.,160,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
183,Mr Neville,"No, it was not-you just did not hear what I said. For four years it was acare by any Australian government. It will deliver, as I said earlier, $30 billion for aged care over the next four years, bringing the total funding since 1996 through to 2008 to $67 billion. That is a huge investment in aged care. Of that, $58 million will be spent to ensure that an extra 27,900 new aged care places are put in place in the next three years. Of those new places, 13,030 are coming onstream this year. The 2004 budget builds on this good news, but we cannot just wave a magic wand and instantly summon aged care places throughout Australia. We must provide the tools and resources to build on the infrastructure that is already in place. So along with the general eight per cent increase-that is, taking the measure from 100 beds per thousand of population to 108 beds per thousand of population for people over 70-this government is making a huge investment in aged care, with a one-off grant of $3,500 for every nursing home and hostel place. On an individual basis that might not sound like a lot of money, but let us see what it really adds up to. The entire figure amounts to $513 million going into the capital development of our aged care facilities in this financial year-that is half a billion dollars. For my electorate, we are talking about $3.34 million for capital upgrades in aged care facilities. I went to one aged care facility, which should remain nameless, that has been having a bit of a struggle, and they told me that the $140,000 that they will get is going to be of immense benefit to help them finish off the hostel in the manner in which they have always wanted. I recently opened the new aged care facility in Gin Gin, on behalf of Ministers Truss and Bishop. I can attest to the quality of the aged care services and facilities that I found there. This facility is indicative of what is going into a lot of regional areas. The Kolan Gardens complex has been on the cards for the past 10 years and the Gin Gin community worked hard and long to get it to fruition. We all know that small centres face an uphill battle in terms of fundraising, so I am proud to say that in this instance the Australian government helped out with a $1 million grant towards the cost of building Kolan Gardens. I cannot think of a more practical way to help our older residents who do not want to leave the area where they grew up and where the people they know and love reside. There is already a tremendous demand for places at Kolan Gardens and expansion plans are in the pipeline. I for one will support the expansion and any plans that will increase those sorts of facilities within my electorate. It is also interesting that the Kolan Shire Council, who were the umbrella body for this grant, decided that they would undertake the project themselves. They raised funds in addition to the $1 million that the Commonwealth put in-they had a target of $2 million-and they decided to build the complex themselves, engaging their own architect and construction manager. Would you believe that the architect estimated the cost of the facility at $3 million, but the council said to the construction manager, ‘Use our own day labour to the extent you can, and, wherever you can’t, please go out into the community and get appropriate subcontractors,’ and, by doing it that way, the facility was built for $1.9 million. It just shows you what small communities can do with a bit of assistance from the federal government. I understand that, with our climate, beautiful countryside and coastline, Hinkler is very attractive to retirees, to the point where the Miriam Vale Shire, which is between Gladstone and Bundaberg, is both Queensland’s fastest growing mainland shire and the fastest ageing shire within my electorate. As at the last census, the average age of Hinkler residents had increased by almost three years, going from 36 to 39 years. However, in the Miriam Vale Shire, the average age has climbed from 37 to 42 years. Logic dictates that in another 20 years there will MAIN COMMITTEE be a boom in the demand for aged care places, and I commend the government for taking steps in this budget to address those future concerns. But the government is also taking care today of families, who are our future and who are at the forefront of this budget. Families are the building blocks of Australia, and the only way to create a secure foundation for them is to extend practical assistance in the raising of children, making home ownership affordable and generating employment. This budget is helping each and every family to get ahead in life-not with hand-outs but with hands-on help. It is a strange feeling indeed to realise that many young Australians voting at the next election will have no recollection of the previous Hawke and Keating governments. They will not remember national unemployment at 10.9 per cent. They will not remember what it is like to live under the oppressive regime of home interest rates at 17 per cent. Suffice to say that 17 per cent interest rates mean that a couple with a $100,000 mortgage have to find $1,400 every month just to cover interest payments. Yes, that figure is right-$1,400 every month. Without strong economic management, we could return to the bad old days where home owners barely kept their heads above water. I do not want to see that, and Australian families certainly do not want to see that. This government has managed our economy to the point where every Australian home owner is enjoying low interest rates, better employment opportunities and a strong economy. In short, we are giving people the tools to put roofs over their heads and to stay in steady employment. That is particularly so in my electorate of Hinkler. Some in the Main Committee today would be surprised to hear that the notoriously difficult Bundaberg jobs market has made a remarkable recovery since the coalition came to power in 1996. Since that time, the Bundaberg region has seen Centrelink queues almost cut in halfdown from 6,200 people to just over 3,200 people. Any way you look at it, it is an outstanding achievement and one that goes hand in hand with the national unemployment rate. At 5.5 per cent last month, Australia has recorded its lowest unemployment for 23 years. Perhaps even more impressive is the fact that 80 per cent of the jobs created during the last 12 months were full-time positions. Let us compare that with Labor’s record. AlthoughI am sure the opposition would prefer that I did not, let me give a few figures. In the past six months, the coalition has created 68,000 full-time jobs-note that they are full-time jobs. For the last six years of their government-the last six years, not the last six months-the ALP could only manage 53,100. So in six months this government’s policy has achieved more for job seekers than Labor achieved in two full terms. I for one will mark the headway being made, even if the opposition, with its spruiking of gloom and doom, will not. Just recently we had the opposition leader come to our city trying to sell the fallacious furphy that youth unemployment in the Wide Bay-Burnett region was over 30 per cent, when in fact it was less than 19 per cent. He tried to pass off the full-time teenage unemployment rate of 32.5 per cent as the region’s youth unemployment rate. You would think the Leader of the Opposition would know the difference between these measures. The full-time teenage unemployment rate is always high, and the reason for that is as follows. Sixty-eight per cent of kids are still at school. Of the 32 per cent who leave school in that age group, of course you will always have a high proportion of them wanting a full-time job. So that measure is always a high figure, everywhere around Australia-even in areas where there is relatively good employment. MAIN COMMITTEE When you move away from full-time teenage unemployment to all measures of teenage unemployment-in other words, full time, part time and casual-the figure drops from 32.4 per cent to 22 per cent. It is a big drop. However, if you want to go to youth unemployment, which is 15to 24-year-olds-and that is the rate the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe he was citing-the figure is actually 18.9 per cent, or, as I said, just under 19 per cent. It is pretty deplorable. If you want to use the Leader of the Opposition’s measure of 32.4 per cent, if that is what he says he meant-that is, it was the figure for full-time teenage unemployment but he just put the wrong name on it-then let us compare it with what it was in Wide Bay under Labor. What was it? It was an amazing 54.7 per cent. That is, the rate for full-time teenage unemployment was 54.7 per cent. If the Leader of the Opposition comes to my electorate, I do not mind him giving figures. I know we have had endemic unemployment in my area, and I work very hard to reduce it. But he should not start scaring people: he should come and tell them the truth and start putting up some sensible measures to see how we might get that figure down. As I pointed out, the figure is coming down, and it is because this government has been so focused on it. It is also not surprising that the Leader of the Opposition claimed that 90 per cent of Hinkler workers would miss out on tax cuts. He failed to mention that the very great bulk of those people have children, and they will do very well out of the 2004 budget. Families in my electorate and across Australia will have a far easier time balancing their work and personal obligations thanks to the biggest family assistance package ever. Around two million Australian families will benefit from the $600 increase in the family tax benefit part A, along with this: from next month onwards, every new baby will attract a $3,000 maternity payment, rising to $5,000 for babies born after 1 July 2008. We also know that working families need flexible child-care options, and this budget responds to the growing demand for our child-care sector, with 40,000 new outside-of-schoolhours places and 4,000 new family day care places coming on line. But, even better than responding to the immediate demand, this government is actually building the basis for selfsustaining long-term prosperity in regional Australia. The opposition might be interested to know in relation to the Wide Bay Burnett region, an area which obviously has them captivated, that this government has invested almost $10 million in job-creating projects via the Sustainable Regions Program and the Regional Assistance Program. We are providing much needed capital support to create new industries such as smaller aircraft manufacturing, scallop ranching, small crop processing-in particular, chillies-and hemp fibre production. But we have not forgotten the one industry that has been Bundaberg’s backbone for generations-I refer to the sugar industry. The $444 million sugar package has been welcomed by the grassroots of the industry, because of its comprehensive nature. Cane farmers have the choice of restructuring and diversifying or exiting the industry, while sugar mills have been given the wherewithal to maintain throughput and retain crucial local jobs. In the Bundaberg region, about 3,000 jobs directly rely on the sugar industry and, although we have not yet seen the full impact of the package, the majority of the industry is optimistic. Canegrowers’ past chairman, Jim Pederson, is on the record as saying: MAIN COMMITTEE The package will lift the blanket of uncertainty suffocating individuals and families by allowing them to make informed decisions about their futures. We should see substantial benefits flow through to depressed coastal communities from Far North Queensland to northern New South Wales. I would like to know what the opposition’s thoughts on the package and the future of the sugar industry are. Let me tell you: the ALP members have jumped on their negative bandwagon and driven as hard and as fast as they can through the rural sugar communities of Queensland. It is no secret that the opposition does not support the sugar industry one iota. Communications spokesman Lindsay Tanner is on the record as saying: Now the sugar industry was mentioned before. We know where John Howard’s priorities lie. They’ve spent several hundred million dollars bailing out the sugar industry already and there’s going to be hundreds of millions of dollars more. We have had the shadow minister for agriculture and fisheries saying the same thing and the Leader of the Opposition trying to say he was only asking an innocent question. This has been a good budget. In the areas of my electorate which the ALP should be interested in, they have been found wanting. Australian public in a desperate bid to satisfy the Prime Minister’s political needs, not the needs of ordinary Australians. Four out of five families and singles will not get a cent out of income tax relief and three out of five families will get nothing at all from this budget. That is six million Australian families and singles whose pockets are empty yet again. After eight years in office this government has taken, on average, almost $9,000 more each year in federal taxes from these individuals. What do we see from all this tax income in the government coffers? A breakdown in basic services that the Australian people have been complaining about for years and years, a failing Medicare system, increases in HECS fees and a faulty, flawed, family tax system that discourages people from taking on extra work. Today, I would like to focus on some key areas of the budget that have failed people in my state of Western Australia and in my electorate of Swan-ordinary people who tell me that the government’s quick-fix election bribes in the budget are not what they need or expect from a government operating in a strong economic environment. Firstly, there is the issue of transport funding through AusLink. The plan has been purposely slanted to serve the east coast of Australia-in particular, those marginal seats the government wants to win. It has imposed the government’s electoral priorities and only partly funded projects, leaving state governments to pick up the tab for the remainder of the cost. The government has ignored the states. They have been left out of the negotiations that developed the detail of the nationwide transport network. This plan is not conducive to a national network. It falls well short of the Commonwealth government accepting responsibility for funding of the national transport system. In principle I welcome the government’s injection of funds into transport infrastructure, but the allocation process is inconsistent. The government needs to have an independent infrastructure council, with representatives from the private sector and local and state governments to provide public scrutiny and information about the cost-benefit ratios of these projects. Funding should be allocated on the highest level of public benefit, not as part of a porkbarrelling project system in marginal seats.

184,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (10.27 A.m.),"This budget is just a fistful of dollars thrown at theWestern Australia has again missed out on its fair share of the AusLink funding. Of the $6.2 billion allocated for transport infrastructure upgrades across Australia, WA will receive just $432 million. Ironically, $190 million of these funds is old money previously announced for projects dating back some five years. WA will receive just under seven per cent of the AusLink allocation to the state and territory governments. It is unfair, when you consider that Western Australia produces 30 per cent of Australia’s exports by value, generates $23 billion in revenue for the Commonwealth government each year, contains 25 per cent of the national highway and takes up a third of the nation’s landmass. The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ freight movement survey of 2002 shows that, of the total freight travelling by rail throughout Australia, 45 per cent travels through Western Australia. As a destination for freight travelling by rail nearly half-47 per cent-of all tonnes per kilometre travelled in Australia is heading west. The government’s support of the upgrade of the Fremantle Port and Kewdale terminal rail loop project is welcome. Kewdale freight terminal is in my electorate and is part of Pacific National’s Perth freight operations. It is one of the busiest in the country, generating 66 per cent of Pacific National’s total revenue. Some 300,000 tonnes pass through Kewdale, and the majority of this freight is moved between Friday and Monday each week. Kewdale freight terminal is located on 110 hectares of land. Pacific National has injected significant funds into the site to ensure future projections of over one million tonnes of freight will be moved through the terminus by 2028. However, the Kewdale-Fremantle loop upgrade is aimed at moving sea containers from the port, not rail freight containers coming into Western Australia from the eastern states. Given the volumes flowing through Kewdale freight terminal now-and the future projections-it is remiss that the government has ignored funding for the Indian Pacific rail network. That is the network that runs trains twice weekly from Sydney via Adelaide to Perth and it is made up of some 4,300 kilometres of rail track. There are significant amounts of freight being railed into Western Australia on this antiquated rail network. AusLink funding, with its focus on the east coast of Australia, has ignored the rail and road network spanning the centre and west of Australia. As Vincent Tremaine, Chairman of the South Australian Freight Council, said, AusLink is ‘nothing more than an east coast-centric initiative and, as such, should be renamed EastLink.’ Western Australians are already being punished with higher costs of goods because of oil price increases, and the government’s failure to address road and rail freight systems for goods coming into Perth will only compound these problems. Rail has a substantial market share in the east-west route. However, nothing has been included in this AusLink funding program to maintain and improve this network. AusLink is trying to create a national road and rail network that will streamline passenger and freight movements, in the hope that the amount of cargo on roads is reduced. This package ignores the rail and road networks for goods coming to Western Australia from the east coast. I recommend the government consult with transport providers on this route, to ensure that the people in Western Australia are not disadvantaged in future funding allocations. In relation to aged care, my electorate includes some of the most established suburbs of Perth. In these suburbs are many elderly residents-some 16,000 people. Many of these constituents live in retirement and lifestyle villages, hostels and aged care facilities in Swan. Australia’s ageing population has been the topic of much discussion for many years, and the figures are quite startling. The number of children under 15 declined last year, but the growth MAIN COMMITTEE rate for people over 85 or more is 4.6 per cent. There will be more than four million older Australians in 20 years time, 40 per cent more than the number now. Our ageing population is growing fast, and there are obvious requirements to accommodate this part of the population now and to plan for the future. I welcome the government’s injection of funds into aged care. However, it is again just a short-term political fix. It does not address long-term issues. The government has been surprisingly quiet on the findings of the long-awaited Hogan review report-the $7 million assessment of aged care. It is because their Aged Care Act 1997 has been so shamefully neglectful of senior Australians that after eight years the aged care crisis has deepened. I suspect the Hogan review confirms that the 1997 reforms were the catalyst for the calamity we face today. The new funding system introduced by the government in 1997 brought about changes to aged care without providing the necessary financial backup. This lack of funding has put significant pressure on the aged care industry. We now see a chronic shortage of places, a weakened industry and the delivery of poor quality care. This underfunding was highlighted by La Trobe University’s report Underfunding aged care: an analysis of the adequacy of care funding in residential aged care in April 2001, which found: Contrary to the claims of government, there has been a total underfunding over the 3-year period ... in the range of $61.3 million to $158.6 million. In October 2001 a second report found: The level of underfunding over a 4-year period ... was estimated in the range of $193.9 million and $265.8 million ... In February 2003 a further report found: The level of underfunding over a 5-year period ... was estimated in the range of $226.8 million and $393.5 million ... But there was more. In October 2003 La Trobe University’s report found: The level of underfunding ... was estimated in the range of $260.4 million and $405.8 million from 1996/97 to 2003/04 ... Yet it is only now that the government are injecting funds into aged care, years after industry groups made them aware that the underfunding was putting them under great pressure to provide quality care for residents in aged care facilities. It is a typical coalition knee-jerk reaction in an election year. In the Hogan report, the Aged and Community Services Australia submission clearly states: The pricing arrangements in place since 1997 have eroded product quality by reducing the quality of life of residents. They have done this through the pressure they have imposed on funding levels. This has resulted in a reduction in support for the quality of life of residents due to a reduction in the time staff are able to spend with them. The Hogan report cost Australian taxpayers $7 million, and the government’s response to the report has been deliberately put off for consideration until next year’s budget-after the election. There are questions that need answering. Will an accommodation bond apply to residents who are classified as medium-care residents under the new resident classification scale? Will there be further increases in the maximum daily accommodation charge for non-concessional MAIN COMMITTEE residents from $16.25 to $19 per day, a 40 per cent increase from the current charge? Will accommodation bonds apply consistently for both high-level and low-level care? Will bonds be available to providers for the duration of a resident’s stay if it is greater than five years? Will an aged care voucher system be introduced? The government say they need to consult with the industry on these issues, but they are putting off decisions about this aged care crisis until after the election. The fistful of dollars thrown at aged care to cover up the inadequacies of the 1997 reforms may buy time in the short term, but will it address the ongoing issues? Australia’s population is ageing, and it is happening fast. The funds that are so desperately needed will help to address the government’s shortfalls-their neglect of the seniors in the past-but they fail to provide any measurement or assessment of how these funds will be administered. There are no safeguards in place and very little detail in the offering to ensure that the dollars injected will be used effectively and accounted for transparently. Before the end of this financial year, over $500 million will be used for capital investment in facilities to help aged care providers meet safety and building standards required for the 2008 certification. Those providers out there are struggling to meet the 2008 certification requirements, and this additional funding will assist in this case, but the government has not yet set in place a mechanism to ensure that this capital injection goes towards the building requirements for certification. It must provide a clear and concise method of ensuring these dollars are not wasted. It needs to ensure that the quality of life for residents is going to improve. Older Australians have been ignored by the government for over eight years, and I feel that this funding is now so belated that they have given up hope. Aged care providers and workers have been pleading for years for assistance, and the requests have been falling on deaf ears. The industry has always struggled to attract and retain employees. Although the government has funded opportunities for education and training for aged care nurses and workers, that is something the opposition have already announced through our Aim Higher education package. One of the biggest deterrents to people entering the aged care work force is the low level of pay on offer, and I am sure that many dedicated aged care workers would have certainly felt slapped in the face by the government’s ‘top end of town’ tax cuts in this budget. In their generous spending spree, the government have failed to meet the needs of the majority of Australians. The huge spending budget-$52 billion over five years and $6 billion before the end of the financial year-has ignored taxpayers earning less than $52,000 a year. The government’s tax and family package, some $35 billion, has failed to actually provide relief to the people who need it. Three out of five families and singles will receive nothing, and four out of five taxpayers will not receive one single cent of the $15 billion in tax cuts. It is ludicrous. The average wage in Australia is just under $50,000, yet the government has not been listening to the average Australian taxpayer. In my electorate of Swan, the 2002 census found that the average median weekly income is $890 or just $46,000 per annum. So, for most of the 80,000 residents, last year’s pitiful tax cuts would seem like a salvation in comparison to this year’s. In Western Australia only 234,600 families and single adults will receive an income tax cut. A total of 815,300, or 78 per cent of Western Australian families and single adults, will receive no income tax cut because their taxable incomes are below $52,000. These are the forgotten people in this budget. MAIN COMMITTEE The government has failed to listen to the average Australian. They are under financial pressure. Even if they are fortunate enough to receive a tax cut, they will still be worse off than when this government came to office. Australian families are hard working. They are the backbone of our strong economy, but they have been largely mistreated in this budget. You would think that, with Australia’s strong economy, a fair and equitable budget would reward hard workers-but not so. The rich are still getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and families are being financially squeezed. In relation to the family tax benefit, the $600 hip-pocket election sweetener the government is delivering into the bank accounts of recipients of the family tax benefit can only be described as a retractable gift. It is a compensatory measure for bad policy. There are some 600,000 Australian families with debt from the family tax benefit system-with an average debt of $900. There are 3,109 families in Swan who currently have a family tax benefit debt. The $600 payment fails to address the real dilemma of the family tax benefit system. It is faulty and flawed. Here are some of the facts. The total of family tax benefit overpayments in 2002-03 was 1,639,378 or, in dollar terms, a staggering $1.417 billion. The total of family tax benefit underpayments for 2002-03 was 1,279,186 or $1.08 billion. Only 44 per cent of payments under the family tax benefit scheme are correct; a staggering 56 per cent are wrong. The facts are in the figures. The system is not working. The $600 payment is just patching up the debt trap. The average debt is $900 for families with overpayments. The government refuses to correct the family payment system and it penalises people who work hard, who are returning to the work force or whose incomes vary throughout the year. In the last election year we saw the same bandaid solution-a $1,000 waiver just prior to polling day. I think Australian families are tired of this giving with one hand and then taking back with the other hand. Now, of course, any debts families accrue in the 2003-04 financial year will be hidden until after the election-so save those $600 payments per child because you will need the money to pay your tax bill. You will not be able to spend the money on what really matters: food, clothing and education costs. Nothing symbolises the cynical nature of this budget more than these $600 payments. They straddle the Prime Minister’s preferred election dates. Australian families want sustained reform of the family tax benefit system. They want a system that delivers financial relief to them year after year, not a system that delivers debt year after year. Rather than reform the system, the government has applied a bandage to the wound. There is nothing to ensure that families get to keep their fair share of earnings from overtime or when a parent returns to work. Ordinary Australians are being robbed by a benefit trap that does not reward them for hard work. Since 1998 the election year budget spending shows a typical trend. The average new spending in the three election budgets is now at $32.9 billion, while in non-election years it averages $3.9 billion-a fiscal bribe to attract voters at just the right time. But it does not address the issues of two of the community’s most serious concerns: affordable health and education. This government’s budget is a pre-election monetary inducement that does not address any true reform to services that Australian people need. There is no plan to adequately fund public hospitals, to save Medicare and increase bulk-billing rates and nothing to help the 500,000 Australians waiting for dental care. The issues of child obesity and mental health have not been addressed. Labor will fund a $1.9 billion project to rebuild bulk-billing, provide $300 MAIN COMMITTEE million to restore Australian dental care and $25 million to promote community well-being and reduce childhood obesity. Australians also need better access to education-lifelong learning and opportunities for all. This government has no plans to fund schools on a needs basis. There is no plan to address the shortage of TAFE and university places and nothing to keep higher education from becoming outpriced for ordinary Australians. Labor will invest $2.34 billion to rebuild and reform universities and TAFE colleges through the Aim Higher package. There will be 20,000 new university places and 20,000 new TAFE places opened each year. The government’s 25 per cent increase in HECS fees will be reversed so that university degrees are accessible to all, not only those who can afford it. Young people have been completely forgotten by this government. Each year some 45,000 young people leave school and do not go on to full-time work or study. They are lost in a system full of gaps. Youth unemployment in some Australian towns and cities is hitting the 30 per cent mark. It is a waste of young people’s lives and talent. They need opportunities to work and develop new skills, to take on responsibilities, to work hard and develop life skills. Under Labor these young people will not be forgotten. There will be additional work and training opportunities so they can do something good for themselves and their families, plus their local communities. There will not be fees for secondary school students at TAFE colleges and there will be 7,500 new apprenticeships available. That is a $700 million investment in the future to give young people a sense of belonging and purpose to their lives. In relation to work and family, the government have had over a year to work on a family package ready for release, but they have held back. Struggling families feel financial pressure and they are waiting. In time for a pre-election sweetener the funds have flowed. Again it is too little, too late. The financial burden on families needs to be eased by delivering effective and fair tax reform that repays hard work, not one-off payments or quick fix solutions. The failed baby bonus scheme has also been shelved and the government have again used lump sum payments like the maternity payment-a one-off payment for a quick fix, not a sensible, staggered payment like Labor’s baby care payment, which ensures that the money is spent on those extra expenses week by week. This budget is all about satisfying political needs, not the needs of ordinary Australians. Eighty per cent of Australian families will receive no income tax relief and over 60 per cent will get nothing out of this budget. Since the government came to office eight years ago we have seen an average increase of $9,000 per year in federal taxes for ordinary Australians, but they are not getting value for their money. The government has run out of steam, run out of ideas, and it is failing to meet the challenges in crucial areas such as health and education. The government has no future, no direction-(Time expired) question of the differing philosophies that the differing political parties apply and the way that shapes policy and in particular shapes the budget and the strength that is in this last budget brought down by the Treasurer in May. I was interested to hear the member for Swan concluding his remarks by saying that the government has run out of ideas. Wrong. In listening to his speech I kept being reminded that I was hearing the same old rhetoric. The rhetoric of those opposite has not changed since they lost government in 1996. They want to reintroduce the same tired, old policies that were shown to be failures.

185,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (10.48 A.m.),"I rise to speak in this debate on theI have just been reading a small publication shown to me by my colleague. The difference in job creation statistics is outstanding. When you look at the most recently published statistics, you see that in the past year-that is, in a single year-we have created 68,000 full-time jobs; yet the best the Labor Party could manage in its last six years in government was 53,000 jobs. Those figures really show the difference in the philosophical thinking that underpins the different sorts of policies that we introduce and that those philosophies bring about different outcomes. That is why the Labor Party’s philosophy of collectivism, whereby they will make decisions for groups and the individual can be sacrificed to the group collective decision, will always fail people who need to have policies made for them so that they can succeed. However, the philosophy of individualism that we follow obliges governments to make decisions that take into account the requirements of all individuals, including those who are brightest, those who are ordinary, those who are at the bottom of the class and people who are disabled-it does not matter who they are; there has to be room for them within our societyand not sacrifice them to what is seen as a collective or group decision. When we look at the way policy is implemented in accordance with the philosophy-and I would hasten to say it is also not a selfish philosophy; it is one that says that you must not be concerned only about your own opportunities but that you have an obligation to look after your neighbour as wellwe see it is a philosophy that brings about good outcomes. The principles of free enterprise, which go hand-in-hand with this, tell us that individuals will always spend their own money which they earn through their hard work better than will a government that says, ‘I am going to compulsorily collect your money by taxation and then I am going to spend it on your behalf-and you will be better off, because I make decisions better than you do.’ Wrong! Individuals will always make a better decision. So the question of tax cuts for us is one of returning to individuals some of their own money so that they may make the decisions for themselves and their families about how they will have better outcomes in their lives. When we introduced tax reform in 2000question? in philosophy, does she go as far as Margaret Thatcher, who said that, as far she was concerned, there was no such thing as society? garet Thatcher’s record not only as a leader of a nation but as a leader strutting the world stage is that she and Ronald Reagan between them changed the world. So there is a lot that I admire about Margaret Thatcher. The question of what a society is is not pertinent to what I am talking about. A society can be an incorporated group; it can be a whole lot of things. My point is MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004

194,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop,"It is a very worthwhile question to ask. I must say that Marthat individuals have an obligation to each other as well as to themselves, and governments have the obligation to make a decision that allows all people to reach their maximum potential and not, as collectivist governments such as the Labor Party do, make a decision for the collective or the group where individuals can be sacrificed to that decision. I go back to where I was: this perfectly splendid budget returning taxpayers’ money to taxpayers so that they have the ability to spend their own money more wisely than governments who purport to spend it on their behalf. The principles of free enterprise-of which this is a tenet-are very firm in outlining the business of government. The business of government is toon the Procedure Committee are very keen that there be interaction in the chamber, and today we are showing that you can have a lot of interaction! It is very busy here. Going back to my point: the fundamental principles of free enterprise are that governments shall do those things that the private sector either cannot or will not do and provide for those people who cannot provide for themselves. In accordance with those principles, this budget is a very fine budget indeed. When we had tax reform in the year 2000, we made a point of saying that 80 per cent of taxpayers would pay no more tax than 30c in the dollar. The tax cuts which have been introduced in this budget ensure that that promise is again met: 80 per cent-indeed, more than 80 per cent-of taxpayers will face a top marginal rate of no more than 30c in the dollar. In addition to that, looking to the people who have needs, we introduced very early in our term of office the family tax benefit parts A and B, which are designed to assist families with dependent children to meet the costs of bringing up a family and to have quality of life. In enhancing that policy, before the end of this month there will be a payment of $600 tax free that will go to around two million families who have dependent children and who come under family tax benefit part A. There will be a further lump sum payment of $600, which will be paid around September after families have done their tax returns to see whether or not there is an adjustment to be made on the payments they have received or otherwise just to keep the sum in its totality. I add that both of those payments are tax free. In addition to that, people who are carers and in receipt of the carer payment will receive a lump sum payment of $1,000 tax free and people who are in receipt of the carer allowance-and there are about 280,000 of those-will receive a $600 tax-free payment. That is to acknowledge the dedication and the tireless work that those carers give to those people who are in need of that care. The question of the balance between work and family is one that is ever present in the minds of people, particularly those in their 20s and 30s. There are a lot of stresses put on young people in their 20s and 30s. They are the people whom we want to see get married and have families, and we want to see those families stay together. With the divorce rate as high as it is, young women in particular find the stresses on them very high for the simple reason that they cannot really afford to lose their job skills. They might find themselves the breadwinner for their family if the marriage breaks up. Also, we have put a lot of investment into young women and the nation needs a return on those skills as well. So the maternity payment of $3,000, which will begin on 1 July, I think is a payment which will assist in that initial period MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004

197,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop,"Sorry, there is a private discussion going on right here. Weof adjustment in family life when the first child arrives-and that comes as quite a shock to the family system and the family finances. That will be a most welcome payment for the first child, as it will be for subsequent children. But I do think that we need to look even further than that and start to think about ways in which we can have policies that will make the home the centre of family life where both parents can work with a degree of comfort. I use the word ‘comfort’ because so often the supermum or superdad syndrome occurs when both parents in a family are working. At another stage, I would like to talk about some ideas I have developed about tax deductibility of wages paid for jobs in and around the home that would allow homes to become a sanctuary and a place where working parents can maintain their family life without the great stresses that are put upon them. The policies that are in the current budget are ones that I applaud, even though there are other ideas that I would like to see explored and introduced at a later date. The 40,000 after school care places that have been allocated and the additional 4,000 day care places are also important in making life easier for working parents-although, as I said, there are other ideas that I would like to see adopted at a later stage. I would like to conclude by mentioning the money that has been made available in aged care. As a former minister for aged care, I find the $2.7 billion over four years a most important aspect of the budget. That will take the total amount of money spent on aged care to something like $8.7 billion, which is a phenomenal amount of money. In the years that I was minister we increased it to $6 billion and we increased the standard of care that had to be given by introducing accreditation. In that period, some 240 aged care providers were either moved to different premises or, indeed, closed down. This was a very important change in aged care because there were people in the industry who really no longer deserved to be there. Running establishments in the way that they had been doing had been acceptable. The new accreditation standards have made the standard of care much better for residents. I know that this government will always place its most important focus on the residents themselves, their quality of care and their quality of life. I heard the member for Swan say earlier that aged care simply did not get the money that it was deserving of. I looked back on their record and saw that they had left us 10,000 places short. They had never closed a home. There were still places that were firetraps. There were still places that stank of urine. There were still places that were just unacceptable. I am pleased to say that the accreditation has put an end, basically, to all of that. The sanctions that are put in place if people fall into breach are that either they are brought up to scratch or they leave the industry. I think the recognition by people who work in the industry is that it is now better not only for residents but also for them, because they now know what is expected of a proprietor. Overall, I would just like to say that the budget as it was brought down was an important budget in the sense that it followed the continuing line of each budget-that is, they always focus on how we can keep the economy strong, how we can empower people to be in charge of their own lives for better outcomes for themselves and how, as a government, we can meet the responsibilities of principles of individualism and free enterprise that I mentioned earlier in this speech. 2004-2005 and cognate bills I want to refer especially to the Howard government’s long list MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
198,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (11.03 A.m.),"In this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)of betrayals in several areas of concern, including the Calder Highway in my electorate of Bendigo. It is taking Canberra longer to upgrade the Calder Highway from Melbourne to Bendigo than it took to complete the Snowy Mountains project. The Snowy Mountains hydroelectricity project commenced in 1949. It was Australia’s greatest civil engineering project. It took 25 years to complete. Under the coalition’s AusLink program, announced earlier this month, it will take at least 26 to 27 years to complete the Calder upgrade from its start in 1983. The federal upgrade of the Calder Highway started under the Hawke Labor government, which poured $75 million into it and scheduled it for completion in the year 2000. However, the only factor preventing this date from being achieved was the election of the Howard government in 1996, which has continually stalled the upgrade. Now, under its AusLink program, the Howard government will take at least another seven to eight years to finish the Calder. That will mean that it will take until 2011 or 2012 at the earliest to complete the work-that is, of course, if it ever honours its promises. On its woeful record in the Bendigo electorate since coming to office, nobody in the Bendigo region believes that it will. Central Victorians and Calder motorists are bitterly angry over the second-class treatment they have received from the Howard government over the Calder Highway. Thanks to the Howard government, the Bendigo region remains the only major provincial region in Victoria without a fully duplicated highway to Melbourne. In the lead-up to the government’s AusLink announcement, Bendigo people demanded that the Howard government guarantee $193 million and a non-rubbery finishing date to complete the Calder Highway from Kyneton to Ravenswood. Instead, Bendigo was fobbed off with a promise of only $114 million and no finishing date. This was all that was promised in the AusLink statement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson. State Minister for Transport Peter Batchelor exposed the fraud of this fob-off. He warned that it would finish only one of the two remaining sections, from Kyneton to Faraday, and that it would leave the Faraday to Ravenswood section unfinished. He also warned that on this funding it would take until 2012 to complete the Calder. I note the comments made by Councillor Bruce Phillips, Chairman of the Calder Highway Improvement Committee, an organisation which has generally been very forgiving towards the Liberal and National Party government. On ABC radio in Bendigo, Councillor Phillips, who incidentally is a former senior engineer with VicRoads, stated that the liquidity problems associated with the federal funding announced by Mr Anderson meant it would take at least seven to eight years to complete the Calder. Councillor Phillips said: That’s absolutely ludicrous, because physically the job could be done in four to five years. To take seven to eight years, I mean, you could do it with pick and shovel and a wheelbarrow. Given the modern equipment that’s available today, it shouldn’t take anything like that time. So what we have is just more drip-feeding of Calder funding to get this government through yet another election so that it can cut and run afterwards like it did after the last federal election. I remind the House that this government held back funding in 2000 for the Carlsruhe to Kyneton section, paid up only in the 2001 election year, and that it committed no new funding in the 2002, 2003 or 2004 budgets. It pulled the plug on the Calder at Kyneton and that is where the federal upgrade has been blocked since last year. All this was after the Treasurer MAIN COMMITTEE came to Bendigo in the 2001 election campaign and specifically promised to match all funding put up by the state government. In addition, the then Liberal federal candidate for Bendigo in that election, Maurie Sharkey, officially guaranteed a 2006 Calder completion date on behalf of the federal government. I have said previously that Mr Sharkey was a very decent man, but he was hung out to dry by the Treasurer. Bendigo people just did not trust the Treasurer and the Howard government over the Calder and they voted against the coalition in Bendigo in the last election. Where, then, was Treasurer Costello for the AusLink announcement on road funding for the Calder and other projects earlier this month? Not in Bendigo. He was in Geelong. The Liberals’ Bendigo spokesman had to travel to Geelong to find out what Mr Costello had in store for the Calder. In fact, there was not one federal minister in Bendigo to outline the Calder funding let-down and to explain it. There was not even a backbencher, such as Senator Tsebin Tchen, the duty senator. Mr Costello could not face the Bendigo public and he cowered in Geelong instead. This was the Treasurer who wanted to fix ‘the bloody Calder’, according to roads minister Campbell. Senator Ian Campbell actually told Bendigo a few days earlier that he had been given one specific commission by Mr Costello after his own appointment as roads minister. That commission was to ‘fix that bloody Calder’. Some fix! So what we have now with the coalition’s last Calder cop-out is what I have been warning about for some years. They have chosen to blow out the Calder’s completion beyond 2010 and probably well beyond 2012. Of course, they have blown out the cost with their delays. The latest estimates by VicRoads, completed in March this year, show an increase of 17 per cent since 2001, when the project costs were estimated to be around $330 million to complete the duplication from Kyneton to Ravenswood. This brings the total completion costs now to around $386 million-a massive increase of 17 per cent. Taxpayers have to cop dramatic increases in construction costs just because the Howard government have stalled the project for a total of almost four years so far. They stalled the Carlsruhe stage for over 12 months before they were finally forced to pay their share, and we have been waiting for almost three years for Mr Costello to honour his now famous 2001 election promise to match the state government’s funding under the RONI agreement. Let us remember that only a short while ago the Minister for Transport and Regional Services claimed in a reply to my written questions that the coalition’s RONI commitment to the Calder had already been met in full. He ripped up and rewrote the government’s original promise to fund the Calder from Melbourne to Bendigo. He claimed the only RONI commitment made by the government was to ‘begin the task of upgrading the worse sections’ between Melbourne and Mildura. That was a barefaced falsehood. But it was not surprising. After all, there was not a single cent set aside for the Calder under the government’s forward estimates in the budget for the next three years. They had no intention just a few weeks back of funding the Calder for yet another three years. That was just a few weeks back. So why would anyone trust them to live up to their promise to pay what they claim they will give the Calder? I have often said that the highway is the coalition’s Calder lie-way. It is a highway potholed with bumper-to-bumper broken promises. Their shonky AusLink Calder deal will just keep Bendigo people in a state of cynicism and disbelief towards them. The coalition have left Calder motorists with a goat track between Kyneton and Ravenswood and it will still be there into the next decade if Mr Costello has his way. MAIN COMMITTEE I would like to give a brief outline of the Calder funding since pre-1996. I want to do this to show the lie in the government’s claims that Labor has done nothing for the Calder. It was the Hawke Labor government that started the duplication of the Calder Highway. It funded the Big Hill to Ravenswood duplication that was completed in 1986. The federal Labor government by 1996 had provided around $75 million, estimated to be equivalent to $155 million in today’s dollars, for reconstructing and duplicating the Calder Highway. In other words, the last federal Labor government invested more in today’s dollar values than the $100 million the Howard government has grudgingly put into the highway. The federal Labor government provided the funding under a number of programs, including the Australian Bicentennial Road Development program, the Australian Land Transport Development program, the One Nation roads program and the better cities road funding program. A sum of $75 million in 1985 dollars equals $155 million in today’s dollars. The federal Labor government provided $2.8 million for the Gap Hill to Gisborne preconstruction, $15.2 million for the Kyneton bypass, $7.1 million for the Diggers Rest to Gap Hill preconstruction, $29.2 million for the Diggers Rest bypass, $13.2 million for the Keilor to Diggers Rest duplication, $2.04 million for the Big Hill to Ravenswood duplication, $2.05 million for the Harcourt to Ravenswood lane construction, and another $3 million for maintenance and lane construction. What is also of great importance is that Labor set a target to finish the entire Calder Highway duplication from Melbourne to Bendigo by the year 2000. The Howard government said during the 2001 federal election campaign that it would match the state government’s funding and that it accepted the state government’s completion date of 2006. These promises it systematically dishonoured. After stalling the project for another four years from 2001, it will be 2005 before any coalition Commonwealth funding will be allocated to the Calder, and the completion date will be 2011 or 2012 at the earliest-that is, assuming the coalition stuck to its most recent promise, something that history has shown would be most unlikely to occur. In fact, its credibility has been run down and its promises are running on empty. The long-awaited final decision on the much troubled ADI Bendigo Bushmaster contract will be announced shortly. I led a delegation consisting of a former member of Bendigo council, Councillor Willie Carney, and local trade union representatives on 21 March 2002 to see the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, to discuss this contract. I understand that the final trials have been completed and that the vehicle has in fact passed with flying colours. This contract has run off the rails on several occasions over the past five years, and now it looks as though the long wait may have been worth it. The Department of Defence has reduced the number of vehicles to be built from 370, the initial quantity required, to 299, to meet its budget constraints. ADI Bendigo has shed 248 jobs since the Howard government privatised the defence manufacturer-after the Prime Minister said that he would not privatise it. If the Bendigo plant misses out on this contract, it would mean that we stand to lose the complete facility. Prime Minister Howard, as the then opposition leader, came to Bendigo on Wednesday, 14 February 1996 and gave Bendigo a commitment not to privatise ADI. His exact words were: ‘No, no and no; we have no plans to privatise ADI.’ Of course, this is just one of the many commitments given in Bendigo that this coalition government has walked away from. Now that ADI is fully privatised, the company can do what it likes. The Commonwealth has no MAIN COMMITTEE power to instruct it to do anything, unless it is stipulated in Australian government defence contracts awarded to the privatised Australian Defence Industries. The former defence minister, Peter Reith, in an answer to my question on notice on 21 August 2001, stated: The Project Bushranger contract does not stipulate where the Bushmaster vehicle is to be manufactured. ADI has indicatedand note that word ‘ indicated’; he does not say ‘guaranteed’to the Department of Defence that the vehicle hull and general assembly is to occur at the company’s Bendigo site. I demand that the Howard government insert a clause in the contract before signing, ensuring that the Bushmaster vehicles are built in Bendigo, where they were designed and where the prototypes were built. The Howard government has tried on several occasions to wriggle out of this contract, but Senator Hill assured us in 2002 that, if the vehicle passed the stringent trials put in place by the department, the contract would be considered favourably. I understand that an announcement on the contract will be forthcoming over the next few days or weeks. Let me refer now to the shocking neglect by this government of the dental needs of lowincome people in my electorate. Over 10,000 people are waiting up to 4½ years for dental treatment and dentures from public clinics serving the Bendigo electorate. The Howard government wrote off pensioners and low-income families by limiting new Medicare dental relief, approved earlier this year, only to people who had gone through six months of chronic illness related to their teeth. Now, of course, the Howard government in this budget has shown how excruciating its policies are towards the dental needs of struggling Victorian families. In 1996 the Howard government abolished the federal funding that the Keating government had provided to state public dental health services, and this has just added to the burdens that poorer people who rely on public dental services have to suffer. I would have thought that a decent federal government would have restored that funding in this budget. This government did not. It is squandering a fortune in taxpayers’ money on advertising its woeful efforts to hide its plan to dismantle Medicare. There is no end of public money if it can be manipulated into churning out propaganda for the coalition. Despite the state governments increasing their expenditure on dental programs, there is now a huge unmet demand for public funded dental programs. In Bendigo, the waiting time recently for general dental treatment was 38 months, and the number of patients waiting for it was 6,001. There were 372 patients waiting 19 months for denture treatment. In Sunbury, the wait is 10 months for general dental treatment, and the number of patients waiting is 1,083. For dentures the waiting period is 55 months, and the number of people waiting is 334. Federal Labor will invest $300 million in dental care over four years to provide 1.3 million extra procedures, clear the existing backlog and substantially reduce the waiting lists. I was also delighted to note that, in the Bracks government’s recent state budget, extra funds were allocated to step up public dental services. This, combined with federal Labor funding, would make quite a difference to the availability of public dental services for people on low incomes. The coalition government earlier allocated a miserable $5 million for four years and only for dental patients with chronic illnesses caused by their dental problems. Under the earlier MAIN COMMITTEE coalition program, patients must suffer dental related chronic health problems for six months before they get assistance. For pensioners and low-income earners, this is systematic cruelty. A recent national survey found that one-third of Australians in the $30,000 to $50,000 household income bracket had not been to a dentist for over two years due to their inability to pay. Poor dental health means pain, inconvenience, poor general health, embarrassment and discrimination. I refer now to the need for a magnetic resonance imaging scanner in my electorate. I note the recent announcement by the Minister for Health and Ageing of an additional 23 Medicare funded MRI licences. Bendigo Health Care Group should be allocated one of these licences. The year before last, I organised a petition of 7,000 signatures demanding that the Howard government provide an MRI Medicare licence, and I presented that petition to the federal parliament in February last year. The Bracks government has allocated $3 million for the building and equipment for MRI services at the Bendigo Health Care Group, but the Howard government has so far refused to provide a Medicare licence to enable Medicare cardholders and lowto middle-income earners to receive the service. It is an issue that I have pursued vigorously for the past four years. Now that we are in a federal election environment, the Howard government appears to have been panicked into eleventh-hour promises again. The government has suddenly announced that it intends to provide another 23 licences, but it says that the location for 20 of those licences will not be known until closer to the federal election. Why? Is it waiting to see which pork to pull out of the barrel and for whom? Why hasn’t Bendigo got an MRI machine? Why has the Victorian government been told to take its money and go away, instead of using it to build the MRI facility? Why is the federal government twiddling its thumbs and doing nothing while patients from Bendigo and its district have to travel to Melbourne or Ballarat for MRI services that should be available in the Bendigo electorate? It looks like a shabby re-run of the government’s stalling over the Calder. State money has been sitting idle, waiting since the 2002 state budget to fund the next stage of the Calder, but Canberra again will not pay up. And it looks like a re-run of the $2 million Bendigo was promised for arts facilities back in the 1996 election. It has only started to turn up seven years later, when the upgrade of the art gallery for which it was originally promised has been completed. Even now a hefty chunk of the money, now allocated instead to the Capital Theatre, has been siphoned off to help pay for the waste incurred by the City of Greater Bendigo Council when its members voted to bury the big new theatre for which the federal cash was finally earmarked. I also express my concern about the anxiety that has been caused by the government to the employees of the Geospatial Analysis Centre at Fortuna, Bendigo. The review of the future of this operation by the government has caused uncertainty and anger among its employees. It has also placed a worrying threat over the economy of Bendigo and over vital Bendigo jobs. Bendigo has been facing the threat of having this operation stolen from it by the Howard government for some years. It faced the threat of being moved away and transferred to Canberra. Most of the employees at Fortuna have said that they would prefer to resign their positions rather than transfer to Canberra. The DIGO Bendigo performs a vital role in our national Defence Intelligence Organisation and has considerable expertise that would be difficult to replace if all or part of the facility were to be relocated to Canberra. It is also a major contribuMAIN COMMITTEE tor to the Bendigo region’s economy. Its removal would result in the loss of around $40 million in economic activity if the centre were relocated to Canberra. Defence Minister Hill stated on 4 March that the operation will remain in Bendigo. However, I believe Bendigo needs real assurances that this operation will not be packed off to the nation’s capital. I wish to reiterate Labor’s assurance that the centre will remain in Bendigo under a Latham Labor government. I have had discussions with the Labor spokesman for defence, Senator Chris Evans, and he was delighted to announce that Labor will retain the centre in Bendigo. Labor will keep the Geospatial Analysis Centre in Bendigo because we believe that there is no worthwhile benefit in relocating it to Canberra. It is now up to the Howard government to announce their plans for the facility. I understand that they have made that announcement. They have said they have allocated an extra $10 million for a new building, but there is nothing in the Department of Defence’s forward estimates mentioning $10 million for that building. I suspect this is just another broken promise to Bendigo. Having just spoken about the importance of retaining defence jobs in Bendigo, I also wish to express my grave concern at the possibility of further job losses at Telstra’s Abel Street depot in Bendigo. The integrated deployment centre has around 70 jobs. According to the Centre for Sustainable Regional Communities at La Trobe University’s Bendigo campus, the centre is worth $14 million in direct wages to Bendigo. This means a further loss of $27.48 million in output across all sectors in Bendigo and a further loss of 108 jobs. The Abel Street centre is one of four Telstra centres that are under review. Telstra management has said that one of these will close at the end of the year. I see this as just another step along the unending road of Telstra downsizing its work force in preparation for the full privatisation that its management hopes for from the coalition parties. Already in Bendigo district we have seen the loss of over 400 full-time Telstra jobs since the Howard government’s privatisation plans were announced. Telstra never comes clean with what it has planned in the axing of jobs. It always claims that any talk of job losses is pure speculation. Telstra wants to throw people off the scent so that it can get on with achieving the coalition’s blueprint for a bigger profit company employing a diminishing work force and offering less service to the public, especially in the country. In most cases in the past the speculation has proven to be correct. Most Australians will not have a bar of the full privatisation of Telstra, and that is what this coalition government are pushing for. They know only too well that it means lowering of services in regional and rural communities and the inevitability of continuing job losses such as those endangering Telstra’s operations at the Abel Street centre. I want to conclude by referring to the rort that the government is playing with its massive pumping of advertising revenue, funded by the taxpayer, to promote its own cause. Australians are witnessing a fraud of extraordinary proportions. They are seeing their tax dollars used for a massive government advertising blitz. The Howard government is spending close to $123 million on 21 different advertising campaigns this year alone. The advertising budget for the Howard government’s failed Medicare package is $15.7 million. Australian taxpayers are paying out of their pockets for a massive and sustained advertising bombardment in the run-up to the next election. No-one should be fooled by this poll-driven attempt to cover up the fact that, under the Howard government, Medicare is dying. I will conclude on that point. MAIN COMMITTEE should be about providing security and opportunity for all Australians-for all Australian individuals and for all Australian families. The budget should also be about planning for Australia’s long-term social, economic and security interests as a nation. Regrettably, the 2004-05 Howard budget appears to be by contrast little more than an election grab bag, concerned primarily with the short term, the immediate and the political; not the long term, the sustainable and the important-important for families, for individuals and for the nation. Pensioners will continue to endure greater financial stress, not less. Families will continue to pay extra for basic services, not less. Education will continue to cost more, not less. Access to basic health services will cost more, not less. If we look at what the budget has to say about tax, it is quite plain that this is not a budget for all Australians: it is a budget for some Australians. Some 83,846 Southside residents, whom I represent in this parliament, will get not a single cent from the tax cuts provided in this year’s federal budget. The budget has overlooked the majority of working people on Brisbane’s Southside and the majority of working people elsewhere in Australia. Census figures demonstrate that 86 per cent of Southside residents earn less than $52,000 a year. These residents will not receive one cent of tax relief. There are many people in our community who work hard but who earn less than $52,000, meaning that they will not be rewarded by the much heralded tax cuts. Across Australia, there are 8.5 million families and singles who will not benefit at all from John Howard’s tax cuts. Mr Howard has stated that two million families will be eligible for increased family benefits. We now know that around one in three of these may never see a cent of it. The money will be eaten up by existing family payment debts. The overwhelming majority of Brisbane’s Southside residents have missed out on receiving some form of taxation relief. On education, regrettably this budget also fails the test of providing opportunity for all rather than simply opportunity for some. On Brisbane’s Southside, tertiary students attending neighbouring universities-Griffith University, the Queensland University of Technology and the University of Queensland as well as the Moreton TAFE-will get nothing at all from this budget. There is not one extra cent for new TAFE places despite the fact that 15,000 young people miss out on a place every year and many industries face serious skills shortages. This budget fails the 20,000 qualified Australians turned away from university every year because the government refuses to fund enough places. The government’s HECS increases will cost the average university student and their family an extra $25 per week. The budget’s fine print also reveals that the government will drive university students a further $90 million into deeper debt by slugging them with 20 per cent penalties when they take out a loan to pay fees. For Queensland universities the story just keeps getting worse when it comes to federal funding. The Howard government has now cut over $620 million from Queensland universities since 1996. Public funding has not kept pace with the increased cost of running a modern university. This is having a drastic impact on students’ educational experiences. Overcrowded classrooms, less individual attention, fewer resources and low staff morale are becoming common features at our universities. The latest figures reveal that the number of students per teaching staff member at Queensland universities has blown out by 30 per cent between 1996 and 2001.

199,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (11.23 A.m.),"The annual budget of the Australian governmentOn child care, the budget brings no relief for the thousands of families unable to access quality, affordable, centre based care for their children aged up to five years. The latest issue of Child Care, Australia showed that 46,300 children needed centre based long day care in June 2002. The relevant federal minister is reported to have alerted the cabinet to the crisis in centre based long day care and child-care support, but the cabinet refused to listen. This has been confirmed by leaked cabinet documents. The minister recommended that $30.6 million be allocated to address unmet demand in long day care but the minister got nothing. The minister also recommended that the child-care support broadband receive $70 million over four years, but the minister instead got $16.3 million. The Prime Minister has admitted that ‘the child-care system is not perfect’. This ranks as the understatement of the century. He also stated that the government is ‘looking at what needs to be done to allow the system to respond more effectively to demand’. But the PM has failed to endorse the recommendations of his own minister and he has failed to increase centre based long day care and child-care support. On vaccines, the 2004 budget has allocated no funding for the vaccines that experts have advised our children should receive. For example, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, a disease which is reportedly responsible for killing around 50 Australian children each year, was not funded. Since September 2002, almost 2,000 children have contracted pneumococcal disease and of these 150 have died. Many more have suffered brain, blood and spinal injuries or diseases. It is now nearly two years since September 2002 when the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, ATAGI, advised the Howard government to fund the following for all Australian children: the vaccine against the deadly pneumococcal disease, the vaccine against chickenpox and the replacement of the oral polio vaccine with an inactivated polio vaccine for infants. The National Health and Medical Research Council backed these recommendations, but the federal government in this budget has chosen not to fund these vaccines. Since September 2002, over 360,000 babies have been born. Hundreds of thousands of mothers and fathers have had to make the agonising decision as to whether they can afford the $500 to pay for the recommended but unfunded pneumococcal vaccine. The funding of these vaccines needs to be addressed. There was no better time to do it than in this budget. On pensioners under financial pressure, the 2004-05 federal budget has done little for pensioners in the electorate I represent in this parliament. Many pensioners on Brisbane’s Southside are being hit with debt notices because the government has mismanaged the system. The government recently confirmed that pensioners owe almost $39 million of Centrelink debts as a result of government error. The government has failed to conduct annual checks on the income of partners of pensioners, even though this information is regularly supplied to Centrelink. After discovering these basic checks had not been done, the government is now reviewing the payments of aged, disability, parent and carer pensions and sending out debt notices. I know this because a number of pensioners in my electorate have, with disbelief, shown me the letters they are now receiving from the government. There are 11,069 aged pensioners living in the electorate I represent in this parliament and 3,346 disability support pensioners. The average debt raised against aged pensioners across Australia is $4,500. This is a lot of money for an older person to find-a third of their annual pension. Pensioners hit with the debts are paying a high price for the government’s administrative bungling. If the government MAIN COMMITTEE had regularly checked its own information, these debts would not have been allowed to go on. Now the government is hitting people for debts which they cannot manage on a pension. The government’s ambivalence towards pensioners is epitomised by a call my office received today from a resident of Coorparoo who rang to seek help because he struggles to live on his pension and feels that pensioners these days are, from the government’s point of view, simply invisible. It is a sad reflection on the government, but the sentiment expressed by this constituent from Coorparoo is the same one that is expressed to me by many pensioners at mobile offices, community groups and in my electorate office. On health, I have spoken before in this place about the concerns many Southside residents have about the current deficiencies in federal health care funding. As this is the single biggest concern that local residents approach my office with, I want to spend some time addressing the matter. On Brisbane’s Southside we have a bulk-billing crisis-a crisis that has been evident for years, yet the government has done absolutely nothing about it. Since 2000, the number of GP services bulk-billed has fallen by 30 per cent in my electorate. Today only 58 per cent of GP services are bulk-billed in my electorate, whereas almost 90 per cent of services were bulk-billed only three years ago. The cost of seeing a GP who does not bulk-bill remains high and is on the rise. The national average is $14.92-an increase from $14.03 since last quarter, a 14 per cent increase on the March quarter last year and an enormous 68 per cent increase since 1996 when the Howard government first came to office. This simply demonstrates that undermining the universality of Medicare through discriminatory bulk-billing incentives and sham safety nets will inevitably lead to people paying more to see a doctor. The impact of these financial barriers on ordinary Australians is clear. In the last financial year there were three million fewer GP visits than in the year before-that is, three million times that Australians in need of health care did not go to a doctor. At the same time, hospital emergency departments have been flooded by Australians looking for GP style care. Yet at the same time, local residents are seeing their tax dollars used for a massive government advertising blitz. It has been revealed that the federal government has now confirmed that it will spend $109 million on 21 different advertising campaigns this year alone. The advertising budget for Mr Howard’s Medicare package is $15.7 million alone. If the Medicare advertising money was used to actually fund bulk-billing, the government could afford a massive 610,894 more visits. I can confidently say that we will see more money spent in this fashion before the next election-money that could be used to fund better access to doctors. Spending taxpayer dollars on advertising for a bandaid fix instead of saving Medicare is something that people on the Southside simply do not expect will solve any of the problems with which they deal. I remind all those in this parliament of John Howard’s 1987 election commitment, when he stated: Bulk-billing will not be permitted for anyone except the pensioners and the disadvantaged. Doctors will be free to charge whatever fees they choose. That was John Howard in 1987 stating explicitly his political philosophy at that stage in terms of universal health care. What we have been seeing since then is John Howard undertaking the same strategy by stealth. As the alternative government of Australia we also have articulated alternative plans for Australia’s future. Our tax plan will be released in the weeks and months ahead. When it comes to health care I have previously informed my electorate of what Labor’s plan for reMAIN COMMITTEE forming the health care system will be. It is a long-term plan; it is not a bandaid solution. We have a two-pronged approach to the reform of our health care system. We will systematically address the crisis in the system and we will set the foundation for real reform. In government we will invest $1.9 billion in Medicare to raise bulk-billing rates from 67 per cent to 80 per cent by increasing Medicare patient rebates for all bulk-billed consultations by an average of $5 and providing powerful targeted incentive payments to bulk-billing doctors. We will introduce 100 Medicare teams for health hotspots where bulk-billing is in free fall. We will establish Australian Dental Care, investing $300 million to provide up to 1,300,000 extra dental procedures for pensioners and concession card holders. We will fund important vaccines against pneumococcal, chickenpox and polio for all children. We will invest $25 million to promote community well-being and to reduce childhood obesity. On education, Labor is committed to quality lifelong education for all Australians. We have recently announced that in government we will invest $2.34 billion to rebuild, reform and expand our universities and TAFEs through our Aim Higher package, creating 20,000 new university places and 20,000 new TAFE places each year. We will reverse the government’s unfair 25 per cent HECS hike and abolish full fee degrees for Australian undergraduates. We will fund all Australian schools, government or non-government, on the basis of need. We will give all young Australians the backing to learn or earn through a new Youth Guarantee to support young people in school and make sure early school leavers move from training to work. We will provide free books to the parents of every new babe, develop comprehensive neonatal screening for hearing and sight, and provide parental literacy programs for parents who cannot read to their children. We will invest $8.7 million to get more male teachers into schools and establish a buddy-up program to get more male mentors into primary schools, giving boys appropriate role models. And we propose to establish a national mentoring plan and invest $33 million to create 10,000 new mentors. I am particularly pleased to outline federal Labor’s plan for higher education in Queensland. Under this plan Queensland universities would receive over $60 million in additional funding by the year 2007. For university students living in my electorate, that means Griffith University would receive an additional $12 million, QUT an additional $14 million and UQ an additional $16 million. This will provide desperately needed funding for Queensland universities to maintain standards. Other sources of new funding for Queensland universities under Labor’s $2.34 billion higher education package include 21,000 more full-time and part-time commencing university places to be distributed across Australia; a competitive $450 million universities of the 21st century fund to support university reform; a $150 million community engagement fund to support regional, rural and outer-suburban universities’ leadership role in local communities; $150 million to reward excellence in teaching and learning; and $347.6 million to properly fund all university places at the full Commonwealth rate, including 25,000 places that the Howard government currently funds on the cheap. Under an alternative government, Queensland universities will receive the support and funding they need to deliver world-class learning outcomes. On balancing work and family, Labor will deliver effective policies to help Australians balance work and family. We will introduce a new baby care payment worth $3,000 in 2005, rising to $5,380 by 2010, to be paid to nine out of 10 mothers whether they are in the work force or not. We will legislate to ensure that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission takes MAIN COMMITTEE into account the need for workers to find a better work and family balance and we will abolish the Howard government’s antifamily Australian workplace agreements. On the environment, Labor is committed to injecting 450 gigalitres of water into the Murray-Darling in our first term of government through a $350 million river bank program and to injecting 1,500 gigalitres over 10 years to save the river. We will ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change and develop a national emissions trading regime. We will promote renewable energy by raising the mandatory renewable amount. We will protect our fragile beaches and coasts by investing $31 million in key environmental assets and stopping inappropriate coastal development. We will save our rivers and dramatically improve our water efficiency by a range of relevant programs as well as institute a ban on free plastic carrier bags in shops and supermarkets. On better job security, an alternative government would ensure that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission takes into account job security and the need to prevent the misuse of casual employment. We will also seek to provide protection for 100 per cent of Australian employee entitlements in the event of employer insolvency, with no additional cost to small business. On small business, an alternative government will implement a seven-point plan to reform the Trade Practices Act to give small business a fair go and to strengthen the ACCC. It will simplify the red tape faced by small business in complying with the Howard government’s GST. We will implement a six-point plan to put downward pressure on petrol prices. We hope that this will provide appropriate relief for small businesses everywhere. On secure retirement incomes, an alternative government, a Labor government, will set a ‘65 at 65’ retirement income goal for all Australians-65 per cent of an individual’s gross income at the time they are 65 years of age. We would ban excessive entry and exit fees from funds. We would introduce measures to provide compensation to those who lose their super as a result of theft, fraud and trustee negligence or unpaid contributions where a business fails. We would eliminate the contributions tax over time, starting with a two per cent reduction in the tax from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. This is a range of the measures which an alternative Labor government would create should we obtain political office by the end of this year. The overriding philosophy which underpins the programs we have put to the Australian people is our belief that we should provide opportunity for all Australians, not just for some-opportunity for all Australians through our proposed reforms to the taxation system; opportunity for all Australians in terms of what we propose to do with the health care system, principally Medicare; opportunity for all Australians through what we intend to do by way of reforming higher education, providing more funding for it and opening up the TAFE system through the provision of additional places; opportunity for all Australians through an enhanced child-care system so that working mothers everywhere would have an opportunity to access quality centre based care; and opportunity for all Australians in terms of a better superannuation system which better meets the needs of working Australian families and individuals, whatever their income and whatever their background. We have therefore articulated a clear vision for Australia’s future, a vision which is relevant not just for the nation, not just for families and not just for individuals but also for the community that I proudly represent in this parliament, on Brisbane’s Southside. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE with a look at the tax cuts. The tax package is designed to deliver between $20 and $80 a week extra into the pockets of Australians through a combination of tax cuts for middleto high-income earners and enhanced welfare payments for lower income earners. The tax cuts were aimed specifically at voters the government believes will be crucial to the outcome of this year’s election. They are cleverly designed so that people on average earnings do not move into the higher 42c tax bracket while taxpayers close to the top 47c regime also get a reprieve. The income threshold attracting the 42c rate has been pushed out to $58,000 and then $63,000 under these measures. The income at which the top marginal rate kicks in will be pushed out to $80,000 by July next year. While the government and the opposition are engaged in a bidding war around tax cuts in the lead-up to the election, several independent studies are showing a shift in public attitude from more money in the pocket to more social infrastructure. The tax cuts will be eaten up overnight by petrol increases for most, while greater spending of taxpayers’ moneyobtained, perhaps, by a modest increase in the Medicare levy-will deliver better hospital services for the long term. That is where public opinion is at the moment, it seems. More and more people want better health and education spending and seem prepared to pay for it, which is a decided shift in public attitudes since similar surveys were taken 15 to 20 years ago. No government or alternative government has the wit to take the hint, and I think the government that does will perhaps be surprised by the response it receives from an electorate which has seen a downgrading of its social infrastructure-particularly around health delivery-over the last 20 years. We have seen incidents like the one at Goulburn Hospital a week or so ago where a woman with a severely ulcerated leg was asked to go home and wash her bandages and bring them back the next day because the New South Wales state hospital system could not provide fresh dressings. I do not think anyone wants a public hospital system that is forced into such circumstances. I get complaints time and time again from businesses in the Orange and Bathurst communities who are way down the list for the payment of accounts by the local central west medical service, Mid Western Area Health. It is chronically underfunded. There is an argument that it is chronically overstaffed at an administrative level. These things need to be looked at and the buck needs to be delivered to the area where it is needed most. Again, it underlines a suggestion that I know the Minister for Health and Ageing has been toying with, which is that the Commonwealth take over responsibility for health care. That would obviously involve some constitutional changes. Health and education are two areas in which I do not think a country with a relatively small tax take like Australia can afford the luxury of the duplication that we have with the state administration of the health and education dollars. It would save a lot of politics if the buck began in Canberra and the responsibility ended there as well. The family tax benefit changes might be welcomed by recipients, but it strikes me that the one-off, immediate $600 payment per child is designed more to address the embarrassment of overpayments that have caused such heartache to so many families. But those many parents unfairly impacted by debts far greater than the $600 will no doubt be grateful for this moderate mercy. The basic problem of how these overpayments are accrued has yet to be addressed. Because most parents need the money immediately, they cannot afford to wait until income tax adjustments at the end of the year, and forecasting income is nigh impossible.

200,Mr Andren (Calare) (11.43 A.m.),"I want to begin my response to this year’s budgetThat brings me to the pattern of employment and income in this country. The tax cuts will not have any impact on the many in my electorate whose incomes are below the $52,000 level. In fact, the average income in my electorate is $45,000. While both major parties engage in rhetoric about unemployment rates, neither side is prepared to acknowledge that to be employed and to not be a statistic on the unemployment figures requires but one hour of paid employment per week. A six per cent unemployment rate is meaningless for defining the employment profile of this nation. We should be looking at underemployment and the increasing rate of casual and part-time employment for a snapshot of just how contented people are with their lot. No doubt part-time and casual work suits many, particularly women, but it does not suit the traditional breadwinning male worker. Statistics show that the growth in male casual employment has greatly exceeded that of female casual employment in recent years, to the point where there are now about an equal number of males and females in casual work. The current research note from the Parliamentary Library on casual employment details one definition of casual work as ‘a job that is short-term, irregular and uncertain’. That means that 28 per cent of the work force, according to the latest figures, is in this situation. Putting aside those who genuinely want casual work because it suits them, I would suggest that one in five working Australians are certainly not relaxed and comfortable in our supposed boom economy-an economy that is showing signs of slowing down. Who will be the first to go in such a downturn? The casual employee. Casual employment has now been added to unemployment as a device available to finetune the modern economy. Employees in larger enterprises are more and more not valued contributors to an enterprise but units of cost to be put on the payroll or disposed of at will. The parliamentary research paper, which recently found its way into the Sydney Morning Herald, shows a close correlation between unemployment and casual employment which the researchers say suggests that casual employment, with the exception of students, is probably ‘an involuntary work arrangement for many workers’. In other words, most casual workers are not relaxed and comfortable with their situation, as this government and, no doubt, Labor in government would want to kid us. Another chart in the parliamentary research paper shows another high relationship between level of educational attainment and casual employment. In other words, just as unemployment reflects a lack of jobs, casual employment reflects a lack of ongoing jobs more than it reflects a preference for casual work. Mindful of the remarks I made earlier about the difficulty of estimating income for family tax benefits and the high incidence of distressing debts, the evidence from the research backs all of this up. Compared with ongoing workers, casual workers, according to the parliamentary research note: ... have much greater variations in their weekly earnings, are more likely to have a preference for longer hours, are more likely to have been in their current job for less than one year and are less likely to have been in their current job for more than 10 years. They have greater expectations that they will not be in their job in 12 months. They are less likely to be covered by workers compensation; less likely to work a set number of days each week; less likely to have had a work-related illness, possibly through fear of a reduction in wages or loss of employment; less likely to be a member of a trade union; more likely to work on weekends; less likely to have undergone training in the last 12 months; more likely to have no superannuation coverage; less likely to have worked some hours at home; and less likely to be employed in the Public Service. MAIN COMMITTEE All of this confirms the notion that casual work is largely involuntary and not a relaxed and comfortable scenario in a booming economy. Having said that, I have consistently supported the proposals that small businesses with 15 and now 20 or fewer employees should be exempt from unfair dismissal laws but certainly not from unlawful dismissal. That is the compromise I am prepared to make to ensure that small business can operate without the threat of protracted litigation when the proper processes have been followed to counsel, warn and remove underperforming or disruptive staff. Of course, there is never a case for diluting unlawful dismissal provisions that relate to issues such as gender, race or religion. Small business in country and regional areas like those I represent do, I believe, at this point need that protection. I am not prepared to countenance the extension of these laws to any larger work force, because the personal small business link between employer and employee that I notice and observe in my electorate certainly gets thinner and thinner the larger the work force gets. I believe that 20 is about right. To illustrate this point, I can look at the recent loss of 200 jobs at the Electrolux plant in Orange-a loss of jobs that, as far as media coverage was concerned, paled into insignificance with the immediate and quite political response of the government to the loss of jobs at the Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide. Yet, when you look at the loss of jobs in the whitegoods industry, first in Email and then in Electrolux in Orange, the impact on the central west community is far greater in terms of impact per capita than it is in Adelaide, I would argue. Whilst the finger cannot be pointed at the international Electrolux company because it, like any other, is seeking a cheaper work force and competitive costs around the world and, indeed, will remove its small refrigerator plant from Orange because it cannot compete with the cheaper imports from Asia, it does put a huge question mark over the future of the large fridge-manufacturing plant in Orange and whether it can continue to compete in the world market. I intend to ask the government: where is the assistance package for the workers in a community like Orange who will need to be retrained, redirected and re-employed somewhere in the work force? Those 200 workers represent something like 1,200 to 1,500 people in the community. Of course, the flow-on effect to the subsidiary industries that are supporting the whitegoods manufacturer is quite significant. I ask the government: where is the package for rural and regional Australia when it comes to the loss of such a significant number of jobs as that represented by the recent major cutbacks at the Electrolux plant at Orange? The other major issue that arises from the casual employment scenario is child care. This budget does add to child-care funding. In recent days the government has announced new initiatives, including a $138 million package for rural and regional areas. I am pleased to see that the minister recognises the need for community based family day care and long day care and look forward to this package meeting some of the demand that has built up in my electorate. However, the demand will be great. At Wallerawang last week I spoke with personnel at the Pied Piper facility. They pointed out the impending crisis they are facing through a combination of higher costs, fixed incomes and reduced government assistance. Another phenomenon in rural Australia, particularly in areas close to metropolitan areas, is that towns like Wallerawang are attracting a greater number of people from the western suburbs of Sydney who are seeking more affordable rent. Many of them are recipients of social security payments and, indeed, many of them are seeking casual and part-time work when MAIN COMMITTEE they can, but the cost of child care is a huge factor in that equation. The flow-on effect to an organisation like Pied Piper is quite severe in that they cannot raise their prices because these people cannot afford it, so they are caught in a cost squeeze. They are among other child-care facilities in my electorate-and, I would imagine, in the electorates of members in the chamber-seeking support from the package that the government is talking about. Rural and regional areas in particular need support if they are going to extend their child-care servicesparticularly long day care, which is the growing area of need. I would say that the pressure is intense for child care for noughtto two-year-olds-sad as it may be that those kids cannot be at home until they grow to the age of two. There is a need for long day care for these children. The service is not only inadequate but unaffordable at the moment. So organisations such as Pied Piper will be seeking some of the limited support available and, no doubt, there will be similar requests from all over rural Australia. Aged care budget initiatives have been generally welcomed in Calare, especially the move to cut compliance costs through reducing classification categories and a boost for aged care assessment teams. The one-off $3,500 payment per resident is welcome, but one-off fixes of this nature are often ill-directed. There seems to be little discipline in how the money will be spent. It seems that the not-for-profit organisations will easily use this money, but there still seems to be a desperate need for capital assistance for the not-for-profit organisations, particularly in regional areas. Unless and until the accommodation bond is put back on the agenda as a legitimate means, I believe, of accessing aged care payments for nursing homes then this capital crisis is going to continue big time. Increasing the ratio of aged care places per thousand population members over the age of 70 from 100 to 108 will begin to address some of those shortfalls, although I am not convinced this ratio is anywhere near sufficient to meet the demand across the Central West in particular. There is a waiting list in most centres for long-term care in the Central West, let alone for adequate places for respite care. While the government, in cooperation with the states, has introduced payment for respite care to recognise the job that carers are doing, it is the lack of places that is going to be the problem. There is simply not a sufficient number available in the Bathurst-Orange area. I spoke with carers last week about this very problem, welcome though the support might be. I would like to quickly talk about a couple of things that relate to the electorate and that should not be regarded as vote-buying exercises as they are very welcome and wise initiatives. There are changes related to the wine equalisation tax. The industry has been calling for abolition of the WET ever since the GST was brought in. It has taken until now for the government to make a move. While it has been welcome, producers in my electorate are saying that the government has chosen to offer a rebate rather than simply abolish this tax based on the volume of wine sold, which is what the industry has been asking for. So the tax remainsit just means that certain lowto medium-volume producers will get it back eventually. Small wineries operate on pretty slim margins and it strikes me they will be faced with major cash flow problems. It would have been much simpler to have allowed smaller wineries to opt out of the tax without the need to apply for any rebate. The final comment I wish to make is to do with Mt Panorama funding. After all the politics of the last election, when federal funding for Mt Panorama was cynically used as a blatant vote-buying ruse, the announcement of the federal government’s $10 million funding boost MAIN COMMITTEE for the circuit was very welcome and very wise. With the likes of Peter Brock banging on the doors of government down here, the message finally got through that it was an irresistible national funding priority, whoever happened to be in the seat at any particular time. The federal Minister for Arts and Sport, Rod Kemp, told me the arguments for supporting Mt Panorama were overwhelming and he also said the Prime Minister had spoken up strongly in support of federal assistance, despite some raised eyebrows from the Treasury. I have long argued that public spending of public money should be done on the basis of need. The public will punish the cynical whiteboard allocation of funds, as we have seen in the past, so it is good to see Mt Panorama off the electoral agenda, having been funded as a racing circuit of international repute. I commend the government for that, although it did take quite a deal of time and a little bit of political argy-bargy in between. They have funded it as it should be funded: on the basis of need, not who happens to hold the seat at any particular time. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.03 p.m.)-The appropriation bills that we have been debating here today are, I would say, probably the most forensic vote-buying exercise a federal government budget has seen in a very long time. The government’s carefully calculated spending spree, which contains some $52 billion of new spending, including tax cuts to highincome earners, is probably nothing less than a desperate attempt to cling to power. Certainly it is more of an attempt to cling to power than a concerted effort to address the many problems and needs of the broader Australian community. These are needs which cut right across the critical areas of health and education as well as social security and, as we have seen, impact adversely on the everyday lives of struggling Australian families. Unfortunately, the government’s short-term pursuit of appeasing a few has compromised the long-term benefits for the majority of Australians. It is for this reason that I wish to make the point that this budget is very much a wasted opportunity. The government has effectively shirked its responsibilities to the broader community and has failed to offer much-needed genuine relief to the many Australians who have been seriously disadvantaged by its much flaunted and promoted economic policies. There are many casualties of this government’s policies. I would like to look at a particular group that we all deal with and that I deal with in my capacity as the federal member for Calwell. I would like to look at the plight of old age pensioners, who after years of working and paying taxes have to literally do battle on a daily basis just to get by in their day-to-day living. Yesterday a study was released which affirms that 70 per cent of elderly pensioners barely manage to make ends meet on what is a meagre amount at best. Many of these pensioners have now had to pay back commonly occurring overpayments which result from, in my assessment, what is perhaps the incompetence of Centrelink and also from flawed government policies. These elderly pensioners, who through no fault of their own have incurred thousands of dollars of debts, face stark choices-often including propositions that they should sell their family home in order to pay back these debts. It is an indictment on this government that it refuses to address the debt problem that innocent pensioners are hit with on a daily basis. If this is not enough, in addition to these overpayments, many elderly Australians come into my office and say, ‘We have just suffered another cutback to our pension,’ or, ‘We have lost our pension altogether.’ This time it is because many Australians who worked very hard and paid MAIN COMMITTEE taxes for many years have managed to own a second home in addition to their family home. These people have found that as a result of the large increase in real estate value, often driven by property developers and so forth, the value of the second home-which for years they have been able to keep and the value of which has kept below the means test threshold-has gone through the roof. As a result of that they lose their pension. They do not get any more income, it is just that their bricks and mortar have suddenly become more expensive-artificially inflated, in most cases. Most of these people come in and say, ‘What am I going to live on?’ This is a very sad indictment on the government. This is a generation of people who have worked very hard all their life, who have paid their taxes and who now deserve some sort of respectable attention from government. In my electorate the general response to the budget has been pretty much the same as it has been in other electorates across the country, where three out of five families and singles did not receive a single cent in tax relief or family assistance. The Treasurer’s strategists certainly would not have given too much thought to the electorate of Calwell and especially the suburb of Broadmeadows, a suburb which is known for its high rate of intergenerational poverty. Despite the constant chirping and dorothy dixers that we get in the House about the government’s economic successes, we never hear the Treasurer talk about his record on poverty. We never hear the Treasurer talk about poverty in this country. This is because the government simply does not want to talk about the 2.4 million families who live in poverty, many of whom have been driven into poverty by the same economic policies that the government constantly flaunts and raves on about, especially during question time. The government do not want to talk about the 370,000 people on unemployment benefits; they do not want to talk about the 500,000 Australians waiting anything up to 18 months to have their teeth fixed. The government do not want to talk about poverty, because to do so they would have to admit that they have failed a considerable number of Australians. They would have to admit that the prosperous Australian economy is leaving many Australians behind. If they admitted this, they would need to change their policies and budget priorities in order to address this problem. Because they are an opportunistic and deceptive government, they recognise that there are no votes to be won from poverty. There are no votes from poverty for the Howard government. As such, the government ignore the poor and instead chase votes elsewhere where they can buy them, as we have seen in their last attempt in the federal budget. This budget has essentially failed my constituents of Calwell. Not only does it not address the critical health, education and employment needs of my constituents, especially the battling families and individuals, it does something extraordinarily new for us in Calwell: it maliciously undermines the harmony and character of Broadmeadows. As I have said before in this place, Broadmeadows is a place of hardship but also a place of strong community networks and relationships. It is a place with its fair share of disadvantage, but in recent years Broadmeadows has developed and changed and is proving itself considerably-no thanks to this government, I might say. This year Broadmeadows received some special attention from the federal budget. We learnt that a new high-security immigration detention centre is going to be located in Broadmeadows. As you can imagine, this came as a great surprise, not only to me but also to the people of Broadmeadows, because there had been no indication of it and certainly no consulMAIN COMMITTEE tation with the community or the council. I had absolutely no idea that the government was planning to relocate its new detention facility to Broadmeadows in my electorate. Because the government has failed in its attempt to sell part of the historical Maygar Barracks-there were three failed bids, I understand-which were put on sale last year, a year and a bit ago, it appears that the government has made some last-minute decision to simply pinpoint Broadmeadows and Maygar Barracks as the new place for the detention centre. Last year, the community and I tried very hard to persuade the government to give the historical Maygar Barracks and its many buildings to the community for community use. As I said, there are many disadvantaged emerging communities and refugee communities settling in Broadmeadows who are in desperate need of facilities such as halls and centres, which they want to use as places for their community to meet and to worship. They need spaces for their young people to get together for recreational and teaching pursuits. Surprise, surprise: of course the government refused-flatly refused, as a matter of fact. At that stage, it was very busy with its big fire sale of Defence land, probably to raise money to pay for the war effort in Iraq. In refusing to give the Maygar Barracks to the community of Broadmeadows, the government also turned its back on the historical significance of the Maygar Barracks-a place to which locals have very fond attachments, not only directly but through their greatgrandfathers, the World WarI diggers who congregated in the famous white-tent cities before they went off to Gallipoli. Despite community protest, it appears that the government will proceed with its ‘gift’-the ‘gift’ that the federal electorate of Calwell received this year from the budget-of a new detention centre. It will spend $6 million of taxpayers’ money to buy a portion of the Maygar Barracks-which effectively it owns anyway; I presume that one department is going to buy it from the other-and then it will spend additional millions to build a 200-bed facility. There is a very cruel irony in this, because Broadmeadows is one of Australia’s most ethnically and culturally diverse regions. It is home to many different cultural and language groups, who, despite their great diversity and often very disadvantaged backgrounds, live harmoniously together. Significantly, it is also home to one of Australia’s largest Muslim communities, many of whom are recent arrivals to Australia. A significant proportion of these new Australians fled from the kind of terror, violence and poverty that more often than not drive people to seek refuge in other places. Locating a detention centre amongst this community is, I believe, totally and utterly insensitive. It places a centre congruent with many of the residents’ worse nightmares right in their backyard and threatens the social harmony of the many communities that call this area home. It has the potential to incite prejudice and racist behaviour from those who do not understand the complexities and horror of forced migration and the search for refuge. Converting the barracks into a high-security detention centre will further, I am afraid, stigmatise the Broadmeadows area, which already suffers a reputation of being rough and disadvantaged. This stigma, whether fairly or unfairly, does exist and extends to the residents of the suburb, who are often unfairly discriminated against because of the connotations that the suburb’s name conjures. Local residents and groups have made tremendous efforts to boost the appearance and reputation of Broadmeadows. In recent years we have seen numerous innovative programs MAIN COMMITTEE launched, many by the Hume City Council and the state government. Broadmeadows finally has its first ever library, the Hume Global Learning Centre, which is now a year old. It is a state-of-the-art library, which has brought great benefit to the people of Broadmeadows. Therefore, you can imagine why this gift from the government is such a slap in the face for the residents of Melbourne’s northern suburbs, who have worked so hard and with such dedication to counter the deep prejudice held against them. It is academic to say that there is a great level of unease in the community about this proposed detention centre. As I said, many of the residents are opposed to it, and I understand the Hume City Council has written to the minister for immigration. We strongly believe that this centre runs the risk of setting our community and our efforts back. It sets us back in our efforts to develop and change the perceptions that many people have of Broadmeadows. For many years the Maygar Barracks operated as a hostel for newly arrived migrants, which is another irony. Many thousands of my constituents lived at the barracks for a time or had family and friends who for a short period called the barracks home, forming deep friendships and relationships with Australia’s other newest residents and negotiating the language and culture of this country which was to become their home. Many of them moved from the barracks into the surrounding areas and still live there today. They still have very fond memories of their stays at the Maygar Barracks. I think it is an irony that the Maygar Barracks are to be transformed into a high-security detention centre, with all the things we have come to associate with such detention centres. The high razor wire fences and prison like qualities will definitely sour the precious memories my constituents have of the place, turning what was once a place of welcome into a place of rejection and containment. As I have said-and I want to emphasise this point, as it is what struck me when I first found out about this proposed detention centre during the federal budget presentations-it is deeply ironic that Broadmeadows should receive this sort of attention from the federal budget. It is certainly something the community does not want and does not need. It is particularly ironic because the money being spent on this project is money that is desperately needed in other areas in our community. One such area of immediate need in Calwell is the Bridgewater Lakes Estate in Roxburgh Park, a 124-bed aged care facility which is due to be completed and hopefully operational-or so the owners thought-in August this year. That has now been cast into doubt, because the owners of the facility missed out on the necessary allocation of beds in this year’s aged care approval rounds. The northern suburbs of Melbourne in my electorate have a very high need for nursing home and aged care beds. Surely it is more important for a government to spend money to provide good quality beds and accommodation for elderly Australians who have worked hard and given so much to the growth of this country. Surely that should be a priority, and all others, including the detention centre-and some $10 million, I suggest, will be spent on relocating and establishing that-should wait. Surely that money should be spent on providing much needed aged care beds. But perhaps the greatest victims of federal government neglect in Calwell are the young people who live in my electorate. The government’s policies show a disregard for their future. It is an established fact that education, particularly public education, is the greatest key to opportunity for young people, especially those who do not have the ability to access the nongovernment education sector. Yet, rather than make education more accessible to the disadvantaged, this government, through its policies, makes it harder for those young people who MAIN COMMITTEE cannot afford the best resources and the opportunities that other students in more affluent areas enjoy. These are the students that need the greatest attention and assistance from government, because they do not have the opportunities that other kids have. When you look at the fact that 70 per cent of children attend government schools across the country-including, of course, many in my electorate-it is astonishing that such schools will receive barely enough money to cover indexation, while their wealthier private school neighbours receive an increase of almost 40 per cent in funding. It is not the issue of funding non-government schools that is the problem here; it is the imbalance between the level of funding that is being meted out to the private school sector and the level of funding being meted out to the government school sector-which has a greater number of participants than the non-government school sector. Following on from school education, of course, is the issue of universities and higher education. In my electorate, the prospect of HECS fees rising-and we have recently seen La Trobe University, one of the major universities in our area, indicating that they would be putting up their HECS fees by 25 per cent-is making education for kids in my electorate less and less affordable. I do not know whether you would call it a pipedream for these young people, but certainly it is becoming a vexing issue because this massive increase in fees comes without any additional financial support for students and their families, forcing them to choose between massive debts in the future or no tertiary education at all. I do not know how that benefits the progress of this country when its young people have to choose not to pursue a tertiary education because they will not be able to afford the debt. I am not sure how that advances our cause in any way. I have spoken to many students in my electorate, and I can tell you that they are truly worried about their ability to afford a tertiary education. It is not that these students would not benefit from a tertiary education. Intelligence is not the prerogative of the wealthy; intelligence is something that most children have. They have capabilities. They rely on their families and on government to assist them to develop that intelligence for themselves and for the good of their country. I want to look also at TAFE. A couple of weeks ago I visited the new Koori learning education centre at Kangan Batman Institute of TAFE in Broadmeadows. I can tell you that I saw first-hand some very lovely work that the people there are doing with young people in my region-particularly troubled youth and Indigenous youth, who seem to be totally at the bottom of the ladder in relation to prospects for education. The creation of this new learning centre has provided hope and opportunity to many young Indigenous people, many of whom do slip through the cracks. This is not only about our underresourced government schools; it is that schools are just not catering for their style of learning and their predicament, which impacts on their learning. I have to commend the Kangan Batman TAFE for not only the effort and the planning that it put into servicing the students of the region but its deep understanding of those students who have the greatest need. We are very fortunate to have this TAFE in Broadmeadows. You can imagine we are very disappointed that there is no additional funding or provision for the 15,000-odd young people nationwide who have missed out on TAFE funded places. It is a great disappointment for young people in my electorate and across the country. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE to the Child Support Agency. I would like to address the issue of a gentleman who, on 10 May this year, received a telephone call from the Child Support Agency advising him of a serious breach of privacy. That serious breach of privacy was that his personal file-a file containing his personal information that was being carried out of the office by a Child Support Agency worker-had in fact been misplaced on a tram in Melbourne. This was on 10 May. In fact not only his file had been misplaced; the files of 15 other individuals had also been misplaced. These were files that contained the most intimate personal details: tax file numbers, income details and addresses. I am talking about the addresses of the children for whom these people are paying child support. I am talking about file notes of child support workers about this particular individual. To my understanding, all of that information relating to this gentleman plus 15 other individuals was left on a tram seat in Melbourne on 10 May. Just imagine if you and I were in a similar situation. When we give information to the Child Support Agency we are guaranteed that there is some level of privacy. Very intimate detail is contained in these files. Yet on 10 May this gentleman’s life was laid bare to the public-to anyone who had picked up those files. I regret to inform this chamber, this House, that those 15 files have disappeared. Someone has those 15 files, which contain the most intimate personal details of bank accounts, tax file numbers, ABNs, addresses and income. Someone is running around the streets of Melbourne with those files. You would think that, given that set of circumstances, there would be a major effort to recover those files, issue an apology and give some undertaking that this would not happen again. The information about this matter was raised in an excellent newspaper in Cranbourne, the Cranbourne Leader. The journalist concerned, Jeanette Langan, wrote about it in the Cranbourne Leader and it has been picked up by the Herald Sun in Melbourne. Let me give you some of his feedback about how he felt: Everything about me and my children was in there-where they live, what I earn, my ABN, my tax file number and income details. I cannot sleep at night for worrying. What if a paedophile has picked up the folder and he knows all about my kids or a criminal got hold of all my financial details? With the Internet these people these days will steal your whole identity. He received a written apology but three weeks later has still not been given a list of exactly what went missing, nor any compensation for the days off work he has had to take to reorganise his life, let alone for the stress to him, his new wife and child and his ex-wife and children. As a tradesman he has had to get a new ABN and tax file number and give them to the dozen employers that he works for as a contractor. He has had to close his bank accounts and notify his ex-wife and children that they are at risk. He goes on to say: AndI am not alone apparently. There are other people’s documents in the folders but I can’t find out how many. We have identified about 15. They have breached their own protocol. Documents were meant to travel in a secure case in a private car but this didn’t happen. Apologising, the state department registrar, Geoff Martin, admitted: A major breach to department rules has been made. Your privacy is a major concern for us and the staff involved have been sanctioned. However, unfortunately for this particular individual, this was not the first breach that he had been subjected to.

201,Mr Byrne (Holt) (12.23 P.m.),"I rise today to speak about a particular matter pertainingLast year they mistakenly sent me court papers and child access details of a dad in Mildura with the same Christian name as me. I wonder who’s got mine? I am just one person and I have had two privacy breaches in 12 months. They really need a shake up in there. Too right they do. As I said, when you provide information to the Child Support Agency-the most intimate, detailed information-that agency should take whatever measures are possible to ensure your privacy is guaranteed. I would like information from the Child Support Agency as to the other 15 people whose files were left on the tram seat in Melbourne. Have they been notified? What has actually happened to them? Further, I understand that this matter has been passed on to the Privacy Commission, given the seriousness of its nature. WhatI would like to see and what I call for in this House today is that the Privacy Commissioner report his or her findings on this matter to the minister and then the minister, with the appropriate names and details deleted, can report back to the parliament-and to me-about what action has been taken. This is a very serious breach. I have detailed not just one breach but two breaches to the same individual. One would think that is a pretty traumatic event and that that would be the end of it. Matt Cunningham wrote an article about this incident in the Herald Sun. Following its publication an individual who has similar privacy breach concerns to those of the person I have spoken about contacted Matt Cunningham by email. The email reads as follows: I read the article in your newspaper yesterday regarding CSA leaving documents of people private details on a train with much interest. A clear breach of privacy. I think the CSA agency problems go far deeper and they are attempting to cover up endemic breaches of privacy. As recently as 2 weeks ago my personal details were sent without my knowledge to an open work fax at my place of employment. Everyone in my office had a good read (I was the last to know) and this caused me severe embarrassment once this information entered the public domain. I lodged a complaint with the department who apologized and agreed this was ‘a clear breach of privacy laws’. They blamed it on a ‘contract lawyer’. This begs the question, is this one of a case or a regular breach of privacy laws? I think we are establishing the fact that we are getting a fairly regular breach. The email continues: And should a lawyer working on behalf of the department not know privacy laws. Or are they systemically acting above it? What procedures are in place to prevent this happening to someone else? This department has tried to make out this was a one off. However reading your article I don’t believe this to be the case. For most fathers/mothers involved in this very sensitive process the one sanctuary they have is the workplace. Perhaps this adds to the high suicide rate amongst parents involved with the CSA. He then sent another email with regard to this that he would like read into the Hansard. This was a complaint that he sent to the relevant agency: MAIN COMMITTEE I would like to place the following complaint against your department and would like a written explanation and apology. I would like to lodge a complaint for a breach of privacy against a Senior Case Officer. I have not spoken [to] or know who this person is. I am in the process of being reviewed by the agency. That did not stop them from sending a fax of all his details to his workplace, however. He continues: I have not yet had this meeting. And have made all child support payments as requested by the department. Unknown to me your Senior Case Officer has sent a fax of a very sensitive nature to an open fax at my new workplace. It seems many people have seen this fax and now I am suffering acute embarrassment due to this fax. A certain stigma is associated with material of this nature in the public domain. AndI feel my reputation has been damaged and defamed by your department. I have done nothing wrong yet your department has damaged my career and made my workplace unbearable. This has severely damaged my reputation at my new company. How is it possible an open fax is sent to a common fax in an office regarding such a personal issue? Does your department not realize how sensitive and private this issue is? What processes do you have in place to prevent this flagrant breach of privacy? I feel that this has severely damaged my future career in this company and I would like to know what your department is prepared to do about it? IfI do not get a satisfactory explanation I will have no choice [but to] escalate this matter. I have just cited three examples of very serious breaches of privacy. Fifteen files containing intimate personal information were left on a tram seat in Melbourne. The same gentleman who was the victim in that case was sent a letter 15 months earlier with someone else’s details. He was told the personal life of someone with the same first name. And now we have another email. We keep on being told that this is a one-off, that this is not a systemic breach. I say to this chamber that there is a systemic breach and it needs to be investigated. I would ask that the matter that I have just cited be investigated by the Privacy Commissioner. I would also request that the Privacy Commissioner release his or her findings to the relevant minister and that that minister make available to me and to the public an explanation as to why this has occurred and give a guarantee that this will not occur again in the future. In researching this matter and in looking for precedents-as I said, we have been told that this is not systemic-I came upon an article written by Adele Horin and published on 14 March 2002 in the Sydney Morning Herald. The article says: The Child Support Agency’s Penrith office lost 180 “restricted access” files containing highly sensitive details about separated and divorced parents. The files were supposed to have been locked in a special security cabinet. Instead they were stacked beside a clerk’s desk and thrown out by the cleaners. The files are considered more personal than tax records. They contained people’s names, their tax file number, their employer’s name and how much was deducted from their pay for child support. MAIN COMMITTEE Restricted access files are kept on high-profile people ... In this case, the files involved parents who worked for the NSW Department of Community Services, the Australian Tax Office and the Child Support Agency itself. So yet again, some two years ago, we had a very clear privacy security breach. I do not think it is too much to ask the Child Support Agency, on behalf of those people whose files are missing and on behalf of that gentleman in Cranbourne who cannot sleep at night because he is worried about what is going to happen to his children now that their address is out there, to be much more careful with the information it is given. I would also reiterate that I have asked the Privacy Commissioner to investigate all the matters that I have raised and report back to the relevant minister, who can report back to this House, to make the Child Support Agency publicly accountable for the breaches in privacy that have occurred. Moving from the particular matter in micro, much to the member for Deakin’s pleasureport-I would like to talk about the budget in general. Unfortunately, Member for Deakin, this is probably some stuff you are not going to like as much. One would think that, with the $52 billion that has been spent, in my electorate as a consequence of this vast truckload of money there would be universal bulk-billing, no doctor shortages, no difficulty in assessing psychiatric care and no difficultyMr Barresi interjectinglooked after by the provision of abundant emergency relief funding and community based agencies, that there would be no child-care shortages or aged care shortages and that lowto middle-income earners would be given the tax relief that they are looking for to cope with the fairly crippling levels of personal debt that are emerging in my electorate. I am sorry to disappoint you, Member for Deakin. Let me give you a snapshot of what is actually occurring in my electorate. We will start with bulk-billing. In the past three years, the bulk-billing rate in my electorate has dropped from 91.7 per cent to 76 per cent. That is a 15 per cent drop. When you talk to doctors in the region, what they are saying is that in the next five years there will be no universally bulk-billing doctors. I have read much about this. In fact, I received in my letterbox from the Prime Minister himself the Strengthening Medicare package. What a delight and joy it was to read! I would presume that, as a consequence of having this money, which I presume is part of the $100 million that has been spent on advertising, all my problems and the problems of my constituents would be solved and therefore they could get bulk-billing doctors. But funnily enough, when I contacted doctors in the region, there did not seem to be an increase in the bulk-billing rate. But how could it be? We have spent $100 million on advertising and we have spent lots of money telling people that bulk-billing is alive and well-and yet the bulk-billing rate in my electorate, which has plummeted precipitously in the past three years, has not jumped. Why could that be? I am a little bit confused. There is another issue that is near and dear to my heart, and that is the issue of Medicare offices. This is one I must attribute to the ‘about to be former’ member for La Trobe, Bob Charles, who lobbied for a Medicare office in the Fountain Gate Shopping Centre 10 years MAIN COMMITTEE",193,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004

204,Mr Byrne,"Yes, $52 billion. One would think that our poor and disadvantaged would beago. Lo and behold, after a sustained five-year campaign that the residents of the City of Casey undertook-in fact, we got a 22,000 signature petition, which I tabled in this place in 2002-we were actually given the joy, during a flying visit by the Prime Minister to Narre Warren some two or three months ago, of an announcement that there would be funding for a Medicare office. I am very pleased about that. I am very pleased for the residents of Casey, who should be given the appropriate credit for the delivery of the Medicare office. Let me tell you about the Fountain Gate Shopping Centre before they were given that funding. This is a shopping centre that has something like 11½ million movements through it per year. It was the largest shopping centre in Australia not to have a Medicare office. For five years they were told no by the Health Insurance Commission, notwithstanding the staggering number of young families around the region-we have 40,000 children in the city of Casey between zero and 12 years old. Just imagine you are one of the parents of those children and you go to a doctor. If you have sick children, you are going to go to the doctor a lot. You go to the doctor-you do not get bulk-billed, because it is very hard to get bulk-billing in the areaand you have to take your forms somewhere. Where do you take them? You could not take them to Fountain Gate. You still cannot take them there, because they still do not have a Medicare office. The funding has been announced but the office has not been delivered. Where do they go? They have to travel to Dandenong, with queues of 30 people. They have to travel to Warragul. For five years they were told they were not good enough to get a Medicare office. Yet all of a sudden, with the dawn of an election campaign, the impossible has become possible. SoI have written to the Health Insurance Commission, which, very interestingly, instead of answering the questions directly, have gone to the Minister for Health and Ageing. It is very unusual for a government department to not actually respond to a direct request from a member of parliament. Could it be that they were put under pressure because of an election campaign? PerhapsI am being cynical. For five years when we have asked the Health Insurance Commission whether or not they would put a Medicare office in the region, we were told: ‘There are a set number of offices and, too bad, you’re not going to get one until one closes down.’ Then we had the very famous electronic billing system that was going to cure all of our ills, and then, lo and behold, magically as a consequence of the Prime Minister’s visit, we have a new set of criteria and we are now being told that, because of the huge amount of growth in the area, we are suddenly going to get a Medicare office. I hate to tell you this, but for many years, as the member for Deakin would know, up to 80 families a week have been moving into the city of Casey-80 families a week. Unfortunately my time is running short and I know the member for Deakin is enjoying this presentation. You would think also that, given the amount of funding, there would be an abundance of doctors-that doctors would be positively pullulating in Holt. The problem is that we have severe doctor shortages. In fact, in the Hallam Medical Centre, we have a doctor who has 8,500 people on her database but she cannot get another doctor. She is a fully bulkbilling doctor and yet she cannot attract another doctor to the region. She is forced to try to get an overseas doctor. The recommended ratio of patients to GPs is normally about one to 1,400 depending on their micro-socioeconomic grouping. In the city of Casey, with those 40,000 children aged between zero and 12, the ratio of doctors to patients is one to 2,000. MAIN COMMITTEE We have an absolutely chronic shortage of doctors in this region. And yet, with this magnificent presentation-the rivers of money, the fistful of dollars, Member for Deakin, that are coming through-I have not seen any new doctors turn up at Dr D’Argent’s doorstep. I have not seen a flood of doctors come and tend to the sick kids who are winding up in emergency departments in public hospitals because they cannot find a doctor. I am waiting for that, so, if the member for Deakin can enlighten me on this, it would be absolutely fantastic. I would just like to address one more issue in the time that allows-the much trumpeted tax cuts. Ninety-four per cent of my electorate did not receive a tax cut. I do not know what the statistics are for the member for Deakin’s electorate. He is in a marginal seat, so I think it might be a bit better, because it is a highly targeted package-particularly in La Trobe and Deakin and Aston and other seats. But let me talk about good, working-class areas like Holt: for 94 per cent of people in my electorate there are no tax cuts. They are not thanking the Howard government for the tax cuts; they would like a bit more. Ninety-four per cent of people in my electorate earn under $52,000 a year-not as many as the member for Deakin, not as many perhaps as the member for Aston, not as many perhaps as the member for La Trobe. Never has so much been given to so few, and we know whybecause there is an election. Just like the Medicare office in the city of Casey: for five years there were 22,000 people petitioning the government and, all of a sudden, there is the delivery of a Medicare office because there is an election. This budget is a cruel hoax, and I would invite the people of Holt to pass their vote in judgment at the next election. (Time expired) Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.43 p.m.)-I am sorry to break up the delightful talkfest across the table, but I rise to discuss the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and its cognate bills and to demonstrate that the people of Chisholm were forgotten when the government was drawing up this budget. Those earning more than $52,000 may receive a tax cut, but any benefits will be wiped out comprehensively by the continuing increase in the cost of health and education services. The $600 payment per child will only go towards paying off family payment debts accrued by local families through no fault of their own. And what of those people earning less than $52,000? They have to go without. Given the Howard government is the highest taxing government in Australian history, local workers earning up to $52,000 have paid more than their fair share of tax and deserve, like other Australian workers, to get some of their money back. In a $52 billion budget, a substantial level of funding could and should have been directed to saving Medicare. Bulk-billing rates in Chisholm have fallen by more than 10 per cent since 2000. In the short space of four years we have seen a decline of 10 per cent in our bulk-billing rate. While the government has tried to make much of the slight shift in its bulk-billing rate in the March sector, the most recent bulk-billing rate is still lower than the bulk-billing rate in March last year. Of course, with the government sitting on the electorate specific bulk-billing figures, I do not know whether the rate in Chisholm has continued to decline. Anecdotally, I am still hearing about people having trouble accessing bulk-billing doctors, particularly out of hours. Out-of-pocket costs have continued to rise-up by 14 per cent since this time last year. Any tax break is not going to make up a 14 per cent differential that you are now paying to go and see your doctor. It is worth remembering that, when Labor left office, bulk-billing was at 80 per cent. It has fallen over the life of this government by 12 per cent. Labor is committed to getting it up to MAIN COMMITTEE 80 per cent again. Labor is committed to getting it up to this level by a planned and sensible approach to Medicare and not spending a small fortune on showing the same ad every day of the week, or sending the same pack to each home. By now we have the message. Save the money and put it back into actually saving Medicare. This government has also ignored the plight of residents in Melbourne east who are referred for an MRI test. Of the 16 MRI machines in Victoria that are eligible for a Medicare rebate, not one is based in the eastern region of Melbourne-that is, from Box Hill out to the Yarra Valley. This is an enormous area in the Victorian metropolitan area and also beyond. What this means for residents of Melbourne east who are advised by their specialists to have an MRI test is more stress at a time when they certainly do not need it. need is to be put at major inconvenience by travelling to a radiologist kilometres away from your home to find a Medicare rebated MRI unit, for which there is generally a sixto eightweek waiting list anyway. The alternative is to somehow find $500 for a service which many other Australians rightly receive a rebate for. The Eastern Health network has made several representations to the Department of Health and Ageing and has put a strong case that Medicare eligibility should be granted to the current MRI machine owned by the radiological practice based at Box Hill Hospital. Let me re-emphasise that for the member for Deakin: the Medicare rebate should go to the one currently in operation at Box Hill Hospital and not the one in his seat that has not been established yet. I note that the health minister last week announced that the government will fund 23 new Medicare-eligible MRI machines in underserviced locations around Australia. The minister, having recently acknowledged in the Maroondah Leader that Melbourne’s eastern region was underserviced, must surely be planning to include the MRI based at Box Hill Hospital in this secret list. I look forward to the announcement of this service being given to the people in the east of Melbourne at the most sensible and logical location and not at the one in the marginal seat next door to mine. I am pleased that the government has finally opened its eyes to the threat that pneumococcal disease poses to our children and agreed to fund a vaccine for all toddlers. I recently tabled a petition in this House signed by more than 250 local parents calling on the government to follow the expert advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council that the vaccine should be provided at no cost to all children under two. There is nothing in this budget for thousands of Chisholm residents who are on waiting lists for dental care. More than 4,000 residents are on a Whitehorse Community Health Service waiting list. The story is similar at Monash Link Community Health, where the average wait for treatment is two to three years. Dental care is a shared state and federal government responsibility. The state government has recently done its part in our neck of the woods. It has cut waiting lists in Whitehorse by funding in its 2004 budget nine new dental chairs at the Whitehorse Community Health Service. The clinic will go from having one dental chair to 10, with six of the chairs allocated for community and youth dental programs, two for the school dental service and two to support undergraduate clinical experience of dental professionals from the University of Melbourne. This is a very welcome initiative and I say thank you to the MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
205,Mr Barresi,I’m fighting for one now.,199,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
206,Ms Burke,"Yes, I know you are. When your health is under a cloud the last thing youstate government for putting these chairs where they are needed-again, in Box Hill, which is a great place to locate services. The clinic will operate on an extended hours basis, increasing significantly the number of hours of care to be provided and reducing waiting times. So the state government has lived up to its responsibility while the federal government just closes its eyes to the pain and discomfort of so many residents, many of them elderly. Speaking of the elderly, I am concerned that this budget does not address the long-term care needs of our ageing populace. While I welcome an injection of capital and recurrent funding in residential aged care, it speaks to me of a quick fix rather than tackling a woeful funding formula. According to the Community Care Coalition, up to $405 million has effectively been taken out of the prices paid by government for residential aged care between 1996-97 and 2002-03. In community care, about $120 million of government funding has been taken out of the sector. The Community Care Coalition say: The result has been an increasingly thin spread of community care services-for example clients only being showered once a week instead of every day and the steady dilution of services provided in residential care-for example, staff not able to spend as much time with individual residents. And as quality is beginning to suffer, many organisations are now considering whether they can continue to provide care at all. This budget does not deliver enough to the aged care sector. As the Chief Executive of the Victorian Association of Health and Extended Care, Mary Barry, has said, Victorian nursing homes will receive an overall increase of three per cent in the coming financial year, which will be more than consumed by the staff salary increases of four per cent that have already been mandated. Given that nurses working within the aged care sector earn predominantly 25 per cent less than nurses in the acute care sector, this four per cent is going nowhere towards filling the gap and ensuring that we have qualified professional staff working in the aged care industry. I am disappointed that there were absolutely no funding measures for community care in this budget. I am aware that the minister has said the community care review will be released shortly, and I hope the government has seen fit to adequately fund these vital services which ensure older people can remain living in their homes and communities longer. There is a crisis in community care. We keep saying that people should be able to age gracefully in their homes, but if we are not providing the dollars to support them there they will end up in residential aged care. It is not good economic sense. We need to keep them in their homes. If they can have services provided to them at home where they need it, that will benefit the community at large. Turning to education, I am disappointed to see that no commitment of any substance was made to additional university or TAFE places in Victoria. Just last week a Victorian state parliamentary committee inquiry into unmet demand for places in higher education found that 13,000 eligible tertiary students in Victoria missed out on a university place this year-that is 13,000 in Victoria alone. Nearly 8,000 of those who missed out were mature age applicants. The committee found that traditional TAFE students were being displaced by university students who were eligible for but could not get a university place. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, does not fool anybody on this side of the House with his talk of new university places to be phased in over the next four years. These places are not MAIN COMMITTEE new. They are just backfilling because of a government bungle that allowed universities to put in half-met places. There are no new places out there. The government are just funding those places that already exist. Does anybody understand, in light of this $52 billion budget, why the government felt compelled to force universities to raise their fees by 25 per cent from next year? In my electorate I am honoured to have two of Melbourne’s best universities, and certainly Australia’s largest: Monash University and Deakin’s Burwood campus. Both of these universities have decided to increase their fees by the maximum amount. I am really concerned for the young people who want to further themselves in university but are scared of being saddled with debt. I and the elder of my brothers and sisters were all privileged to go to Monash University at a time when you did not have to pay fees. My younger brother sadly incurred all the HECS that his elder brother and sisters did not have to. There was no way my parents could have seen their five children go to university if we had all had to pay fees, and we were not the sort of family who would have said, ‘Let’s incur a massive amount of debt.’ It is people from backgrounds like mine who would never have seen the inside of a university who are missing out on education. I feel, too, for parents-parents like mine who want their children to succeed and who may be placed under further financial strain to make it all possible. It would be tragic if young people from less well-off backgrounds were deterred from furthering themselves through university study because of the prospect of going into major debt. Deciding whether to attend university or not should come down to whether you have the ability, not whether you have the ability to pay. If we want to be a smart country in the future, surely we need to be supporting, not deterring, young people who want to develop their potential. One issue glossed over in this budget is the concern about lack of household savings and retirement income. The one measure-matched savings for low-income earners-is not a policy; it is a cop-out. How many people on $28,000 or less are going to be able to save $1,000 in order to have the government match it? Few, if any. The government’s current system of co-contributions to super has not even run a year yet, but it has certainly tied up a bucket of money in as with that cute pink pig. Apparently, they had to re-shoot the ad because the pink pig was too big. If you had measured it, you would have had more money than the government was actually giving you. They have re-shot the ad twice to get the right-sized pink pig. A lot of money has gone into the pink pig but not into people’s pockets. We have not been able to assess the current system. It has not even run a year, so we do not know if it is working, but the government have said in the budget, ‘We’re going to move from a dollar for a dollar, to $1.50 for a dollar.’ That is not good economics. You need to assess a program to see whether it is working before you go and increase it. It goes the way of the government’s failed baby bonus system-a complete dud, by the government’s own admission. The government have now scrapped that and introduced a new maternity payment in the budget, which is welcome. Copying is one of the greatest forms of flattery, so we in the Labor Party are very impressed that the government have copied our scheme. They have thrown in a few flaws, so we know it is a conservative initiative. The super measures in the budget were no measures at all; the Treasurer should hang his head in shame. He claimed his next big task after reforming the tax system and introducing the GST was to deal with super, and what we have is nothing. My seat of Chisholm has a MAIN COMMITTEE greying demographic, a high rate of tertiary education and, consequently, a large number of self-funded retirees or those who hope to leave the work force shortly to live comfortably on their super. By virtue of retirees downsizing their homes, my electorate also has a growing number of young families moving in. What do these groups have in common? What is their community of interest? It is security-not, mind you, fears about an unknown villain who may break into their home or a terrorist threat but concern about their family’s financial future. They want to provide for their kids, live a comfortable but not flamboyant life and retire in comfort. For the populace to achieve this end, they need savings-which is a great worry, because as a nation we are fast becoming dis-savers. John Howard, way back in June 1995, said: ... household savings-and that’s not a bad indicator of, you know ... the money that people have got left over after they’ve put the bread on the sideboard and ... food on the table. ... it went right over a cliff in the last quarter. Now what this indicates is there’s a massive squeeze on mainstream Australia and the people who are being hurt most are the battlers. He needs to look at the figures now, because they are a disgrace. With consumption the main driver of economic growth, the national accounts for the first three months of 2004 reveal that the household savings ratio hit a record low of minus 3.4 per cent. The household savings ratio has now been negative for a record eight consecutive quarters in a row. When Labor left office, $5.80 in every $100 of household income was saved by Australian households. Under the Howard government, this has turned negative, with households spending more than they earn. Overall household debt under the Howard government has almost tripled-from $290 billion in March 1996 to almost $750 billion in December 2003. Household debt has skyrocketed from 85 per cent of household income in March 1996 to a staggering 147 per cent in December 2003. Most alarming of all is Reserve Bank of Australia data which shows that, in March 2004 alone, we put $13.35 billion on our credit cards-about $430 million a day. On top of this, we racked up $265 million worth of interest payments-almost $9 million a day. The banks are liking this, but it is hurting our back pockets. While we did manage to pay $13.32 billion off our cards during the month, we still owed a record $26.7 billion. That is more than four times what we owed when John Howard became Prime Minister in March 1996. This is a picture of a society that spends, and one that spends money it does not even have. And what is the government doing about this? What is its proposal? What was in the budget? Diddly-squat; absolutely nothing. Labor, on the other hand, have a plan. We are the party primarily responsible for the only savings individuals have-their super. It was Labor, back in 1987, who took the visionary and bold step of introducing compulsory superannuation. We actually took away a pay increase from people and made them put it into their super. It is Labor who believe that appropriate retirement savings will ensure a secure background for our aging populace. It is the Treasurer who wants us to work until we drop. ‘Demography is destiny’ is not a catchy phrase, and working beyond what people consider their due retirement age is not something the Australian populace wants or should have to embrace. But we need savings. We need a system that encourages people to place money in a fund which will secure their financial well-being in retirement. In addition, as the recent discussion paper by the Consumer and Financial Literacy Taskforce found-and ASIC has echoed thisMAIN COMMITTEE we need to get financial literacy on the political agenda. People need to know what to do with their money and they need to know that when they get advice and place that precious sum somewhere it is secure and growing. There is enormous fear out there amongst people about finally having to take control of their super-employees are generally happy with their money going into their super fund. They have faith that the trustees are making wise choices on their behalf. Whilst they do not like seeing negative returns on their investment, they like the thought of it in someone else’s hands. What they dread is the day they will actually have to take charge. We need a better system-one where consumers are protected and can make informed choices, and one where funds are protected if the trustee takes off with a table-top dancer to Central America. Labor have a plan. It has a significant plan with respect to superannuation. We have outlined this in numerous policy documents. In essence, we have five key elements: simplicity; security, safety and certainty; safer choice; affordability; and fairer taxation. Genuine savings need to be encouraged and we need to educate all in financial literacy-or the next generation will be like my daughter in thinking you can put it all on mummy’s credit card. The budget did nothing to plug this yawning gap. We need to be doing things about savings. We need to be doing things about telling people that they now need to be putting more into their super. Their nine per cent is not going to ensure a comfortable retirement. You need to start it when you begin in the work force and not leave it until later in the piece. This budget has done nothing in respect of that. It is a smoke and mirrors budget with an enormous amount of money going out but not going anywhere that will significantly help the populace at large. My seat of Chisolm has been left out. The members of the Liberal Party who encircle my seat in the east of Melbourne can talk about a road-they cannot talk about anything else. They cannot talk about the lack of services in our neck of the woods, they cannot talk about bulk-billing rates and they cannot talk about education. They can talk about a road. They should start talking about things that are important to their constituency. They should start talking about things that their constituency knows that it needs. They should start talking about services and the lack of them in our neck of the woods. They can keep on about a road for as long they like, and they know it is a nice smokescreen for the election campaign. They can talk about it but they cannot deliver on it and so they should start concentrating on what matters to our area. This is an election budget full of sound and fury signifying nothing. The budget has not helped the struggling families in Chisholm and it has not helped pensioners or self-funded retirees, but it has spent a whole lot of money on targeting a few-maybe those who will ensure the Prime Minister gets to sit out his dotage in Kirribilli. It is a tragic way to run an economy and a country. tally important to any national economy in the modern age. I refer in particular in this case to the success of the road networks and the telephone networks. These integrated networks in modern society really work because the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. The reality in this case is that if you have a successful network-if you have that network working properly, with all of those parts contributing successfully-then you can make a modern road network work in such a way that it can add value to the economy and the national GDP output MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
207,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (1.03 P.m.),"The success of integrated networks is viand it can contribute much more in totality than any of the parts could ever do individually. Of course, that works for Australia because it is such a vast country-the distances are so significant. All of our individual states have industries spread across very large distances. In our rural and regional economy in particular we have agricultural and regional horticultural industries in scattered towns in many electorates. One in particular is the electorate of Wakefield, a particularly important part of South Australia and its regional economy. Stretching from Elizabeth to Clare, it is an important and significant area of 6,000 square kilometres, with industries vital to Australia’s export economy within it. These include the wine industry, which is now doing particularly well. I would like to see the wine industry grow and flourish, but it can only do so if we have integrated networks such as the road network-and, indeed, as far as the tourism industry is concerned, we need to include integrated networks like the telephone network as well. I would first like to turn to the road network and draw the Main Committee’s attention to the failure in the recent AusLink announcements of the Howard government to properly provide for South Australia’s integrated road network and its growth into the future. While the recent AusLink announcements provided some $11.8 billion over the next five years, which may seem a very significant and substantial amount of money-and it is in anyone’s terms a massive amount of money to spend on the road and rail network-South Australia has significantly missed out. Indeed, to quote John Fotheringham, the RAA’s chief executive, South Australia was ‘dudded’ in this announcement by the Howard government, because out of that massive $11.8 billion road and rail package we will only receive $239 million over the five year period. South Australia accounts for some eight per cent of the national population, but we will receive a paltry $239 million of that substantial package. Our eight per cent population figure should have netted us a much more substantial amount of money. South Australia does not share with the eastern states the most substantial part of the funding. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, that you are a fine representative of New South Wales, which received a much more substantial part of the funding from the Howard government than South Australia did. While we should have received a much higher percentage of the figure than we did, we also did not receive the necessary amount of money to allow us to continue to grow and develop the integrated road network that will be required. Wakefield, my own prospective electorate under the redistribution, will receive funding for the Sturt Highway extension during that five-year period, but, while the Sturt Highway is an important road link in South Australia, as is the Port River Expressway link, unfortunately that will not necessarily be enough to ensure the success of the integrated network within South Australia. I think it is vital to see the national highway network as part of that vital economic link: not just as a road network as such, but as an economic network-and one that ensures that the totality of our economic institutions can grow as an economic whole. Of course, the industries in my electorate that I spoke of-the tourism and wine industries in particular-cannot continue to grow as they have done in the past without that road network. Stretching up through the Wakefield electorate from Adelaide-through Salisbury and Elizabeth, through Gawler, through the Main North Road, all the way through that wine and tourism electorate-to Clare eventually, and through the western side of the electorate, up the recently developed Port Wakefield Road, as the major north-south axis of the electorate, it is MAIN COMMITTEE an essential development. The Main North Road from Gawler to Clare is in significant need of redevelopment too, and funding for that should have been provided in this area-the rural part of the electorate-while in the urban part of the electorate we are certainly in need of development of the Main North Road running from Adelaide through Elizabeth and to Gawler. That is an essential part of the future economic development of the Adelaide area itself. The east-west links within the electorate are also essential. I think it is important to look not only at the major axes of the road networks within an area but also at the cross-links, because many of the smaller communities are vitally dependent on the cross-links within these geographic districts as well. In order to ensure that economic and community development takes place, it is vitally important to look at the east-west cross-links in this case as well as the major axes of connection on a road network basis. The major AusLink projects have gained recent attention in the media. In the eastern states such major funding was provided particularly, I might say, to coalition electorates. Words like ‘pork-barrelling’ come to mind, of course, although I would not make such a direct accusation. Other colleagues of mine have done so and I am sure they had an adequate basis to make it, but I have not personally undertaken such an investigation because I have had my attention focused on South Australia. I am certain that their basis was no doubt correct. I think one should also draw attention to the fact that, earlier this year in South Australia, the Prime Minister announced additional funding for South Australia’s local road networks. But the state minister, Trish White, was able to draw attention to the fact that South Australia has again missed out on the local road network funding. South Australia maintains some 11.7 per cent or just over 75,000 kilometres of the national local road network, yet we have received only 5.5 per cent of federal road funding for local roads. This is even after the additional funding that the Prime Minister provided, which will still give us only some 7.2 per cent of the Commonwealth’s financial assistance grants for local roads over the next three years. This is still significantly less than our share of the road network. No other state received such a poor deal. Indeed, it is comparable to the payment which Tasmania receives for only 2.2 per cent of the network. The reality is that, while Tasmania may have some special case because of the small size of its economy-and I make deference to my colleague the member for FranklinSouth Australia should certainly receive an additional grant to bring its funding for local roads back to the national per capita and per road kilometre share, if I can invent such a metric for the purposes of this discussion. South Australia should have that appropriate funding. I think this case has been made again and again in this parliament and outside of this parliament by the South Australian Local Government Association as well as, in the context of a parliamentary committee of this House, again and again by the state minister, the state Premier and local representatives in this parliament. South Australia has missed out again and again in the context of local road funding. The economic importance of this cannot be overstated. I have already referred to the importance of economic networks in the context of roads. I also mentioned the economic value of networks in the context of telephone services. I would like to draw a parallel with those telephone services in the context of regional areas because of the importance of the CDMA and GSM networks in regional areas in towns like Clare, MAIN COMMITTEE which I have already mentioned, and many of the other regional towns such as Kapunda, Balaklava and Mallala. I will not name all of the towns in my district of Wakefield. The networks are just as important when those networks are virtual and in the ether of our airwaves as they are when they are on the ground, because they contribute equally to economic value. Having one phone in a network is useless. Having two phones has some value, but you can speak only to one other person. When you have millions of phones then, of course, the economic value of a phone network is not countable. Of course, it is now the situation in Australia that virtually everyone has a mobile phone, as you can tell if you walk down the street or go to a restaurant. The reality is that mobile phones are now ubiquitous in this country and they are equally important in the regional areas. When you go to tourist and wine areas like the Clare and Gilbert valleys and the areas around those, you see the importance of the mobile phone network. As any person who represents a rural or regional community in this House will know, mobile phones are essential in rural and regional areas, but they have a special significance in areas that have a tourist value and we certainly need to boost the mobile phone coverage in country districts. This government has made much of its commitment to the mobile phone network in rural and regional Australia, without actually delivering that much, I might say. While there has been an increase in coverage in recent years, you can still travel in rural and regional areaseven in significant towns in this country-but not have complete coverage. When you go to many of the areas which are frequented by tourists-and I would cite as an example the town of Clare, which is a major tourist town in South Australia in the context of wineries-they have very limited GSM coverage. Yet tourists frequently go into the rural and regional areas of Australia with their GSM phones, because they come from the major capital cities of Australia. Although the government has committed through Telstra to installing CDMA in rural and regional Australia, because of the better distance coverage which CDMA has, the reality is that tourists often come from the major metropolitan areas and frequently bring GSM telephones with them. Tourists come to tourist areas like Clare, for example, with GSM phones and then discover that there is very little GSM coverage, if any, in tourist towns like that. Even though GSM coverage is limited, so is CDMA coverage, and these areas are frequently saturated. When you try and get a mobile line, you cannot do so even on CDMAand certainly not on GSM. These issues need to be taken up by both Telstra and the government, which claims some success in increasing mobile phone coverage but, I suspect increasingly, with little credibility in this area. Certainly, the issue of tourists and the way in which they choose to use GSM phones in areas which are tourist dependent needs to be examined more closely by Telstra and the other carriers at the same time. While we are touching on the issue of wineries in this context, I think it is very important to note the budget decision to impose a rebate or to relax the imposition of the wine equalisation tax on local wineries. The wine equalisation tax was a very significant one from this government’s point of view. Labor has always sought an exemption from the WET for small wineries and, instead of providing this, the government granted a rebate from the WET for small wineries. While this is welcome in its own regard, the government, instead of doing the obvious, adopted yet another of Labor’s policies-as they have frequently sought to do. They varied this, which is always a mistake for this government. They should have simply done what MAIN COMMITTEE we asked and provided an exemption but, no, they moved away from this area and granted a rebate-but one which will only come into effect on 1 October. Many smaller wineries and those who are suffering from some credit problems in the current season will struggle in the interim period, because the tax rebate will not take effect until 1 October. It is some five and a half months from budget day to 1 October. Given that the rebate will not take effect until that date, what is to happen in the interim period? If you have a large winery with significant financial resources behind it, you can carry customers and the available finance until that date. If you have a winery that is under some financial pressure, if there is already a credit question behind you, then of course there are financial issues that need to be discussed with your bankers in that interim period. That places additional financial stress on wineries in the industry in the intervening period. It creates additional pressure that the industry and small businesses in it, many in my prospective electorate, do not need. The government had no need to place this additional pressure on wineries. It could simply have made this rebate’s implementation date much earlier. It could have been implemented, for example, from budget night. That is quite a common practice in respect of taxation measures that are introduced in a budget. The operative date could have been much sooner than 1 October; it could have been 1 July. I would not have thought the amount of money involved in having an earlier operative date would have been of such magnitude as to place any great pressure on the budget. Making1 October the operative date simply indicates neglect on the part of the government, which could have made small businesses in the wine industry far better off had they given this rebate an earlier operative date. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 1.21 p.m. to 1.32 p.m. tion tax must be on the basis that these small wineries have the opportunity to resolve the issue of their WET liabilities much sooner than 1 October. This additional period from the budget allows customers of the wineries to be aware of the fact that this substantial tax-this 29 per cent tax-will be lifted, but it will be lifted some 5½ months from the date of the budget. This substantial period between the date of the knowledge by the public that the tax will be rebated and the actual rebate of the tax is far too long. If you are adjusting a tax like this to apply a rebate then you need a much faster application of the rebate. To provide this in the public domain for such a long period and not apply the rebate is an absurd policy response. I call on the government to provide a much speedier application of this rebate to ensure that the industry is better provided for. This is a worthwhile policy initiative but it should have been done in the manner which Labor has always called for. 1) 2004-2005, there is not much time so I will try and be as brief as possible. I think the headlines of the Tasmanian daily newspaper The Mercury said it all on the day after the budget was released. The heading was ‘Thanks for nothing’. People might not realise that Tasmanians are disadvantaged in several ways and the disadvantage that is obvious to most of us who live and work in Tasmania and to those of us who represent Tasmania in this place is that Tasmanian workers receive less pay than their mainland counterparts.

210,Mr Slipper,"Is the cost of living lower?ing 88 per cent of Tasmanian workers will miss out on federal government tax cuts. The federal budget paved the way for tax cuts for people earning a minimum of $52,000 a year, but as I said, most Tasmanians earn much less than the tax cut benchmark, meaning that they will miss out on paying less tax out of their salaries. Only 12 per cent of Tasmanians will benefit from the move by Treasurer Peter Costello to raise the thresholds on payable tax-just 12 per cent. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, the average Tasmanian wage is $33,186 a year. The figures compiled in November last year show that Tasmanians receive the second lowest pay packet of any state or territory in Australia, earning just $2 a week more than their South Australian counterparts. These are not my figures or my words; they are from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Tasmanian Council of Social Services agreed that 88 per cent do not earn enough to benefit from the tax cuts. TasCOSS director Mat Rowell said that they can now confirm that only 38 per cent of Tasmanian families are currently in receipt of either family tax benefit A or B. That is, the vast majority of Tasmanian families will not benefit from the $600 payment. My time is very limited; I only have another two minutes. The government stands up and says that this is good for Australia and that people earning a minimum of $52,000 a year will get a tax cut, but 88 per cent of Tasmanian families will miss out entirely. has been targeted at the marginal seats that the government holds or wants to win. The five seats in Tasmania have been and hopefully will be held by Labor members who have been in this place for a long period of time.

The public can be reassured that due consideration has been given to the needs of individuals and the broader Australian community in this forum. I would like to thank all honourable members who have participated. The discussion has focused on a broad range of issues-from the general state of the economy, to issues emerging in the individual electorates of members, specific funding proposals and the suggestion by the opposition that the government has failed to provide for the delivery of important services. I was interested in what opposition members had to say about the bills and the broader budget. However, not surprisingly, I find myself unable to agree with most of the sentiments expressed. I will take the opportunity to respond to some of the main issues raised shortly but, because of the shortness of time, I may not be able to respond to everyone and in this respect I apologise to those whose remarks will not be addressed.

214,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdminiBeforeI do so, however, I would like to provide an overview of the package of appropriation bills. I will start with the budget bills. These bills provide for substantial funding totalling approximately $50,426.2 million. They reflect the broad objective of the government to maintain a strong economy and to provide for a range of initiatives that look to the future in terms of boosting innovation, funding new infrastructure and addressing existing demographic challenges, including the ageing population. Some of these initiatives include funding of $3.4 billion as part of the largest ever package of measures aimed at assisting working families who are bringing up children; measures to boost retirement savings, including enhancements to the co-contributions scheme worth $2.1 billion; funding for carers as well as investments to ensure that the aged care sector is able to provide affordable and quality services to the increasing numbers of older Australians; substantial investments in science and innovation and in road and rail infrastructure that is critical to a growing economy; initiatives for diabetics and the hearing impaired; a focus on Indigenous health; additional subsidised medicines and significant rural health initiatives and additional funding to improve our national security arrangements and enhance our defence capabilities and preparedness. In addition to these initiatives, the budget bills provide record levels of funding to ensure that the Australian community has access to quality and affordable health care and for the education of the next generation. This is consistent with the priority the government places on these fundamental services. Also included in the package of five appropriation bills are two supplementary additional estimates bills. These bills propose expenditure of $787.1 million for important initiatives that can be accommodated this financial year because of the strength of our fiscal position and the effective economic management by the government of the Australian economy generally. More than half the funding in the supplementary additional estimates bills is for a grant payment of $450 million to the Australian Rail Track Corporation for investment in new rail infrastructure projects on the interstate rail system. The balance includes, among other things, provision for $57.6 million in additional payments to the states and territories, $125.7 million in administrative assets and liabilities for initiatives to combat avian flu, $10 million in assistance to Lifeline and a $600,000 contribution towards the Athens 2004 Paralympic Games. I emphasise that the significant level of expenditure proposed in this package of bills is only possible because of the government’s continued strong management of the economy. The Australian economy has seen a long period of sustained, strong growth since 1996. It is forecast to grow by 3.9 per cent in 2004-05. During this long period of expansion, the unemployment rate has been reduced, inflation has been kept low and interest rates have remained close to historical lows. The official interest rate is currently 5.25 per cent. Employment is forecast to grow by 1.75 per cent during 2004-05 and the unemployment rate is forecast to average around 5.75 per cent. It is currently at a low 5.5 per cent. Inflation is forecast to decline to around 1.75 per cent through the year to the June quarter 2005. The Australian economy has been one of the developed world’s top performing economies in recent years, and this is widely recognised. The OECD’s economic outlook for May 2004 forecast that Australia would remain one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD, with growth of 3.8 per cent expected in 2004, easing to 3.5 per cent in 2005. This government has a strong record of economic management. The OECD has endorsed Australia’s fiscal policy record and framework. Out of 27 countries in the OECD, Australia is MAIN COMMITTEE only one of 10 expected to have a positive balanced budget in 2003-04. During 2004-05 the government is forecast to record a budget cash surplus of 0.3 per cent of GDP. This compares well with, for example, the United States and the United Kingdom, both of which are expected to record deficits in 2004-05. The government’s responsible economic management has ensured that the Australian economy has remained robust and buoyant in the face of a challenging international environment, which included the Asian economic crisis of 1997-98 and the more recent economic global downturn. The government has reformed fiscal management to ensure sustainable government finances, with fiscal responsibility enshrined in the Charter of Budget Honesty legislation introduced by this government. It has achieved budget cash surpluses every year since 1997-98, except for a small deficit in 2001-02. In addition, the 2004-05 budget forecasts a cash surplus in 2004-05 of $2.4 billion and healthy surpluses in each of the out years. Since inheriting a $10 billion deficit in 1996, the government has turned the budgetary situation around, accumulating $31 billion in surpluses over its last six budgets, since 1996-98. The government is continuing to reduce the debt burden. As at the release of the budget, net debt is forecast to continue to fall in 2004-05 to around $24.7 billion. This means that the general government net debt position is among the lowest in the OECD. For example, as a share of GDP, net debt is well below that of the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and New Zealand. Net debt will have fallen from 19.1 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to an estimated 2.9 per cent by the end 2004-05. The continued decline in net debt means that net interest payments are expected to fall to $2.9 billion in 2004-05, from a peak of $8.4 billion in 1996-97. The government’s disciplined fiscal management has contributed to maintaining investor confidence and lower interest rates, which encourage strong and stable economic growth. Most opposition members have been critical of the spending and reforms proposed by the government. While I do not have the time to address every such criticism, I would like to take the opportunity to respond to some. Opposition members have overwhelmingly criticised the government’s tax reforms, indicating that only one out of five Australians will benefit. The government cannot be accused of doing nothing for low-income earners. It has delivered significant growth in relation to wages for low-income earners, in addition to employment growth. Average weekly ordinary time earnings have grown by 5.2 per cent in 2001-02 and 6.3 per cent in 2002-03. Furthermore, the budget provides a range of specific measures targeted at assisting low-income earners, including initiatives in the family assistance package, which I will cover in more detail in a moment. These measures come on top of the income tax cuts delivered by the government in the 2003-04 budget and a new tax system. In response to numerous comments from opposition members about the government’s tax record, I point out that the Commonwealth’s tax share has decreased under the current government. To illustrate, the Commonwealth’s general government sector taxation cash receipts as a proportion of GDP have declined from 23.7 per cent in 1996-97 to an estimated 20.9 per cent of GDP in 2004-2005. The overwhelming majority of opposition members have expressed concern that most families will not receive the $600 increase in family tax benefit A because it will be used to offset debt. The opposition needs to be reminded that a debt arises because a family has earned more than they forecast. Having said that, the emerging trend for the 2002-03 reconMAIN COMMITTEE ciliation reveals that there were fewer people with a debt in the last year and more receiving top-ups. Accordingly, the majority of families will not need the $600 to offset debt. It is also erroneous to say that paying off a debt will not bring a substantial benefit to a family. They will be able to use the income that would otherwise have been applied to the debt for other purposes. This is a substantial benefit that will greatly reduce the incidence of debt among recipients. The honourable members for Kingston and Fowler question the benefit of the family assistance package for working women. The changes to the family tax benefit improve rewards for work for lowand middle-income families by relaxing the income test. The taper rate applying to the maximum rate of family tax benefit A will be reduced from 30c for every extra dollar of income to 20c from 1 July 2004. This will significantly reduce effective marginal tax rates and allow low-income families to keep more of any increases in private income they receive. The government has also increased from $1,792 to $4,000 the income threshold for family tax benefit B for the secondary income earner and reduced the family tax benefit B taper rate from 30c to 20c for every extra dollar of income. This will allow the secondary earner to keep more of any increase in private income and provide significant benefits for parents who work part time. Secondary earners who return to work will also be allowed to keep any family tax benefit B payments that they were entitled to prior to returning to the work force. Turning to the maternity payment, some members, including the members for Jagajaga, Burke, Chifley and Isaacs, have criticised it for being in the form of a lump sum and expressed concerns about the effects that may have in terms of teenage pregnancy. On this issue I would highlight the fact that the government scheme includes provision for the $3,000 maternity payment to be delivered in six instalments rather than as a lump sum. This could include a situation where a mother requests it or where a social worker believes that a mother is vulnerable for a range of reasons or at risk of financial problems. The Department of Family and Community Services is currently developing guidelines. I would also note that teenage birth rates in Australia are already low, despite relatively generous welfare and family assistance schemes. Health issues have also been a major theme of the debates, with the vast majority of opposition members expressing concerns in this area. The government is committed to providing health care to all Australians. The new Medicare safety net will protect all Australians against high costs for a whole range of treatments outside hospitals. All Australians will continue to receive free access to public hospitals as a Medicare rebate and affordable medicine through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Medicare will also provide greater assistance to Australians in need, through new measures such as additional money to GPs when they bulk-bill concession card holders and children under 16. Opposition speakers almost without exception expressed concern about bulk-billing rates. These rates have increased by 1.8 percentage points during the first three months of this year, to 68.3 per cent of all GP services. Bulk-billing figures for the March quarter suggest that the $5 bulk-billing incentive introduced on 1 February this year under MedicarePlus has helped increase bulk-billing rates. The bulk-billing rate for Australians aged 65 and over has also increased. In the March quarter the rate jumped 2.9 percentage points, to 76.9 per cent, compared with 74 per cent in the December quarter. This means that more than three out of four visits to the GP for people aged over 65 are bulk-billed. MAIN COMMITTEE In relation to out-of-pocket expenses incurred for services other than those provided in hospital, the government has consistently kept average growth in patient contribution per service under 10 per cent, compared to the previous average growth, which was well over 15 per cent. The year-to-date average annual increase in out-of-pocket costs for such services across all service types is $1.67. In relation to the issue of pneumococcal vaccination, I am pleased to be able to inform all members that the government has recently announced that it will provide free vaccinations to children up to two years of age. The government has negotiated a low price for the childhood vaccine, which will be available for all babies born from 1 January 2005 and all children born since 1 January 2003. The deal struck by the government secures stocks of the vaccine for Australia for the next two years. This is a great achievement for Australian families, given the tight international supplies of this product. The government is also making pneumococcal vaccine free to adults aged over 65 years. The vaccine will be moved to the national immunisation program so that these older Australians can access it free of charge from their health care provider. On the subject of dental health, it seems that I need to remind many opposition members who think that the government is not doing enough in this area-including the members for Melbourne Ports, Hunter, Reid, Bass, Throsby and Burke-that dental services are the responsibility of the state and territory governments. Nevertheless, the government will provide access to treatment under a dental health care plan for those patients who have a dental problem that is significantly adding to the seriousness of their medical condition. It is estimated that over 25,000 people per year will access the dental care plans. Another area of the budget that has come in for considerable criticism from the opposition-including the members for Greenway, Corio, Denison, Bass and Chifley-is aged care. The government is committed to providing older Australians with the support they need to remain independent and in their own homes for as long as possible. It provides substantial support for this purpose through a range of community care programs. The government will provide an extra $2.2 billion over five years-$513 million in 2003-04-through its new Investing in Australia’s Aged Care package. This represents the biggest investment in aged care ever undertaken by an Australian government and builds on significant reforms made since 1997, bringing total spending to an estimated $30 billion over the next four years. A new initiative is a one-off payment of $3,500 per recipient of residential aged care service to assist the aged care sector to meet improved safety and building standards for aged care homes that have been developed and agreed by the industry. In response to the comments made by the honourable member for Chifley about the lack of probity and tests associated with the payment, I note that the funding is in recognition of the requirement for such improvements to be made, whether these improvements have already been made or not. It is expected that any decision to sell or purchase an aged care facility would take into account any upgrades that have or have not been undertaken to meet safety and building standards. In relation to residential aged care, the government has addressed shortand medium-term requirements as a result of the Hogan review. The government intends to address the long-term needs of residential aged care in the future. Many members opposite-including the members for Jagajaga, Melbourne Ports, Batman, Hunter, Fraser and Corio-have also levelled criticism at the government’s funding of educaMAIN COMMITTEE tion and training. In relation to higher education, the Our Universities: Backing Australia’s Future package announced in the 2003-04 budget represented the most significant overhaul of university funding and governance ever undertaken in Australia. The package will provide an additional investment of $2.6 billion in higher education over the next five years, including funding for more than 35,000 new fully funded university places. This budget will also make higher education more affordable by increasing the repayment threshold for HECS to $35,000. Additionally, the budget reforms include a new suite of loans available from 2005. These loans will ensure that students are not disadvantaged or deterred by a lack of financial means to access their chosen higher education course. Over the next 10 years, the government will provide some $11 billion in new support for higher education. Turning to vocational education and training-as discussed by the members for Batman, Grayndler, Cunningham and Lowe, to mention a few-the government will provide $2.1 billion for vocational education and training in 2004 alone, including $725.5 million for new apprenticeships. Statistics indicate that there are now 406,900 Australians training as new apprentices, compared with 141,400 in December 1995. The funding of schools was raised by a number of opposition members. The government will provide schools with a record $31.4 billion over four years from 2005 to 2008. This represents an increase of $5.3 billion, or 23 per cent in real terms, over the current four-year period. Every government and nongovernment school will receive a real increase in funding. Since the commencement of the debate, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services launched the AusLink white paper. This represents a strategic approach to land transport funding within a five-year land transport plan. It incorporates nationally significant road and rail links into a single national land transport network. The network includes existing national highway and Roads of National Importance programs. AusLink goes a significant way to addressing the infrastructure backlog in road and rail, with an additional $3.6 billion to be invested in the national land transport network in the five years to 2008-09. Under AusLink the government will also continue the successful Roads to Recovery program for local and regional roads in the five years to 2008-09, providing funding of $1.2 billion. The government also has a very good story to tell in relation to a whole range of other areas including Telstra, electoral legislation and a number of other matters. However, time precludes my attending to all of these. In conclusion, though, the three budget bills for 2004-05 and the two supplementary additional estimates bills for 2003-04 are important pieces of legislation underpinning the Howard government’s activities and reforms to be introduced over next 12 months or so. I commend the budget bills and the supplementary additional estimates bills to the House. be now read a second time.

218,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (4.00 P.m.),"I raise with the Minister representing the Minister forThe enactments reflect an ever increasing and punitive measure against a migration agent who is charged with the responsibility of assisting his or her client for the purpose of obtaining a visa that is validly entitled to the client. The ultimate power of veto in denying a visa application lies in the hands of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The decision about whether an application is vexatious or grossly unfounded is one that truly rests with the department, which vets the application at the point of lodgement and determines whether that application gives rise to the exercise of a migration power that allows the department to accept the application and the fee. This process therefore relies on a system of pre-assessment. For an application to even be accepted by the department, that application must conform to minimum prescribed requirements-in short, a valid, completed application form, correct fee and appropriate attachment. If it is the minister’s opinion that too many visa applications are vexatious or grossly unfounded then, rather than enact an ever increasing spiral of punitive provisions and strike-out powers, the better course of action would be to make better use of disciplinary provisions already in place. The department bears the brunt of responsibility in exercising veto on the grant of a visa by execution of the relevant migration power. If there is an increase in vexatious and grossly unfounded applications then the minister is directed to the already extensive disciplinary powers available to her under migration law. Resort to increase punitive provisions does not fix the problem of the defective administration found in the department itself. For example, how many audits of migration agents are conducted each year? I put that to the minister. I also put to the minister: what is the process of pre-assessment of agent and principal visa applications by the department prior to them being lodged with the department? The solution here is to increase the funding for assessment and investigation of scurrilous migration agent practices, especially in the closely connected areas of migration agents’ clients’ accounts and the making of bogus applications. In other words, there is a close connection between the vexatious application that is lodged solely for the purpose of extracting a fee from the client and the migration agent’s defective migration agency practice. If the minister is serious about stamping out the lodgement of vexatious and grossly unfounded visa applications, I believe she should turn her attention to four areas in appropriation. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to take these up with the minister: (1) increase compliance and investigative powers over the migration agencies, especially with respect to the management of their clients’ accounts; (2) more vigorously examine the exercise of her non-compellable and discretionary intervention powers under the act; (3) exercise the already existent powers without recourse to ever increasing punitive provisions; and (4) ensure that her department is professional and competent in the administration of migration law through proper and competent exercise of its power of approval, refusal and veto. I would be grateful if the minister could look into those matters for me and report back. Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (4.05 p.m.)-The government takes very seriously the role of ensuring that consumer protection exists and that the few in the migration advice industry who are unscrupulous in their approach are, indeed, rooted out of that industry.

219,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs andistered. The member for Lowe would understand this. I think he has a registered migration agent on his own staff. Being the minister responsible for the part of the Migration Act that looks after migration agents, I do not apologise for trying to toughen up the regime as it impacts on those who seek to exploit people’s money first, rather than give good advice first. I do not for a moment resile from the approach that puts consumers first, particularly those from a non-English-speaking background and those who are perhaps new to Australia and used to, in the society they have come from, a system where they have to buy some form of brokerage with any actions or dealings involving government. It is a serious matter. Some people in those sorts of circumstances-they are new to Australia and used to hiring someone to engage in any activity with government-are being exploited, and we hear about this. It is important that we get that balance right. The vast majority of people who are registered migration agents are happily doing the right thing. The few who are doing the wrong thing are dealt with through the processes of the regulatory authority. I am keeping the pressure on that authority to make certain that they put the consumers first. I think they have heard that language very strongly from me, and they will continue to hear it from me. I think it is also important that we listen to what the member for Lowe has to say. We will look at the technical aspects of his particular request, but at the end of the day the government do not for one second walk away from putting consumers first. comments made by the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. Quite frankly, I think the most recent legislation has the balance right and the predominant concerns should be about people who do launch vexatious complaints and do cause so much difficulty in the industry. My concern in this area relates to the question of professional indemnity insurance and the question of people who are left on the beach when people either disappear or go out of business-and also, in relation to the most recently announced move by the minister, with regard to the regulation of overseas agents. The opposition are more concerned about that than about the fact that a few migration agents might be hit over the head-in most cases deservedly. I would like to talk briefly about a few aspects of the budget in this field. Regarding expenditures for Medicare and social security and the government’s claim that on the expenditure side we will be spending an additional $30 million over four years on promotional measures encouraging humanitarian settlement in regional areas and additional settlement assistance, at estimates I understand that officers of the department were unable to fully clarify the way in which this expenditure will occur or the benefits that these people will receive or not receive in regional Australia. It is our understanding that the majority of them come under the temporary visa provisions and, therefore, would not seem to obtain these benefits. We continue to want clarification of that. We also note again, as we did in the main appropriation debate, that any new spending of $30 million is dwarfed by revenue of $58 million and cuts in other portfolios of $65 million-a net saving to the budget of $93 million over four years in this sector of regional migration. We are also pleased to note the postponement, after widespread criticism, of the suggested implementation of a new client statistical program for migrant resource centres. That elicited, as I said, a degree of criticism in this sector. One would find it rather ridiculous, as seemingly MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
220,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (4.07 P.m.),"I associate myself with the majority ofsuggested initially, that migrant resource centres could not retrieve such basic details as the suburbs of residence of clients or the names and addresses of, for instance, African clients when they might be organising an event for the African client base that they handle. That matter, as I understand it, has gone back to the drawing board. That seems to be a reasonable suggestion, given those criticisms. I turn to English language tuition and the government’s announcement of up to 400 hours of language tuition for the 16to 24-year age group in the refugee sector. The first point we would make is that the phrase ‘up to 400 hours’ should not be read by anyone as actually meaning 400 hours. Under the previous system we had claims of up to an additional 100 hours. Under questioning it was revealed that the average was 68 hours and the amount of hours that were allocated to AMEP service providers had actually been capped so that that would be the outcome. So, when we speak of the previous ‘up to 100 hours’ and the current ‘up to 400 hours’, there must be a degree of concern as to what that will mean in the real world. I guess the other question on this sector is whether designation by age is the way to go-that is, whether it should be based on how old a person is or on their education and their ability in the language. But we certainly welcome any improvement. We also welcome the integrated humanitarian settlement strategy. There are indications that it will do something about the chronic collapse of volunteer numbers in this sector over the last few years. They tell us-and this is not our invention-that a perception of red tape and difficulties in actually participating has led to that. I do not think there is any dispute about the decline in numbers. Also the budget does herald an extension of limited assistance to people sponsored under the special humanitarian program in regard to case management and coordination. That change is extremely welcome. I will leave our response to these matters there. Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (4.12 p.m.)-I thank the member for Reid for his contribution. The matter of statistical collection with migrant resource centres had certainly caused a great deal of concern in the sector, mainly because of the hysteria whipped up by the member for Reid and others. But, of course, we want to continue to work very well with migrant resource centres and the settlement agency partners that we have. We also want to make sure that those who are getting settlement services are those who need them most of all, so we are looking at a way to get a proper collection process in place to adequately reflect the changing face of our migration program and the changing circumstances of settlement needs that come from that. I will go on to the other matter of the additional hours for the 16to 24-year age group under the Adult Migrant English Program, which is a program the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, actually did not know existed and has been saying around the country that we need to have. It has been in place since 1948. It is worth putting on the record that, after 56 years, this program has a lot of experience. Working in with the experience of my department, it has certainly been able to fashion itself to, in particular, the needs of 16to 24year-olds who need additional hours, as well as to those of other people from non-English-speaking and very poor educative backgrounds. Because of the changing face of our migration and refugee program, these people are getting assistance through this budget. With regard to migration agents overseas, I have released, with my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training, a discussion paper on the matter. We are looking for MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
221,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs andideas on how to deal with a very important part of public policy. Obviously, migration agents registered in Australia are able to fall within the remit of the regulatory regime, but there are people in other countries offering advice. With such record numbers of students coming to Australia to study-a very effective export industry-we need to ensure that education agents and those in migration related activities are taken within the regulatory regime, to ensure the right sorts of outcomes so that Australia’s best interests are met. As far as settlement funding overall is concerned, I would again invite the member for Reid to understand that there has been an injection of $100.9 million of new money over four years. This funds a whole-of-government response to a very extensive review of settlement services that coincided with the 25th anniversary of multiculturalism as part of official Australian government policy. This is about targeting the changing needs of the profile, which is constantly changing in our migration program. It is about making sure that what we have done to date is still relevant. While those opposite want to dig back to the past, they have to understand that the program has changed and the response from government has to change. The extra funds which are going in, particularly those going into regional areas, are new and welcome moneys. The way in which all of these moneys are distributed, of course, is always up for the submission of people who seek grants to do particular tasks. But this government does not believe in funding organisations, per se, but funding outcomes. We are not about buying favours, as those opposite have been in the past, and we are not about creating a sense of division and separate development in society. We are about saying, ‘Who needs assistance to get started in Australiawhich people from which backgrounds in which circumstances settling in which areas?’ Where people settle, the funds follow, of course, and yet, despite that particular approach, we are also looking at new regional initiatives to get people to actually move into regional areas. The member for Reid has a very big problem. It is one I will share with you: the member for Reid’s problem is that the premier in his own state does not want people to migrate to Sydney. He does not want more people to settle in the Western suburbs of Sydney. But the New South Wales government has failed to come up with any initiatives that actually help to drive an outcome that is positive and better. This government in fact has provided funds in a regional sense. This government is about investing in people. This government is in fact about changing the perception in the community of how our migration program works. The disgrace for those opposite is contained in this statistic: in 1996 only 35 per cent of people said they supported Australia’s migration program. That figure has now doubled, and that is because this government has been proactive in getting results which reflect the desires, concerns and aspirations of the Australian community, through a migration program that will in fact grow a benefit for Australia. We restored the integrity of our migration program. Along the way, the deliberate investment in individuals has made a difference and will continue to make a difference, providing this government is returned. Wales and his attitudes towards migration to Sydney or whether surveys in 1996-unnamed surveys, unspecified questions-showed a lower level of support for migration are not really pertinent to the question that I asked the minister. My question concerned whether those people that are going to regional Australia through the latest scheme are actually going to receive certain benefits. This was not clarified by the departmental people at the estimates hearings MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
222,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (4.16 P.m.),"Rhetoric about the Premier of New Southand it has not been clarified again by the minister today. Regarding the attitude of the Premier of New South Wales, the minister might not be concerned about the enormous refugee humanitarian intake that comes to Sydney as opposed to the rest of Australia, but it is of interest to us in Western Sydney. Based on the minister for immigration’s recent figures in answer to a question, 20 per cent of the entire refugee humanitarian intake in this country-not just in Sydney-comes to my electorate. That is a matter that concerns people in Western Sydney, and to be so dismissive of it is very questionable. But, as I said, the question we really want answered is whether the people under this latest regional scheme will receive these benefits, because they do appear not to be eligible for them, due to their temporary status. I am aware of this $109 million figure, but the reality is that this is largely a consequence of an increased refugee humanitarian intake. If you take more people in, it costs more. This is a point which the previous Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, made extensively when there was talk by the opposition about whether they would increase the intake. He made the point that it costs the Australian taxpayer more money to have a humanitarian refugee come into the country than it does to have a business migrant or a skilled independent come in. We have seen a variety of economic works about that. So part of this claim that there has been some massive initiative by the government in regard to new settlement measures is fraudulent. It is simply a consequence of the change by the minister for immigration in regard to the intake for the coming year. Those are the two points I wish to look at. We can talk until the cows come home about the Premier of New South Wales and about whether the Premier of Victoria is more interested in migration than the Premier of New South Wales, but one reality is true, and that is that even under the government’s current provisions a number of critics in the industry-not Laurie Ferguson, the member for Reid, but critics of migration and academics-have said that under the current provisions the massive change has been not to rural and regional Australia but, in actual fact, in significant part to Melbourne and Adelaide. Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (4.19 p.m.)-Over four years, $100.9 million of new money will fund the whole-of-government settlement services review outcomes. Funding to the Department of Family and Community Services-the former parliamentary secretary is here-and the Department of Education, Science and Training, as well as my own department, targets key areas of settlement need. These include English language and literacy proficiency, employment and access to early intervention services to help those at risk of not settling successfully, particularly families and youth. The whole-of-government package also recognises the needs of our more established migrant communities with the creation of a new program of $11.6 million over four years to strengthen culturally appropriate aged care through the Department of Health and Ageing. In addition to this, more than $166 million over four years will support the increased humanitarian program of 13,000 places. Through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I invite the member for Reid to understand that the funding is additional; it is new money. The humanitarian program is not driving it; it is new money-the commitment from this government to provide new money. That $166 million over four years will support an increased humanitarian program of 13,000 places and expand existing settlement services. I invite the member for Reid to focus on that. As I said before in MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Appropriation Bill No 2 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 5 2003 2004 Appropriation Bill No 6 2003 2004
223,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs andresponse to his earlier contribution, it is critical to know that, where people settle, settlement services follow. That is an absolute given. What we are trying to do is to drive more people with rural partnerships. It is not about Canberra telling regional communities where people must go. I guess that being from Queensland I feel very finicky about this. This is about saying to regional communities: where do you want people? Do you want people? Do you want to work in partnership with us? Do you want us to help you find people to settle? Do you want the skilled migration that helps to drive that? Do you want the people who accompany skilled migrants who may need settlement services? Communities in regional Australia can grow and use migration to their very best advantage. We want to make sure that all regions feel a sense of the benefit that migration now delivers to this country, compared to the way it was under the previous government. That is what we are trying to do here. We are about saying that the result of having settlement services and more people in regional areas is that all other services will follow those people. That is what this government are about. Ms HOARE (Charlton) (4.22 p.m.)-I rise to speak in this debate because I have some very serious concerns about the Indigenous affairs portfolio. In the budget papers we saw the proposed transfer of all the ATSIS funding to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. We have not yet seen any indication of how the Indigenous programs are going to be administered-what departments they are going to go to and how it is going to affect the staff and the delivery of programs to Indigenous Australians. In the Treasurer’s budget speech we did not hear one reference to Indigenous Australians, even though it is an area where huge change is taking place. A major concern of mine is that there seems to be some confusion within the government relating to the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the transferring of ATSIS programs to mainstream departments. Legislation to abolish ATSIC went through the House of Representatives a couple of weeks ago and was just yesterday referred in the Senate to a Senate inquiry. To my mind, that means that the ATSIC legislation which has been put forward by this government has not yet passed the parliament. It is not yet law, so I understand that to mean that the ATSIC Act of 1989 still exists and is still in operation. That raises some questions about the staff of ATSIC and ATSIS. To my understanding, if there is a commissioner whose contract comes under the ATSIC Act 1989 then that contract continues unless that commissioner is sacked under that act. Remember that the current legislation has not yet passed through the Senate. That brings me to the concern about staff employed by ATSIC commissioners, such as the PAs to the ATSIC commissioners. As I understand it, their contracts are aligned to the contract of the commissioner. So if the commissioner’s contract does not expire then the personal assistant to the commissioner cannot be sacked. There is another group of staff I am concerned about-the research officers for the commissioners. I understand they are actually employed by ATSIS, but again their contract is related to the term of the contract of the commissioner and as such they should be retained as research officers for the commissioner until that commissioner is sacked-legally-by the government. That is not something that we in the Labor Party want to happen. However, we do have concerns about the legalities of the position that the government is currently taking in relation to administrative arrangements for ATSIS staff and ATSIC staff. MAIN COMMITTEE Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, you may not be aware of the huge shemozzle that happened last week with these staff. I know one research officer-and I presume this happened to all research officers around the country-on Thursday at 10 a.m. received a notice of termination from the acting CEO of ATSIC, Mick Gooda. The email did not have a subject title. It said: Notice of termination I wish to advise that your employment as a non-ongoing employee with ATSIC will be terminated with effect from close of business Wednesday, 30 June 2004. A notice of termination is attached. How do you think any of us would feel in that position when we received a notice of termination like that? Then, two hours later, at 12.03 on Thursday, 10 June there was an email with the subject ‘Incorrectly sent termination notice’. It read: All, Apparently some of you have been accidentally sent termination notices via email. This was due to a glitch in the mail merge process. These are people’s lives that we are playing with; these are people’s careers that are being played with. The administrative arrangements are not in place, the guidelines are not clear and the legalities are not clear on how these staff are affected. We really need the government to come clean, particularly when we are looking at the emotional and career turmoil of these people, and we need to find out from the government what it is that they are actually doing. (Time expired) Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (4.27 p.m.)-I thank the member for Charlton. The Leader of the Opposition-her leader-was the first person to announce the abolition of keep it going. Again the Labor Party are showing themselves to be really caught up on detail and failing to understand how things work. In fact, the member for Charlton’s own contribution has failed to understand that, where the money goes, the functions tend to follow. The fact is that we really do not need to see the bill passed to get on with the job that we are currently doing, which is about getting results for the first peoples of Australia, the first Australians, and about getting the right result. The fact is that, under the member for Charlton-and I presume that this is the latest Labor Party policy on the run-Labor would prefer to see $120,000 spent per week to keep the would be $56,000 per week in the commissioners’ wages alone. Think about how, every fortnight, a new house could be built in remote Australia for Aboriginal people. Think about how every month water supply systems could be put into place. But the Labor Party want to keep their mates-or people that they want as their mates-employed and career paths created at the expense of the people that are actually meant to be served by what ATSIC, which was their idea, was set up to do. ATSIC is a failed experiment. These are not my words; these are the words of the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Australian Labor Party. Yet the member for Charlton has come in here this afternoon and she is against her leader. I am sure the caucus will sort her out.

224,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs andBut it is a bit of a no-brainer to work out where all the different aspects of current ATSIC functions will end up. The Indigenous media organisations understand that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts are going to be looking after Indigenous-specific media grant programs. They would realise, of course, that people like FaCS would look after community housing and infrastructure. They would understand that health services would be further entrenched within the Department of Health and Ageing and that the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs will continue to have an oversight role in so many other aspects of what is going on. These matters are being sorted out. In fact, the administrative orders are in the process of being finalised. They will go to the Governor General for royal assent. They will be disclosed fully and openly to all Australians, including the first Australians. It is pretty easy to work out what is going on. The Australian Labor Party cannot have it both ways. They cannot have their leader say that ATSIC should be abolished and members of their caucus running around saying ATSIC should stay. The Labor Party have to come clean on this. The program changes do not require legislation. We are proceeding. For instance, the ministerial task force met today. The commissioners will certainly continue to get paid, and the Labor Party are happy for that $120,000 a week. That complete waste of money is how they approach a lot of things and it seems to be their latest approach to this. At the end of the day, the Labor Party have to account to the Australian people why they are delaying the inevitable-why they are delaying real results for the first Australian by digging their heels in at the caucus level in defiance of their own leader. That is what the Labor Party have to explain. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country want change. Only 21 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people actually voted in the ordinary, everyday first Australians. If the member for Charlton and the member for Lingiari, who I suspect is probably going to pop up and do his own thing as well in a moment, want to get up here in defiance of their leader then they are standing for a system which has stood in the way of resources hitting the ground to assist the first Australians to ensure that they have dignity and equality of opportunity. They are standing in the way of a system that will force the secretaries of each government department that takes on these Indigenous specific roles to enforce the outcome through their own department’s systems. It is no good to say that mainstreaming, as they try to dismiss it, has been tried before and failed. What has never been done before is that secretaries to departments and their performance pay arrangements are tied together in getting real outcomes-as they should be-for the first Australians. exactly what I want to do. Despite the semantic rubbish coming from the minister opposite, let me ask one salient question: does he have any idea of what the unit cost is of housing our remote communities? it costs to provide housing in regional Australia. Answer me this: how much additional dollars are in this budget for Indigenous housing across Australia? Answer the question.

How much money is going to Indigenous roads across Australia this year and in the out years? How much money is going to Indigenous communities-in particular, the Northern Territory-to promote roads in Indigenous communities and roads in unincorporated areas? I can tell you the answer: zilch! Let us stop this rubbish and let us start talking about a couple of things which you need to respond to, Minister. Firstly, given that the ATSIC bill has not passed the Senate and given that it will not pass the Senate until at least the Senate committee reports, which we understand will be the end of October, how will the delegations that the ATSIC commission currently has be performed? What responsibilities under the ATSIC Act will the ATSIC commissioners have into the future? What responsibilities will they be asked to perform? How will their budget be developed? I notice there is an allocation for ATSIC in the budget papers but, of course, that presumes the expiration of the commissioners’ roles. How will the statutory responsibilities which they have under the act be performed and budgeted for? What budget appropriations have been made for that purpose? In the case of their staff, what communications-if anyhas the minister and/or his office had with the ATSIC and ATSIS offices about the termination of the commissioner of staff and the ATSIC budget for 2004-05? Will the minister approve the answer that question, Minister? In the Senate estimates hearings, the Acting CEO of ATSIC, Mick Gooda, gave an undertaking to research officers that they will stay on for the tenure of their commissioners-and that is on page 49 of Hansard for the particular day concerned. This clause was also written into their individual employment contracts. Has the Acting CEO misled the parliament? What is the government’s view about the responsibility of the public service, in this case the CEO of ATSIC, to respond to the concerns of the commissioners? No-one is asking for you to maintain ATSIC well into the future. We agree that ATSIC has to be replaced. But we want to put a process in place concerned with ensuring that Indigenous Australians are properly consulted about what any replacement body for ATSIC should look like. We do not accept the propositions underlying the legislation and, indeed, your budget. Let me ask you another question, Minister, and see if you can respond to this one. A number of Indigenous coordination centres are to be set out across Australia. There is not to be one in Darwin. Can you explain to me how the concerns and needs of Indigenous people in Darwin-some 10,000 of them-will be met if there is no Indigenous coordination centre? Where will their services come from in terms of Indigenous specific programs and programs which would otherwise be operating in these Indigenous coordination centres across Australia? Minister, this is a serious question. There are serious budgetary implications from the mere fact that this legislation has not passed the parliament. You have made a number of assertions about what Labor’s policy is or is not, but what you have not done-and what I dare say you will not be able to do-is outline to us in detail what the implications are for the budget and the appropriations we are discussing in terms of ATSIC under the Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs portfolio, the appropriations made to ATSIC, the approMAIN COMMITTEE",222,Atsic Election So The Atsic Commissioners Were Hardly Representative Of The Views Of The

231,Mr Snowdon,"Then you might tell me how much additional resources are going to Inpriations made to ATSIS and the other functions for effective delivery of policy advocacy support and program service to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. How will the commissioners be serviced, given that they still exist? How do you ensure that they can carry out their functions and statutory obligations? How will they be assured that they will get proper advice from their personal staff if you have sacked them? This is a major concern. It is not some frivolous bit of administrative detail. We are passing a budget here where allocations are made for specific purposes. It is clear that those purposes cannot be met because this bill has not passed. (Time expired) Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (4.37 p.m.)-The member for Lingiari has also caught the Leader of the Opposition’s disease on detail. This year we will spend $2.9 billion on a variety of programs. In fact, that is 39 per cent more than we spent in 1996. That is 39 per cent more than when the member for Lingiari lost his seat at the 1996 federal election-and that is a lot more than zilch. We know that the Labor Party are not real good on numbers because, when they left office in 1996, they said it was a budget surplus and of course there was this massive $10.5 billion deficit, so they do not understand. The ATSIC commissioners will have little to do. They will need to put an expenditure forecast to the minister. But, in their rush to brief the member for Lingiari, they have so far failed to do that. We will be keeping their funding to a minimum until they do what they have been asked to do. With regard to Indigenous coordination centres, a network of 22 will replace the existing ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services’ regional office to coordinate service delivery in regional and remote areas. They will generally be located where the current ATSIC regional offices are. So that is probably why there will not be one in Darwin under this proposal, if that is what the member for Lingiari is trying to say. It is fair to say that our proposal means that there will be an Indigenous coordination centre in capital cities, with a local manager and a state manager. The member for Lingiari is again verbalising this whole point and does not want to understand it. As far as matters to do with specific funding and specific areas of assistance to the first Australians are concerned, we are pleased that the proportion of Indigenous children who stay on at school through year 12 has increased from 29.2 per cent in 1996 to 39.1 per cent in 2002-03. What we are about is in fact liberating the individual initiative of each of these people, making certain that the first Australians are no longer left behind. The member for Lingiari wants to talk today about separate development. The member for Lingiari should look those words up in a thesaurus-he will see a word that he will not want to see. We do not stand for separate development. We want to see the first Australians given opportunities to be very much a part of things in every possible way. What we want to do is make certain of that-as we have done. Since the 1995-96 budget we have more than doubled in real terms the funding for Indigenous specific health programs. It stands at more than $280 million, which is more than double what it was in 1995-96. But, at the end of the day, we know that these 17 research officers that the member for Lingiari is currently concerned about will provide policy and research assistance to the ATSIC commissioners until 30 June. Nine of the people filling these positions are in fact on loan. They will simply transfer to other Australian Public Service positions, so they are not being sacked-the member for Lingiari has got that wrong as well. The other eight are on temporary MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Atsic Budget If It Makes Allowances For The Continuation Of Commissioner Staff Can You

The research officers were provided from around July last year to assist commissioners in providing their policy advisory role in relation to ATSIS. ATSIS will lose the vast majority of its function on 30 June next. Only a shell will exist-as a result of Labor’s delaying tactics-which is going to cost $120,000 a week to keep a bunch of people doing nothing. I do not know what the cost of building a house in the deepest darkest parts of the member for Lingiari’s electorate might happen to be, but if it is $240,000, $360,000 or $480,000-whatever multiple of $120,000 he would like to come up with-he can account to the Australian people about exactly why it is he wants to spend that money to keep people doing nothing. For the member for Lingiari and, indeed, for the record, let me quote the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, the member for Lingiari’s leader.

I am looking forward to the honourable parliamentary secretary’s response, because I know that for a long time he was the spokesperson on child support matters when he was in opposition. I think he applied himself conscientiously. He is now responsible for the Child Support Agency. That is the agency that the Auditor-General has just found is making shocking decisions in relation to cases in the ACT and New South Wales. There is an appalling Auditor-General’s report in relation to the Child Support Agency. He is the responsible person.

238,Mr Price,"How much, Parliamentary Secretary, have we got in this budget to impleI want to ask the parliamentary secretary when we will get a government response. You put enormous pressure on that committee and it delivered the goods. It was not wedge politics and it was not Labor ganging up and refusing to listen to coalition members or vice versa. That committee report was in the best traditions of this parliament. It included a whole raft of recommendations. It came out on 29 December, and we have not had a government response. I have received a lovely letter from the parliamentary secretary, saying they have implemented some of the nice administrative matters that we recommended, but it does not mention one policy item-not one thing that will provide relief to the clients of the agency. Where is the tribunal? I know that, strictly speaking, it is not within the portfolio. But it was a unanimous recommendation. It was a sea change for people who are facing separation and divorce, for those who want contact with their children and do not get it and for all those who commit suicide at Christmas time because they do not get access to their children. What has this government done with the unanimous bipartisan parliamentary report? They have not had the decency to bring down a government response. They have not had the common courtesy or decency to do that. All they have done is fuel the expectations of people who are looking to the parliament, the Prime Minister and this government for some relief, hope and change. IfI have got it all wrong and somehow in the budget there is $650 million to implement the recommendations-or even if there is $300 million, $200 million or $100 million-I will stand up and apologise, but the parliamentary secretary knows as well as I do that there is not one dollar. There is zero. The callous indifference of members of the executive-and we have two of them here-is just unbelievable. One million children were involved in this committee inquiry-and that is one million children who want to have, by and large, better parents or the opportunity to have access to both parents-and what has this government done? It has built up expectations-a parliamentary reference was announced by no-one else other than the Prime Minister-but absolutely nothing has been done and not one dollar has been put into the budget. And they talk about wanting us to announce our policies and plans! (Extension of time granted) As my colleague has encouraged me to do, I am appealing to the parliamentary secretary, because he knows how hard it is, what a difficult subject this is and how difficult it is to get bipartisan support. This committee report, unlike other parliamentary committee reports, had the real prospect of cross-party support for implementation of the recommendations. I want to place on record my appreciation of Kay Hull, the chairperson of that committee. I want to express my appreciation of all the members who served on that committee, and I am pleased that the honourable member for Franklin is here, because he has deep views. I am asking the parliamentary secretary not to be trite and not to take any cheap points, because he has been involved in this issue for too long-he would only disappoint himself and his own reputation. Getting reform in this area is terribly difficult. No-one knows that more than me. This has been a real window of opportunity. I know that the honourable member for Franklin would approach other committee members, saying, ‘How is the government going? How is the response going? Are we going to see some action?’, and I am happy to put on record that I think they have fought very hard for their own report. I do not quibble about that one bit. Each time there would be an expectation given. We would be told that it might be next week or we would get the response that it would be in the budget or that there was another cabinet meeting or that there was some trouble with MAIN COMMITTEE the tribunal-that it was unconstitutional. We heard all these things. Even after the budget we were told: ‘Yes, we’re expecting it in a couple of weeks.’ As I said, there are a million children-a million of our future citizens, a million young people-who have the potential to make a magnificent contribution to this country. If you cannot do it for the parents, who actually have a vote, do it for the children. Be frank with us. Tell us what is in the budget. Tell me if I am wrong. I ask the parliamentary secretary to tell me if I am wrong, and I will get up and apologise. I am happy to apologise. Sometimes I make mistakes, but I could not find anything in it. But I do make mistakes, and I am happy to stand up and say I am wrong. But I say to the parliamentary secretary: these people, and particularly these children, deserve an honest response, and you have to start meeting their expectations. If you are not going to meet their expectations, get up and say so. Get up and say, ‘Look, it was a wonderful opportunity but it was just too hard.’ Or get up and say, ‘When we were framing the budget, these million children did not come within our radar. In our priorities they just didn’t rate.’ I can accept that. I understand the argy-bargy of a budget. Mind you, this is a budget where we are spending $6 billion before the end of the financial year and some $52 billion in all. But, if those people did not rate as far as the budget is concerned, come and say so. If they were not a priority, come and say so. I must say that the failure of the government to act has made it harder for us. But I know what the honourable member for Franklin is like. The honourable member for Franklin is going to dig in on this issue. There is no way he is going to let go. Whatever happens after the next election, he will be back here in this chamber saying, ‘What about the one million children?’ If we are in government, he will be demanding action. But I have to say that this has been hitherto an absolute missed opportunity. These opportunities for bipartisan action in an area that I concede is difficult do not come by every night, every month or every year. Yet what was greeted with great apprehension in the Labor Party at the start resulted, we felt, in a tremendous outcome-a committee doing the right thing and really trying to set the path for future reform and immediate benefit for parents and, more particularly, for one million children. (Time expired) cern by the member for Chifley. As he rightly stated, I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, and this is probably the most contentious issue that has been put in the lap of federal members of parliament, I would imagine, in the 100 or so years of federal parliament. We had an extraordinary number of submissions-1,700 plus, some of them going to 200 pages. Each of the 10 members had to plough through those 1,700 submissions. We had 55 non-sitting days from when the Prime Minister gave the commission to Kay Hull, the member for Riverina, and we were expected to give up virtually every waking moment away from this place, away from our electorates, to wander around rural and remote areas of Australia-because we decided to stay away from the capital cities. We had people in tears. We heard evidence in camera. We heard of sexual abuse. We heard of suicide.

As the member for Chifley rightly states, this was a bipartisan report. We had people across the spectrum from the Left to the Right. The report is a credit to the 10 members. I remember the very first day of the inquiry. We were travelling towards Geelong for our first hearing and there was a violent disagreement. It was almost a case of turning the bus back because it was a situation of them and us. But we persevered and we struggled through. You can read the transcripts of those many hearings around Australia and learn of the anguish of peoplegrandparents, parents and young children-in this whole thing. As the member for Chifley says, it involves one million children. There are 800,000 children who only see their noncustodial parents one day a year. This is a huge problem and, if there is not any money in the budget to deal with it, we have created an enormous expectation. If we have not delivered any money, we are going to cause absolute mayhem. Setting up a tribunal will only deal with future divorces. We still have all the tens of thousands who will have to go through the new regime. They have gone through the Family Court and spent up to $100,000 to get every second weekend and half the school holidays and, as the committee were told today, every fortnight there is a mass migration of up to 800,000 children in Australia going from one parent to another. Every fortnight, 800,000 children move from one place to another, in order to be part of the Family Court process. I would be interested to know what the honourable member opposite, the parliamentary secretary, thinks about this. I respect him, because I know he has a concern about this. As the honourable member for Chifley said, this is not a trite thing. We are talking about people. It is interesting to note that the honourable member for Riverina has come into the chamber. She is probably doing some work filling in for the whip. But we need to know what is going to happen with this report. As the member for Chifley rightly stated, we have generated enormous expectations out in the community, and the system is flawed. In the remaining time left to me in this speech, I would like to pay tribute to the work done by the honourable member for Chifley in this area. Over a long period of time, he has been trying to get this whole issue of the Family Court and the Child Support Agency-Centrelink nexus sorted out and resolved one way or another. IfI do nothing else in this place, being part of this parliamentary report, Every picture tells a story, will be my badge of honour, it really will. I look forward to the parliamentary secretary’s response. tee who worked on this report, Every picture tells a story. It is a great report. I was not part of that committee, but I do understand and acknowledge the hard work that every single member contributed to the report. TodayI want to put a few points to the parliamentary secretary and the minister in relation to the family tax benefit system and the method of payment. In particular, I want to refer to the $600 payment that is being bandied about around the country. I also want to talk briefly about the problems associated with Centrelink and the system that is being administered by the government. To this day, I still cannot understand how it is possible that a system which is so obviously flawed and so obviously does not deliver what it is intended to deliver cannot be completely reviewed and fixed. I have never had a satisfactory response to that question. MAIN COMMITTEE",227,Atsic Board But That Sort Of Situation Appeals To The Member For Lingiari
242,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (4.58 P.m.),"I open by commending all the members of the commitIt is a system that families, no matter how hard they try and how much effort they put in, just do not seem to be able to get right. They do not get it right because of the formula. The basis upon which their income is calculated really means that by the end the year when the final calculation is done and all the payments are recounted the majority of families actually have a debt to the government. This is not a fair system. There must be a way that the government can fix this system so that people can be paid on a fortnightly basis the money they are entitled to receive, based on their circumstances at that point in time, so that there is no debt accumulated. I will give the parliamentary secretary one particular example of why this system is so unfair and so unjust. This took place in my electorate. It is just one example. A young woman in my electorate, who is married with a couple of kids, decided only a few months ago that she wanted to return to work. I think that is a pretty noble thing to do and something that we would all support in this place. I cannot see that the government would not support that either. Being a fairly clever woman, she decided that before launching down this path-accepting a job offer and getting fully engaged in the work force-she would check with her local Centrelink office and find out what impact her employment would have on her current circumstances. To her absolute horror, she was told that if she took up a job next week-and she had been on Centrelink family payments for a number of years-she would suddenly have a massive debt to the government. I will not go into all the details, because they are not so important. The important thing is the broad concept of what took place. If this person were to remove herself from the welfare system-if she stopped getting any payments from the government through the welfare system and, instead, went and worked and contributed through the tax system-a debt would be imposed on her. But, if she stayed in the system, not only would she not incur the debt but she would continue to be paid. I found that odd, so we did a bit of checking and a bit of research, and we found it was true and accurate. She had been paid a certain amount of money, based on the reality that she was not employed and was therefore entitled to a certain amount of money-money which, at the time, she was rightfully due. But, if she took employment, she would have to pay that money back, because it was recalculated and averaged out throughout the year and a repayment would have to be made to the government. She was actually told, ‘You’re better off not taking the job’-nudge-nudge, wink-wink, under the table-‘and staying on family tax benefits. Get your full entitlements. Don’t go and get a job, don’t contribute to the economy and don’t contribute to the tax system. Stay on welfare, at least until the next financial year, because then it all zeros itself out and you do not have to pay back that money that you have been rightfully paid and you can start with a clean slate on 1 July.’ I found that appalling. I cannot understand why this government, the minister and the parliamentary secretary, who is actually here listening, would accept that that is a fair and equitable system and that that is how the government should reward people who are trying to better themselves, get out of welfare, get back to work and do those types of things. That particular case for me really crystallised a whole range of problems that exist in the system, and I would really like to hear a clear, good, concise explanation from the parliamentary secretary, when he responds, of why that situation is acceptable. If it is not acceptable, what is the government going to do about it? MAIN COMMITTEE ber for Oxley regarding the $600 payment. I would like the parliamentary secretary to answer a couple of questions regarding the $600. According to figures I have from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the average Tasmanian wage is $33,186 a year. The figures compiled in November 2003 show that Tasmanians receive the second lowest pay packet of any state or territory in Australia, earning just $2 a week more than South Australian workers. Figures compiled show that 88 per cent of Tasmanians did not earn enough to benefit from the proposed tax cuts by the federal Treasurer. It goes on to state: We can also now confirm that only 38% of Tasmanian families are currently in receipt of either Family Tax BenefitA or B assistance. I would be interested if the honourable parliamentary secretary could assure me that those figures are true, because if they are and 88 per cent of Tasmanians earn less than $52,000, we are seeing only 12 per cent of Tasmanian families benefiting from the rise in the threshold for payable tax. tells a story. I ask the parliamentary secretary: has his attention been drawn to recommendation 29 of the report that says there should be proper external review of Child Support Agency decisions? I am on the record as saying that I support the current system of internal review, because it replaced the necessity to go to the Family Court if you wanted a variation. I thought that was an innovation, but I have consistently said-and I am on the public record as saying this-that Child Support Agency decisions, just like Centrelink decisions, should be properly reviewed by a process of external review, similar to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I am pleased to say that this was a recommendation of the committee. In light of the Ombudsman’s report about the decisions in New South Wales and the ACT, would the parliamentary secretary concede that this actually adds further strength to the committee’s recommendations? I seek his assurance that he is prepared to take a fresh look at it. I have some questions on the Notice Paper, but I would be indebted to the parliamentary secretary if he could advise whether or not the department has in fact prepared all submissions required of it in response to this report for the consideration of government. I also want to raise the situation of the St Marys Centrelink office. I must say that the junior minister has monstered me in the press somewhat. It came to my attention that a public notice was put up by the St Marys Centrelink manager that said they would take no further new applications at St Marys and that people had to travel to either Penrith or Mount Druitt, and I took exception to this. But Mr Anthony said that the notice put up by the manager did not exist. In fact, he has insisted that people can put in applications for disability pensions, blind pensions, unemployment benefits et cetera. They can actually go into St Marys, but they will not be processed as fast as they would at the respective offices. These offices are allegedly centres of excellence. I do not support the two-tier system that the minister is developing. I ask the parliamentary secretary: in this year’s budget, how many Centrelink offices are not going to be centres of excellence? What is the proportion? Is it fifty-fifty? Will 50 per cent be centres of excellence and 50 per cent not be? I know that I am losing staff from St Marys. Could he tell me exactly how many staff? Can he confirm that a centre of excellence-allegedly the Mount Druitt office-is going to be reduced in size by 50 MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Atsic Board But That Sort Of Situation Appeals To The Member For Lingiari

I have never been informed; I have never, ever been informed. I am a phone call away or she is free to drop into my office and talk to me about it.

The minister confirmed that the $600 put forward by the government would be indexed and that it would not proportionally, or in any other manner, be lost; that there would not be any clawback of the $600; that the integrity of that $600 would be maintained. I have actually gone and had a look at this to see specifically what changes have taken place. I ask the parliamentary secretary if he wants to make himself aware or informed, if he is not-I am assuming that he would be-about the change from the wage based indexation to the CPI based indexation. The minister was specifically asked: has there been any change in the indexation? He clearly said: no-no change at all. But when I actually go to the legislation, I find-I will put this on the record-in 6(7)(i) of schedule 4 formula that it says to omit the formula and substitute with CPC rate by 16.6 per cent et cetera. To me that indicates that there is a change, because they are omitting the old formula and substituting a new formula. Therefore, there is an indexation change, and it is quite substantial. It is from wage based indexation to CPI based indexation. What that means in simple terms is that, over a period of about five to seven years, the $600 will be completely eroded. That was a question specifically put to the minister. The minister gave a very specific answer: no. SoI would be very interested to hear what the parliamentary secretary’s answer to that specific question is. It was also in another place, in 7(7)(iii) of schedule 4 formula: omit the formula and substitute CPC rate by 21.6 per cent. So in two places we specifically asked about indexation and the minister said: no, it had not changed; no, there would not be clawback. He gave his guarantee, but when we actually go MAIN COMMITTEE",230,Atsic Board But That Sort Of Situation Appeals To The Member For Lingiari

248,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (5.10 P.m.),"I just want to raise one specific issue on top of the onesand check, it is a matter of: don’t listen to what they say; have a look at what they do. Here it is in black and white. Either the parliamentary secretary can explain that their own legislation is actually wrong and they have got this wrong, or perhaps the minister got it wrong. So the question is: who is wrong-the legislation or the minister? Services) (5.13 p.m.)-I thank the members for Franklin, Oxley and Chifley for their contributions on the appropriation bills in the consideration in detail stage in the Main Committee. I would remind them-the member for Chifley would be well aware of this, being a veteran of the House-that this is not estimates; this is not question time; this is the consideration in detail stage in the Main Committee when members make speeches. The member for Chifley knows that full well, but he has taken the opportunity this afternoon to pepper me with questions to do with the Child Support Agency and Centrelink because, knowing me as well as he has now over many years, he thinks I might fall for the ruse and, out of the goodness of my heart, answer all the questions that he has asked me about the Child Support Agency and Centrelink. I will-because I have great regard for the member for Chifley, especially his genuine desire to improve and his understanding of the Child Support Agency-try to answer as many of his questions as I can, but without obviously giving anything away as he would expect me to do. The report, Every picture tells a story, was a very good report, and I congratulate the member for Riverina-for her chairmanship of it-and all the members of the inquiry, including the member for the Chifley, who all put in a huge effort in a very short space of time. What the members of the committee and the parliament may not know is that one of the reasons the report came about is that I raised the issue of rebuttable presumption of joint physical custody in the party room on a number of occasions. I raised it on a number of occasions as the Chairman of the Backbench Attorney-General’s and Justice Committee, and it was one of the reasons the inquiry was called. There are many other backbenchers who have raised Child Support Agency issues over a long time, but members of the House will remember that one of the very specific inquiry topics was the rebuttable presumption of joint physical custody, as opposed to every aspect of the administration of the Child Support Agency. That was included as a consequence of my raising the matter in the party room. SoI welcomed the calling of that inquiry, and I was surprised at the very short space of time that was given to committee to come up with their report. I congratulate them on the incredible effort they must have put in in order to be able to digest the submissions and also hold the public hearings that they held in order to come up with their very good report. The government is considering the report and will respond in due course. There are many aspects of the report that have been very favourably received by the government. There are some that are very expensive and some that in a policy sense are a large departure from past philosophy with respect to the Child Support Agency. I will comment on one of those in particular. There was a theme running through some of the recommendations of the report that the cost of children should be investigated and this should be the basis of payments under the child support maintenance program. Many people in the government and the public would argue with that, because the philosophy of the Child Support Agency for the last 15 years has been that children should be able to continue having the standard of living that they would have been able to have had their parents stayed together. MAIN COMMITTEE",231,Atsic Board But That Sort Of Situation Appeals To The Member For Lingiari
249,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and CommunitySo there are some big philosophical questions with respect to the Child Support Agency: do you fund children on a subjective cost basis-how much they are going to cost, as though they are chattels-or do you say that it is not the children’s fault that the marriage has broken down and therefore they should be able to continue to have the standard of living they would have had had the marriage not broken down? These are big issues and that is why the government has not yet responded to the report. I can assure the members for Chifley and Franklin that the party room is constantly abuzz with requests for responses from the government to the report. I doubt very much that some of the members-the members for Macarthur, Macquarie, Dickson, Riverina and others-will rest until a response is received. This is in stark contrast, of course, to what happened when the Labor Party was in office. As the member for Chifley would well remember, reports sat on the shelf for many years then, without responses. I well remember the member for Chifley’s excellent report on the Child Support Agency which was produced in 1995 or thereabouts. It was certainly brought in during the first parliament that I was here, and I entered the House in 1993. It had about 500 or 600 pages. It was quite extraordinary. It was very comprehensive. Some aspects of it were picked up by the Labor government of the time. Much of it was supported by the coalition then in opposition. Much of it was never picked up by the Labor government and should have been. (Extension of time granted). Much of the member for Chifley’s report should have been adopted and it sits today unadopted. I respect very much his genuine interest in the CSA, because of the genuine effort that he put in in that parliament. I also respect the member for Franklin and the others who took part in that inquiry. In terms of what benefit some people who are clients of the Child Support Agency may receive as a consequence of this budget, much of the discussion from the members for Franklin, Oxley and Chifley did not touch on the appropriations, but we will let that go given the goodnatured practice of the chamber that we are in. But certainly those separated parents who have more than 10 per cent of the custody of their children will benefit from the changes to the family tax benefit part A-the bonus that is to be received this week or next week and then the ongoing increase of $600 per child that will start from 1 July. So CSA parents will immediately feel an impact from this budget and that will be as a consequence of the changes to family tax benefits. There is also $67.4 million in the budget for the upgrading of the call centres for Centrelink and the Child Support Agency, which will help the agencies to continue to deliver services to their clients. They will also benefit from that. I think the bipartisanship that the members for Chifley and Franklin talked about is very real with respect to the Child Support Agency. There is certainly no politics in the CSA. It is probably one of the most traumatic areas for members of parliament to deal with. We all have our stories of the horrendous situations that some people find themselves in, both payers and payees, as a consequence of family breakdown. Unfortunately, members of parliament do not hear of any happy stories or stories of mutual agreement; we only ever get the negative outcomes. As a consequence, many of us have a distorted view of the CSA. After 10 years, over 50 per cent of clients of the Child Support Agency now self-regulate their payments. So while the CSA does 90 per cent of assessments of people from broken marriages, the payee and payer in 52 per cent of cases actually send the money to each other rather than requiring the Child Support Agency to compulsorily acquire resources. That is a MAIN COMMITTEE huge improvement. But we as members of parliament would never hear about that because we only ever get the very unhappy stories. So there is a bipartisan view on it. I can assure the members for Chifley and Franklin that the government will respond to the report by the whole committee at an appropriate time. The Ombudsman’s report has also been recently handed down. As the parliamentary secretary responsible for the Child Support Agency’s administration-I was the very lucky one who was given that job in the reshuffle-that has come to me. I can assure the member for Chifley that we will respond to the Ombudsman’s report in due course. Mr Albanese interjectingcapacity the party chooses. There are a number of recommendations in the Ombudsman’s report. The CSA is certainly not fighting any of those recommendations. The Child Support Agency is quite happy to adopt most of the recommendations. The government is considering the report and will hand down a response to that very soon. All Centrelink and Child Support Agency offices are under review all the time. Member for Chifley, you would know that. Circumstances change. I can assure you that the CSA offices in Western Sydney are under review, but there is no suggestion at all that they will be closed in the near future. There are particular circumstances in Penrith, which you might well know about, Member for Chifley. The staff are fully aware of them, and we have been working closely with the union to try to make sure that clients and staff of the CSA are happy. I can neither confirm nor deny any of your many questions with respect to particular offices, and you would not expect me to do so. As for informing members of parliament, I can assure you that there is no suggestion that the CSA or Centrelink have been told not to inform Labor MPs of changes. Certainly that would be my understanding. I agree with you: these things are not partisan. A Labor member of parliament is equal to a Liberal or National member of parliament in terms of the services that are delivered in their particular electorate. They should be properly informed and should understand the circumstances. (Extension of time granted) There is another issue to do with the Child Support Agency and the family tax benefit. The member for Franklin talked about the expectation that has been raised by the report of the whole committee. That is true: an expectation has been raised by that. It is an area where every person believes that their particular cause is the most important and must be adopted. The government hope to meet and fulfil as many of those expectations as we can. You would know, because you came in in 1993 as well, that the government can only do so much to make people happy. But we will do as much as we can. You also asked about the family tax benefits and the impact on Tasmania. I would be very cautious about accepting your figures. It would surprise me enormously if 38 per cent of Tasmanians were entitled to receive family tax benefit part A. It does not really jell with your figure on the number of people on low incomes in Tasmania. Families on low incomes are the ones who are eligible for family tax benefit part A, so I would have expected the figure to be closer to 90 per cent of low-income families in Tasmania being entitled to family tax benefit part A. Perhaps that is something you might like to take up with either the department or Senator Patterson’s office. She is the minister responsible. I cannot on the spot here answer MAIN COMMITTEE",232,Atsic Board But That Sort Of Situation Appeals To The Member For Lingiari
250,Mr Pyne,"You may well say so, Member for Grayndler. I am happy to serve in whateverthose questions, but they are on the record now and I am sure that the minister’s office will follow that up. As to family tax benefit part B, we got all of the usual rhetoric from the member for Oxley and a bit from the member for Franklin about family tax benefit parts A and B. The reality is that family tax benefit part A is about consumers or taxpayers making their own decisions about their income and self-regulating. The reality is that the vast majority of people who receive family tax benefit part A receive the right amount of family tax benefit or in fact get a top-up. So 70 per cent of people who receive family tax benefit part A get either more money at the end of the year because they have underestimated their income or exactly what they should have received all year. Thirty per cent of people have an overpayment because they have underestimated their income. The reality is that you could not expect that 30 per cent not to have to repay the debt that they owe to the Commonwealth when they are in exactly the same financial situation as all of those who have received the right amount or in fact got a top-up. Those people have a choice. This government is all about choice and the family tax benefit is all about choice. People can decide what they wish to estimate in terms of their income. In doing so, they will determine how much they will be paid. If they do not believe that their income can be successfully estimated on a fortnightly basis, then they have the option of not taking family tax benefit part A until the end of the year and getting a bonus, if you like, at the end of the year. But that is a matter for families to decide. It is not a matter for the government. I will not be responding to all of the rhetoric of the member for Oxley with respect to the family tax benefit. Needless to say, this is the most generous government with respect to family tax payments in the history of the Commonwealth. In the next week or two, there will be a $600 bonus for the people who receive family tax benefit part A, the carers allowance and the carers payments. From1 July, of course, per child there will be an ongoing increase of $600. As a consequence of that I think the government should be congratulated for the support it gives to families in Australia. This budget has seen a huge increase in the support for families. I would also add that we are reducing the withdrawal rate of family tax benefit parts A and B from 30 per cent to 20 per cent and we are increasing the FTB part B income test threshold from $1,825 to $4,000 a year. All of these things are very positive for families. Finally, of course, with respect to families, the maternity payment of $3,000 per child will be introduced from 1 July 2004, increasing to $5,000 by 2008. I am the father of twins and I would have been delighted if this had been introduced four years ago. I would have been absolutely over the moon. Sadly, I have missed out on that. But from 1 July those families who have twins will receive $6,000 and they will be very pleased with the coalition government. I thank the Main Committee. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Education, Science and Training Proposed expenditure, $2,283,346,000. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (5.29 p.m.)-I have a few issues that I want to raise with the Minister for Education, Science and Training. The minister would be aware that the budget includes an allocation of $6 million a year for three years as a partial contribution to the estabMAIN COMMITTEE lishment of a medical school at the University of Western Sydney on the condition that matching funding is contributed by both the university and the New South Wales government. I would like to know from the minister what negotiations have taken place with the University of Western Sydney and the New South Wales government to make this funding a reality. Most importantly, I cannot see any reference in the budget or in the minister’s statements about the allocation of new medical places or that there will in fact be any medical places at this medical school. If the minister could inform me about those matters, I would appreciate it. While we are in this area, I have a couple of other issues on schools. The minister has distributed a fact sheet on school funding. In fact, it says ‘School funding-the facts’. I am wondering why this so-called fact sheet omits an extremely important fact. It purports to demonstrate where the funding comes from for different types of schools. It compares The King’s School with Fairvale High School, for example-two relatively similarly sized schools in the same sort of area in Sydney. I wonder why the fact sheet does not include the fact that some of these schools operate with up to $10 million more than the government schools that are listed here, because of the private fees that are charged. I would have thought that, if this truly was a fact sheet, it would include the private resources that are available to the private schools. That would give a much more accurate assessment of the resources that are available to schools. It seems to me to be of grave concern when this suggests that The King’s School is actually operating with fewer resources than Fairvale High School. I do not think anyone who has been to either school would suggest that that is the case. As I understand it, The King’s School operates at about $9 million more-that is 150 per cent more-than Fairvale High School when you take into account the fees that are available to The King’s School. I would suggest that it would be very important for the minister to amend this fact sheet and include the private resources that are available to a school like The King’s School so that we can more accurately understand the level of resources that are available. The fact sheet also claims that, under the Australian Constitution, state schools are the responsibility of state and territory governments. I ask the minister where precisely this claim is made in the Australian Constitution. If he could give me the section of the Constitution, I would appreciate it. Also on schools, the minister would be aware that there is substantial discrepancy in the capital funding available to government, Catholic and independent schools. He would be aware that, in the latest national report on schooling-it is a bit old; it is from 2001-per student expenditures are: for government schools, $336 per student; for Catholic schools, $786 per student; and for independent schools, $1,664 per student. These figures cover the total expenditure on capital made per student in each of these three different types of schools. I would like to know how the minister justifies these differences. Just in case he thinks he might blame the states, I remind him that the federal government has not increased its capital funding of government schools since 1996. (Extension of time granted) I would like to know on what basis he continues to refuse to increase funding to what, from these figures, are patently the most needy schools when it comes to capital-that is, government schools. As far as I can see-and the minister might let me know if this is wrong-the most recent schools funding package which he announced at the end of March has no increase in capital for government schools. If he could confirm that, it would be helpful. MAIN COMMITTEE As those seem to be the circumstances, I wonder why that is the case. I find it hard to believe that the minister is not aware of the urgent need to upgrade, refurbish and provide new facilities for many government schools. That is particularly the case in very disadvantaged areas. In relation to that I know the minister is very well aware of this-we have seen the greatest increases in general recurrent school funding over the last four years going to those independent schools that, you would have to say, by any measure already have the most lavish capital facilities. We have already talked about The King’s School, and I am sure the minister is aware of its extraordinary facilities. Noting that the figures for capital for independent school students are way above those available in other schools and, I would suggest, would most likely be much higher in these high-fee independent schools, I ask the minister to let us know whether the additional hundreds of millions of dollars in recurrent money that has gone to these very wealthy schools-the King’s School, for example, as well as Geelong Grammar in Victoriahas been channelled into even more lavish capital facilities at these schools while public schools like Fairvale High School have received no increase in capital from this government. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (5.37 p.m.)-I will have to work off memory on some of these things. Firstly, on the University of Western Sydney, notwithstanding the lobbying and efforts made by the members for Macquarie, Parramatta and Lindsay, the member for Macarthur should probably take more credit for this than anybody. Certainly, for more than a year he has been lobbying hard to see a university medical school established at the University of Western Sydney. I hesitate to use this expression, but I have to say that in what appears to be the context of an emerging crisis in health care in Western Sydney the government believes that one of the substantive ways of addressing that in the longer term is to see a medical school established at the university. In terms of consultations, I was aware that the New South Wales government was sympathetic to if not supportive of the establishment of a medical school at the University of Western Sydney. At least one report appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald approximately four months ago-it might have been a bit before or after that-in which the New South Wales Premier was reported, at least, as being a strong advocate of a medical school being established. I phoned the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, Professor Jan Reid, and asked her whether the university would in fact respond favourably to the member for Macarthur’s advocacy and support the establishment of a school. I said to her that I did not expect that she would just say over the phone, ‘Yes, we’d love a medical school,’ but rather that she might like to make some preliminary inquiries. She came back to me a couple of days later and said-this would probably have been in February, maybe March-that, yes, the university would indeed like a medical school. I said that that would of course require a capital contribution from the Australian government, as well as places. As a consequence of that, the government has announced, as you know, that $18 million will be made available in capital infrastructure to support the construction of a medical school at the University of Western Sydney. It will be $6 million each year, I think, over ’05, ’06 and ’07, from memory. That will be conditional upon an equal contribution from the New South Wales government and also borrowings by the University of Western Sydney. In fact, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney said to me herself that of course the MAIN COMMITTEE university would borrow money for its contribution to the capital. In fact, from memory, the University of Western Sydney has either no debt at the moment or a very low level of debtas in fact is the case right across the university sector. As far as places are concerned, the places for the medical school will be allocated from the 25,000 which the government is about to announce as part of its higher education reforms. Also this year, we have commenced an additional 234 HECS funded places in medicine right across Australia. On the school fact sheet, basically the government is providing information to people in terms of public funding of schools. If the member for Jagajaga is concerned about the government’s fact sheet then she and other Labor members must be outraged by the Australian Education Union’s advertising campaign, which does not even take into account the state contribution for school funding, let alone the fees that are actually paid by parents. The fact sheet shows that The King’s School educates 1,350 Australian children and receives $3.6 million in public funding, and Fairvale High School educates 1,377 Australian children and receives, I think, $15.9 million in public funding. The fact sheet is putting the facts across to the community in relation to school funding by governments-that is, the public funding-because a false and misleading perception has been created in the community. A lot of good, everyday, decent people are being led to falsely believe that schools like King’s and these non-government schools are receiving more public money in support of their education than are children in government schools. (Extension of time granted) In fact the truth is quite different. I like to talk about this when I address groups of young people. For example, I was at Unley High School in Adelaide last week. It is considered to be one of the best high schools not just in South Australia but indeed in Australia. A student asked me: ‘Why are these kids that go to private schools getting more money for their education than kids at government schools? This is what I have been told.’ I said to the students, ‘Okay, hands up those who think that all students should receive the same amount of public money in support of their education no matter where they go.’ Do you know, almost every child put their hand up. Notionally, in an egalitarian society that is what most people think. They think that all students should get the same amount of taxpayers’ assistance for education. The reality is that every child who attends a non-government school receives less public money in support of their education than if they attend a public school. Ms Macklin-What about the private money? government schools in Australia-that is, 2,652 Catholic and independent schools in Australia. In terms of the level of public funding that The King’s School receives from the federal government, do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, that it ranks at 2,548, if you take one as receiving the highest amount of funding and 2,652 as receiving the lowest amount. That means that, if a student leaves, for argument’s sake, The King’s School and goes to the Fairvale High School, that student will receive 4½ times more public funding in support of his education than he currently receives at The King’s School. Ms Macklin-And a whole lot of private money. it.

These are the facts ofis The King’s School, Xavier College, Trinity Grammar or any of these schools, within those schools are parents who have made enormous sacrifices for their children. There are parents there who have three or four jobs between them, who never have a holiday, who drive a 15year-old car, who live in very modest circumstances, and the Labor Party members scoff at this. Ms Macklin-We are laughing at you. ceptionist whose entire income-and she had three jobs-fully funded the education of her son at the Hutchins School, having lived in Claremont in the northern suburbs of Hobart. Those parents have made the choice to forgo a much higher level of public funding for the education of their children, take a much lower level of public funding for their children and make sacrifices in the process. Labor members ought to remember that 47 per cent of people in this country who earn more than $104,000 a year have their kids in government schools, 48 per cent have their kids in non-government schools and the rest have them in both. At the other end of the spectrum, one in five parents in Australia who earn less than $26,800 a year-one in five-have their kids in a non-government school. Ms Macklin interjectingConstitution. Under section 96 of the Constitution, state governments have responsibility for providing schooling to children. As to capital funding, at the moment the Australian government provides $106 per head-per child-for capital funding in a government school. This government provides $97 per child in a Catholic school for capital works and $74 per child for the 459,000 students currently in independent schools. So, from this government, if you attend a state school, you will get $106 per head in support of capital works. If you attend a Catholic school, you will receive $97 per head for capital works. If you attend an independent school, you will receive $74 per head.

In particular-and I do not want to go into a diatribe about what I think of the government’s performance in that regard generally-I want to raise two particular issues to do with the review of the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance program and the proposals to change IEDA programs-in particular, ASSPA and the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme. I take you to the introduction of this report and reflect upon the fact that there are 3,800-odd ASSPA committees around Australia. Evidence to the Senate says that only 10 of those committees responded to the review. Of the 3,800, only 0.25 per cent have involved themselves in the process of responding to the government’s proposals. I recently visited remote communities in the Northern Territory, Central Australia, northeast Arnhem Land and southern Arnhem Land. I have met with ASSPA committees in Darwin and Alice Springs. None of them-not one of them-had been engaged in any process of consultation by your department leading up to the development of this review document and its recommendations. They are extremely concerned that the changes to ASSPA will dramatically and detrimentally affect the education of their children and their role in their children’s education. They are most concerned to ask that you do not proceed with these changes until there MAIN COMMITTEE",238,Atsic Board But That Sort Of Situation Appeals To The Member For Lingiari

255,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (5.47 P.m.),"I want to raise with you a couple of specific queshas been an adequate process of consultation and discussion with the school communities that are to be affected. In addition, in relation to the tutorial assistance program, given that they were not engaged in the process, they wonder why you would want to provide tutorial assistance only for three defined years in a child’s education when it is very clear from any educationalist that what you need to do is go through the full educational life experience of these children, not get them when they fall through the cracks after they have failed a government test. It is most inappropriate that this should proceed. This is what is happening, Minister, if you are not aware of it. I have been asked by these committees and these parents of Indigenous kids in the Northern Territory to request that you do not proceed with these proposals as you are currently intending to do and that you go back to those communities and talk to those parents and their school communities to establish what they think of your government’s proposals. Clearly, they have not expressed a view to you previously because they have not been engaged. I note very clearly that this report was developed internally by your department. It was not done externally and it was not done in a way which would engage parents or their school communities. Most particularly, it was not done to engage remote-community parents. I am most concerned about this, Minister, and I want to make sure that you respond to this in a way that guarantees that these parents will not lose any of their confidence in these the fact that these additional assistance programs provide them with the capacity to be involved in their children’s education, and they are concerned about the impact that it will have on them. I ask that you respond to that and make sure that these parents are not disappointed and that you go back and talk to the 3,800-odd parent groups and consult with their school communities about the impact of your proposals. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (5.51 p.m.)-I will come to that. With regard to capital funding from this government, we are providing $106 per student in a state school, $97 per student in a Catholic school and $74 per student in an independent school. But the Block Grant Authority, with which the member for Jagajaga is fully familiar, distributes that money to the independent schools. You will find that those so called high-fee schools are not getting any of that capital works money. It goes to poorly resourced low-fee independent schools. In fact, in terms of the overall contribution for capital, what makes the difference-whether it is in a government school or a non-government school-is parents. It does not matter whether it is through cake stalls, raffles or parents with second or third jobs, parents going the extra mile make all the difference. With regard to funding for capital works over the next quadrennium, $1.1 billion will be made available for government state schools. That represents a 12 per cent increase in funding at $112 million, and there was an 18 per cent increase of $68 million for the non-government schools because of what we are doing with Catholic schools. As far as the package for school funding over the next quadrennium is concerned, of those 2,652 Catholic and independent schools, if you take the 100 that are getting the greatest increase, they have an average socioeconomic status score of 83, which is very low. Of those 100 schools, 23 of them are special schools that look after children with disabilities-particularly with physical and intellectual disabilities-and the other 77, as I said, have an average SES score of 83. They are receiving MAIN COMMITTEE $1,484 extra per student over the quadrennium, so they are getting the greatest increase. If you go to the 100 schools that are getting the lowest increase, they have an average SES score of 121, which is very high. In fact, the highest SES score is 130. Those schools are receiving an additional $484 per student over the four years. So the schools that are getting the highest increase, 23 of which are special schools with kids with disabilities, are getting $1,484 per student over the quadrennium and those with the smallest increase are getting $484. The next issue relates to Indigenous Australians. Firstly, there are the ASSPA committees, through which the Aboriginal Student Support and Parental Awareness committees have been receiving about $16 million a year. There are 3,800 of these committees. I looked at this very closely because all Aboriginal people in Australia. I do not care whether they are in metropolitan Sydney or Melbourne or whether they are in the remotest parts of the country in the electorate of Lingiari-face challenges greater than those faced by those of us who are nonAboriginal. has a very long tail. In other words, would you believe that we have a lot of schools in the northern beaches of Sydney with relatively small sums of money-as low as $220 going to each of the schools for ASSPA committee activities. Then we have other schools with very large Aboriginal enrolments, predominantly in regions and electorates like the electorate of Lingiari, that are attracting up to $140,000 in ASSPA funding, with very small numbers of students. That tail actually adds up to a significant amount of money. What we are trying to do is target the Aboriginal education dollar predominantly and increasingly into remote and regional parts of the country, particularly when educational outcomes are not being delivered. Mr Snowdon interjecting Mr Snowdon interjectingthemes that came through to me in the first year I was in the portfolio, in meeting Aboriginal(Time expired) the minister can get to answer the question in the last minute or so. Given that we have only five minutes to go, I do not have much option. I want to raise the issue of ANTA funding. The fact is that, due to the minister’s intransigence on the failure to offer growth funding in the ANTA agreement, negotiations broke down at the end of last year at the Brisbane MINCO. I understand that a further MINCO was held in Adelaide last week. I am hopeful that negotiations will be recommenced to ensure that there is actually an ANTA agreement in place. It is quite extraordinary that the minister has a lot of rhetoric about the importance of the traditional trades-boilermakers and carpenters-who he says are paying for people to go to university, as if there is some objection to that process, and yet we have a situation whereby we actually have no ANTA agreement in place. The minister has indeed pinched some of the money that would have been there for ANTA to carve off a separate funding formula for this year. SoI call upon the minister to listen not just to the Labor Party but to organisations such as ACCI, which have called for growth funding to be in the ANTA agreement.

It is something that the government, if it were fair dinkum about these initiatives, would surely match. I will leave it there to give the minister a brief amount of time. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (5.59 p.m.)-We received 10 submissions from ASSPA committees. There was consultation with a random selection of 400 ASSPA committees, directors-general of education, the Catholic and independent schools sector, ATSIC and ATSIS, Indigenous education consultative bodies, Indigenous support units in WA, Queensland and New South Wales, and a selection of vocational education and training providers. Three discussion papers and questionnaires informed the review. There were 62 written responses to discussion paper No. 3, the majority of which were from school education providers. As the principal of one school in western New South Wales-and I will not name the school-said to me in relation to the ASSPA funding, ‘I basically write something for them and then we put it in.’ I was told that the ASSPA funding at another school supports the barbecue with the families. The review that we conducted found that there was very little relationship between the ASSPA funding and the educational outcomes for the children. So what we are now doing is moving the ASSPA funding-which is $62 million, from memory, over four years-to project based funding. We will support and encourage ASSPA committees in their applications for that funding, but we want it to relate to the educational outcomes for the kids. We particularly want to give priority to non-metropolitan Aboriginal students. I do not care what anybody says: that is where the need is greatest. As far as the ANTA agreement is concerned, the reason there is not an ANTA agreement is that the states decided at the end not to sign it. Mr Snowdon interjectingliteracy and numeracy in years 3, 5 and 7, so we are providing in-school tuition at a cost of I think $104 million to support Indigenous students who are having difficult with literacy in particular.

We will also provide a person on a one-toone basis with them in the school environment-again, at a cost of $42 million. you know, preschool activities to support Indigenous students particularly. There is IESIP money generally to support the education of students. We are wheeling out the scaffolding program again through IESIP.

As far as in-school tuition is concerned, the government is focusing on those critical years of 3, 5 and 7 in literacy and numeracy in particular, because that is where we have our national benchmark testing and reporting, and programs are provided in advance in the earlier years to support them in any case.

The government put $220 million of additional funding on the table, which represented a nominal 12 per cent increase. But in real terms, Access Economics-which the states restated an enormous amount of confidence in on Friday-forecast demand over the three years of the triennium that were proposed to be funded to be 2.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively in the second and third years. The Australian government put a 2½ per cent real increase in funding on the table. We asked the states and territories to match it with a 1.5 per cent real increase in funding. The end result of that would have been 71,500 additional places over the next three years. In addition to that, to get around the impasse in relation to the construction code, where we want freedom of association in workplaces where we are funding construction activities, we askedreasons why we do not have an ANTA agreement. The first reason is the construction code, because the states and territories would not agree to it.

277,The Deputy Speaker,"The minister’s time has expired. Minister, you have the opment has a policy across all programs that where Australian government money is being used to support capital works it must comply with the construction code. I offered the states and territories, in the context of the ANTA agreement, the opportunity to roll money over, above and beyond the trigger threshold of $10 million on a capital works project, to fund additional places. They declined to do so. There were three reasons for non-agreement. Firstly, this government believe in user choice-employers having the ability to chose a public or private provider-and we wanted to increase the funding for that. The states and territories could not reach agreement on that. The second issue was the construction code. Thirdly, they argued for a larger quantum of money. The member for Grayndler referred to slicing money out. In fact what the government have done is to take $29 million out this year to directly tender for places for sole parents, people with disabilities, Indigenous people and mature age workers returning to the work force. By definition, they will predominantly be places that are likely to be with larger public providers. Since last Friday we have commenced negotiations on the ANTA agreement. To inform that agreement, we have been doing a lot more work in relation to forecast demand. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (6.06 p.m.)-I want to follow up with the minister the issue of the medical school at the University of Western Sydney. He indicated that the places for the medical school will come from the reallocation of the 25,000 over-enrolled places. Is that correct? to the University of Western Sydney’s medical school. How will they be funded, given that the cost of a medical place is so much higher than the average cost of a university place? Could the minister let me know the answers to those questions? Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.07 p.m.)These are 25,000 places, as I said in the House today, that would have been, and are, in the process of disappearing. At a net cost to the Australian government-or the taxpayers, more directly-of $547 million, these places are going to be fully funded. From those 25,000 additional places which would otherwise disappear, an allocation will be made to the University of Western Sydney for medical places. I will be making an announcement about the number of places in the very near future. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (6.08 p.m.)-The second question I asked was: how are they going to be funded, given the much higher cost of a medical place compared to the average cost of these 25,000 places which you have demonstrated the overall cost of? That is at an average cost. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.08 p.m.)-I will make that clear when I make the announcement. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (6.08 p.m.)-Okay. We will just keep pursuing things and maybe we will find something out today. There is another issue I want to raise. Some concerns have been raised with us about the Higher Education Information Management System that the government is intending to introduce. What sort of testing has been done for this system, at both the institutional and the system level? We do have concerns about this system and would like to know at this point what testing has been done to make sure that it works. MAIN COMMITTEE",243,Asspa Processes Or The Ieda Program Itself Aboriginal Parents Place A Great Deal Of Faith In
278,Dr Nelson,Yes.,244,Asspa Processes Or The Ieda Program Itself Aboriginal Parents Place A Great Deal Of Faith In
279,Ms Macklin,"I would like to know how many of those 25,000 places will be allocatedDr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.09 p.m.)-I am advised that, as I suspected would be the case, the system is still in the process of being developed and implemented. I do not think that we are yet at the point of being able to test it, if you are to use that language. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (6.10 p.m.)-Given that it is in the process of being implemented, I would have thought that you would be making sure that the whole process was going to work and that, as it was being implemented, they were going to test whether or not it will fall over. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.10 p.m.)-The nature of these things is that you cannot actually test something until you have put it together. We are in the process of working cooperatively and very enthusiastically with the university sector to get this built and implemented as quickly as possible for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that many of the new reforms in higher education are predicated on making sure that the Higher Education Information Management System works. In fact, the advice that I have had is that, notwithstanding the teething problems you would expect with any system, by and large the implementation is going quite well. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.11 p.m.)-I wanted to place on record some real concerns I have about education and the impact it is having within the Shortland electorate. The Shortland electorate, as I am sure the minister knows, has a very low number of people attending nongovernment schools. Eighty per cent of all students attend government schools, and, of the other 20 per cent, 14 per cent attend Catholic schools. I have been approached by schools and parents in my area that are greatly concerned about the direction of the government’s policy. They hold the strong belief that their schools are being disadvantaged by government policy. They are very upset that the wealthy private schools are getting the giant’s share of the money through the Commonwealth. They are also most concerned that major capital works programs are not being undertaken within their schools. They have sent me lists, and I have here a couple of those that I grabbed from my office on my way to the chamber. Over $3 million worth of work is needed at Belmont High School for major capital works over three years. They need multipurpose centres, performing arts centres, technology access, building modification, an upgrade of staff facilities, an upgrade of the electrics to sustain the IT expansion, and technology such as laptops and PCs to reduce teacher-student-PC ratios. They need to employ paraprofessionals to remove teachers from bureaucratic functions, and they need an additional GA. They need additional staffing to support special programs and the programs that the government is placing great emphasis on. They need facility maintenance. This school is particularly upset that they appear to be missing out on moneyMs Macklin-That is because they are! ‘Our school is no longer fit for its purpose: C21 learning.’ It really upsets me that, just because students happen to live in the Shortland electorate, they would not have the same access to the same quality of education that students in more elite areas have. I do not think that where a person lives and their access to private schools should determine their ability to access quality education. I find that very disturbing. I think that it is most upsetting that the government has decided to entrench its policies of catering to elite education rather than catering MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Asspa Processes Or The Ieda Program Itself Aboriginal Parents Place A Great Deal Of Faith In
280,Ms Hall,"That is right. As the shadow minister said, they are. They finish by saying,to the majority of students. WhilstI say it is 80 per cent in Shortland, I believe it is something like 70 per cent of students throughout Australia. Another school-the Warners Bay Public School, which is a primary school-list the resources they need. They have very limited resources, including those needed in the language field or TVs and DVDs-the kinds of things that I believe are probably a little more important than an extra cricket field or playing field. They need home reading resources, covered walkways, PA systems, a full-time computer consultant, a maths consultant and counsellors-all the types of things that schools that this government directs money towards have plenty of. In the time that I have remaining, I will quickly point out to the minister that part of the Shortland electorate takes in the Central Coast of New South Wales, which has the lowest retention rate of all schoolchildren in Australia. It also has the lowest rate of students attending university. I think it is very sad that the minister was unable to come up with more resources for the University of Newcastle and the Ourimbah campus. The students of the Central Coast have really been disadvantaged under the Howard government. The people of the Central Coast know this, and they are very disappointed. They really expected better from the minister and the Howard government. (Time expired) Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.16 p.m.)-I will go to the second issue first. The University of Newcastle, from memory, got a minimum of $18 million additional funding under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. In addition to that, students for the first time are receiving scholarships to support them with their real problem-that is, their living costs when they are at university. Also, shortly, when I announce the place allocation, if at least anyone is going to be happy on the other side, it should be the member for Shortland. I will put it that way. The opportunities for education at the University of Newcastle will be significantly expanded. On the school funding issue, this year enrolments in New South Wales government state schools are going to drop by a half of one per cent. The Australian government is a minority funder of public schools, and has been under successive governments-Labor and coalition governments-and, in fact, its funding is called supplementary funding. Of the funding for New South Wales state schools, 88 per cent comes from state governments and 12 per cent comes from the Australian government. This year, in the budget that we are supposed to be debating, this government has increased its funding by six per cent to New South Wales state schools, where enrolments are dropping by 0.5 per cent. Why is the government increasing its funding by six per cent? Because that is the cost of getting a school door open. It relates to the real costs of delivering education services in schools. Last year, the New South Wales government, which is primarily responsible for funding the schools to which the member for Shortland referred, increased its funding to New South Wales state schools by 0.8 per cent-less than one per cent. The inflation rate is running between two per cent and three per cent. The cost of running schools is running more between 5½ per cent and seven per cent, depending on where they are. I say to the member for Shortland: the real question that she should ask-and I join her in this; I will be very interested to know-is that, when the New South Wales government delivers its budget, what will its increase actually be to the funding of its state schools and will it in fact be six per cent? Last year, this government increased its funding to New South Wales state schools by 5.7 per cent. As I said, the New South Wales government increased its by 0.8 per cent. An extra $292 milMAIN COMMITTEE lion would have gone to New South Wales state schools last year had the New South Wales government kept up with the Commonwealth in terms of indexing funding to its own schools. It is fundamentally important that all Australians-and particularly people in this parliament-understand which level of government is responsible for which things and, most importantly, appreciate that, overall, the 2.2 million kids in government state schools in this country got $20 billion to support their education last year-$2.5 billion from this government and $17.5 billion from the states and territories. The non-government schools-Catholic and independent-did not get half of that. They did not get $10 billion; they got $6.2 billion. Parents put their hands deep into their pockets to pay $4 billion in fees. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.19 p.m.)-I appreciate the information that the minister has shared with us here today, but I think that the minister misses my point. He misses the emphasis that I was trying to place in my contribution to this debate. I was placing emphasis on the fact that the Commonwealth, as well as the states, has a responsibility for the education of all children attending school. Ms Macklin interjectingMs Macklin-State schools are not only the responsibility of the state governments. I am glad to hear thatMs Macklin-That is wonderful; it’s a revelation. the Commonwealth has a responsibility for students attending both public and private schools. There is a Commonwealth responsibility there. The point I was making to the minister is that under his government and under his leadership as minister there has been quite a distinct change of emphasis. Instead of providing an equal quality of education to all students, there has been a change. There has been a shift in emphasis, and those students who are attending the wealthy schools are doing just a little bit better-or perhaps we should say a lot betterunder the Howard government. I find that particularly disturbing, because there are no category 1 schools in Shortland. There is no university in Shortland either, Minister-that is within the Newcastle electorate. The students from the Shortland electorate attend either the Newcastle campus or the Ourimbah campus, because the Shortland electorate is on the Central Coast and in Lake Macquarie rather than in Newcastle. That is why I brought up the issue of students being disadvantaged on the Central Coast. The minister would be aware that he was approached by a consortium of the local councils and businesses on the Central Council that are very concerned about the direction in which the government is going and about the implications for the Ourimbah campus. Whilst the minister visited the campus and made a couple of noises, we are still not happy with where the government is going.

286,Ms Hall,"It is very pleasing to see that the minister has confirmed to the parliament that I think that it is very important for the minister to remember that he is the minister for education for all students. The students in the Shortland electorate look to him in the same way that the students in his electorate look to him. They look to him to ensure that they have equal opportunity in education. They look to him to ensure that they have the opportunity to go to university because they are bright young children who have worked very hard, have achieved and have earned themselves a place in university-not because mum and dad can afford to pay for them to go to university. I do not see why a student who comes from Windale in my electorate-which is quite a disadvantaged area where the population really relies on governments, both state and Commonwealth, to ensure that they get an education of quality-should be treated as a second-class citizen. Those people should not be given a second-class education. They should be able to have the same quality of education as students who are living on the North Shore of Sydney. The point that I was trying to make-and maybe the minister missed it-is that I feel that under his government that has changed. There is no longer equality across education. The government’s approach to education has been to foster elitism and to foster opportunity for those who can afford to pay. Choice is now connected to a person’s ability to pay and not linked to a person’s opportunities in life. If we ensured that a very egalitarian type of education existed-and that a more uniform type of education system existed-we would provide students in Shortland electorate with much better opportunities than this government is providing. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.25 p.m.)-I have already substantially covered all of these issues, so there is no point repeating what I have said. But there is one thing I will point out: the chance students in the electorate of Shortland have of getting into Newcastle University is actually better than the chance students in my electorate have, because students in Shortland get five points added to their UAI to get special entry. I strongly support that, by the way, for all the reasons that the member for Shortland pointed out. In addition, the state Labor member who is on the council of the University of Newcastle voted in support of a 25 per cent increase in HECS. When asked by the Sydney Morning Herald why he did so, he said, ‘Of course I would-any sane person would.’ Apparently he had no idea that the Labor Party was opposed to it. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (6.25 p.m.)-Just to follow up on these issues, when the member for Shortland was making her contribution she emphasised the importance of the Commonwealth making its commitment to students in all schools and the minister nodded. I just want to go back to a question I asked the minister earlier, which was in relation to a statement in his school funding facts sheet. I asked him which section of the Constitution actually says that state schools are the responsibility of state and territory governments. He referred me to section 96. I am having a look at section 96, and it does not say anything of the kind. Maybe it is a different section that the minister is referring to, but I would appreciate it if the minister would indicate where in the Constitution it says that state schools are the responsibility of state governments. He says this, of course, to try and suggest that he does not have any responsibility for so-called state schools-and he puts a lot of emphasis on the S. The point that I would make is that it is very plain that the responsibility of the Commonwealth is to all children in all schools. We do have a responsibility to children in government or public schools. That responsibility is there for all to see through the contribution that we MAIN COMMITTEE make, no matter how small. Of course, I am constantly concerned, as the member for Shortland is, about the low level of spending provided to our government-or public-schools. But, that said, the funding that the Commonwealth does provide indicates that we do have a responsibility. I assume that the minister is providing this funding properly, under the Constitution. He should acknowledge that we have a constitutional responsibility for these children, as much as the states do. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.28 p.m.)-The Australian government will be committing $9.8 billion over the next four years for state schools. There will be $2.6 billion this year-a 5.4 per cent increase across the board this year alone. Watch out for that when the New South Wales state government budget is delivered. It is section 96 of the Constitution that gives the Commonwealth the authority to pay money to the states in order to provide schooling. Just in case the member for Jagajaga is in any doubt about thisquestion? Ms Macklin-Yes, I am. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (6.28 p.m.)-I just want to be very specific. Yes, that is exactly what section 96 does: it gives authority for the Commonwealth to give grants to the states for various purposes. It is not a section that says that state schools are the responsibility of state governments. Where is that in the Constitution? Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.29 p.m.)-I would have thought that it was self-evident that the states then use that funding to run schools and do other things. If there is any doubt about this let me point out that as Australia’s Minister for Education, Science and TrainingI cannot visit a state school unless I write to the relevant state minister and ask permission from them, because state schools are regulated, administered and primarily funded by state governments. Further to that, whereas 12 per cent of the recurrent funding for state schools comes from the Australian government, half of the 88 per cent that the states put in is actually money that has come from the federal government in the first place. What is happening here is that the opposition is trying to transfer funding responsibility for schools across to the federal government. Ms Macklin-Yes, I am. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (6.30 p.m.)-So the minister in fact cannot tell me which section of the Constitution says that state schools are the responsibility of state governments. That being the case, I think he should withdraw this funding fact sheet which says: Under the Australian Constitution, state schools are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.

It was $604 million and it builds on a record budget allocation of $10.6 billion in 2004-05 for veterans and war widows. I will not make a long address, but I notice the absence of anyone here to actually ask further questions on this portfolio. In my mind, it builds on the fact that, in the budget in reply speech from the opposition, there was not one mention of veterans and not one mention of war widows. I think that this silence has not gone unnoticed by the veteran community. On the understanding that we are here to consider this budget, it is very disappointing, to say the least, to see that there are no questions to be asked on behalf of veterans. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Attorney-General’s Department Proposed expenditure, $2,392,872,000 Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (6.33 p.m.)-I thank the Attorney for being here to answer questions. I have questions in three areas and, if it suits the Attorney, I will ask each of them separately. The first is in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services which, as of 1 July, will come under the Attorney’s department. We have asked questions in other places about what steps have been taken in terms of the handover to the Attorney-General’s Department from the department previously administering it. I am also conscious of a number of issues that have been raised about serious problems with the tender document, which I know will have a huge impact on the capacity for legal services to be provided to Indigenous people. Given the Attorney’s background in this area, I know that he will be able to address my concerns, particularly in relation to two matters. My first concern is that the tender document enables any service provider who is successful under this tender document, if it is used, to MAIN COMMITTEE",249,Asspa Processes Or The Ieda Program Itself Aboriginal Parents Place A Great Deal Of Faith In

296,Mrs Vale,"This budget delivers in a very responsible and sensitive way for our veteransrefuse services to an Aboriginal person who has a prior conviction. We all know that a major problem in the Aboriginal community is that we have not only repeat offenders but Aboriginal people who are often convicted of minor and repeated offences. They often end up incarcerated as a result of multiple offences, although no individual offence would be significant enough, on its own, for them to end up in jail ordinarily. I am also particularly concerned that the tender process allows for non-Indigenous services to tender for the provision of services to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. In fact, there is no requirement in the tender documents for any particular input from Indigenous staff or advisory boards. Quite apart from the handover of services, this is an issue that I think the Attorney needs to address, in that there is a serious issue of cost shifting that may occur: if Aboriginal legal services do not continue to provide services to this community, we will find that more and more people are turning up to legal aid commissions. I understand that all the legal aid commissions have written to both the Attorney and the minister currently responsible, to raise their concerns about the impact this will have on legal aid money. So, indirectly, it relates to the package that has been announced in terms of the overall legal aid budget. Those are the main issues that I hope the Attorney can assure me about given that, in a number of days, they will be his responsibility. The questions that were asked in the other place in relation to this were not adequately answered, unfortunately. We have services that do not know what is going to happen, while the minister’s own department has recently released for discussion an Indigenous justice paper which makes recommendations that run seriously counter to the whole philosophy in the tender document. I just wonder if the Attorney can advise us on: how those two matters sit together; what his views are on how this will be administered within the Attorney-General’s Department; whether any adjustments will need to be made in terms of the budget; and whether he has addressed these particular concerns about acting on behalf of people with prior convictions and about lack of control or input from Indigenous community members? ber for her questions in relation to this matter. I do take an interest in the provision of legal services, particularly those for Indigenous Australians. The changes that have occurred in relation to ATSIC and ATSIS are not intended to dismantle the provision of specific legal assistance services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, but it was the case that ATSIS, as it was reviewing arrangements for the provision of Indigenous legal services, was very conscious that the performance of the organisations had been very variable. I hope, in a spirit of reasonableness and perhaps even bipartisanship, that there can be some acknowledgment that some of the Indigenous legal services have functioned extraordinarily effectively, delivering a comprehensive range of services in the most cost-effective way-but I have to say that that has not been the case universally. There was a review of which I was apprised that compared the cost of delivering Indigenous legal services with those of other legal aid bodies. While I am only remembering the figures indicatively, I think some Aboriginal legal services were able to deliver them at a cost that was about 25 per cent that of legal aid bodies; in other cases, the cost was outrageously more. Quite frankly, I think it was appropriate that there should be some review. MAIN COMMITTEE",250,Asspa Processes Or The Ieda Program Itself Aboriginal Parents Place A Great Deal Of Faith In
297,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (6.37 p.m.)-I thank the honourable memIn the context of looking at how that might be done, ATSIS came to a view that it should be through a contestable process. As I understand it, what was circulated was a draft tender document. That has been exposed. It was released on 4 March for public comment. Comments have been received and issues arising from the proposed tender processes are being considered by the government. It would be inappropriate of me at this stage to foreclose argument in relation to consideration of those issues, save to say that the two points raised by the honourable member had been raised with me by some state attorneys and by those interested in the provision of Aboriginal legal services. I just want to make this point: this is not about cost shifting to other legal aid bodies of Indigenous clients. It is about trying to put in place the arrangements in a fairer, more appropriate way, and the funding that is available for Aboriginal legal services will be quarantined. I make that very clear. To the extent that I can, after a fortnight, look more closely at some of these issues, I can assure the honourable member I will. But I understand that there are already indications that some of the existing Aboriginal legal services have been prepared to submit tenders. They have been seen to be of a very high order, and those are bodies that do have Indigenous representation. I would want to see how the process unfolds before I come to a view that organisations that have not been delivering effectively for Indigenous people ought to continue to be funded as they have been in the past if the process reveals that more effective provision can be obtained in other ways. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (6.42 p.m.)-I thank the Attorney. My concern remains the flip side of his answer, which is: there is nothing in the current exposure tender draft that would ensure that those services that have been operating effectively and efficiently would be given some inside running, as they should be. We will obviously keep an eye on that when the minister, in two weeks timegiven to me that, where bodies have been working in the way in which I have described, they will be disadvantaged. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (6.42 p.m.)-It is a little disingenuous to use ATSIS, who have not even seen any of the terms of the document that were released, as an excuse for doing this. But I am sure your conversation with them was useful. The second question that I wanted to ask the Attorney was in relation to the legal aid funding increase that appears in the budget and the offer that has then been distributed to the various states in relation to that extra money. I am wondering if the Attorney can give me a little more information about how the new funding formula and the division of funding, particularly between states, was calculated? The Attorney would know that in Queensland the increase was of the order of 17 per cent but in New South Wales and Victoria there was nothing more-I do not even think it was keeping up with the legal CPI. I am wondering if the Attorney can spend a little time to take me through the detail of how those calculations were actually made. I also would like the Attorney to give some information about the contracts that have been provided to the legal aid commissions as part of the offer with this new increase. Could he advise how they were actually drafted and why they were drafted as contracts between the Commonwealth and non-government organisations, when obviously the legal aid commissions in all of the states and territories are statutory authorities and the negotiations and MAIN COMMITTEE",251,Asspa Processes Or The Ieda Program Itself Aboriginal Parents Place A Great Deal Of Faith In
298,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (6.42 p.m.)-I spoke to the former head ofagreements between them have a form which is different as a result of that? I am also wondering if the Attorney has had an opportunity to look at the Senate committee’s report into legal aid and whether any consideration of the issues that have been raised in that report will be factored into the negotiations and discussions that will now be held with the legal aid commission in relation to the offer that is on the table as a result of the budget. Finally in the legal aid area, could the Attorney provide some information about how the rate was struck for private practitioners? There was an increase, but I am just wondering what the basis was for that new rate and how it relates to a discussion paper of, I think, several years ago that dealt with this issue and suggested that there should be a national fee scale for private practitioners? The Attorney would be aware that the offer that is being made is for $120 an hour in most jurisdictions but, I think, $140 an hour in the ACT, although it is one of the smallest client base areas. I wonder if the Attorney-General could advise whether there has been any consultation with the legal aid commissions about these rates. of the issues that have been raised, and I am sure I will be aided by the honourable member if I overlook any of them. The issue of funding has to be seen in the context of the fact that there are quite significant demographic and economic variables between the states. The demographic variables include the numbers of people who are on certain benefits. As I understand it, Queensland has a disproportionately higher proportion of supporting mothers-I think that is the particular group that was drawn to my attention. I must say that I have not sought to interfere in relation to the funding model that was used. I certainly sought to satisfy myself that it was reasonable but I did not substitute my opinion for those of the experts who brought their knowledge to bear. I note that the Senate was trying to work out whether it could more effectively develop a model of its own or review the model that was being used. The funding officers were determined after a review of the model used to distribute legal aid. As a result of the review a new model has been developed. The new model changes the distribution formula in several ways to address concerns that have been raised by legal aid commissions and to recognise changes in demographic and economic circumstances in each jurisdiction. There were a number of distributive effects. There was a significant increase in the share of funding for Queensland, recognising it has a higher proportion of unemployment and incidence of divorces involving children and persons receiving a single parent payment, and the commission also has a low cost per case which acts to increase potential demand. There was an increase in the share of funding for Western Australia, which had struggled to meet demand under its current funding, and an increase in the share of funding to the Northern Territory, which had difficulty in meeting the need in its regional and remote areas. The share of funding for New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT was thus reduced in comparison to that of the others. The funding is not determined solely on the basis of the model, which is seen as an instrument for measuring demographic and economic changes in time. In recognition that no commission is yet meeting total demand an adjustment has been made for those commissions whose funding share is reduced under the model to enable them to maintain current service levels. That is the explanation that I am prepared to offer. In relation to the Senate review, I think that report was tabled out of session in the recent non-sitting period. While I am aware that the Senate has some views about levels of approMAIN COMMITTEE",252,Atsis About This As Recently As Today I Do Not Think There Will Be Any Indication That He Has
299,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (6.45 p.m.)-I will try and remember allpriation that might be made and so on, I have to say that the budget outlines the government’s negotiating position in relation to funds that are available for agreements. I am fairly flexible in relation to these matters. Certainly, we had sought to negotiate with the commissions. I have had a letter from one state attorney that says that he would prefer that the negotiation be with him. As far as I am concerned I do not see any reason why it should not be, but the negotiations will be on the basis that the Commonwealth’s offer has been fixed in the budget itself. In relation to the issue of the solicitor’s fees, there has been a concern about low fees paid by some commissions for family law and veterans work. It was for that reason that funding has been provided to assist the commissions to increase their fees to a minimum of $120 per hour. Some commissions already pay that rate, but I am told that Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania will benefit as a result of this decision. An additional $100,000 will be provided to the ACT to assist the commission to increase its fees to $140 per hour. The commission has serious difficulties in obtaining legal services from private practitioners at its current rate of $130 and the decision was taken for that reason. Ms Roxon interjectingstates and sufficient numbers of people are doing so. That is the reason the decision was taken as it was. to raise with the Attorney the recommendations in the committee report Every picture tells a story, particularly the proposal to establish a new tribunal. The Attorney may be aware that there was a lot of newspaper speculation about the constitutionality of such a tribunal and whether or not it traversed the Brandy decision. I want to draw to the Attorney’s attention the fact that the committee not on one but on two occasions now has sought the views of the Commonwealth’s chief legal adviser, Mr Burmeister, and I am indebted to him, as is the committee, for pointing out that he felt very strongly that the issue of contact and residency is administrative in nature and distinguishes the tribunal in terms of the Brandy decision. I ask the Attorney whether or not he has sought his own advice as to the constitutionality of the proposed tribunal. I also say that there was speculation, again, in newspapers that the cost of the tribunal was going to be some $650 million. I know that the committee recommended that the tribunal should consist of three members but, like former Chief Justice Gleeson, I think the tribunal is really trying to communicate that we need to break the monopoly of the legal profession in dealing with these matters. WhilstI cannot speak for our spokesperson or even other committee members on these matters, I say that I do not have a difficulty with it being a single member tribunal and I do not see that that is in any way departing from the report. In relation to the investigative arm, I also say that I think the principal benefit of that recommendation is to really demonstrate the shortfall in family law matters when serious allegations are made. I wonder whether the Attorney would also comment on enforcement, as there was a lot of speculation again in the press about enforcement. I have always believed that the greatest enforcement measure would be the variation to present contact and residency arrangements. If imprisonment or fines were involved, that clearly is a judicial matter and that would have to go before a court-quite properly-but, again, if people are looking for a more favourable MAIN COMMITTEE",253,Atsis About This As Recently As Today I Do Not Think There Will Be Any Indication That He Has

301,Mr Price (Chifley) (6.51 P.m.),"I thank the Attorney for his presence here today. I wantdecision in a court, it would be an issue of judicial review on an error of law or what have you and a court then returning the matter to the tribunal. Does the Attorney have any comment to make in relation to the $650 million that was bandied about? Has he had his officers look at some of the state operations, such as what used to be known as the Landlord and Tenant Tribunal in my state? I always get the name wrong; it has another name. These tribunals operate so effectively at such low cost to the Commonwealth but dispense justice in small claims tribunals. Is he able to indicate when he may be able to respond to the report or has he already responded but is waiting for an overall response from other government departments? Like my colleagues on the committee, I see the recommendation of a tribunal as a breakthrough. Is the Attorney able to indicate, for example, despite his predecessor’s faith in the Magistrates Court, to what extent a number of judges have now been made redundant on the basis of the effectiveness of the Magistrates Court? AllI can say to the Attorney is that the committee did, in good faith, work very hard to deliver a report by 29 December-a report the Prime Minister had asked for-but to date we remain bereft of an indication from the government about the direction in which it will proceed on this bipartisan, unanimous report by the committee. amount of work that goes into preparing committee reports. I think this report, with the level of bipartisan support that it had and prepared in the way in which it was, is an excellent report. It speaks well of the parliament for the outcome that was achieved. I just make that clear. The report is one that is obtaining a good deal of attention from the government. My role, as one of the ministers who carries responsibility for aspects of the areas in which the committee made recommendations, is to put to government a submission on how you might deal with the recommendations if you were minded to implement them. The recommendations were very wide ranging. I think there has been an element of speculation in some of the comments that I have seen in the press, which are not necessarily based in reality. Let me just say that I have not seen any suggestion that, if you were to implement the recommendation-and there are various ways in which you might implement it-it would cost that amount of money for a tribunal per se. It depends upon whether you are implementing some of the other recommendations that relate to various forms of counselling and the investigatory body that you have referred to. You then get a series of add-ons. They are not necessarily add-ons; they may in fact be recommendations that you could implement discretely. We have not concluded our view, but $600 million is not appropriate. On the constitutionality of the proposal, I was aware that the government’s Chief General Counsel, Mr Burmester, appeared before the committee and gave certain advice. I cannot tell you about advice given to the government. We do not normally table our opinions in relation to these matters. But I am aware that Burmester gave some advice that there were aspects of the judicial function that could not be divested to a tribunal and there were other elements of decision making in relation to family law matters that might be able to be dealt with by a tribunal. It is important to understand that, if you were going to implement the recommendation, not all of the work that would be undertaken by magistrates or the Family Court would be able to be divested to a tribunal. I just make that very clear. MAIN COMMITTEE",254,Atsis About This As Recently As Today I Do Not Think There Will Be Any Indication That He Has
302,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (6.56 p.m.)-MightI say that I know thestill decide to challenge it later. The whole issue of constitutionality would arise. I might say that a former Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, who was not appointed by this government, also has a view on these matters. His view is that much of the recommendation that the committee made might be beyond its power. The only point I would make is that, while there is certainly the advice of the Chief General Counsel, it is an issue that is not necessarily uncontestable. I just make that point. I understand why the issue of the investigatory arm is pushed. You were right to raise it as an issue of concern. If you have children who are being abused and you need to get independent verification of that, you need to get it from somewhere. One of the things the Family Court has been doing, I think through Project Magellan, is looking at how it can get that level of advice in a trial from family and community services departments in their various forms in each of the states and territories. The reality is that the range of issues that those departments have to deal with in relation to children, for which the states or territories have responsibility, are testing the capacity of those organisations. Unfortunately, they do not see family law matters as having the same priority as other matters. (Extension of time granted) I would like to conclude in relation to this issue. The difficulty we have is in relation to the extent to which there should be cost shifting by the states from the role that they should properly be fulfilling as the Commonwealth sets up its own investigatory arm. That is an issue. Family Court and the Magistrates Court, which has been growing. If the growth had not been there, you might well have seen magistrates replacing Family Court judges. But, as I understand it, while there were some appointments that were not filled, because of magistrate appointments, it has not meant that we could simply substitute a Federal Court judge with a magistrate directly in every case. Obviously, we continue to look at these matters in terms of the workload that needs to be met. I am concerned about the time that it takes for some of these matters to be raised. I would like to see family courts being more informal in the way in which they operate. I have taken an interest in these matters over a long period of time. I think, for a whole variety of reasons, a degree of formality that has grown up over time may not be necessary. I was particularly interested in some of the commentary of the committee that was not developed into recommendations. I have certainly looked at how we might, if we wanted to, take up those comments. This is not a matter in which we are seeking to delay; it is a matter on which there is a very significant level of dialogue and consultation within the government to implement recommendations in the best possible way, being conscious that this has been a very important report-one which we believe brought great credit to those members who were involved. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (7.03 p.m.)-I thank the Attorney-General for that information, which has obviously been a matter which many people on both sides of parliament are dealing with. I might encourage the Attorney, if and when the government is in a position to do this, to consult closely with us. I think that most people would feel that family law and family breakdown are issues that rarely divide along party lines.

306,Mr Ruddock,"It is an issue. The only other matter I would raise is the workload of thecontentious issue unanimously does mean that any further options which the government might have developed in a different way should be discussed in detail with us. We look forward to the opportunity to do that. I might also just ask the Attorney in passing, given that he has raised the question of workload for the Family Court, if he would like to comment on why it is that in the budget we have announcements about eight extra federal magistrates to deal with immigration matters when, in fact, the pressure on the court for assistance in family law matters is actually well in advance of the workload that is required in immigration matters. I would like it if the Attorney could give me assurances that those new magistrates are going to be operating across all areas of the federal magistracy rather than being eight allocated immigration magistrates. That would be something that I would think would be useful for the community to know. My last area of questions in addition to that question about the federal magistracy goes to community legal centres. I wonder if the Attorney can talk to the parliament in a little more detail about the decision to provide no extra funding in the budget for community legal centres. The Attorney would be aware that a very strong proposal was put forward by the National Association for Community Legal Centres that suggested in particular that there were major viability problems for many community legal centres. I am conscious that one of the critical issues that was raised was the ongoing viability of many community legal centres. I was hoping that you might be able to provide us with some assurance or guarantee here that you are confident that all community legal centres will be able to remain open after 30 June this year given that there is no increase in their budget and very strong cases have been put as to the increasing costs for running their services, which provide a great support to many people in all of our electorates. I am wondering if, in addition to that, there are any longer term plans for expanding CLCs and providing better support. The first question is on the viability of the current services but the second question is about any long-term planning. I am wondering if the Attorney might want to comment not just on the additional cost that clearly any service would be facing-that is, increased cost of rents and telephone services and others-but also on whether the Attorney is aware that the current average pay rate for a principal solicitor in a community legal centre is $46,200 per annum whereas an equivalent person in private practice in Sydney or Melbourne would earn between $75,000 and $110,000 per annum. I am not, of course, asking whether consideration has been given to providing comparable rates, but has any consideration been given to making sure that qualified legal practitioners can actually be paid if they work in community legal centres-and still meet their rent, phone line services, electricity bills and others? the honourable member with some statistics which have been made known to me over a period of time. The point I would make is that community legal services operate in areas in which the advice at times will be in relation to federal matters-that is, matters for which the Australian government is responsible-and in other cases will be on matters that arise under state jurisdiction. While some states have contributed to the ongoing cost of meeting community legal services, in other states there is no contribution. Ms Roxon-So you still don’t have to keep up with inflation?

I will get you the table, but these are indicative figures. In South Australia it was about 20 per cent. In Western Australia they are talking about making contributions, but essentially it is in the order of one or two per cent. I do not think there is any contribution in other territories or Tasmania.

But, in terms of the information that I have before me, if I took it to an expenditure review and asked my colleagues to provide extra funding I do not think they would be saying, ‘We think that the Commonwealth ought to be putting more in while states do not think it is worthy to make a commitment at all.’ That is the only point I am making. These are your fraternal colleagues. If this isMs Roxon-You didn’t even ask for any more. cap in hand to the ERC and see if I can get some extra money out of it. General with respect to the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner, which we have spoken about briefly in a private capacity on an earlier date. I would like to set the context of that by quoting from an interview earlier this year between Chris Uhlmann and Malcolm Crompton, the then federal Privacy Commissioner. It is a quote that I have used before. It is quite detailed, but I think it does get to the nub of some of the issues facing that organisation. The interview was in February and went as follows: privacy law that came into place a couple of years ago where our complaints workload has gone up five-fold-quintupled. Unfortunately we were only funded for a doubling of the complaints workload before that came into place and we haven’t been given further funding. What we have had to do instead has been to reallocate resources within the office into the complaints area. Got a lot more people doing work in there, but unfortunately it’s not enough to clean up the backlog, so much as to try and stop the backlog getting any longer. So we’re doing our best but there is a very finite resource restraint unfortunately. tion is a challenge for any government, and those are the resources they have given us.

311,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (7.10 P.m.),"I would like to raise a question with the Attorneybut the thing that I can say is that I have made them continuously aware of the issues from the moment the private sector privacy law started a couple of years ago. I have kept them continuously up-to-date, I have made the Attorney aware of the amount of money that I believe would be needed to begin to address this problem. How he has taken that forward is a matter for him to answer. for example in the areas that directly affect individuals I have literally had to cancel the audit program that the office is empowered under the law to conduct. That means I am no longer able to audit federal agencies or credited organisations for the way they do their business simply because I haven’t got the resources. I have moved them instead into trying to handle the individual complaints that people make, because I think that is the first line that we have to offer to people. But even having done that and reduced resources in other parts of the office unfortunately I haven’t been able to reduce the backlog. My understanding from the Attorney, when he has been quoted publicly on this issue, is that he maintains that this is principally an issue more in relation to priorities and systemic issues within the organisation. I guess that some time has passed since that particular interview and the particular complaints from the outgoing federal Privacy Commissioner. It is always interesting when you see outgoing government appointments-they tend to be a lot more forthcoming in their views about the way their organisation has been treated. I congratulate Mr Crompton on his honesty about the situation facing OFPC. I would be interested in hearing the comments from the Attorney-General on that particular issue. ber for the questions he has put to me. I might just say that I announced this week, or at the end of last week, the appointment of the new Privacy Commissioner, Karen Curtis. Her appointment begins on 12 July. The only point I would make in relation to the resources is that obviously these matters are the subject of comment from time to time. I imagine that the head of any statutory body would want to obtain or garner more resources for the work that they have to undertake. In relation to the Privacy Commissioner, there was new work in implementing private sector amendments that came into effect on 21 December 2001. The cabinet approved at that time initial funding of an additional $5 million for the implementation of those arrangements with ongoing funding thereafter. Currently that ongoing funding is of the order of $1.413 million. The workload of the commission increased as a result of that additional activity. I have noted that from time to time. My view is that you do not necessarily continue to fund to whatever workload emerges in a particular organisation. Sometimes you have to look at whether or not there are systemic issues that might suggest that you should undertake the work that comes to you in a different way. That is a matter that I will want to talk to the new commissioner about. I am on the public record as saying that the systemic issues are matters that I think ought to be looked at as much as the question of resourcing of the organisation in itself. I might say that, while it is not my responsibility, I have noticed that at the moment in New South Wales, where there is a privacy responsibility, the New South Wales government has in fact been reducing funding in this area. You may care to have a look and see how your fraternal colleagues also view the issue of privacy when you are pursuing with me a view that I should be finding extra resources.

312,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (7.14 p.m.)-I thank the honourable memSouth Wales Liberal Party talks about the issue of fraternal colleagues, but that is just by the by. With respect to the response from the Attorney, I would again like to come to a response interview that he had with Chris Uhlmann the week after the Crompton interview-again in mid-February-which raises issues around the system but also makes a point about the issue being dealt with in a budgetary context. I will again quote from that before I make a couple of comments. The interview went as follows: that’s provided by statutory officers as part of the consideration as to the way in which resourcing ought to be applied. But I’d go back to the starting point of your article in CHOICE. I haven’t read it, but what I have read indicated to me a matter which is of concern to me, I might say, and that is that there is a lot of information that these credit reference organisations obtain which appears on the face of it to be incorrect and it suggests me that there is a systemic problem. The question you have to ask itself is whether you address the systemic problem. I mean part of the issue I think was that most of the mistakes were likely to jeopardise creditors or credit bodies being able to follow accurately whether or not people they were dealing with are of concern. And most of the information it seemed was information about names and dates of birth and so on that were incorrectly recorded, which means that you probably wouldn’t get an adverse reference. But I think that the approach that CHOICE were taking in asking for a look at the systemic system involved in this sort of information was probably the correct one. enough money to do his job? load of cases because there is a systemic problem. I mean he is claiming there’s been a five-fold increase in complaints and that what has happened is that his budget has only been doubled. I mean there has been a substantial increase in resources that the Privacy Commissioner has received, but you have to look at the question, and we would do this in a budget context, about whether more resources are appropriate given just that there’s an increase in the number of complaints, or whether you’d look behind the complaints and ask yourself whether there’s a systemic problem that needs to be addressed. On that question, there certainly are systemic problems that need to be addressed, but the fact of the matter is that we are still dealing with a situation where, for two years now, there has been a significant increase-a quintupling-of the workload for the Privacy Commissioner. The circumstances are that we have not seen the funding increase to match that. That last paragraph is a quote from me from an earlier speech. The point I arrive at from there is that these systemic issues are not new. I appreciate that the Attorney has only been in the position for a little time now. The commissioner was saying in the earlier quote that he had been raising these issues for quite some time now. I wonder if the Attorney could give us any advice about whether in fact the department has previously looked at those systemic issues and, if not, why not. On from that, when we look at the question of the likely basis of systemic problems in this area, I can appreciate that systemic problems can lead to a rise in complaints to a degree, but I question whether a quintupling in those circumstances is likely to be explained away to the extent that would be required in order to allow the Privacy Commissioner to be able to do its job. I remind the Attorney that just a matter of weeks ago-in fact, in March-there was a Privacy Amendment Bill which, as I understand it, loaded some extra responsibilities onto the MAIN COMMITTEE",259,Uhlmann Are You Disappointed Crompton Of Course I D Like To Be Able To Offer A Better Service Than I Am Able To Offer Up To Now
313,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (7.17 P.m.),"I am always bemused when a member of the NewPrivacy Commissioner, again with no increase in funding. I also ask: given that the matter was considered in the budgetary context, as he says, but the result of that was in fact a very small cut to the funding of the commission for the coming budget period, is that the proper response? I know from discussions that I have had with the Attorney that the very small cut related to a particular issue, so I am not making a point that it was a cut in any dramatic sense, but there certainly was not an increase. In fact, in actual terms, there was a very small adjustment down. In the circumstances where we are dealing with a quintupling, in a situation where systemic problems have obviously been in place for some time and where the Privacy Commissioner maintains he has been raising these issues with government for some time, and we are now here some four months later with a new commissioner coming into place-and that is an important part of what needs to be done-does the Attorney really believe that this matter has been dealt with expeditiously by the government? that I deal with are dealt with far more expeditiously than I have seen issues in this department being dealt with at earlier points in time under various administrations. I just make that point. I am not known for sitting on my hands if an issue can be addressed. Mr Griffin interjectingthe observation that you were very generous in terms of our private discussions in reflecting the dialogue between us. That is as I would expect, I might say, given our long standing familiarity-you may not want it to be friendship-with each other. But the point was simply that this small reduction resulted from a non-recurrent funding in 2003-04 for Comcover insurance premium and other minor reductions. It was not an effective cutting of the organisation; it was just a variation that occurs. But it is quite clear that we did not increase the overall appropriation for the Privacy Commissioner, and I am not asserting that we did. I thought the discussion with Mr Uhlmann was very civilised. Usually my wife would correct my grammar, and I listened for some awkward expressions that I might have used, but, putting that to one side, I thought it was a fairly accurate reflection of what I believe is the situation. If you have a large number of individual complaints that are being received because organisations in the private sector are collecting information in a particular way and people believe they have a remedy by an individual complaints mechanism, you have to ask whether or not, if you changed the systems and had the organisations addressing these issues in a far more effective way, you would reduce the level of complaints. I have not asked my department whether they have a view or have investigated this matter. I will now ask them, but I have not asked them. Given her background, I do intend to discuss with the new Privacy Commissioner whether or not the systemic issues can be addressed. My preference is for that, rather than just seeing an inexorable increase in individual complaints, if they can be addressed in other ways. move on to other things, at least tomorrow. On that issue of the new Privacy Commissioner, I would like to quote briefly from an article in the Australian to give us the context of how that may well in fact go. The article was headed ‘Privacy boss to face tough times’ and said: New Federal Privacy Commissioner Karen Curtis faces an uphill battle for resources needed to do her job, privacy advocates say.

There’s no magic wand that’s going to convey extra resources.” Anyone “brave enough to walk into that job confronts that absolute problem of trying to get two square pegs into one round hole”, he said. That’s going to be a huge challenge for her. I think she’ll be told to manage with what she’s got.” AlthoughI agree with the magic wand point, I alert the Attorney to the expectations in the community sector about how that might actually go. I certainly wish the new commissioner all the very best of British in terms of trying to work through those issues, because I suspect that Mr Britton is right about the likelihood of the resources front. I would certainly be interested to hear back about what the department has advised on this issue. With respect to his other point, certainly I have always considered him to be a friend, in the context of where one has friends in this place; but I certainly would not broadcast that too loudly amongst some of my colleagues. ticles, as you might expect.
