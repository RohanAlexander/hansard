0,"2douse Of I&Epvrscntattbes. Friday, 27 October, A.m., Ancl Read Prayers. Minister Was Delivering His Budget Speech Last Night! Failing To Notice, Although I Was Following Him Closely, That He Had Ceased From Speaking In Regard |To The Northern Territory And Was Dealing With Matters Affecting Papua, I Interjected, "" When Are You Going To Send A Live Man Up There?"" Meaning The Northern Territory, But, Of Course, As Reported The Interjection Seems To Refer To Papua. Any Imputation I Might Make In Regard To The Administration Of Papua Would Be As Unjust As It Would Be Ungenerous. I Knew The Administrator For Some Time Previous To His Appointment, Of Which I Cordially Approved, And Which His Work Has Fully Justified. I Have Not Had The Pleasure Of Meeting The Lieutenant","Governor, but his popularity, and the esteem in which he is held, give the most complete and emphatic contradiction to any reflection on his administration. I desire to unequivocally deny any intention of reflecting on the administration of Papua. Further, I thank the Prime Minister for the offer of the post, which he made so publicly, and which I as publicly decline, with thanks, although I feel highly honoured by the offer, inasmuch as this is the first occasion upon which a member of this party has had an offer of anything like a decent billet from the Labour Government. External Affairs noticed the following statement in this morning's newspaper:DEAR FOOD IN GERMANY. Berlin, 26th October. The debate on the subject of dear food was continued in the Reichstag yesterday. I-Ierr Delbrueck, Minister for the Interior, said the importation of Argentine cattle into Germany would not be permitted owing to the danger of Texas fever being introduced into the country. Frozen meat, he remarked, had gained a certain footing in Great Britain, but the people endeavoured to avoid it. Great Britain during tbe Boer war suffered badly owing to the inferiority of tinned meats. Seeing that our export trade' in meat is likely to develop materially, and that we hope to do business largely with Germany, IQII. as well as with France, will the Minister cause a report to be forwarded to the German and French Governments regarding the manner in which meat exported from Australia is examined prior to export? paragraph until the honourable member brought it under my notice. I shall see that the High Commissioner is notified, and that the steps necessary to do what the honourable member suggests are taken. on a question some time ago by the honourable member for Maribyrnong as to markets for our frozen meat and butter in Germany, I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether he is aware that under the contract between the German Government and the Norddeutscher-LIoyd line of steamers, that company is prevented from carrying any such produce from Australia to Germany. And, if this be so, will the Minister endeavour to take steps to have the contract so modified that we may have the benefit of the German market? or not there is such a clause in the contract under which the subsidy is granted by the German Government. I remember that, some years ago, when I took part in a Royal Commission on the mail service, I understood that there was such a condition, but, in any case, it is a matter for the German Government alone. If that Government chose to grant a subsidy under the terms indicated, I cannot see that we have any right, even by inference, to interfere. Speaker, why the notice of motion regarding the appointment of a Commission to inquire into the Sugar Commission, which I moved, is not now on the notice-paper? ber was good enough to inform me this morning that he would ask this question, and I am glad to have an opportunity to explain the position.

Yesterday, however, at 26 minutes past 4, when the honourable member's motion was called on for discussion, the honourable member for Lang moved, in his absence, that its consideration be postponed until that day week. That motion was negatived, the House deciding by a majority that it should not be postponed until that day week. When the division had been taken, it was 32 or 33 minutes past 4, and past the time fixed by tlie Sessional Order for the calling on of other business.

If we introduced a provision requiring all employers to organize, and followed up that provision with what is really the essence of the object in view by requiring that all employers and employees in an industry should be bound by an award, I do not know whether such an amendment would be valid. I believe, however, that there are members of the Opposition who desire to secure what would be something approaching a common rule by such a re-arrangement of our legislation as would enable an award of the Court to bind the employers in a clearly-denned industry, such as mining. member compel both sides to register under the Act? to be gained by compelling the employers to register. The register is simply an indication of what organization is to be reized labour taking another. Another point garded as representative of the industry affected. There might be two organizations connected with an industry. The register would merely show which of those bodies properly represented labour for the purposes of the presentation of a dispute to the Court. Registration of an organization of employers is unnecessary, because we can always identify a particular employer affected. If we went further and declared that on registration all members of the organization should be bound, whether they were parties to the dispute or not, and if we could get all concerned into such an organization, I think registration would be necessary the Constitution? throwing out a few suggestions as to what would render arbitration possible, in the direction of something approaching a common rule, without taking over the whole industrial power. My point is that the Government are reducing the inducements on a voluntary basis for employers to organize, and also impairing the effectiveness of preresult of this inquiry it should appear that the senting a dispute by declaring that employees need not organize. In the case of a dispute affecting half those engaged in a wide industry, there would be nothing to prevent the higher than that which has previously prevailed,. non-unionists presenting a case to the Court although the members of the organization of labour relating to the industry might not wish to go on. They might have settled the dispute by some industrial agreement. Because they were organized, they would be subject to penalties if they broke through such an agreement or did anything in the nature of a strike. But we might have a body of men who have never taken upon their shoulders any of the responsibilities incidental to securing an industrial agreement. They might be discontented for some reason or other with the terms accepted by the organization, and they could present a dispute .to the Court. We should have in the same industry parties who were bound and parties who were not. hardly be heard if there was a large organization. trial dispute, the Court would be judicially bound to hear it. Assuming that half the labour in a particular industry were organized and half unorganized, then, under this amendment, we might have the organized labour taking one view, and the disorganis that the only means of enforcing an award as against labour at present is through organization. I could show that by reference to several sections of the principal Act. Right through the Act organization is regarded as an excellent method of putting the demands of labour in a particular industry before the Court, and my fear is that by taking away the inducements to organize we shall impair the efficiency of the law. The English Labour Commission, in 1894, presented a very extensive report on the conditions of labour, in which it recommended the organization of employers and employees for bringing about industrial peace. In paragraph 66 of their report we have the following statement :We have considered it to be our main object, so far as relates to these associations, whether of employers or employed, and their larger development in the shape of federations of associations, to inquire to what extent their existence or absence, strength or weakness, in various trades and occupations have affected, for good or evil, the relations between employers and employed,, and are a cause -of, or obstacle to, conflicts between the classes. If , and in so far as in the increase of strength and organization in these industrial bodies tends, on the whole (in spite of occasional conflicts of great magnitude), towards the establishment of a kind of industrial peace",17,Conciliation And Arbitration

There we find the English Commission, appointed to inquire into the conditions of . labour and what would conduce towards industrial peace, recommending organization, the only qualification being that, when the organization becomes too widespread by disregarding particular industries, there may be too great pressure brought to bear upon some members, or upon the community at large. In the subsequent amendments proposed by the Attorney-General we are widening the scope of these organizations in a way to which one may direct criticism subsequently. I do not want to propose an amendment, but must express regret that we are departing from what was declared in 1904 to be the very essence of the presentation of disputes to the Court. It is not necessary to the presentation of a dispute to the Court that there must be organization on the part of the employers, so long as it is not presented by the employees. The registrar may certify that there is an industrial dispute, or an industrial dispute may be referred by a State authority to the Court without there being an organization. That, I think, rather strengthens my argument. The Act is symmetrical at present, and by these amendments we are removing inducements to effective organization. I agree, in the main, with the statement of the case by the honourable member for Angas, but, at the same time, should like to restate my objections to the proposed amendments of the Act in my own. words and in my own way. proposals of the Government, we ought to be guided by two groups of considerations. The first is, whether the proposed new scheme of registration and organization aimed at by this amending Bill would be expedient, wise, just, or prudent, and whether it would tend to effectuate the main object of the arbitration scheme embodied in the principal Act. The second consideration is whether, even if the Bill were passed by Parliament, it would be within the scope of the Federal power. I submit that the proposed amendments of organization and registration would not be wise, effective, or prudent. The main object of the scheme of arbitration embodied in the principal Act is the settlement of industrial vation of industrial peace, and not the manufacture 01 fomenting of disputes. be rather to extend and widen the possible area of disputes, to create fictitious and artificial disputes, rather than to settle real, substantial, tangible disputes as they arise in the ordinary course of industrial controversy and conflict. The scheme of arbitration as embodied in the principal Act prepared_by the late Mr C. C. Kingston was, in its way, a ""masterpiece of industrial legislation. Above all, it gave expression to the true spirit and principle of the interpretation of the Constitution. No doubt it was at the outset a serious and important problem to construe and give effect to the power conferred upon this Parliament, by paragraph xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution, to settle industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. There were certain clear and ""distinct limitations to the Federal power in that paragraph"". The Attorney-General quoted specimens of State legislation with reference to the settlement of industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. Let me remind him that those hardly help us in determining the true lines ancl principles of Federal legislation on thc subject. The Federal power is distinctly limited, whereas the State power within State boundaries is practically unlimited. Therefore, samples of State legislation giving the State Courts power to deal wilh; all kinds of employment?, vocations, and crafts, have no application, and afford no real assistance or guide to us in keeping within the limits of the Federal power. What would be the use of any further legislation aimed at improving this machinery, if it facilitated In viewing these and promoted industrial strife or controversies that could not be dealt with by the Federal tribunal which has been created? It may be that this amended scheme, when adopted, will, on the face of it, appear to be within the exercise of the Federal power. I do not say that it will not, because it merely proposes to eliminate words of construction and interpretation from the principal Act, but thc real difficulty will come later on. This amended scheme of registration and organization, if adopted, will be an encouragement and inducement to a large number of Labour organizations either to maintain their present form of general registration or to induce others to endeavour to secure registration, and the difficulty will arise",18,Conciliation And Arbitration
59,Sir John Quick (Bendigo) [J.1.17].,"when they come before the Court to enforce the settlement and determination of difficulties. I agree with the honourable member for Angas that, in order to effectuate this Federal authority, we must have some form of registration and some form of organization. It would be almost impossible to conceive of labour controversies coming before the Court to which mere private individuals were parlies. A private individual would hardly be able to conduct a great campaign in this Court, l t would, therefore, appear that organization of some kind is necessary, but Mr authorized to do by the Act. It would Kingston evidently found the keynote of that organization in the words"" industrial disputes ""-of the Constitution itself. The first condition of any organization is that there must be an industrial dispute, and the second is that that industrial dispute must extend beyond the limits of one State in order to bring Federal jurisdiction into force and operation. An industrial dispute must connote, to use the term used by the Chief Justice in the engine drivers' case, at least two propositions. The first proposition is that there must be two parties to a dispute, and the second is that the dispute must have reference to some question of industry. I apprehend that those are fundamental propositions. words of the Chief Justice? his very words. According to the Argus Law Reports, page 289, he saidI adhere to what I said in the Woodworkers Case, 15, A.L.I?., 381, on this point"" The disof conditions. pute must be single in the sense that there must be .1 substantial 'community of interest amongst the demandants and amongst those who refuse the demand."" That shows that there must be two parties to the dispute, a claimant or group of claimants on the one hand, and a combatant or contestant or group of combatants, contestants, or employers on the other. pute unless there were two parties? am contending. But this amended scheme contemplates a form of registration or organization in which there is to be, as it were, an army of men engaged in a common craft, such as engine-driving, scattered all over Australia, asserting a claim, not against any particular employer, but against the world at large. That, I contend, would not be a dispute, to start with, within the meaning of the Act, because a dispute must be definite, concrete, and capable of being reduced to the shape or form of some issue whicli may be determined by the arbitration tribunal. To allow an army of men, organized or otherwise, representing forms of labour dissociated, separated, scattered all over the continent, to come into Court by a plaint, and say to the Judge, "" We want an increased rate of pay,"" or "" We want an alteration of conditions,"" would be to ask the Judge to do a thing which he is not be impossible to describe a mere general demand for increased pay or altered conditions as a dispute within the meaning of the Act, unless it were reduced to a controversy or dispute or conflict between a definite number of men, capable of ascertainment and determination, on the one side, and a definite number or group of employers, capable of ascertainment ancl determination, on the other, so that they may be brought before a Court. This scheme, however, contemplates the registration and organization of a number of men, not fighting to assert a community of interest or of rights, as against definite employers, but to assert a differentiation of rights. You may have one body of men claiming one rate of pay and one set of conditions, and others of the same class, in other parts of the Commonwealth, claiming different rates and conditions, their only common bond being tbe desire for an increase of pay, or some special improvement setting up a bogy. nite object aimed at. Apart from the unwisdom, inexpediency, and injustice of allowing such cases to be brought before the Arbitration Court, there is cthe objection that such a course raises the constitutional question whether the dispute would be within the jurisdiction of that Court. I do not wish to anticipate a subsequent amendment regarding the abolition of prohibition, but, even should it be carried, and the Arbitration Court determine that there was a dispute when in truth and reality there was not a dispute within the meaning of the Constitution, its decision would be open to review by the High Court on a motion for prohibition.

In the engine-drivers' case the Chief Justice said that it would be inconvenient if all persons who employed, say, carpenters, were regarded as carrying on a common enterprise or industry, and so liable to be involved in one great law suitA good illustration is afforded by the present case, in which the award as proposed would extend to employees engaged in industries of all possible kinds, fioin drivers of locomotives or of winding engines on mines, to men in charge of small gas-engines used in industries in which the use of engine power is merely subsidiary, and to employees engaged in equally diverse industries. The honourable member for Maranoa says that I am raising a bogy, but the engine drivers' case was an attempt to combine in one huge law-suit all the engine-drivers of Australia. munity of interest between all the engine drivers of Australia. driving a high-power steam-engine, and another merely attending to a donkey-engine on a farm. than between the honourable member's profession and the medical profession. of lawyers and doctors could not be decided in the settlement of one dispute. What is contemplated would be unworkable. No Court could arrive at a satisfactory determination on such a multitude of conflicting duties, rights, and interests. Trie Court is to be asked to fix rates of pay and conditions, not for men doing the same class of work, but for men doing different classes of work in different industries. engine-drivers' case. given in regard to shearers and shed hands, who are employed all over Australia. hands are all employed in the same industry, and remunerated by employers of the one class, whose profits all spring from the sale of wool. The pay of engine drivers must be determined by the character of their work, the nature of their attain1 ments and experience, and similar considerations. There is a great difference between an engine-driver in charge of mining machinery and a man in charge of a small engine in the country. ber say that the engine-drivers cannot be classified ? classified according to industries. The scheme of the Act is that organization must be based on industrial community. What is now proposed is the registration in one organization of men engaged in different kinds of work and in different industries. One group of engine-drivers might be working under conditions with which they were highly satisfied, being well paid and well treated. They would not desire to be brought before the Court, but, under the Bill, they could be dragged into litigation to fight some phantom employer. I discussed the engine-drivers' case before I left for England, and could not see how their disputes could be legally or conveniently brought before the Court. the legal one. pointed out that there were legal and practical difficulties. bitration Court did not refer to any but legal difficulties. esteemed official, but not the sole judge of what is convenient and practical. us as are those of the Chief Justice. .said in that caseIt seems to me impossible to deny that the employers and employees concerned in an industrial dispute must be engaged in the same industry as to affirm that every person who employs a carpenter or engine-driver is, in any relevant sense, engaged in the industry of carpentry or engine, driving.

It is not the extension of an industry or calling from one State to another that gives our Court jurisdiction.

West Sydney) [11.45] I again rise to express a hope that we may get along a little faster. The honourable member for Bendigo has very strongly emphasized his objections to this clause; and as I listened to him, I realized for the first time rhle clangers that beset the road we are treading. Unfortunately there is absolutely nothing the honourable member said that has any relevance to the question before the Committee. proached this question with his mind fresh and vigorous from long fallowing ancl ploughing in pleasant lands, was apparently quite unaware, until the honourable member for Maranoa told him, that an award had been made. the question as if it were the introduction of a new and dangerous principle, whereas it is merely making certain that which is clearly implied in the Act, and was always understood to be enforced therein, so as to leave no room for doubt. I call the honourable member's attention to section 4 of the Act of 1004, in which is the definition of ""industrial dispute"" as it left the hands of the late Mr Kingston, upon whom a very eloquent eulogy was delivered by my honourable friend. "" industrial dispute "" is defined as a disputefa) arising between an employer or an organization of employers on the one part and an organization of employees on the other part, or lb) certified by the Registrar as proper in the ber in the Committee to vote for it. Howpublic interests to be dealt with by the Court. lhat was struck out later, but, at the time the Bill was first placed on the table it contained that clause, and in that shape it was passed into law. That Bill was introduced by the Government of which the honourable member for Bendigo was a follower and a supporter; and it left in the hands ot one man-and that man not the Judge but the Registrar-to decide what an ""industrial dispute"" was, with all those terrible potentialities for danger that my honourable friend pointed out. For seven years this principle has been acted upon, and not the least shadow of tliese disasters has appeared. We are proposing the amendment of the Act because we desire to give the Court power to deal with all conceivable industrial disturbances, subject to the constitutional limitations which, as we know, usually arise between organizations of employees and employers. This the present Act does not do, for several reasons. It may happen for some reason or other lhat men do not organize. For instance, when there was a dispute among the wharf labourers in Sydney, some fifty men formed themselves into what they described as a union, and called themselves free labourers for the purpose of doingthe work on the wharfs. They were an organization merely for the purpose of defeating the unionists. Nothing is more likely than that the interference of such a .body of men will create disturbance. Everybody knows that it is like a The honourable member who apred rag to a bull when bodies of so-called free labourers claim the right of unionists. I am not saying whether that is sensible or expedient, but merely stating a fact. The proposed amendment of the Act is to make it perfectly clear that the Court has jurisHe dealt with diction to deal with such associations as with any other body. As to everything else the honourable member for Bendigo said, we can discuss it when, we are dealing with the proposed amendment of the Act to which it is relevant. It may be pointed out, however, that the honourable member for Angas took quite an opposite view to that of the honourable member for Bendigo, and desired that everybody should come into organizations, indeed, In that section he even went so far as to suggest that all employers should be organized. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to hear the honourable member move an amendment to that effect-nothin g would give me greater pleasure than to ask every memever, had the Government made such a proposal no protection or walls would have been strong enough to prevent the shafts of criticism piercing our unfortunate hides I am between Scylla and Charybdis-between the suggestion that we go too far,",21,Conciliation And Arbitration

85,Mr Hughes (Attorney,"Generaland the suggestion that we do not go far enough 1 hope the Committee will accept the clause as it stands. -The Attorney-General has left out the qualification made by the honourable member for Angas, who spoke of clearly defined industries, and urged that if we couldget complete organization of employers and employees in an industry he would like to see it, so that an award might deal with all the parties concerned. under another clause for Angas did not wish to discuss under this clause any question but that of organization : and he asked why it was proposed to strike out the words. According to the Act, ""industrial dispute"" means one extending beyond the limits of anv one State, ancl arising between an employer or an organization of employers on the one part and an organization of employees on the other part. What the honourable member for Angas said was that, by strikbg out these words proposed to be omitted, there seems to be a desire to discourage organization, while the whole scheme of the Act was directed to encourage the registration of organizations. There is an advantage in having an organization on each side, because the views of each can be crystallized ancl responsibility thrown on clearly defined bodies, ancl a distinct claim formulated.' The evidence and material on which the opinion is formed is accessible, and there is a record of the persons who can be bound by the award. sons for preference to unionists? organization-ther e are auite other reasons when the object is political. The object of striking out the words seems to be to allow the vaguest kinds of association to have the benefit of the Act. clear that what was in the original Act still stands. original Act was to encourage organization, but, according to tlie proposal before us, any association, whether registrable under the Act or not, may be proclaimed. ber cloes not object to that? couraging organization as defined under the Act', the amendment will encourage men not to register, because ill-defined associations outside the Act will be able to get the same benefit as clo registrable associations. organize and register. we can to encourage them to do so. by the proposal before us. do not register, the employees cannot "" ge; at "" them. ployes can appeal to the Court, and even if the employers are not registered the men can "" get at "" them. long as the men do ""get at "" them? there were 177 defendants, and the difficulty was that there was no common bond of interest to enable them to register as one employers association. For instance, the defendants included the City Council of Sydney, the Commissioner of Works of New South Wales, the Tasmanian Smelting Company, and so forth ; and no organization was possible on a common basis. There is danger in striking out the words lest we defeat the purpose in view, namely, to get all registrable organizations registered under the Act. I cannot understand the arguments from the other side, which in the general debate were to the effect that the Bill was giving a premium to organizations. The Bill is before us because of the difficulty in the engine-drivers' case, caused by the High Court's interpretation of "" industry.""

106,Mr Fowler (Perth) [11.50],"I havethat he was within the limits of the Constitution, he had no alternative but to give that decision. No one acquainted with that case would hesitate to admit that it was only a very partial presentment of a. case which would undoubtedly, if this power were conceded, be developed under the amending Act. I cannot understand how it is that honourable members opposite do not realize the danger to their own movement that will come from the mad craze for unification and centralization whicli has overtaken them during the last year or two. We have been told by interjection to-day that the case of the engine-drivers is fairly well instanced by the analogy of the senior and junior members of the legal profession. To my mind there is not the slightest similarity. _ Let us put the case of a man controlling a gasolene motor in a sausage-making establishment in Melbourne alongside that of an engine-driver in charge of a huge complicated steam-engine on one of the Western Australian mines. ber ever had any experience of the difficulties that often arise in driving an oil-motor? I desire honourable members to consider at what period in his career, a man in charge of a .gasolene motor, complicated and intricate though it may be, will be competent to take charge of a large steamengine such as we find in use on the Western Australian mines? He may work the one for a lifetime, and never be able to control the other for the reason that the two engines are entirely dissimilar. The two industries are also entirely different; there is no connection whatever between them. Therefore, these analogies as regards other industries are altogether pointless. The danger that I see to the principle of arbitration and to the Labour movement in this connection is that what may be described as a wholesale judicial decision in a case such as that of the engine-drivers would apply to the whole Commonwealth, and must of necessity deal with a tremendous variation of employment and a variation in the nature of the machinery handled by the men. utterly impossible for any one decision to fit all these varying cases; there is sure to be friction and dissatisfaction here and there. Take a case that I have in mind as bearing on the possibility of any judicial authority being able to apply one uniform decision all over Australia. We have in Western Australia what is called a special concession to the postal employees employed on the gold-fields; but it has been all along a matter of irritation amongst our postal servants in that State that the decision does not recognise the full differentiation between the case'of Commonwealth, employees in Western Australia as compared with that of the Commonwealth servants in the eastern States. It is only a mere make-believe. Any one who looks at this matter broadly must realize that the tendency of all judicial decisions 5s asnear as possible to a condition of uniformity. I know that honourable members opposite are aiming at uniformity in this matter, because they think it will centralize the control and authority of those who control labour organizations in a political sense. This Bill is, I believe., the handiwork of the Attorney-Genera!, and members of his party are accepting it in entire ignorance of its true significance. There is no doubt that if it is found to be constitutional, and an attempt is made under tliis power to give decisions regarding industries of the nature of the engine drivers, it will lead ultimately to the disintegration and demoralization of labour, both politically and industrially. -The honourable member for Perth has mis-, understood the scope and object of the clause before the Committee. Both he and the honorable member for Bendigo must admit that the obiect which both parties had inview in introducing legislation of this cliaracter was to settle industrial disputes and bring about industrial peace. Take the position in wbich we stand to-day. Will it be denied by the Opposition that a judicial decision of the High Court regarding an interpretation of the Court below has practically prevented the older craft industries from reaping the benefit of industrial legislations. Honourable members may raise as many issues as they like in reference to the matter, but that is the position, concisely stated, to-day. In my opinion, that was never the intention of this Parliament, and if we strip this question from all party considerations I do not think it can seriously It is be said to be the intention of the Committee to-day. We hear a great deal about the number of industrial upheavals and strikes that are now taking place; but we have not had serious disputes, calculated to endanger industrial peace, in connection with the old craft industries of Australia. There",23,Conciliation And Arbitration
107,Mr Watkins,Has the honourable mem,24,Conciliation And Arbitration
108,Mr Fowler,I am coming to that.,24,Conciliation And Arbitration
109,Mr Archibald (Hindmarsh) [12.6].,"is a greater tendency in that direction on the part of the younger organizations which have not the experience and knowledge of the older ones. The Australian Workers Union, for instance, has been in existence f'Or something like thirty years, and during that time has gained much experience. And so with the Amalgamated Engineers. The Waterside Workers in my own State have been organized for something like forty years, and in connection with those organizations we have known what strikes really mean to the workpeople. We have learnt how serious are their effects on the workers, apart altogether from their effect on the genera] industry and progress of the country, and the evil they inflict upon innocent persons. periences, and consequently there are more industrial troubles in connection with the modern organizations than there is in connection with the older ones. younger organizations grow older they will learn. and some of us have paid pretty dearly for it. of a trade organization. Even in the absence of industrial legislation the wonderful prosperity which Australia has enjoyed for some time must of necessity have resulted in wages being raised, and in the absence of the effective industrial machinery that we have to-day, we should have had more chaos and strife than at present prevails. If the employers on the one hand, and the employees on the other, were unchecked by industrial legislation the position would be much worse than it is. Do honourable members opposite mean seriously to say that they would shut off from our industrial legislation the whole of our ancient labour organizations-organization s having behind them in some cases the traditions of a hundred years or more ? Are they going to say that we have a new patentCourt-created "" industry "" and new patentlawyer-created ""industrial disputes,"" and that these old craft industries of the English-speaking people are to be cut off? cluded. are. It is remarkable that in appeals from the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to the High Court we generally have a majority decision of three to two. means that in reality the decision of one Justice in the Arbitration Court can be reversed by another Justice in the High Court. We want to ascertain how far it is possible to secure industrial peace under the Constitution as it stands; and we must necessarily keep on amending our industrial legislation. It may suit the press to say that we are ""patching"" legislation, but, patching or no patching, we must in the interests of industrial peace make our industrial legislation as perfect as possible, and ascertain the limits to which we can go. I do not disguise my opinion that the dual control of legislation in this regard must be attended with failure. It is an axiom that if you want good government vou must have undivided control, and since the power to legislate on industrial matters is divided between the Commonwealth and the States, we must have failures.

It was the New South Wales employers who forced the engine drivers into the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Mr Justice Heydon roundly lectured the Northern colliery employers because they would not meet the men and the Engine-Drivers and Firemen's Assoeiation repeatedly tried to meet the employers in New South Wales, but was told that better conditions could not be granted because of the Inter-State competition.. Therefore the Association-rightly , in my opinion-se t about organizing the engine drivers and firemen in the other States, and' wealth Arbitration Court.

Clause agreed to. Clause3 (Definition of "" industry "" ) . intend to speak at length on this clause, because it has already been fairly well discussed. The difficulty in the engineers' case arose from the fact that, unlike the case of any other dispute, there was a great number of callings within the organization. In the bootmakers' case there was only one calling, and the position was the same in the harvesters' case. In the engineers' case, however, we had engineers engaged in various classes of mining. as well as greasers, oilers, and fitters. There matter what the dispute is. The High Court were some eighteen or nineteen different classes in all, and during the early part of the hearing some five or six were struck out by the President of the Court by consent. Fitters, for instance, were struck out as not being properly engineers, being claimed by another association, and therefore men who ought not to have been brought into that dispute. No matter how we look at this question, there are difficulties; but it may be, on the whole, better for the employees that they sliould be capable of uniting in craft unions for the purpose of dealing with disputes. There is a special difficulty in the case of the engineers, who, taken by themselves, are a comparatively small body. In these Inter-State disputes a large body of men is required. If the engineers' organization were confined purely to engineers and firemen, and perhaps to the oilers connected with engines, its total membership would be so small that it would be felt that they could not bring much momentum to bear in connection with an industrial dispute. It was for this reason, no doubt, that they brought in a number of employees really not related to engineering, and that seems to have been the cause of their failure. One can understand that those who favour craft unionism The Government do so, because, under it, a settlement can be obtained applying at once to all these different classes. From the employees point of view there is a good deal of reason in that. Hitherto these organizations have been unions dealing with State matters and regulated under the industrial determinations of State Boards. Questions were settled by the Boards independent of any dispute between particular employers and employees, and they set for the whole union some standard rate of wages. But under our arbitration law the same end cannot easily be obtained. Being a judicial matter, there must be some relation of employer and employed. In the circumstances, confining, as the High Court decision does, the term "" industry "" to a number of men engaged in some homogenous trade, _and confining, as the Act does at present, the term ""employment '' to persons '' engaged for hire ' ' in some particular employment, it is very difficult to get a general ruling applicable to all engineers. From the engineers' point of view it seems to be expedient that they, as employees, should have the possibility of obtaining under the guise of arbitration a common standard for all employed, no says that that is not arbitration, -and I doubt if it is; but Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice O'Connor have said in their judgments that there is 110 reason why under the Constitution craft unionism cannot be made the basis of organization. On the other hand, we have the difficulty of the employers. Under craft unionism we cannot easily get an organization of employers.

191,Mr Glynn,"I do not think so. Theorganization. On the engine-drivers decision, they certainly could not have organized, because the same objection, that they are not in some definite industry, would hold just as much against the employers' as against the employees' organization. When you come to what are true industrial organizations under the Act, and extend your craft unionism, you diminish on the other side the incentive to organize to meet that craft unionism,, because it is beyond the bounds of possibility, for instance, to get an organization of all the employers who were made respondents in the engine-drivers' case. They covered all sorts of mining, smelting at Port Pirie, electric works, electric wire men, and others who had not the remotest connection or interest as employers. The objection from the employers' point of view that I see to widening the definition of ""industry,"" is that it will incidentally diminish the inducement to effective organization on their part under the Act. In the circumstances it is inexpedient to seek, under the guise of arbitration, to bring in craft unionism. I recognise the difficulties, and do not propose to move an amendment. On the whole, 1 believe it will be constitutional. Mr Justice O'Connor thought that under the Act as it stands craft unionpresent legislation was based upon that Act ism would be included -whic h I did say in a totally different Mr W. H . IRVINE Mr Justice Isaacs thought it would be. Jumbunna case. Mr VV. H . IRVINE -He said so in the engine-drivers' case. ference lo it by Mr Justice Isaacs in the Jumbunna case. He then referred to an industry practically as covering everything that appears in this definition as it will be amended. He said the definition of "" industry,"" appeared to mean a business, such as that of a merchant, a trade, a manufacturer, such as a flour-miller, an undertaking such as that of a gas company, a calling such as that of an engineer, a service such as that of a carrier, or an employment. He said that, in his opinion, a general terra' like ""calling"" would be an industry embracing some others than those mentioned, and intended to refer to general vocations. He added that, as the Act stood, the governing terms were those now to be struck out, and that the relation of employer and employee was connoted by them. If , then, we knock out, as the amendment does, the words "" in which persons are employed for pay, hire, advantage, or reward,"" it seems to me, according to what the Judges have said, that the definition of ""industry "" in terms of an aggregation of employers or an aggregation of employees would 'be within the meaning of the Constitution. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [2.34]. -This clause is undoubtedly the key clause to the whole Bill, the last that was passed merely making a subsidiary alteration. I do not intend on this clause, although it is really the heart of the Bill, to repeat the arguments I used in the House. In fact, I fail to find from any quarter of the House any definite answer that has been put forward to those arguments. One suggestion was made by the Attorney General, and also, I think, by one other honourable member on the other side of the House, to the effect that, if the view which we are urging from this side was right, how was it that in New South Wales -there was registration of craft unions under the State Arbitration Act? In fact, that, to my mind, constituted the main part of the answer which the Attorney-General gase to our arguments. He : cited the Act of New South Wales, and in fact cited me as having said that the connection, dn the engine-drivers' case, the judgment of the majority of the Court proceeded upon this simple ground, that, apart altogether from the particular verbal expressions used, it was plain, from all the main sections of the Act, that the intention and scheme of the Legislature was based upon organization of industries, and not organization of crafts. The interpretation clause was referred to by most of the Judges as not necessarily creating anything inconsistent with that general scheme, but their conclusion was based upon provisions such as section 7, which now the Attorney-General has given notice of his intention to alter, and mainly upon section 55, dealing with the registration of organizations, and upon certain other sections, all of which showed that the word ""industry "" was really used to indicate an aggregation of employers and employees in relation to each other. The Attorney General might, when he referred to the New South Wales Act, have told honourable members that not one of the expressions or the sections in our Act on which the Court relied for the conclusion to which it came, is present in the New South Wales Act at all. Neither",31,Conciliation And Arbitration
192,Mr Glynn,I think he said so in the,32,Conciliation And Arbitration
193,Mr Glynn,"T have here the first rethe expression "" any industry,"" in section 55, which was the main basis of the High Court's decision, nor the provision in section 7, nor, so far as I know, any of the provisions in which the words "" any industry"" were used in our Act, appear in the New South Wales Act. Had the High Court been called upon to decide this question upon the language of the New South Wales Act, it would have been deprived of the basis of the conclusion at which it arrived. Let me iturn to the main section in that Act, corresponding to section 55 of our Act. Section 55 of our Act is the section providing that an organization of. employers which may register is an organization of employers in connection with an industry, and that an organization of employees which may register is an organization of employ6s over 100 in number, connected with any industry. The High Court's main reason for coming to the conclusion they did vvas that it could not be supposed that the Legislature meant those simple words "" in connection with any industry"" to mean one thing at the beginning of the section and another at the end of it. That was the simple and very sensible common-sense basis of their conclusion, but it turned upon those words. What do we find in the similar provision in section 4 of the New South Wales Act of 190:1. It is provided there thatWhere the registrar, or in case of appeal the Court, is satisfied that the provisions of this Act have been complied with, the registrar shall in the prescribed manner and form register as an industrial union (Â«) any person or assoI had cited enough from the judgment ciation of persons, or any incorporated company, or any association of incorporated companies, or of incorporated companies and persons, who or which has in the aggregate throughout the six months next preceding the date of the application for registration employed on an average taken per month not less than fifty employees. That is with regard to employers. There is not a word of "" employers connected with any industry."" The word "" industry "" is not used. vision(#) Any trade union or association of trade unions, or (f) any branchSo that, under the New South Wales law, not only .was there no indication that the organizations or unions that could be registered were organizations or unions on one side or the other in connection with an industry, but the very widest terms were used which in our Act are used to govern the meaning of association, and not of organization at all. There is no provision in the New South Wales Act similar to our section 7, nor, from a hasty look at it, is there any provision similar to section 41, nor is there any provision, so far as I know, from which the Court could in that case come to the conclusion that uncler the New South Wales Act ""industry"" was limited to or was intended to mean an aggregation of employers in connection with their employees. The scheme of our Act, as the Court found, to paraphrase their language for the present, is not like the scheme of the New South Wales Act, under which all associations and trade unions could be registered. The scheme of our A.ct is that we define associations in the widest terms and say that only a certain class of. those associations shall be entitled to be registered-namely , that class of association which is an organization both on the side of the employers and on the side of the employees, in connection with a particular industry. That is the language they adopted. For that reason the Court said that the scheme of the Act was organization of industries. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. tion on one side, what happens ? Mr W. H . IRVINE -The honourable member may put all kinds of conundrums to me. I. am simply endeavouring to show the basis of the decision with which Parliament is now asked to deal. I thought when I spoke in the House to convoy to honourable members what its real effect was. Buti f I may be permitted to go a little more in detail into it, because this clause is really the crux of the whole matter, I should like to place beyond all possibility of doubt what the meaning of the judgment of the majority of the Court was. What they said was this: It is not associations, it is not trade unions, as such, which Look, then, at the next proare entitled to register, but it is organizations on one side and on the other in connection with an industry, the organizations being in connection with the same industry. ( tice Isaacs, as set out on page .303 of the report of the caseThe true meaning, then, of section 55 is not, I think, difficult lo grasp. First it dealt with employers' associations by allowing any association of employers in any industry to be registered, provided that during the preceding six months the employers associated employed on an average per month not -less than one hundred employees in that industry.",32,Conciliation And Arbitration

196,Let Me Cite Again The Language Of Mr Jus,"The next paragraph gives the corresponding right to the employees, by permitting that a hundred or more may register as an organization, and so protect the workers in the industry against the employers. In other words, where there is an industry in which you have employers, they may register, and where they may register, so may the employed. held that Parliament has enacted that if an industry is not of a sufficient size or importance, it shall not"" come within the machinery of our arbitration lajw, that only industries in which there are more -than ioo employees can be formed for registration. If Ihe employers had only ninety-nine employees they could not possibly register as an organization; and it would be strange if on the -wording of that section, drawing no distinction between the industries referred to, those ninetyto its unconstitutionality as to the fact nine employees could, by combining with another employee outside that industry, and having nothing whatever to do with it, register themselves ns an organization for the purpose of raising an industrial dispute in the employers' industry within the meaning of the Act, although the same employers in precisely the same circumstances could not. Such unequal treatment is opposed to the reciprocal aspect of the whole Statute. Is not that pretty plain language? 'The scheme of the Act is organization by industries in the ordinary sense of the term, and does not permit the registration of organizations of trifling industries, because no organization of less than ioo employees can be registered. says that if the word industry were taken as meaning craft, and there were in some business only ninety-nine engine-drivers, they could defeat the Act by saying to an engine-driver in some other business, "" Join with us in making an organization of ioo employees."" The Government does not propose to amend section 55, and without its amendment it is absurd to com elude that Parliament, while imposing this restriction as to_ the size of organizations, desired that where there were fewer than TOO employees in a business they , should get employees in other businesses to join with them for ithe purpose of bringing a dispute before die Court. It is not proposed to amend that provision of the Act which requires that an organization must have 100 members before it can be registered. that if in an industry take the shipbuilding industry, for example-there were fewer than roo carpenters employed, they Mr VV. II. could join with carpenters in some other industry to form an organization. vantage that they should do so? Mr W. H . IRVINE I am not arguing that point. The main objection to the Bill raised by honourable members on this side is not as to its constitutionality, Mr Justice Isaacs although that is doubtful, the Chief Justice himself having expressed a doubt_ as to the constitutionality of craft organization, though Mr Justice Isaacs seems to think that the Constitution would permit it if Parliament approved of it. He went on to saypities if it is unconstitutional. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is another question. The argument on this side against the Bill is not directed so much that it introduces a principle which will throw the existing machinery out of gear. It can be no pleasure to any one, whether a lawyer or not, to see great sums of money, contributed by all sorts of poor people, involving considerable sacrifices in many homes throughout Australia, being wasted. Our main objection to the Bill is that it attempts to graft on to the stock something which will not grow with if. Section 55 provides for the registration of organizations. Its restrictions and qualifications are obviously based on the idea, as Mr Justice Isaacs pointed out, that the employers and employees who register Mr Justice Isaacs in connection with a dispute shall be related in an industry. Mr Justice Isaacs has pointed out that it makes section 55 absurd to take any other view, because that introduces a new element. In the ship-building industry you have engineers, carpenters, and other artisans. The employers and employees have a common interest. There may be mutual antagonism, but they are Ixyund together in a common undertaking. It is necessary for them to work together in peace and harmony. Organization on those lines is the basis of our legislation. It may be said that some other basis would be a better one. but that, as the High Court has pointed out, is the present basis. If you attempt to introduce legislation by crafts, you say to persons who cannot register as employees in an industry, being too few, "" You can It was not intended remedy your disability by getting others from some other industry to join you, persons not interested with you, and having nothing in common."" That, Mr Justice Irvine. Isaacs hits pointed out, reduces the whole",33,Conciliation And Arbitration

198,Mr Fenton,"It will be a thousandthing to an absurdity. I ask the Attorney-General whether it is intended that when this Bill is passed, the engineers in the ship-building industry can be members of a registered organization of ship-building employees ancl also members of a registered organization of engineers? It seems to me that there must be one form of organization or another. A man cannot ride on two horses at the same time, unless he has keen trained in a circus, and even then he cannot do it for long. We must provide, either that employees may register as craft organizations-thoug h to clo that further alterations of the law are necessary-o r that the registration shall be of organizations bers that, on a question of this sort, I am of employees organized according to the industries in which they are engaged. Is it intended to register both kinds of organizations ? workable. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is my difficulty. An organization of employees in the ship-building industry could enter into a binding agreement with their employers, or again, all the engineers of Australia, including those engaged in the ship-building industry, could form a union and enter into an agreement with employers generally, but the latter arrangement would not, except in a limited way, settle a dispute in the ship-building industry. It will inevitably lead to confusion if both kinds of organization are permitted. The employees of soapmaking works may have a dispute with their employers, and an agreement between them may be come to ancl registered. That is what is now contemplated by the Act. Huti f the Bill is passed, you may have overlapping, and then what would become of such an agreement? The engineers throughout Australia, assuming craft organization to be constitutional, might make demands on the whole of their employers, or on some of them, or on one of them, and make an industrial agreement. But such an agreement might clash with the agreement between the soapmakers' employees and their employers, to which the engineers engaged in the soapmaking industry were a party. Thus we have two different sets of organizations which are inconsistent, and can never come together-w e have all the difficulties that arise from instituting, as a basis for the very difficult process of settlement, two heterogeneous and inconsistent methods. complaining of the same thing every day. Mr W. H . IRVINE I believe Judge Heydon has his troubles, but we are now talking of serious, practical difficulties. The Attorney-General was good enough to make a good deal of sport out of some innocent words which I used. I expressed a wish that we could all put off our party clothes, and discuss a question of this sort face to face; and it took the honourable gentleman some days to discover that I felt myself hampered by my party claims. I myself was not aware of it at the time; and I can assure honourable memabsolutely unhampered by any party claims. I am prepared, personally, to accede to any view in which I can see a hope of making something like a permanent foundation for the settlement of disputes. We are now introducing the basis of craft organization; and what the effect may be I know not. I am not prepared to say definitely, as a matter of legal construction, even after reading the judgment, that, if we make this and the other alterations, the Court will necessarily adhere to the same interpretation. Courts always endeavour, if the language of an Act will permit, to give effect to what they believe to be the intention of the majority in Parliament; but does the Act enable them to clo it? This is a clause which deals with the interpretation of particular words, and that clause affects all the clauses in which those words are used. It is proposed to make a further alteration, and I shall not prophesy what view the Court may take ultimately. But, without the slightest fear or doubt, I prophesy that this machinery will be thrown into such complete confusion that, if there is any benefit whatever derived from the new thing which we are grafting on the old, it will be at the cost of unutterable expense and delay throughout the continent. There will be delay, dissatisfaction, and unrest amongst employers and employed; there will be difficulties introduced where there are already more than sufficient, constitutional and otherwise. It would be better to throw the whole thing into the melting pot ancl start afresh, and see if we could not arrive at some basis. If we think there ought to be organization by craft, let us so remodel the Act that the sections will dovetail. present constitutional limitations?",34,Conciliation And Arbitration

IRVINE -Personally , I do not think we possess enough power; but we have to deal with the Bill in the light of the powers we do possess. do the best we can; and, failing, we must have an amendment of the Constitution. Mr VV. H . IRVINE I am afraid that interjection rather indicates that honourable members opposite are not so anxious or concerned about this particular Bill as they are about an extension of the powers. I should be sorry to think that that was so, because we are trying to debate this question on its merits. honourable member is scarcely in keeping with the balance of his argument. Mr W. H .

IRVINE I am afraid that we cannot do much, and I have always said so; but still, we had better do the best we can. happening in Sydney to-day, can we do anything ? Mr W. H . IRVINE I know to what the honourable member refers. I think the task before is us extremely difficult; but that is no reason why we should take to pieces the somewhat ineffectual, very costly, and not altogether satisfactory machinery -which , however, is doing a little work at immense expense-and try to introduce other parts, which will not work with the old parts. Let us do the best we can with the machinery we have without altering the basis of it. cation by experience I Mr W. H . IRVINE -There is no experience which is so dear as that obtained in the law courts, though it is very salutary sometimes, and I do not object to being engaged to assist^ in imparting it. The matter has now been pretty well threshed out;' but I do not think any real answer has been given to the arguments advanced by honourable members on this side as to the effect of the proposed amendment. If there be no answer, what are we doing? We are simply walking with our eyes open into a morass, where we shall have to plunge about a good deal before we are able to get out-that is the position, I submit, as it stands now. At a later stage, we shall have an opportunity to deal with the important question, of the control of this House over the High Court. Such control, if we can exercise it, might possibly enable us to pass any legislation we like. But I have now only to say that we are going with our eyes open into a condithe tion, of things which will lead to endless confusion, delay, irritation, and worry in the'industrial ranks of both employers and employees; and tlie only outcome will be a still vaster expenditure'a still more wasteful and useless expenditure-of the people's money, which might be devoted to much better purposes. ney-General) [3.10] -The honourable member for Flinders has not advanced any argument that takes us beyond where we were the other evening. He has devoted a good deal of time to removing an impression, which was very heavily imprinted on the minds of the Committee, that he had fallen into error in declaring that the Act was not based on the New South Wales and other Acts, and, to that extent, was governed by the definition of the various terms used in these. The honourable member spoke of the scheme of the Act, but I remind him that, underneath the scheme is the intention of the Legislature-the reason that inspired the Legislature to take action. That reason was a desire to prevent industrial disputes. The honourable member devoted much time, in a"" very interesting manner, to showing us the great dangers that await us, the confusion and disaster that must inevitably overtake us if we agree to this amendment.

209,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Attorby side?-yo u cannot have both."" My answer is that we can have both, because we have had both for the past seven years. They have worked together, they will work together, and there will be no confusion. There will not be driven across any award relating to the wages and conditions in any industry-usin g the term in the sense sional men, such as doctors, architects, and of the interpretation of the High Courtthe plaint of any craft association asking for wages and conditions for its members, some of whom are, let us say, embraced by the award regulating the industry. During the past seven years in the Commonwealth Court, and for the past ten years in some of the States, there have been these two methods of organization, and the scheme of the Act and the intention of the Legislature was devised in order that we might avail ourselves of the two systems. To show that there will be no confusion, and that men will fall either into a craft organization or an organization by industry as their circumstances demand, we have only to look at the facts to-day. The engineers ancl the carpenters, for instance, are both organized as crafts, simply because that is more convenient for them. In many such cases, there are skilled trades the same sort of skill to drive the same which have inherited traditions binding them together. In the marine engineers we have a craft inseparable from an industry by its very nature, because a marine engineer cannot be other than attached to the shipping industry. A land engineer, on the other hand, may be attached to any of a hundred industries, but he always does the same work. A shearer of sheep, on the other hand, at the same time that he allies himself with his fellow-craftsmen, must be a member of an association attached to the industry, because he has no other way of finding occupation except in shearing sheep. He not only does the same work, but does that work always in connection with the same industry. The honourable member says that there will recognised by the Court in the Boot Trade be confusion if we adopt this amendment. My reply is that there will be no confusion if we adopt it, though there will be if we do not, for some 20,000 men will be unable to register unless the amendment is passed. The honourable member bids us beware of many dangers; but what does he or any other honourable member opposite advance as a method by which these 20,000 men may be brought under the Act? Perhaps they will tell us that these men must organize by industries. That is easy to say, but hard to do. Let us take, for instance, the profession which the honourable member for Flinders and myself follow. Supposing it were said to be better for the public good, that, instead of being banded together by the nature of our profession we should join with other professo forth in the district in which we lived? Uncler such circumstances, instead of finding ourselves allied with our fellow craftsmen, we should ""find ourselves, as I have indicated, allied with doctors, engineers, architects, and other professional men, with whom we had nothing in common. My honourable friend would surely have objected to that. He would have said, "" No; my interests lie with the members of my own profession, and therefore I wish to organize with them."" What does an engineer know or care about the circumstances of a soap factory in which he is employed? What have they do do with him ? What does it matter whether a man drives an engine in a soap factory or in a jam factory? A man who drives an engine is an engine-driver, and it requires sort of engine, whether that engine is hauling quartz from a mine or goods along a track. ber suggest that wages in respect of the same class of work should be equal all over Australia irrespective of the cost of living? paid to a person must have relation to the cost of living, and the cost of living is determined by many conditions, including geographical position. I clo not say that there should be one wage paid all over Australia in respect of the same sort of work. But other things being equal as to the cost of living, disadvantageousness of .position, and so on, the same wage ought to be paid for the same kind of work. That is obvious, and has been case. One wage is paid to men in Queensland, another to the men in Victoria, and still another to those working in another State. The scheme of the awards tends finally to reach a level, because the conditions in the southern portions of Queensland are not materially different from those prevailing in New South Wales and Victoria. But let us look at the circumstances of another industry. A wharf labourer here will receive is. 3d. or is. 6d. per hour, as the case may be, over the greater",36,Conciliation And Arbitration
210,Mr Kelly,Does the honourable mem,37,Conciliation And Arbitration
211,Mr Hughes,"I do not. The wagespart of Australia, and in Normanton as. 6d. or 3s. 6d. per hour. Yet no one can say that the difference does more than fairly measure the disadvantageousness of the one position as against the other. Engineers are allied as craftsmen. Ho\v could they possibly leave their interests to an industry of which they formed an insignificant proportion? Let us take the case of a factory where 400 men are engaged on the general work of making bodies of buggies and motor cars, where one or two engine-drivers and fitters are also employed. The 400 men can register; they have interests in common. It is suggested by the Opposition, however, that they should take with them the two engine drivers and fitters, of whose skill or work they know absolutely nothing, and that the Court should hear a full and comprehensive statement of not only the carriage and motor building industry, but also of the trade or calling of engine-driving and engine fitting, although the interests of only four men are to be considered. On the face of it such a proposition is absolutely absurd. It is now laid down firmly as a principle in the Commonwealth that an unskilled labourer is to receive a fair and reasonable wage, ancl (here is to be superimposed on that wage an additional payment for skill. No doubt an engineer is one of the most skilled tradesmen in the country, and before the wage that should be paid for the exercise of liis skill can be measured, there must be a close inquiry into the whole of the circumstances under which a man has attained and practised that skill. The period of his apprenticeship, and so forth, must be considered, ancl, in short, there must be an inquiry into the whole industry. Let us take the case of a soap factory employing one brassfounder and one coppersmith to look after its boilers or coppers. Are the wages ot coppersmiths and brassfounclers to be fixed by the circumstances of one employee"" in a soap factory, or are we going to take the craft, and to inquire to the men of this country an opportunity into the measure of skill required, the degree of effort put forward, and the amount of money ancl time expended in learning the trade? All these things must be looked into by and large. The convenience and obviousness of the position have forced some men to register by way of "" industries,"" and others to register by way of "" crafts."" A wharf labourer naturally registers by way of "" industry."" His business begins and ends in carrying in connection with the shipping industry. The Mr Hughes. sailor is. similarly circumstanced, and so are the marine engineers. They register by way of "" industry,"" and also by way of ""craft."" If it were conceivable that a man employed as a sailor could go into the Court, as it were, at the tail of some other industry, would it be possible to determine, in such circumstances, the rate of pay and conditions tp be observed in respect of such a man? Certainly not. Carters and drivers, for example, are employed in fifty industries. Are we to say that when those engaged in a biscuit factory or manufacturing confectioner, which industries seek and obtain an award, the wages of carters and drivers employed in that industry are also to be fixed in the same award ? How could tliat be done? The Opposition point out the hopeless bog into whicli one man must get when he tries to regulate all tlie industries of a country, and yet they are calmly prepared to so increase and multiply the difficulties as to make the task utterly insuperable. If Mr Justice Higgins is asked tofixthe wage's for engine-drivers, he is not to take into account each little industry all over Australia. He takes the engine-drivers themselves, listens to what, they have fo say, and has evidence put before him by the employer, whether he is a biscuit maker, a brickmaker, or a mine manager. The employer, no matter what his occupation is, gives evidence, and in what way is he to be inconvenienced because of the procedure we propose? In any case, he has to give evidence, and if it is to cover all his employees, the same evidence. If we take the industry, the engineer must still come before the Court, and his employer must appear and say what he thinks are the wages that ought properly to be paid to engineers. We would not lessen the work of the Court by compelling all men to register under the grouping of "" industry "" ; we should rather confuse and multiply it almost interminably in that way. We desire'that there shall be opened to register either under "" crafts "" or under "" industry,"" whichever is convenient to them. The honourable member for Flinders spoke about the scheme of the Act, and said that this alteration would be so incongruous to the Act, so out of harmony with it, that our last condition would be worse than the first, and that it would lead to confusion. It might be unconstitutional; in any case it would lead to delay. Mr W. H . IRVINE I did not say it would be unconstitutional. to be unconstitutional ; and, in any case, ganizationit would lead to delay. that charge based? Upon the statement made by the Chief Justice, and reported at page 289 of the Argus Law Reports. Speaking of the definition of "" industry,"" the Chief Justice, in the Engine-drivers' case sairlTn the second place, that is not the scheme of the Act. The unit of aggregation for the purpose of industrial agreements and proceedings in the Court is not the handicraft but the mean one of two things. It will mean the collective enterprise in which employers and employees are associated. It was contended by the union 'that "" industry "" was capable of bearing the further definition of craft organization. The High Court decided that the scheme of the Act, apart from, the wording itself, was opposed to that definition. It never said-it never could have said-that the word "" industry "" was in itself incapable of such a meaning. Mr W. H . IRVINE -No one has suggested that. depends upon the definition. The definition of "" industry "" in the Act isbusiness, calling, service, or employment. The honourable member for Angas pointed out that the words that made the word ""calling"" ambiguous were those immediately following "" in which persons are employed."" The Chief Justice, dealing with the two meanings of the words-the one passive and the other active-pointe d out that the whole question turned on the words "" in which persons are employed or engaged,"" and not on the calling which the person followed. A man may be employed as a gardener, and his calling will depend upon the industry of his employer, which is quite a different thing. When we set down in this definition what we mean by "" industry,"" we shall entirely remove the grounds upon which the Court decided that "" industry "" did not include and connote ""craft organization."" That is perfectly clear. We come now to the consideration of the other point raised by my honourable friend, namely, that the scheme of the Act is such that we cannot alter it without upsetting the Act itself. Take any section you please Mr W. H . IRVINE -Tak e section 55. 55 provides thatAny of the following associations may, on sand men who cannot register as things compliance with the prescribed conditions, be stand now. They are some of the best L/0 Upon what is (a) any association of employers in or in connection with any industry, who have in the aggregate, throughout the six months next preceding the application for registration, employed on an average taken per month not less than one hundred employees in that industry ; and (*) any association of not less than one hundred employees in or in connection with any mdustry. When die Bill passes "" industry"" will industry in which the employer is interested, and it will also mean the craft or. calling which the employee follows. I fail utterly to see how it can be said that this definition will be repugnant to the meaning of section 55. I would ask the honourable member for Flinders to look at subclause b of the Bill, and apply it to subsection b of section 55 of the Act. The question is whether the definition as enlarged is repugnant to the scheme of the Bill to such an extent that it is impossible to apply it without rendering the whole thing meaningless, or inviting endless confusion and trouble. Sub-section b of section 55, read with the amendment, will trade, manufacture, undertaking, be as follows: Any association of not less than a hundred employees in or in connection with any calling,' service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of employees on land or waterMr W. H . IRVINE -Oh, no. That is not what it says. say. Mr W. H. IRVINE -In one sense it will say that; but it leaves the word "" industry "" as meaning one thing in the first part of the section, and practically another in the second. the industry of the employer or the calling of the employee. Surely the honourable member will not contend that this Legislature cannot legislate so as to enable persons to group together upon the basis of craft organization ? Mr W. H .

We must take our responsibility, and make such preparations as we can within our limits to enable them to register. The honourable n ember is not able to tell us how we can d-v that. No effort is made by the Opposition to tell us what we are to do with tliese people. This amendment will not make for confusion and delay. It will, 0:1 the other hand, make for peace and harmony, and the speedy settlement of troubles. Who are those that objected in the engine-drivers case yesterday, or the day before, to such an adjournment as would permit of this Bill becoming law? Were they persons who are keenly desirous to expedite the settlement of the men's claims?' Not'at all. When it*was plainly shown that the men were cheated, or choused, of their award by reason of an interpretation put upon the word "" industry "" that the men outside and people inside this House never intended to put on it, and that this Parliament was going to set forth its meaning in plain terms, they opposed the adjournment of the case. All that was asked was that the Legislature should be given time to say what it meant, and that the 4,000 men engaged in engine-driving should get fair terms and conditions. Those people want the engine-drivers to group themselves into 130 industries. Some of them are grouped together. .There are about twenty leading classes. a great number. I have no doubt that the number of industries vvhich employ engine drivers is considerably, over a. hundred. Those people want the men to break their own ties, to disrupt their organization, and formed in New South VVales, and exist to band themselves into a hundred or more insignificant little new organizations all over the country, in which they and tlieir claims would become of trifling imthe New South Wales Act. The honorportance to the industries to which they are able member for Flinders admitted that attached. That is the method suggested by the gentlemen who speak about the delay and confusion that this amendment will cause. Confusion and delay have been caused already, and injustice has been done to an intelligent and orderly body of men who, in spite of the very greatest temptation, have stuck to their work, and are willing to stand by the award of the Court., which was by no means unduly favourable to them. Those gentlemen who prate about peace and the benefits of industrial harmony, tell us that we must not make any amendment in the Act, or do anything to help the men. The honourable member for Flinders said the scheme of the Act in section 55 contemplated so cleaTly organization upon the basis of industry that there was no escaping it. He said that the employer who can register must employ not less than 100 employees, and that the association of employees which may register must contain not less than 100 employesFrom that he deduced that there is some causal or necessary relation between those two, so that the whole of the employees of the employer are, as it were, identical or coincident with the too employees who may form an association. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It was not my deduction; it was that of Mr Justice Isaacs. tion other than a quite incidental one, and not in any way causal. VVe must have some limit. We cannot allow too great a multiplicity of organization. If we allowed an employer of, say, two employees to register, or every band of five employees to form an association, the business of the Court, which is already sufficiently difficult, would be multiplied indefinitely. We, therefore, fix a number. In the New South Wales Act it was fifty, but here we made it 100. I remember that it was because we were dealing with the whole of the States that we made the number 100 instead of fifty. We must never let go of the fact that at that particular time, and now, 100 employees could, and can, associate themselves togetlier upon any basis. In New South VVales there exists the restriction that they must be members of a trade union. Trade unions have been there to-day on the basis of crafts. It is also well known that this Act, so far as it was possible for us to make it, followed himself. We intended to enable these existing organizations, subject to the provisions of the Act, to come in and register. If we do not, we cannot get industrial peace. This is not an Act to benefit trade unionists. It is an Act to protect the community. The honourable member for Flinders said it would produce difficulty and confusion.

221,Mr Hughes,"I say there is no relabreaks in the continuity of industrial operations. That is the one evil. Every honourable member must realize that that is a matter of such great importance, and growing greater every day, that we have to face it. We must have continuity of industrial operations, if we can secure it by any means at our disposal. Twenty thousand men are outside this Act, and do honourable members mean to say that if 20,000 people could not get civil justice, or redress under the criminal a state of things would be allowed to exist for a moment? Why, then, should we allow it in this case? We have to provide for the registration of these men. We are now providing for it. The provision we make is not repugnant to the meaning of the Act, but is in consonance with it. It will not involve amendments in other sections to any greater extent than has already been given notice of. It is open to the Court, and the Court will be compelled, to look at the definition of industry, which will be now set forth in such clear terms that there can be no difficulty or doubt about it. The honourable member for Angas has made one suggestion worth considering. He pointed out that everything depended upon the words in section 4 of the principal Act as amended. The amendment will remedy a great wrong without doing injustice to any one, and, instead of making for delay or confusion, will straighten out much that is tangled, and lead to expedition. Progress reported. That the House do now adjourn. wish to bring under notice the manner in which the Labour party is treated by the daily press, as instanced by a recent article in the Argus, based on remarks made by Lord Dudley, a former Governor General. Lord Dudley is reported to have said that there is, in Australia, a set of professional politicians who are the outcome of payment of members, and the Argus published a leader on the subject, in which these statements occurThere is no reason at all why a Governor General who has closed his term of office should soon as it passed both Houses. Not so Lord, refrain from making a statement of his observations whilst amongst us on political matters. Lord Dudley has returned to England to take up once more his duties in the House of Lords, [72]2 and since payment of members is now beforethe British people, it would be only natural if he were to discuss the subject in the light of his experience in Australia. It would be childish of us if we resented comments which did not take the form of fulsome praise. Mr Murray and Mr Fisher go to England with more or less prejudiced mmds, and when they return they speak freely about British institutions and the condition of the people. They should not complain if Lord Dudley, or any one else who has been here, were equally frank in expressing their opinions of us and our laws.. such If it is childish to object to anything that is not fulsome praise, why did not the editor of the Argus insert a letter, which I sent on Thursday last, with a respectful note requesting its insertion, and which wasreturned to me without any statement as to why it had not been accepted ? I ask honourable members to listen to this letter, and"" to say whether it might not fairly^ have been published in a journal professing to represent the public interest, and to give both sides of public questions. It is as followsLORD DUDLEY. To tlie Editor of the Argus. Sir,-It is quite true, as Lord Dudley suggests, there is a body of politicians in Australia which depends for its bread and butteT on the "" allowance"" received for "" expenses,"" but it should be pointed out to the British public that body is not formed of politicians belonging to one political party. Most members;conservatives, liberals, and labour membersare glad to get the "" pay "" ; and, man for man, they are as honest and upright as the conservatives, liberals, and labour members who can afford to live without their parliamentary salary. AndI think it can be proved that Australia has made greater headway in all the States since she adopted payment of members, than when she allowed members to pay themselves in those various indirect ways that an unpaid Parliament usually pays itself. An unpaid Parliament would, no doubt, have put up with the vagaries of Lord Dudley as Governor General of the Commonwealth, but not so a Parliament elected out of the wider choice that payment of members creates. I do not suppose the most idle paid-member of an Australian Parliament would, as Governor General, with a salary of ,Â£10,000 a year and expenses, have performed his duties as Lord Dudley did. Amongst the items of his singular conduct was his opening of the Federal Parliament on the 3rd of July, 1910, and departure for Sydney on the same day. As you, Sir, know, in our Commonwealth Parliament, the Governor General's Speech is debated, and there is an Address-in-Reply. So far as I am aware, all the Australian Governor General who preceded Lord Dudley stayed in Melbourne to receive the Address-in-Reply as Dudley.

223,Mr Higgs (Capricornia.) [3.47],"Iaddress down to Government House, to avoid drawing attention to Lord Dudley's late arrival, but the Speaker of the House of Representatives declined to be a party to such an irregularity. Another and much more important matter has reference to section 56 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act. This section provides that no vote, resolution, or proposed law shall be passed by the Parliament unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor General -because he knew that that journal would Lord Dudley was, apparently, not much concerned with the constitutional duties of his post, which see. The following message was presented to Parliament on the same day it was supposed to have been signed by Lord Dudley :"" Message No. 7 : In accordance with the requirements of section 56 of the Constitution, the Governor General recommends to the House of Representatives that an appropriation of revenue and moneys be made for the purpose of a B i ll for an Act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, a sum for Invalid and Old-age Pensions. Dudley."" This message was for an appropriation of three and a half millions of money. It was dated as having been signed by Lord Dudley on the 26th of July, and it was presented to the Speaker on the same day. Lord Dudley was in Sydney, and could not have signed the message in question. The only possible explanation is, that Lord Dudley did not sign the message at a l l , that some person forged his signature, or that Lord Dudley left his signature on a number of blank sheets of paper, so that others could fill in the messages ns it suited them. The same remarks apply to Message No. 9, Tuesday, August 9; Message No. 15, Friday, August 26; and Messages Nos. 18 and i g , Wednesday, September 7, 1910. (It would furnish an interesting point for constitutional lawyers as to whether the Bills passed after the receipt of such bogus messages are genuine laws.) As to the foregoing facts, if any doubt arises fn your mind, I beg to refer you 'to the Parliamentary Records for 1910. I am sure you will agree with me that, no paid member of Parliament could neglect his duties as Lord Dudley did without risk of defeat at the hands of the electors; and further, I respectfully ask you to agree with me that as we pay our Governor General Â£10,000 a year and expenses totalling another Â£13,000, it would be a good plan for Australia to ""elect that high official by popular vote. I am & c , W. G. Hiccs. Parliament House, 24th October, t r j n . 1 may have been very innocent in expecting the ""childish"" editor of the Argus, Mr Cunningham, to accept that letter, but let me quote the motto of that journalI am in the place where I am demanded of conscience to speak the truth, and therefore the truth I speak, impugn it whoso list. Mr Higgs. member send a copy of his letter to the Age? Argus that the leading article to which I have referred appeared. Mr. JOSEPH COOK I suppose the honourable member sent his letter to the Argus not publish it. class to which we have to submit from the honourable and bitter member for Parramatta. He is a disappointed man, who missed his chance when he left the party which otherwise he might have been leading to-day. Disappointment is written on the honourable member's brow; I know that the honourable member for Parramatta is (Signed) very much annoyed because I have stuck to my Republican views, while he has forsaken his and become an extreme Loyalist, and possibly a sycophant. This party is badly treated by the daily press, which is really a "" suppress"" of the worse type. Of course, I do not so class all newspapers; but it seems, strange that the editors of many of the leading journals, such as the Argus, seem to have entered into a conspiracy to protect Lord Dudley, simply because he happens to be a titled personage. Not long ago, we had cabled out from England the news that Pete Curran, a Labour man, had been fined for being drunk. It is known that the Australian Labour party is more sober than any other party; and it was cruel, to try to blacken its reputation by this paltry little bit of news. Some newspapers, like the Argus, are absolutely unfair; and some of the pressmen in this House, wage-earners like ourselves, are not fair in their methods, as I shall show by a few instances salary while he was here? pertinently asked by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports; and the Prime Minister replied "" Yes."" The answer was a whole speech in itself as to the inconsistency of Lord Dudley in talking about professional politicians when he was receiving pay; and at the same time making his position as Governor General a. perfect farce.

230,Mr Higgs,"That question was verypress. Only a few years ago, reporters and journalists generally had to stand on the mat while they waited for some ignorant, but wealthy, man who had been elected to a public position. The Labour party, however, has placed the pressmen in a position of social equality, where they ought to be. Yet, what is the treatment some of them give to the party? That question I can only answer from the way in which I have myself been treated. Last year, when the Constitution Alteration ^Legislative Powers) Hill was before the House, on a FridayI made a speech, to which the Melbourne Age referred as follows :The last chapter of the second reading of the debate oa the Industrial PowersB ill produced a couple of thoughtful speeches from two Queenslanders, MrL . E. Groom and Mr the representatives of his paper to give fair \V. HiggsI do not wish to boast; but, as a matter of fact, the speech I made received some praise from quite a number of honourable members! How was that speech dealt with ? The Brisbane Courier, the representative of which is Mr Sampson, gave a very fair report to the honourable member for Darling Downs, and one or two that followed him, but did not even mention the fact that I spoke. I could mention other similar cases. Mr Sampson, who misrepresents the Labour party in so many ways, is employed, not only on the Brisbane Courier, but in connection with Pathe"" Freres. The late Minister of External Affairs, Mr Batchelor, myself, and others, during our visit to Europe, went to the Roubaix Exhibition, and were most hospitably received by the Mayor and the municipality generally. Mr Batchelor was there to open the Australian Court. I may say that Roubaix is one of our best customers for wool, and can boast one of the largest woollen mills in Europe. On the occasion Pathe Freres look cinematograph films, which have since been exhibited in Melbourne. duty it was to furnish some description of the film, actually headed it "" Australia at the Roubaix Exhibition; President Fallieres meets Sir George Reid."" As a matter of fact, neither Sir George Reid nor the President was there; and I submit that that description of the film was given merely because a member of the Labour party happened to be Minister of External Affairs. If the Minister had happened to be the honourable member for Ballarat, or the honourable member for Parramatta, the name would have appeared, and not that of Sir George Reid. Then how did Mr Whyte, the reporter of the Sydney Morning Herald. .report my speech on the Industrial Powers Bill? Be wrote as followsThe debate was begun this morning by Mr Groom, who skilfully showed wbere the Government were wrong in tbeir proposals, and pointed out the dangers that would arise if the measure was carried in its present form. Mr Higgs, of Queensland, followed, and bored the House! with an hour's speech until he gave way to "" Sir }ohn ""Forrest. My own opinion is that Mr Whyte is not instructed by the editor of his paper to misrepresent the Labour party in this fashion. 1 know the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald well enough to believe that he tells reports. If we search the columns of the Sydney Morning Herald, I am certain we shall not find similar remarks made about any honourable members opposite. It is urged, 1 know, by some, that the reporters act thus in accordance with'-instructions; but I cannot believe that Dr. Ward, the editor of the Sydney Daily Telegrafh, gives his reporter, Mr Peters, instructions to write the bitter vitriolic stuff which appears about this party ' in the columns of the Daily Telegrafh. will be given some space to-morrow word of my remarks will appear. I am not troubled about any criticism there may be of me; but I do contend that the reports of my speeches ought to be fair, so that people may be able to judge whether or not I bore the House. These poor literary worm's think that what they write pleases their editors or their party; but I ask them whether it is to their interests to so work into the hands of the' capitalistic section. Which programme is more likely to suit them-the .programme of the Labour party or the programme of the capitalist? A Now, Air. Sampson, whose great change has come over the press of late-years. At one time, the newspaper proprietor was a man with some milk of human kindness in his breast, but the modern press has become a. commercial machine. When I was a compositor on the Sydney Morning Herald, some twenty-five years ago, it was a treat tb see old compositors of sixty years or more allowed to come into the office and earn what they could at the case. Mr John Fairfax paid them Â£ 1 a week each, in addition to what",42,Adjournment Press Criticism Of Labour Party
231,Mr Fenton,The honourable member,43,Adjournment Press Criticism Of Labour Party
232,Mr Higgs,"It is possible that not athey could earn, so that these poor old fellows in their declining years were provided for. The position is different to-day, for now there is no old-age pensions system in connection with the newspaper. When they are old, the compositors are turned adrift, and my friends of the press who are writing down the Labour party, which is trying to do its best to help them, and all other sections of the community, will probably be turned out also when they get old; and some of them, no doubt, will be glad enough to take the old-age pension, for which the Labour party has succeeded in making provision. I am not going to submit any longer to the treatment to which I have been subjected by these representatives of the press. If I find that I am unfairly treated in any degree, I shall probably avail myself of another-opportunity to deal with the matter. Let me point out, for a moment, bow unfairly this treatment operates. Some of the newspapers can afford to send to Melbourne a special representative. Mr Sampson, for instance, is specially employed by the Courier. But a Queensland newspaper company which is not in a position to be directly represented here, takes its news from the Sydney Morning Herald or some other papa-. Thus, if Mr Whyte sends to tbe Herald a garbled report of our parliamentary proceedings, that report is transmitted to various newspapers in Queensland which take their news from that journal. Honourable members will thus see how very unfair is this attitude on the part of the press towards our party. These great newspapers avail themselves to the full of the postal and telegraph facilities, yet they are not prepared to deal fairly by tbe Labour party. The matter of which I complain is a positive outrage,, and serves only to emphasize our conviction that we ought to have a daily Labour press. I appeal to these gentlemen of tbe press for fair play. We are paid members of Parliament; they are paid members of the press; and the one calling is as honourable as the other, so long as a man does his duty and behaves himself. I appeal to the representatives of the press to be fair, and ask them to say whether they think it just to treat a party as. the Labour party has been treated for years in the columns of some of the daily newspapers. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.8 p.m.",43,Adjournment Press Criticism Of Labour Party
