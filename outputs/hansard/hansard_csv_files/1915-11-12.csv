But there is another amendment to which I ask the particular consideration of the Prime Minister, because I think that its far-reaching effect and injustice are not realized. I should like to see the provisions of section 15 recast. That section now enacts that, in the case of a person not resident in or of a company not registered in Australia, selling goods here, the principal shall be deemed to have derived from their sale, taxable income equal to 5 per cent, on the price at which the goods were sold. This rigid, cast-iron assessment is unfair. In in numerable cases, some of which have been brought under my own notice, firms have been engaged for long periods, and in one case present in my mind for upwards of seven years, in endeavouring to establish branches in Australia, and, during the -whole time, have consistently incurred losses on their Australian business. ever, requires that they shall be assessed on a profit of 5 per cent, on the price of their goods sold here, even though no profit at all has been earned. My suggestion is that in these cases the assessments should be on the actual profits, as shown by the balance-sheet and statement of the actual dealings and transactions in Australia. The Commissioner should at least have some discretion in this matter. If he felt itfpractically impossible to assess the actual profits, it would be perfectly' legitimate to allow him to assess them at 5 per cent, on the price of the goods sold, but where he was satisfied as to the actual results of the transactions, he should be able to assess accordingly. makes liable for the payment of income tax the person selling the goods, that is, the agent. He is personally liable for the payment of the income tax in respect of them. That seems harsh and unreasonable, but there is this feature about it that the agent is made liable only in respect of contracts and dealings to which he himself has been a party. however, which goes much further. makes the agent or representative in Australia liable, not only for the transactions to which he has been a party, but also in regard to the transactions of his principals entered into abroad. The amendment declares that goods shall be deemed to be sold in Australia on account of a person not resident here, or of a company, if any person in Australia receives a commission in respect of the sale of them, or is paid a salary for obtaining orders or for influencing their sale. In many cases which have been brought under my notice by merchants, 90 per cent, of the transactions which would be affected by this provision have been the result of contracts entered into abroad without the knowledge of the agent here. Yet tlie agent here is to be made personally liable in respect of them. The harshness and unfairness of the amendment will be understood when I again emphasize the large percentage of business done by principals without the knowledge of their agents, particularly in those cases where no money passes through the agent's hands, and he has no means of recouping himself. I am sure that that cannot be intended. It leaves agents with this alternative, to give up their agencies, or to accept an unjust liability. In many Section 15, howcases the principals w ill repudiate their liability for the tax, and the agents w ill have to pay it . Principals abroad cannot be made liable for the tax, because we have no jurisdiction over themj but it is going too far to make agents here directly responsible in respect of transactions to which they have not been a party. I'ask honourable members what would be their feelings if such a law were enacted by the British Parliament, making agents residing in the United Kingdom liable for all contracts entered into by principals in Australia? Such a law would be the cause of much annoyance and irritation. A section of the community w ill be harshly and unjustly dealt with by the The section amendment. It s effect w ill be more far-reaching than was contemplated by the Attorney-Generali n another direction also. It will have the objectionable result of discriminating and differentiating in its treatment of merchants, it w ill bring ahout a process of unequal competition, and it w ill be a source of irritation to the British merchant who is already experiencing the An amendment is proposed, utmost difficulties because of the amount It of labour that has been drawn by the war from the ordinary avocations of life, and because of the serious competition of .America. The differentiation w ill lie in the fact that the merchant who has an agency in Australia w ill be taxed very much more than the merchant who has no agent, and sends his goods direct to his customers. The goods of the firm that is sufficiently enterprising to establish an agency in Australia are made liable for the Customs duties as they come in, and, in addition to the agent's personal down that there is uo power on the part income tax, he has to pay taxatiou on the of the States to tax Federal instrumenbasis of 5 per cent, of the selling price of talities, but there does not seem to have the goods disposed of.

There are all sorts of means of evading it. South Africa tried it, but as the result of experience it was repealed and a licence substituted. That also proved of no value, and had to be abandoned. terfuges have been put up to evade legislation and taxation of this kind. Isi t wise to try to tempt our ordinary agents, who are reputable men, and have lived all their lives in Australia, to do this kind of thing, or to drive them out of Australia altogether ? They do a great part of their business on the indenting principle through London agencies, and the London houses of those who purchase the goods. All the transactions are completed in London, and they will still be completed in London. The only effect of this legislation will be to eliminate the local agent and his local establishment, thus throwing a lot of men out of work, and to substitute the peripatetic agent, who passes through, does his business, gets out, and leaves Australia the poorer for it all. If there was some object of a protective character in view, I could understand this proposal. There might he some sense in it if it would lead to the establishment of permanent sections of business in Australia, but that will not be the result. These firms will continue to do their business in London.

Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 3Section 15 of the principal Act is amended by inserting at the end thereof the following sub-section:"" (3) Goods shall be deemed to be sold in Australia on account of a person not resident in Australia, or on account of a company not registered in Australia, if any person in Australia receives n commission in respect of tiie sale of the goods or is paid a salary for obtaining orders for or for influencing the sale of the goods.""

The Attorney-General, however, was unable fco be present, so that he will pardon me if I deal with the clause a little more f u l l y than I should do in ordinary circumstances. A good deal of doubt and difficulty is likely to arise from the reading of section 15 as proposed to be amended, or even as unamended, in connection with section 52 of the Act . I am entirely in sympathy with the object which I think the Attorney-General desires to attain. His object I understand to be tliat, foreign companies and foreign individuals, who directly or indirectly derive a profit, from business done in Australia, shall payincome tax upon the profits of that business. That is the broad principle. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I agree entirely with it . It is in accordance w it h It the principle adopted, not only here, b u t in other countries. The main provision for giving effect to it under the Income TaxA c t is based on profits. Thei n come has to be ascertained in the ordinary way, and the person who is made responsible for that is the agent who is carrying on the business here. The agent carrying on the business here is the man who receives the money for transmission to the principal. I think we shall a l l agree that any branch of a house, or any agent carrying on the business of a foreign principal here, should be obliged, as required by section 52, to make returns, and that the agent should be made responsible for the payment, out of the moneys he received on behalf of his principal, of the income tax payable on that man's income.

The main principle that governs all is that embodied in section 52, under which the agent has to ascertain the profits and to pay the income tax, and is entitled to reimburse himself out of the moneys received for his principal. intended to deal with the same principle; but is applied to a somewhat different class of cases. agent who is, in the ordinary sense, carrying on the business of a principal here, but an agent who is simply effecting sales for principals acting, perhaps, for a number of firms in a number of isolated cases of sales, but not a representative in the wide sense of the wordthen you say with regard to such contracts, "" Where there is no foreign business carried on here, arrive at a rough and ready means of estimating the profits by assuming that the profits on the actual sales and contracts amount to 5 per cent."" again with that principle, for it is a fair way of dealing with a practical difficulty. But section 15, unfortunately, I think, makes the individual agent who has made the contract personally responsible to pay out of his own money the income tax on that 5 per cent. first trouble arises. that he should pay the income tax out of any moneys in hand, or that he should retain moneys after the Act comes into operation, and he knows what he has to do, to pay income tax due by his principal. the year ending 30th June, 1915, agents who simply effect sales-wh o are simply the agents for entering into these contracts, while other persons have the handling of the money, shall be personally responsible for the income tax, is manifestly unjust. cannot be carried oub. that if it remains the Attorney-General, when we meet next year, will find it necessary to propose an amendment to do away with the manifest injustice. the other hand, if the selling agent be, as in some cases, the man who receives the money for the sale, then he ought to be, and would be, responsible under section 52. member propose to amend section 15 of the principal Act? Sir William Irvine. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I am not going to propose any amendment, but I wish to make a suggestion. The difficulty to which I have referred as existing under section 15 will be immensely accentuated by this amending clause. The amending clause would extend this personal liability, not merely to the man who effects the sale, but to Section 15 is any man who receives a commission in respect of the sale of goods, or is paid salary for obtaining orders or for in Where you have not an fluencing the sale of goods. Thati n cludes a very wide class of advertising agents, who may have nothing to do with the receipt of the money, and may not be immediately connected with the actual sale which gives rise to the receipt of the money. I suggest that the Attorney General should strengthen section 52 which applies to every agent. Thei n terpretation clause includes as an agent we will every person who receives any money, and section 52 makes every person who receives the money of his principal liable to pay income tax. If he is a person I agree carrying on a business, he is supposed to make a return in the ordinary way, and to pay taxation on his income. But if he is an agent who receives money sporadically or occasionally for sales effected by himself or somebody else, he would accept the benefits of section 15, because he That is where the would, say, "" I cannot make out a profit It is perfectly right on these sales, but I will pay taxation on 5 per cent."" The man who receives the money is tlie person who ought to be made responsible for paying the whole of the income tax, whether it is measured in the ordinary way upon a statement of profits, But to say that, in respect of or under section 15 as 5 per cent, on the sales effected. I suggest for the consideration of the Prime Minister that an investigation w ill disclose that section 52 does cover, not only the man who conducts a business and presents a return in the ordinary way, but also the man who Such a provision receives money on sales effected by himI am satisfied self or anybody else. If he is liable to pay income tax on that money, it is unnecessary to make liable the person who effects the sale, but does not receive the On money. A t the same time, it is necessary that the person who effects the sale should supply the Department with a f u l l return. If he also receives the money, he pays taxation, but if he does not he fortifies That is the whole position. the Department with the whole of the information on which the person who does honourable receive the money is made liable.

But the amendment as applied to section 15, creating a direct personal liability on the part of the agent to pay out of his own money taxation on money received by another person, who is liable to taxation, would lead to difficulties which the Attorney-General would do well to consider.

I think that the requirements of the honourable member for Corangamite are met by section 64, which provides that a Board, consisting of the Commissioner, tlie Secretary to the Treasury, and the Coniptroller-peneral of Customs, may, in cases of hardship, release taxpayers, wholly or in part, from their liability. Sir [11.44] I wish to move That the following paragraph be added to the clause: (7t) by inserting in paragraph & after the word "" State"" the words "" and Federal."" The object of the amendment is to enable the deduction of Federal income tax when arriving at the taxable income. As I had not an opportunity on the last occasion, I wish to bring the matter up now. ""Under the principal Act, the payments of Federal land tax and State land tax are -allowed to be deducted in arriving at the taxable income. Further, State income tax and municipal taxes may be deducted, but, for some reason or other which I cannot ascertain, the Federal income tax is not deductible. lawyers and others, and I cannot ascert a in why. The assessment is made on the previous year's income, and, if the deductions I have mentioned are proper, I see no reason why an exception should be made of the Federal income tax. Minister and Attorney-General) [11.48]. -The point raised by the right honourable gentleman has no doubt occurred to many, and it is a standing mystery even to the most having been permitted access to the in most secrets of the Commissioner's office, I have been able to learn the reason for this exception from the general rule. The object of this taxation is, of course, to obtain revenue, and, technically, there is no doubt that our power to impose taxation includes the power to tax the whole income; that is to say, we could impose a tax of 20s. in the i l . If taxpayers were allowed to deduct the amount If the honorof income tax paid, aud a tax of 20s. in the £ 1 were imposed, a taxpayer would have the right to deduct the whole, and would, therefore, pay no tax. at all. That is the explanation of the position, and when stated in these terms it is perfectly obvious. We do not tax the amount paid in State income tax because that taxation has nothing to do with us; but to make the exemption now suggested would be to exempt the very income that we are taxing, and render the instrument of taxation a piece of worthless paper. Sir JOJ i N FORREST (Swan) [11.50]. I am much obliged to the Attorney General, but I do not think there is much in his argument. If the only object of this taxation is to raise revenue, why have any deductions at all ? When, howJOHN FORREST (Swan) ever, there are deductions, why should an exception be made in a case which is clearly one in the same category as the others. I submit that the explanation is not very edifying, at any rate to me. same principle as that laid down by the Attorney General is in operation in the case of the Income TaxA c t , Victoria. ThatA c t forbids the deduction of the amount' paid in the previous year, but allows the deduction of Federal taxes and all other State taxes. We may look at the matter from a different point of view. Let us take the case of a man with an income of £1,000 a year, when it is decided to impose a tax of 10 per cent., I have consulted representing £ 1 0 0 . If the next year this man was allowed to deduct the £10 0 paid in the previous year, tlie country would not get 10 per cent, on £1,000. The principle is thoroughly sound, and I agree with the view of the Commissioner. toThat the following paragraph be inserted:"" (I) Sums paid by way of commission for collecting income.""

Minister and Attorney-General) [11.55]. I move That after clause 6 the following new clause he inserted:""6A. Section 27 of the principal Aot is amended(a) by adding at the end of sub-section 1 thereof the following proviso:' Provided that in the assessment of a partnership entered into before the commencement of this Act there shall be deducted from the total tax assessable to the partnerbalance "" will not put such estates out of ship so much of the total tax as bears to the total tax the proportion which that part (if any) of the whole income which is distributed to the partners bears to the whole income.' (6) by adding after sub-section 2 thereof the following sub-section:' (2A) For the purposes of subsection 2 of this section income shall be deemed to be distributed if, in thc opinion of the Commissioner, it is held by the trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary, who is a minor, or for the reasonable expenditure of the trust estate.' (o) by omitting from sub-section 3 thereof the words ' to such of the beneficiaries as are taxpayers,' and inserting in their stead the words ' to the beneficiaries.' "" This new clause is proposed in order to limit the effect of a previous amendment made in the incidence of taxation on partners, to partnerships entered into before the coming into operation of the B ill . The honourable member for M a r ibyrnong, in a letter that he sent to the Department, cited a case of gross unfairness arising through the operation of the clause as it stands. The amendment was intended to make the incidence fall more equitably on partners. pointed out, however, that bogus partnerships might be created in order to get the benefit of the section; and the present amendment is intended to confine t h a t benefit to partnerships made before the commencement of the Act. This clause also affects trustees and beneficiaries, and is, I believe, due to the suggestions of a Trustee Company. It is not quite clear to me, however, that the B ill as amended will touch the case of an ordinary beneficiary, who is neither a minor nor has had sums kept back for repairs and maintenance. Eor instance, in the case of an estate distributed on 2nd July, a whole quarterly instalment of income would, on the 30th June, he held over technically. I am informed that this is safeguarded by section 28, sub-section 3, of the original ActWhen tbe income of any person cannot be conveniently returned as for the year fixed by this Act, the Commissioner may accept returns made up to the date of the annual balance of the accounts of such person. But there is no "" a n n u a l balance"" in this sense in the case of a trust estate; there are quarterly payments, and I am in doubt as to whether the words "" annual court, and involve taxation at a higher amount on sums not really, but technically, "" held back."" This, I am sure, was never intended by the Government or by the House; and I ask the Attorney General to look into the matter. Minister and Attorney-General) [12.0]. I shall do so. The object of the amendment is to relieve hardship in the case of certain trust estates, and although it is quite satisfactory to the trustee company referred to, it may f a i l to cover some of the points raised. I shall look into the matter before the B ill finally leaves another place, and see what is necessary to be done. The Commissioner says that he can adjust the date of distribution, and that it is not fixed by the return. However, if there be any other points I shall see to them. Proposed new clause agreed to.

I have no desire to enter into a wrangle with the members of the Public Works Committee as to the usefulness of their labours. merely express a doubt as to the wisdom of referring to them these purely policy works, which the Government intend to proceed with regardless of whether or not they are going to be paying propositions. The next point is as to we should proceed at the present time. Administration decided to build the Pine Creek to Katherine River line upon a 4-ft. 8^-in. extension basis. say, we decided that the line should be built on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, so as to link up with the Northern Territory line; but the sleepers, culverts, and cuttings and curves were to be such as would enable the immediate conversion of the line to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. That was decided in anticipation of the almost immediate unification of the Australian gauges. good policy. The difficulty, however, is that, if we are to accept the ex-Prime Minister as the mouthpiece of events, the unification of the Australian railway gauges is indefinitely postponed. line should be built on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. It is a mere waste of money, if we are to havo no unification of gauges, to build a 3-ft. 6-in. line on 4-ft. 8^-in. sleepers. The cost of ballasting a 4-ft. 8^-in. line is in finitely greater than that of ballasting a 3-ft. 6-in. line. as to whether this railway ought not to be earth-packed throughout. memhers may talk of the necessity for the quick passage of live stock. curry line, however, is an earth-packed railway, with a maximum speed of 15 miles an hour, and it is carrying in the neighbourhood of 300,000 stock per annum to the meat works-a n infinitely greater traffic than we shall have on this line. better meat if carried at 30 miles an E v e r y one reads the rehour. now under consideration. We have to consider economy; yet we are deliberately proposing to build a line upon specifications to connect up with the uniform gauge system, although, judging by the ex-Prime Minister's utterances, there is I no possibility of a uniform railway system in Australia for many years to come. We ought not to proceed with this line u n t i l we know exactly what is to be done with respect to a uniform gauge, and generally in regard to the Northern Territory railway system connecting both South whether, in the circumstances, Australia and Queensland.

There are sections of the line from Pine Creek to Katherine River yet to be completed, and I believe it would pay the Government to find employment for these men elsewhere in the Commonwealth rather than to proceed with this work at a time when a hugely increased expenditure must be involved. appeal for economy, the honourable member for Wakefield suggested that too much reliance should not be placed on the day-labour system. anxious as he is for economy, I would remind him that in Victoria, where we have in power the only Liberal Administration in Australia, the day-labour system has been in force for many years, and that, according to the Minister of Public Works, the State railways are constructed for far less than would be possible under the contract system.

The question for tlie House to consider is I do not believe that. whether this is the most opportune time to build the railway. The Minister of Home Affairs has told us that one of the principal reasons for undertaking the work at the present time is to provide employment for a number of the men at present engaged in the construction of the section previously sanctioned by ParliaI n making his ment. It is said that there are about 500 men employed on that railway, and that unless the proposed extension is proceeded with a number of the men will be As one who is as thrown out of employment, and the authorities will be faced later with the necessity of reorganizing the whole gang. When we realize the difficulty and expense of taking men to the Territory, we can quite understand the anxiety of the Minister to have the work put in hand, in order to retain the men who are already there. The Minister of External Affairs has given a guarantee that the laying of the project has been inquired into and reported upon by the Public Works Committee. That assurance has considerably relieved the situation. I would point out to the House the difficult position in which the Committee would be placed if asked I think to report on a railway, the construction I do not want to refer to other of which had already been decided upon by the House.

We have had a Tariff before us for twelve months, and yet it has not received legislative sanction. When we finished discussing the last Estimates, the If it is possible for financial year had nearly expired, and apparently we are going to have that experience again. However, I hold that we are justified in overlooking the irregularity, in the hope that the Public Works Committee will obtain for us the necessary information; and I have sufficient confidence in the Committee to believe that that will be the case. For example, a good deal has been said about a low-level bridge. I think the Committee w ill find that, for all pracUnder tical purposes, such a bridge will answer the traffic requirements of the Territory for a good many years. A t all events, I am satisfied that if the Chief Engineer recommends a low-level bridge, we ought to be guided by his opinion, because no man in Australia has had more experience of such bridges for railway purposes over rivers where the current in flood time is much stronger and swifter than we have reason to believe it is in the Katherine.

That is the course I personally favour, because then the whole responsibility of proceeding with the work would rest with the Government. This railway must be constructed in order to settle the country, and in order that we may get some return from the 200 miles of railway already in existence. The sooner we discard foolish settlement experiments and develop the Territory as cattle and stock country, the better it w i ll be for all concerned.

The Committee must investigate these proposals, and report on them to Parliament, when it is for the House to decide whether a work referred to the Committee shall be carried out. The assurance having been given that this work wil l not be commenced until a favorable report has been received from the Committee, I shall not oppose the taking of action by the Government on that report, though it would be a different matter if the report were adverse. The reference of the work to the Committee is primd facie evidence of the approval of the House. I understand that the Minister will not do anything until a favorable report has been received from the Committee, and, that assurance having been given, I shall support the B ill . This is not, in my opinion, an opportune time for the construction of large public works; but I am so anxious that something sliould be done for the development of the Northern Territory that I am in favour of the continuation of the railway. I am, of course, desirous The extension from the Katherine that work shall be found for the 500 or 600 men now' engaged in railway construction in the Territory, though I would not consider it justifiable to expend £320,000 on an extension of the railway merely to find them employment. However, I certainly approve of this work on its merits. As to the crossing of the Katherine, I think that a low-level bridge will do for the present. I understand that the rainfall in that part of the country is about 17 inches, and, although a good deal of it comes at one time, I do not think a low-level bridge would be washed away. Certainly, I would not present time on a high-level bridge. The primary object in view is the development of the Northern Territory by giving railway communication. The Territory must be connected with the Queensland railway system, and the Commonwealth must also connect it with the South Australian railway system to keep its .bargain with that State. Of the two connexions, I think that that with the Queensland railway system should be made first. that the transcontinental line shall be better friend to that line than I am. I was Treasurer in the Government which made the contract between the Commonwealth and South Australia, of which I approved. B ut one or two of the representatives of the States seem intent upon driving its friends into the camp of the enemy. The only really good country near to Port Darwin is that on the Barclay Tableland,"" and I would bring the line first southwards through Bitter Springs, Newcastle Waters, Anthony's Lagoon, and Alroy Station to Camooweal.

The announcement of -the Prime Minister indicates what, to an outsider, seems an extraordinary state of things. He has read to us a mechanical statement of the bare facts concerning 'the torpedoing of a vessel when, unofficially, even the details of the occurrence have been perfectly well known for -weeks past. There may have been Imperial reasons for withholding the official -publication of the news, but they are beyond comprehension. If the unofficial -reports be true, any proper relation of what occurred would be warmed by some -of the most heroic stories of the war, and it is a pity that these stories cannot be told to the public. I am glad that the Government is taking steps to ascertain whether the details cannot be made public. In my opinion the publication of this tale of undaunted heroism, and wonderful endurance and fortitude, would make a fine and stirring recruiting appeal. I do not know why it should not be made known officially. Is the Prime Minister ;able to say why this bare official statement of the occurrence has been held back for two months?

It is quite clear that under section 15 of the original Act the only thing touched is the 5 per cent -a n artificial basis;profit upon sales actually effected in Australia. The agent is made personally responsible for the payment of income tax. I pointed out that the real pay objection to the section was that it imposed on these agents for tlie year of assessment, which ended on the 30th June last, the obligation to pay out of their own moneys the tax upon the profits of their principals, although they might have received no money whatever from those principals. That has been rectified, and I appreciate the courtesy That is the of the Government in attending to my objections!. Buit the objection now raised is of a totally different character. The amendment extends the operation of section 15. It does not impose any obligation upon the agent at a l l , but it does impose an obligation upon a man who sells goods, not here, but in London. Such a man will have to pay income tax I give the Committee upon the sale of such goods if any advertising agent for those goods was employed by him, either on salary or commission, in Australia.

They do give attention to the work, but the honourable gentleman repeats himself so often that he becomes tiresome, and honourable members cannot stay here to listen to him. I do not understand the suggestion that firms maintain agents here in order to benefit Australia. They do so because it pays them to do so, and the expenses of their agencies have to be borne by the Australian consumers of their goodsi. would be cheaper than they are but for the expenses connected with keeping up the Australian agencies for their sale. I know of one English firm that for the last thirty-five years has been represented by a paid agent in Australia who draws a very fair salary. this agency has, in my opinion, been detrimental to Australia, because the agent acts in concert with the officials of certain State Departments with whom he is on very friendly terms, with the result that departmental supplies are kept so short that when tenders are called for fresh supplies the time allowed is so brief It comes to that only the English firms that have the goods already prepared can comply wiuh the conditions. One result is to defer the manufacture in Australia of these goods. The interest shown by the honourable member for Parramatta in these agencies is remarkable, but I am afraid it is not due I am telling to the reasons he has advanced.

309,The Establishment Of Motion (By Mr Hughes ) Agreed To,"M ANUFACTU RE OF PAINT : MENT OF LOCAL INDUSTRIES-MEMBER S OF PARLIAMENT AND DEFENCE SERVICE -CENSORIN G OF W AR NEWS OLD AGE AND That the House do now adjourn. £12.31] I desire to impress upon tbe Minister of Trade and Customs tbe necessity for fostering in every way our local industries. to-day paint manufacturers who have to compete w it h the imported article which is retailed to the public in tins of handy -sizes. On such paint there is a duty of about £5 per ton, but owing to certain disabilities suffered by the local manufacturers that protection is very largely removed. One of the principal constituents of mixed paint, as sold to the public, is Soya bean o i l , which, being an edible o i l likely to come into competition with olive o i l , is subject to a duty of 2s. 6d. per gallon. The Department of Trade and Customs, w i th the laudable desire of encouraging the paint industry here, agreed that the duty on Soya bean oil used in the manufacture of paint should be reduced to 3d. per gallon, subject to the oil being denatured. It was found that fish oi l could not be used in denaturing the Soya bean oil, since it has an offensive aroma, so that resort had to be had to linseed o i l , on which there is a duty of 6d. per gallon. The Customs Department demand that the manufacturers shall pay not only a duty of 3d. per gallon on the. Soya bean o i l , but the extra duty of 3d. per gallon on linseed oil used in the mixing of paint, so tliat there is a total duty of 9d. .per gallon to be paid on the linseed oil, which is equal to a duty of 4^d. per gallon all round. The effect of this is that the protection of £ 5 per ton enjoyed by paint manufacturers is reduced to something like 15s. per ton, so that it is impossible for local manufacturers to compete with the imported article. B y way of illustration, I would point out that the Minister lately imposed a duty on the frames used in the manufacture of portmanteaux, because such frames are now being made here. That was a wise ducing the Protection enjoyed by local leather bag-makers, so that they are entitled to receive some further considerathis question .of the duty on paint, and on the oils used in its manufacture; but it is, after all, the first duty of Customs officials to see that the revenue is protected, and they impose conditions-for which, of course, the Minister must be held responsible-whic h bear rather harshly on the local manufacturers. To those who are not deeply interested in the success of Australian industries, this may seem a small matter to bring up at the close We bave in Australia of the session; but I would point out that the manufacture of paint is fraught w i th big possibilities to Australia, and that a very good article is being produced here. I ask the Minister to consider this case, and to make an effort to grant some furthe r consideration to those engaged in the industry. I suggested yesterday that the Government should make use of honourable members who arc prepared to assist pvacrically in the defence of Australia. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister who, we all know, is the present driving force of the Government, is ahout to visit the Old Country, I wish to emphasize this point. It seems to me that, so f a r , the Government have not made anything like the f u l l use of the ""many in the Commonwealth who are prepared to give of their best to the country's cause. No doubt there are a number who believe of the war, as did the sports of Gordon's poem, that it is all over bar shouting, but it is not. The Government should encourage every person who is _ prepared to give his services to the Empire to come forward and do so, but so f a r there has been no such attempt; on the contrary, decided discouragement has been shown. In this morning's press we were told that the Postal Department is still going to great expense in distributing the referenda pamphlets, suggesting one of two things-that the Government have overlooked this wasteful expenditure if so, it is time it was stopped-o r that they are not in earnest in regard to withdrawing the referenda. Possibly they are under the impression that the Legislative Councils of the States will reject the",38,Special Adjournment

I shall take immediate steps to prevent any further delivery. said some severe things about the Prime Minister, I am convinced that he is as patriotic and as much an Imperialist as any man amongst us; but I am afraid when he goes to the Old Country to f u l f i l his mission, if he does not beforehand p u t in train the matter of utilizing the services of the thousands of people who are offering themselves, our war arrangements will not be carried out with all the vigour that should be put into them. I believe that the Prime Minister a broad outlook, and that he has as loyal beliefs as any man in the Commonwealth, and that he is thorough in his Imperialism. From my point of view, and that of many thousands of citizens of Australia, we should make use of the services of every one who is prepared to offer their services to the Empire, and we should, at tlie same time, stop all useless expenditure. I hope that the Prime Minister will have a safe trip to England and back. There is probably no one in the Commonwealth who would be able to represent us in any Imperial Council better than he will be able to do. A little while ago I raised the matter of the torpedoing of the transport Southland, as to which a statement has appeared in this morning's press. My complaint is that in connection with that statement there is no account of what every one knows happened at the time. We ought to be told of the heroism that was shown by Autsralians. Every young man on that boat showed courage and discipline equal to that which would be displayed by veterans. Why Why ment to send to Great Britain to ask if a statement which has been received here, and is creditable to the neople of Australia, can bejmblished ? It is unfortunate that the two statements could not have been published at the same time. What harm could there be in letting people know that Australians volunteered to return to that boat and remained on it for forty minutes when every one thought that it was sinking, and eventually beached it ? When an officer asked for volunteers, it was Australians who I did not know that volunteered; it was young Australians who lined up and stood to their posts like veterans. It was a display of heroism that has never been surA l t h o u g h I have passed. A little while ap/o there appeared in the Australian newspapers a cabled account of the British Fleet, and in the middle of the account tliere was a line to the effect that some matter bad been excised by order of the censors. I asked in the House whether this excision was done on the order of British or Australian censors, and the Minister for the Navy told me that he would make inquiries. Next day, however, apparently as the result of my auestion, the censor has allowed the deleted matter to be published, showing that it was an Australian censor who had given the order. The words censored spoke very highly of Australia and the Australians. It seems to me that a littl e common sense should be exercised in this matter. The other day I raised a question in regard to pensions, and the Treasurer had not the courtesy to reply. WhatI desired to know was this: If [12.45] a mother has no means other than an old-age pension, is that pension to be deducted from the pension to which she is entitled if her son is killed at the f r o n t ? I regret having to occupy the time of honourable members at this hour of the session, but I am justified in doing so by reason of the non-fulfilment of certain promises made to me by the Prime Minister, and because of the unsatisfactory nature of his replies to some questions put by me. The honourable gentleman distinctly promised that certain papers would be laid on the table of the Library, more than a fortnight ago. They have not been placed there yet. He also gave replies to certain questions which I put cannot that fact be published ? to him, and, in view of information with is it necessary for the Governwhich I have been furnished, I have every reason to doubti the veracity of those replies.

Yet, when I asked for a chance of repeating the assertions on oath, Mr Hughes has been discreetly silent for a fortnight. The conclusion is obvious that, I quite recognise that it was alarming as my statement was, it was only too true. The Prime Minister told the House that he was not aware of the fact that 40 or 50 tons of molybdenite, which was badly wanted in the Old Country, had been held back. It must be remembered that we are producing about two-thirds of the world's output of molybdenite. member seriously make the statement that I knew that a quantity of 'molybdenite had been removed from a certain vessel ? prepared to make his statements upon oath.
