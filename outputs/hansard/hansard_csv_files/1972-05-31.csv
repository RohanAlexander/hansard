presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Social Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned electors of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights'. Article 25 reads: 'Everyone has the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.' Yet, 23 years later, in our country of great national wealth and abundance it is to the nation's shame that many thousands of our people live in a state of being inconsistent with the dignity and worth of the human person-languishin g in poverty and want, neglect and the lack of proper care necessary for their health and well-being. We, the undersigned, respectfully draw to your attention that the conscience of the nation is not at ease while the records of our country show that social services are not comparable with that of other advanced countries administering such services, therefore, we call upon the Commonwealth Government to immediately legislate for: Base pension rate-3 0 per cent of the average weekly male earnings, all states, plus supplementary assistance and allowances based on a percentage of such earnings. Unemployed benefits equal to the foregoing. Completely free health services to cover all needs of social service pensioners-hos pitalisation, chronic and long-term illness, fractures, anaesthetics, specialist, pharmaceutical, hearing aids, dental, optical, physiotherapy, chiropody, surgical aids and any other appliances. Commonwealth Government to promote a comprehensive national scheme in cooperation with the States and make finance available to provide for the building of public hospitals, nursing and hostel-type homes necessary to effectively meet the special requirements of aged people, in conjunction with a comprehensive domiciliary care programme to enable aged people to stay in their homes. Mental illness placed in the same position as physical illness. Substantial Commonwealth increase in the $5 subsidy a day per public bed pensioner patient in general hospitals.

Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth: (a) That the Australian Education Council's report on the needs of government education services has established serious deficiencies in education, the most important areas being a severe shortage of teachers, inadequate accommodation, and, as a result, oversized classes. (b) That extra Federal finance is urgently required to save the government school system. (c) That while the needs of the government schools are being neglected, large amounts of public money is being given, in various and numerous grants, to private schools.

2,The Clerk,"Petitions have been lodgedEducation The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: That the Commonwealth Parliament has acted to remove some inadequacies in the Australian Education system. That there is a major inadequacy at present in the Australian education opportunity for all. That more than 500,000 children suffer from serious lack of equal opportunity. That Australia cannot afford to waste the talents of one sixth of its school children. That only the Commonwealth has the financial resources for special programmes to remove inadequacies. That nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that the chief impetus for change and the finance for improvements come from the National Government. Your petitioners request that your honourable House make legal provision for1. A joint Commonwealth/State enquiry into the inequalities in Australian education to obtain evidence on which to base long term national programmes for the elimination of inequalities. 2. The immediate financing of official programmes for low income earners, migrants, Aborigines, rural and inner suburban dwellers and handicapped children. 3. The provision of pre-school opportunities for all children from culturally different or socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bennett. Petition received. Aboriginal Welfare To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That there is a crisis in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability. That there is a need to phase out Native Reserves in the South West Land Division of Western Australia over the next three years. That town housing must be provided for all Aboriginal families where the bread winner has permanent employment or an age or invalid pension entitlement That such housing must be supported by the appointment of permanent 'Home-maker' assistance in the ratio of one home-maker to every eight houses or part thereof. That incentives of housing, 'home-maker' services and training facilities must be created in centres of potential employment for those who are currently unemployed or unemployable. That insufficient State or Federal assistance has been made available to meet these requirements. That adequate finance to meet these requirements can only be provided by the Commonwealth government. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will give earnest consideration to this most vital matter. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Kirwan. Petition received. Postmaster-General's Department The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Postmaster-General's Department Central Office policy, of centralising Post Office affairs and activities under the various titles of Area Management, Area Mail Centres, Area Parcel Centres and similar titles is resulting in both loss of service and lowering of the standards of service to the public, directly resulting in the closing of Post Offices, which is detrimental to the public interest. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will take immediate steps to: 1. Call a halt to all closing of Post Offices and reorganising within the Post Office until full details of the proposed savings and all details of alteration to the standards of service to the public are made available to Parliament, and 2. Initiate a joint Parliamentary inquiry into the Postmaster-General's Department, to assess the degree on which it should be run as a normal business undertaking and to what extent its unprofitable activities should be subsidised as a public service charged more correctly to national development. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bonnett and D r Everingham. Petitions severally received. Eyre Highway To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, we, the citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia, residents in the State of Western Australia, do humbly petition and pray that all levels of Government responsible in Australia will take note of the wishes of we, the citizens, in so far as we request: That the Commonwealth co-operate with all authorities to ensure the early sealing of the one east-west road link, the Eyre Highway, and that urgent consideration be given to increasing the maintenance of the road in the intervening period and endeavour to curtail the dreadful road toll, injury and vehicle damage. That the Commonwealth consider this road as a Defence Measure for the whole of Australia and road link connecting the two coasts of the continent, and consideration to the sealing from the aspects of the increase of trade and tourism within Australia, thus encouraging the retention of the finance in Australia which is now going overseas. Consideration be given on the grounds of a better understanding between the people of the States of Australia, because of their improved ability to travel and meet one another. That consideration be given to one of the most heavily taxed groups within the community, the motorist, and be given the opportunity to enjoy some of the tax fee as charged, by being able to travel with reasonable comfort and safety on the major highways of Australia. That consideration be given to returning specifically for this purpose the increased revenue received from the increase in petrol tax. We, the petitions humbly pray that the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled would take immediate steps to ensure provision of funds to provide for the all weather sealing of this important highway, the Eyre Highway, linking east and west and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bennett. Petition received. Broadcasting and Television To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth: 1. That the Australian people both in Metropolitan and Rural areas should have the best of television programmes available to them and that television as a powerful means of communication should not be in the control of too few hands. 2. The increased quota for Australian dramatic productions should not be imposed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board at the expense of Australian professional variety or Australian documentary or educational programmes, but directed more towards cutting down expenditure on the purchase of imported productions, thus effecting a considerable saving in Australia's overseas balance of payments. 3. The Australian Parliament has a responsibility to encourage the development of our National identity, character and heritage and the promulgation, for the sake of our children, of an adequate picture of Australia, her standards, mores and way of life, particularly through the media of Radio and Television, which is in the immediate control of the Australian Government. 4. Until constructive and positive action is taken by the Australian Government to promote Australian culture and protect the employment and professional standards of Australian writers, artists and producers in Australia itself there is little likelihood of stopping the flow of Australian talent from Australia to other countries. S. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board must insist that its new quota standards of Australian dramatic content on television are rigidly imposed and enforced on all commercial television stations. Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, shouldCause the Australian Government to recognise the right of Australian professional people engaged in the creative and performing arts to further develop their skills and talents in Australia, and to be protected from overseas programmes in a way that will encourage an Australian Television and Radio industry that can reflect and contribute to our identity and growth as a Nation. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will every pray. by Mr Dobie. Petition received. Aboriginal Embassy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned electors (Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, Islander and nonIslanders) of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That the Aboriginal Embassy established on the lawns opposite Parliament House Canberra is less offensive aesthetically, more comfortable and hygienic than conditions under which many Aboriginal people are presently living. 2. That it has been recognised by Foreign Governments and its Officials have always acted with due dignity and decorum becoming their Official Status. And we, the undersigned, respectfully request that: (a) Proposed legislation to enable the Government to abolish this Aboriginal Embassy be immediately withdrawn, and (b) That the Aboriginal Embassy be given free and dignified accommodation befitting Ambassadorial Status in a suitable building in Canberra City. Further-w e protest against the proposed legislation as being undemocratic, un-Australian and a threat to the freedom of all Australian citizens. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bryant. Petition received. Social Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That due to higher living costs, including increasing charges for health services, most aged persons living on fixed incomes are suffering acute distress. That Australia is the only English-speaking country in the world to retain a means test for aged pensioners and that a number of European countries also have no means test. That today's aged persons have paid at least 7i per cent of their taxable incomes towards social services since the absorption, of Special Social Services Taxation in Income Tax and continue to make such payments. (7i per cent of all taxable incomes for 1966-67 amounted to $783,082,150 and this year will produce more than $800,000,000, more than sufficient to abolish the means test immediately.) That the middle income group, the most heavilytaxed sector of the community, subsidises the tax commitment of the upper income bracket through the amount of social services contributions collected politan area and surrounding districts respectfully by the government and not spent on the purposes for which they were imposed. That the abolition of the means test will give a boost to the economy by(1) additional tax revenue from pensions (2) swelling of tbe work force, and (3) increased spending by pensioners. That it is considered just and right to allow people who have been frugal, have lived their lives with dignity and have been anything but an encumbrance on the nation, to maintain that dignity to the end of their lives free from fear of penury. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will take immediate steps to abolish the means test for all people who have reached retiring age or who otherwise qualify for social service benefits or pensions. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bennett Petition received. Pakistani Refugees To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully sheweth: That death from mass starvation and disease is occurring among Pakistan's refugees on a scale unprecedented in modern history. That, as part of the world community, the Australian Government has an immediate responsibility for concerted action. That present Government aid to the refugees in India is meagre and shameful for a country of Australia's position and wealth. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, should: Increase monetary aid for the refugees in India to at least $1.00 per capita immediately and make provision for a further and extra grant for the victims of the famine in East Pakistan. Grant tax deductibility to donations of $2.00 and accordance with the provisions laid down and over to Australian voluntary agencies working with the refugee problem. Ensure that the Australian Government does all in its power to help bring about a political settlement which would be acceptable to the people of East Pakistan. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Wallis. Petition received. Richmond Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition from certain residents of the western suburbs in the Sydney Metroshoweth: That due to an expanding passenger air travel business together with larger and more powerful jet aircraft, aircraft noise has already become a serious problem for people living in the vicinity of airports. That jet aircraft operations have a detrimental effect by way of air and noise pollution on the environment and airports should be situated so as to preserve the environment of populated areas. That protest should be made against the proposal to establish an international airport at Richmond owing to the detrimental effect it would have for the environment there and in surrounding districts. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that this House take appropriate steps to ensure that the Government does not proceed with the proposal to site the second, twenty four hour international airport for Sydney at Richmond or anywhere else in the far western suburbs of the metropolitan area. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Lncherti. Petition received. Universal Declaration of Human Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This humble petition of citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia showeth: That in January 1972 the Soviet Secret Police, the KGB, arrested 19 prominent intellectuals in Ukraine on charges of alleged anti-Soviet activities. That in fact the activities of the arrested intellectuals consisted of: Opposing1. Secret trials and harsh sentences of imprisonment; 2. The forced Russification of Ukraine; 3. The destruction of Ukrainian culture; and demanding: 1. Greater cultural and political autonomy for Ukraine; 2. The implementation of the Civil Liberties guaranteed by Soviet Law. That the above mentioned activities are all in guaranteed by Articles 124, 125 and 17 of the Soviet Constitution. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Federal Government1. Take the necessary diplomatic steps tp defend the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is being violated by the Soviet authorities. 2. Urge the United Nations to effectively internecessary to find an experienced sales vene on behalf of the arrested and jailed Ukrainian intellectuals. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Fox. Petition received. WOOL: RANDALL COMMITTEE OF Primary Industry a question. Has the Randall Committee reported on the remaining areas into which it has been inquiring? If so, has Cabinet yet considered the report? If the Government has received the report but has not yet considered it, when does the honourable gentleman expect that Cabinet will consider it? In any case, how soon would he expect to be able to make an announcement on the result of Cabinet's deliberations on the report? part of the honourable gentleman's question is yes; the answer to the second part of his question is no; and the answer to the third part is 'as soon as possible'. As soon as the Government has made a decision it will be announced publicly, well in advance of the opening of the new wool selling season. Supply a question. Now that the Government has agreed to produce 20 of the ProjectN aircraft manufactured by the Government Aircraft Factories, will the Minister inform the House of the action that is being taken to promote sales and whether the aircraft has yet been named? pursuing a vigorous campaign to sell the aircraft, which at present is known as Project N, and is examining several alternatives to find an experienced sales representative or representatives with a world-wide network of contracts. The Government believes that there is cause for confidence in selling this aircraft. Although it is probable that the aircraft can be sold in lots of one's and two's only, the interest which has been shown indicates that it should be possible to sell a considerable number of the aircraft. For that reason it is organisation. I hope to be able to announce before very long that one has been found. However, on this point I would say that the Australian aircraft industry has a great opportunity to sell many of these aircraft, provided that it can maintain fairly stable cost of production. As to the second part of the question, honourable members will be aware that the Government has received many suggestions for a name for this aircraft and that competitions have been held by radio stations and newspapers for this purpose. The Government has taken advice about the sort of name that would be more acceptable in the markets to which it looks, namely, in North America and Europe, and has decided that the name of the aircraft should be Nomad. the Minister for Shipping and Transport. In the event of the compulsory conference in Sydney this afternoon not reaching a decision, will the Minister give urgent consideration to convening immediately a conference of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, together with officials of the union concerned and the Australian National Line, in at attempt to avert a tie-up of all ANL ships which, if it occurs, would have very serious effects on the economic life of the island State of Tasmania? question refers to the fact that the Professional Radio Employees Institute of Australasia has threatened to withdraw its operators from Australian National Line ships in protest at the use of the ship 'Echuca' on the run from Melbourne to Tasmania to service that State's export container trade. As the House may recall, the ANL purchased the 'Echuca' specifically for the Melbourne to Tasmania run and provision was made for the use of a radio telephone operator rather than the usual wireless telegraphers-the sort of dit-dit-dit-dash men-that ships traditionally carry.",15,Petitions

8,Mr Nixon,"The honourable member'sSome time last year the members of the Professional Radio Employees Institute went out on strike and, as a result, tied up the ships of the Australian National Line. After a great deal of consultation with all the unions involved it emerged that no other union believed that safety of life at sea our attitude on that. was imperilled or that ships were endangered in any way by transferring from wireless operators to radio telephonists. Finally, the 'Echuca' was allowed to sail and the National Line ships put to sea on the condition that there was set up a committee consisting of technicians from the Postmaster-General's Department and from, I think, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd, or some other experts in radio, as well as representatives of the unions involved, to study the effect of the use of radio telephony as against wireless operation. It has always amazed me that although we can talk by radiotelephone to men on the moon, members of the Professional Radio Employees Institute refuse to believe that we can talk to people half way across Bass Strait without impairing safety..There has been reasonable peace since the committee was set up. The facts are that the committee is about to report back to me and, I imagine, to the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and to the employer representatives, on the long term use of radio telephonists as against wireless operators. 1 am absolutely staggered to think that the Professional Radio Employees Institute should take strike action at a time, when, shall we say, the umpire is about to make a decision. It seems to me a quite irrational and irresponsible thing to threaten to tie up the Australian National Line ships and to place in jeopardy not only the freight from the island State of Tasmania, with all the troubles that that foreshadows, but also the operations of the overseas ships of the Australian National Line. It has taken us years, of course, to get back into the overseas shipping business and now, by some irresponsible action on the part of one union, we can see the possibility of all the ships of the Australian National Line being tied up. I deplore the attitude that has been taken by the Professional Radio Employees Institute on this occasion. I think it is totally deplorable and quite irresponsible. I cannot use strong enough words to describe it. the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me. will use his good offices with the President of the ACTU, Mr Hawke, to do something to pull this union into line. ought to do something to pull this union into line. NAVY: DISCHARGES directed to the Minister for the Navy. Some weeks ago, I think in answer to a question from the Opposition, the Minister indicated that he hoped to introduce a system whereby naval personnel could get a full discharge by giving 18 months notice. How is this plan developing? How will this affect the numerical strength of the Service, especially of senior personnel? few weeks ago I was asked a question about this matterI think by the honourable member for Sydney-and I indicated that I had hopes that a scheme of free discharge, after giving 18 months notice subsequent to certain requirements of return of service being fulfilled, could be instituted. I am happy to say that agreement has been reached on this scheme and it will be announced in the course of a few days. The details of the scheme, roughly speaking, are that a junior recruit now entering the Navy at ISi years of age at HMAS 'Leeuwin' will not be required to serve the full 12 years of his engagement. He will have to fulfil a minimum requirement of 4 i years service. As to the effect on the numbers borne in the Service, of course the basic idea behind it is to make the Service more attractive as a career for young men. It is hoped that this scheme will improve the enlistment rate, which is not entirely satisfactory at the moment. Nevertheless there are indications that the naval service is being seen as more and more attractive. The re-entry rate has risen by over 100 per cent in recent months. Re-engagements of senior sailors are running at the rate of about 70 per cent",19,Australian National Line Industrial Dispute

16,Dr Mackay,"It is quite right that awhich is, as everyone will appreciate, a very high figure. 1 will not be satisfied until I see the institution of a scheme whereby sailors can enter the Service for a lifetime career, not simply for stipulated periods of 12 years or 9 years. The scheme would envisage their being able to remain in the Navy throughout their working life with the possibility of discharge after 18 months notice, which would be the minimum requirement. I believe that this will make the Navy still more attractive and will increase the numbers rather than otherwise. Mr FitzPATRICKI direct to the Minister for Primary Industry a question concerning a national fruit marketing authority. 1 remind the Minister that on the 28th September last year the Prime Minister told the honourable member for Franklin that he had referred a communication from the then Premier of Tasmania regarding the establishment of a single national fc'iit marketing authority to the Minister for Primary Industry. As many growers in my electorate are interested in this question, when does the Minister expect to be in a position to indicate what the Commonwealth's attitude is likely to be? this House and elsewhere, there have been very real problems in the horticultural secof the developmental plans has reached tor of primary industry. It is true that there have been discussions at various levels about tbe way the industry could be helped. In addition, following the submission of the report by Professor Grant to the previous Tasmanian Government to the the development of the new port of Darwin Commonwealth Government a representawas completed last year. As the honourtion was made concerning the constitution able gentleman is aware, the case had of either a national export board or an been examined by the Public Works ComAustralian marketing board. As a third mittee and it was shortly thereafter that alternative the Tasmanian Government there was a downturn in the steel industry itself was to consider the constitution of a throughout the world. This caused a falling State board. At this stage I have, through off in the estimated additional requirements consultations with the Apple and Pear for iron ore from Frances Creek in the Board and with others in the industry, Northern Territory. Because this was one been able to identify a few of the particuof the keys to the major bulk facility lar areas where perhaps further assistance development at East Arm this meant that is needed. As the honourable gentleman knows, rising freight rates have been one the matter had to be reviewed. So we called of the particular problems that the indusupon the steering committee to review the try has faced on export markets. This, in situation there. It has been considering conjunction with the problems of excess production in some sectors of the industry, and declining market opportunities, have placed the whole industry in a very difficult position. At the moment a Commonwealth-State committee of officials is examining the alternatives available. Discussions are to be held shortly with State Ministers on some aspects relating to canned deciduous fruits. The whole area is still under active deliberation by the Commonwealth and the States. Unfortunately it is not an area which lends itself to easy solutions. Nonetheless I recognise and the Government recognises the quite critical problem that faces many growers in this area and we are doing all we can to ensure that in respect of the complex arrangements that exist on a Federal basis between the Commonwealth and the States everything that we can do will be expedited. Minister for National Development. I refer to the Government's $23m plans to develop the port of Darwin and also to tbe report concerning it made to the Northern Territory Legislative Council which, along with other considerations, is occupying the attention of an interdepartmental committee. Can the Minister advise the House what stage the reconsideration as the port of Darwin is of vital importance not only to north Australia but also to the whole country? proposals in relation to not proceeding with",20,Australian National Line Industrial Dispute

These proposals, of course, will not be as costly, but they will include the major facility for normal cargo handling and the small ship facility. The bulk loading facility will only be deferred until such time as there is an upturn in the world steel industry and the demand for iron ore increases. We expect that additional contracts would then be available to the producing company in the Northern Territory. At the present time the steering committee has come up with 2 alternative proposals. We are in the process of examining those at the moment and I do hope that my colleague, the Minister for the Interior, and I will be in a position to make an anouncement regarding this in a matter of the next month or so. the Prime Minister. Does he agree that control of the volume of money and credit is the prime function of a national government? Has he noted that in the last 20 years control of money and credit through the Reserve Bank of Australia and the orthodox banking system has dropped from nearly 70 per cent to less than 46 per cent? To what extent has the para-banking system, particularly merchant banks, contributed to this? What action does his Government propose in respect of the excessive inflow of overseas funds which have swollen Australian exchange reserves to a dangerously high level? the honourable gentleman's question, monetary and interest rate policy is obviously one the report is correct, then both parts of his of the instruments that the Government must use in order to control inflationary pressures, but I think that the honourable member will know that on this occasion they have worked only at the margin because the real cause of difficulty was the increase in average wages in excess of productivity. that. tion. As to the second part of the honourable gentleman's question, it is regrettable that so much of the income flows has gone out of the banking system into what shall be called the extra-muralfinanceinstitutions of this country. Mr ConnorYou have the power. Why do you not use it? honourable gentleman, in this case the real cause is the increase in average earnings, particularly in relation to the increase in productivity. Nonetheless, this matter is kept under very close control, and it is one of the matters that no doubt will be dealt with when we are looking at this whole question. control. member for Reid will cease interjecting. There are far too many interjections. been so many interjections from the Opposition and as it is obviously frightened to hear the answers that can be given, I will treat the third part of the honourable gentleman's question as being on the notice paper. the Prime Minister.

Did the report accurately portray Australia's position? of the statement alleged to have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. If statement are inaccurate. He could have ascertained the truth by,firstof all, reading the communique which I issued at the time of President Suharto's visit to Australia, and secondly, he could have easily obtained the information by making an inquiry of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I assure the House that this will be done at an early date. to the Prime Minister and concerns a proposal for a housing finance scheme for servicemen. Does the Prime Minister recall assuring the House when replying to a question 6 months ago 'by the honourable member for La TrObe that the Minister for Housing had already presented a submission for the setting up of a homefinancescheme for members of tbe regular forces?

If the Minister for Housing wishes to answer the question I will allow him to do so. the Cabinet. member will resume his seat in this House some few weeks ago, this matter has been under consideration.

Will the Minister reject any allegations of this nature so that Australian dairy companies will not be disadvantaged in their negotiations for satisfactory long term dairy contracts with other countries? Will the Minister ensure that tbe New Zealand Dairy Board is made aware of our position, and will he request the New Zealand Dairy Board to co-operate more with the Australian Dairy Produce Board? question. Some comment was made by a correspondent about this subject. I do not ruption from the Labor Party indicates know from where he got his information, either a lack of interest in something that but he made a quite unnecessary statement worries a big sector of the rural community that is causing unnecessary anxiety among or an attempt on the part of the honoursome of the people in the Australian dairyable member for Reid to defend the stateing industry.

The Labor Party is interested in the keting in third markets. To avoid any cut throat competition or confusion in the market it was agreed that there would be a very close understanding between the 2 Governments. With Britain going into the European Common Market and with the likelihood of both Australia and New Zealand having difficulty in disposing of their excess production, it is quite vital that we work more closely together. But a suggestion that we would cut our production quite wrong. We have been aiming to create a mechanism whereby Australia would be able to control her situation if we got into difficult marketing circumstances. That is what the Minister for Primary Industry has been endeavouring to try before long. There,has also been some rumour, a mischievous rumour, that New Zealand might hope to get dairy pro r ducts-butter-int o Australia. Anybody who talks this way does not understand the stabilisation and orderly marketing system in this country, which could not allow any imports to necessitate still further exports to other markets.

However, I can understand the honourable member for Murray, who comes from one of the best dairying electorates in Australia, being very interested in and concerned about this subject. Thank goodness there are a few members in this House who display an interest in the topic. I do want to assure the Australian industry that the New Zealand Ministers understand our domestic marketing arrangements. They know that there is no possibility of New Zealand butter being sold on this market while we arc a major butter exporter, and it would not make sense to displace Australian butter merely to put more on the export market. the Minister for Shipping and Transport. I ask the Minister whether any decision has been made as to the use of concrete sleepers in preference to timber sleepers on certain Commonwealth railway lines. Is the honourable gentleman aware of the importance of sleeper production to the timber industry of Western Australia and, indeed, to the employment situation and the economy of Western Australia? Will he see that no decision is taken which will have serious repercussions in the western third of this continent? tations from several members of Parliament for Western Australia-the Minister for Supply, the Minister for Air, the honourable member for Canning and the honourable member for Moore-and I have had representations from the timber milling industry in Western Australia about this problem. I am delighted that the honourable member is now taking a belated interest in the subject. I have received various deputations on this matter and 1 point out to the House that the honourable member has not been on any of them, nor has he sought to lead one. I say that as justification for my comment. I have informed members of the deputations that no decision will be taken about the use of concrete sleepers by Commonwealth Railways until the Bureau of Transport Economics reports to me on an economic evaluation it is making of the use of concrete sleepers vis-a-vis timber sleepers. No decision will be taken on the tenders that have been let until such time as that evaluation is available to me so that a proper judgment can be made on the subject. the Minister for Supply. Will the Minister confirm or deny the accuracy of reports that some of the American tracking stations are shortly to be closed? Supply deals with the United States space agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, on behalf of the Government. There are at present no approved programmes for the period between the end of America's ambitious Skylab project, which will be complete by the end of next year, and the first orbit of the space shuttle project, which will not be before 1978. NASA has advised that it has under consideration a number of changes brought about by its changed activity in space. It is in the process of amalgamating 2 specialist networks-that which supports manned satellites and that which supports unmanned earth satellites-and this, on a world-wide basis, will lead to a reduction in the number of tracking stations from, I believe, some 23 or 25 to about 15. The Honeysuckle Creek tracking station will be converted to a deep space station as part of the deep space network and this will lead eventually to the closing down of the Island Lagoon tracking station, which is a sort distance from Woomera. As regards Carnarvon-and these plans by NASA are tentative-it is expected that there will be a diminution of activity there after 1974. Up to that time it will be supporting the Sky Lab programme and will be taking information from the packages which have been left on the moon. It is an important*",24,Dairying Industry

I know that there has been a great deal of concern about this matter. As I have said, the position is that these are only tentative plans by NASA. I had to consider whether, in view of the fact that they are only tentative, this information ought to be disclosed. It was thought that such information as could be disclosed should be made available to the contractors and, of course, to their employees. So high level consultations and discussions are going on in respect of this matter. I will do my best to see that information, when it becomes more specific, is given to them. I would like to add that the recent announcement of a possible cooperative effort between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has not yet been taken into account in these discussions because, as yet, there is not sufficient information on it. ter a question. The right honourable gentleman doubtless has taken the opportunity, since my reminder at question time last Thursday, to follow up the instruction he gave Treasury officers after a question to him by the honourable member for Canning5 week earlier, to seek final census results from the Commonwealth Statistician.

I will find out from the Statistician through the Minister himself.

What is the position now? official advice along the lines suggested by the honourable gentleman but I have certainly seen a Press report indicating that such a study would be carried out by the College. The position in relation to childcare centres, which has been made clear in recent days by the Prime Minister, is that this has been the subject of detailed consultations in recent months by the Government with Commonwealth and State government departments and also with a diverse series of voluntary agencies involved in this field. That research having been completed, the matter is now before the Government, and a decision will be taken in due course. But I can assure the honourable gentleman that, so far as the research which is available to me from my Department is concerned, there is no evidence which points to the fact that children of prone than others to juvenile delinquency, psychological problems or any form of disturbance of the type that I recall the honourable gentleman suggested.

87,Mr Daly,"What sinister reason prevents the Government from allowing the Parliament to debate this important Bill? 1 suggest a few reasons for the delay. They are the reasons which have prompted me to move this motion. At about the time of the introduction of the Bill, fierce jungle warfare broke out in the Queensland State Parliament between members of the Liberal Party and members of the Country Party over the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries. It produced unprecedented scenes and events in the Queensland Parliament, even carrying to this chamber. The Minister for the Army( Mr Katter), speaking of certain Liberals who crossed the floor to vote against the Country Party's greatest gerrymander of all time, spoke in these terms: Traitors walked across the floor of Parliament land election results. in Queensland. member is a well experienced member of this House. He knows quite well Speaker. less noise in the chamber I would be able to be heard. The honourable member for Grayndler knows full well that a debate on a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders does not enable an honourable member to canvass other matters as the honourable member now is attempting to do. I was just making passing reference to the reason why the House is not being allowed to debate this Bill. At the time to which I was referring, desperate words were spoken by desperate Country Party members opposite who were prepared to use every known device to stop the democratic processes which would enable this legislation to be enacted. If the debate had proceeded in this Parliament at that time-thi s is another reason why we want it to proceed today-member s of the Opposition would have exposed to the Australian people, particularly those in Queensland, the pressure that the Country Party exerts on electoral reform in this and other parliaments. This is why we believe that my motion will be opposed. The Country Party has indicated that, at all costs, it will not support the Government's legislation. The results of the Queensland elections held last Saturday show that members of the Country Party have good reason for delaying this legislation. On Saturday last in Queensland the Country Party, which secured only 19 per cent of the total votes recorded, is now the premier party in that State. The combined Liberal and Country Parties gained 56,000 votes fewer than the Labor Party, yet the coalition is in government. That is one reason why today it is important for the Parliament to consider this legislation. We should be able to debate it and amend it in order to prevent gerrymandering and the prostitution of democracy by the Country Party and others who sit opposite. I believe they have a good reason for not wanting to debate it today, particularly in view of the QueensAnother factorI raise these points because they are important-coul d be the disunity that exists in regard to this legislation. People know that there is disunity in continental shelf, the wool industry, decentralisation and leadership. the honourable member for Grayndler discuss his reasons for moving for the suspension of Standing Orders. Speaker, to show that there must be some reason why my motion will be opposed and the debate not proceed. I ask: Is there electoral disunity on this question? It is a strange thing, but it is the Government's own legislation that we seek to have debated. The legislation had been investigated and was introduced to the Parliament by a Country Party Minister. It has remained on the notice paper for 14 months. Something must be wrong when this is the situation and that is why I seek to have the Bill debated. The Commonwealth Electoral Act needs reform more than any other Act in the nation. A Federal election is pending. In addition to the reforms incorporated in the Bill, some of which the Labor Party supports, the Labor Party seeks to review completely the Act to provide for other reforms. This cannot be done unless my motion is carried. In addition to some of the proposals in the Bill which are good the Labor Party would like to see incorporated in the Act before the next Federal elections provision to",29,Suspension Of Standing Orders

Further the Labor Party would like to see provision made in the Australian Capital Territory for an additional member of the House of Representatives and for senators. The Labor Party would like to see the designation of Party affiliation on ballot papers. Also the Labor Party would like to see written into the Act a complete negation of gerrymandering processes that are part and parcel of Country Party representation and policy in Australia. Mr Speaker, as a member of the Liberal Party, you know that in Queensland the Liberal leader should be the Premier. Country Party members have prevented that and they seek now to prevent debate on legislation in this House. I say that it should be debated. It is significant how silent members of the Country Party are on this issue. They will probably have a Liberal Party Minister defend their stance because they know that what I say is true. The Country Party might well consider changing its name to 'The Party for Gerrymanders'. Does the Government intend to deny the people the reforms necessary to bring the Commonwealth Electoral Act into line with modern-day thinking in all democratic countries? Because of the delay, the evasion and the complete failure of the Government to take this legislation beyond the second reading stage, one may well be entitled to say that the Government, and particularly the Country Party section of it, is opposed to reform of the Electoral Act, even by its own legislation. 1 move for the suspension of Standing Orders for the reasons I have mentioned. You, Mr Speaker, have curtailed my activities somewhat, but I think I have made my message clear. There can be no excuse for a delay of 14 months in debating proposals which were instigated prior to 1969 and which have remained on the notice paper for so long. The Opposition believes that this delay is another step in the Country Party's well-known policy of denying all the principles applying to democratic elections. The delay must be taken as an indication that it is intended, if at all poswill go into recess and will return for a sible, to gerrymander the Australian electorates to the advantage of the minority group-the Australian Country Party-and to prevent electoral reform and its effect on the democratic functions in Australia. The delay in presenting the Commonwealth Electoral Bill and the Senate Elections Bill and carrying them through to completion is scandalous and inexcusable. They should be debated and that is why I move for the suspension of Standing Orders. the motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) because it is an urgent necessity to suspend the Standing Orders to give effect to the sentiments expressed in his second reading speech by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Hunt) on 31st March 1971. I draw attention to the first paragraph of the Minister's speech when, by way of apology for the late introduction of the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, he said: During the last session of the previous Parliament, the then Minister informed the House that a review of the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Regulations thereunder had been in progress for some time, and that, although it was not possible to reach the point where amendments to the Act could be presented to the Parliament for consideration before the 1969 House of Representatives election, the Government's intention was that the review should be resumed immediately after the elections and taken to finality as soon as possible. I emphasise the words 'as soon as possible'. The Minister continued: This has been done and the amendments we propose are the subject of this Bill. While certain of the proposed amendments are formal or machinery in character and need little or no explanation, other provisions of the Bill seek to bring about much needed changes in the electoral laws I emphasise 'much needed changes in the electoral laws'and it is to these that I will devote most of my remarks. I support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders because the Labor Party agrees with the urgency conveyed by the Minister in his speech on 31st March 1971. We had reached the stage where the Minister said that a review had been commenced during the previous Parliament and he was bringing in this legislation halfway during the last Parliament. Shortly we short Budget session. This will be followed by the Fedftral elections later this year. If",30,Suspension Of Standing Orders
94,Mr Cross (Brisbane) (3.7),"I secondwe do not take the action which has been advocated by the honourable member for Grayndler in his motion, consideration of matters which the Government regarded as vital in March 1971, and which the Labor Party regarded as vital then and still does now, will probably not and almost certainly not be given by the Parliament until after the next elections. The question arises whether this matter is urgent. The Government proposes to extend absent voting facilities on an Australia wide basis so that an elector can vote outside the State or Territory for which he is enrolled. The Minister in his second reading speech explained that there were anomalies and that voters were unable to exercise the franchise as was their right. Apparently the Government considered that to be urgent in March 1971 but it is not given urgent consideration today. A further proposal of the Bill-the Labor Party will support this one-is to improve voting facilities for patients and inmates of hospitals, convalesopportunity to debate the matter of public cent homes and institutions, and to enable mobile booths to be established at convalescent homes and hospitals. In March 1971 the Government regarded this as urgent. The Minister in his second reading speech said that it was a matter of great importance that the law should be amended in this way. Therefore the Opposition is advocating the suspension of the Standing Orders today in order that effect might be given to the proposed amendments. The Bill also proposed to tidy up a number of other matters. They include the matter of people who lose their franchise when they are posted overseas; the removal of a person's name from the roll although he has not ceased to live permanently in the subdivision for which he is enrolled; the eligivery shortly. These things are, of course, bility of a member of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory to nominate for election as a senator or a member of the House of Reprsentatives; and electoral expenses, a matter on which the Labor Party has some very sound and profound views. For those reasons, for the reasons stated by the Minister in his second reading speech which was made a long time ago, in March 1971, and also because the Labor Party wishes to take an opportunity to move amendments to this Bill in line with Labor Party policy to reform the Commonwealth Electoral Act to make our franchise more democratic, to extend the franchise to 18-year-olds and to ensure that the electoral system is run as honestly and efficiently as it may be run, I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Grayndler for the suspension of Standing Orders. for National Development) (3.12)-It is rather strange for this matter to be raised now because I understand the Opposition has indicated to you, Mr Speaker, that it has for discussion a matter of public importance to be introduced by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones). We are now in a curious position because we take it that that matter is not so urgent after all seeing that the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has taken precedence and has proceeded with an obvious move to delay the business of the House, firstly, in having an importance, which we now understand cannot be so urgent after all, and I suspect therefore that the Opposition would not wish to proceed with that matter, and secondly, because the honourable member for Grayndler knows full well that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Hunt), who handles these matters and who introduced these Bills, is this week in Western Australia and in the Northern Territory attending government conferences. The honourable member knows also that this motion is designed only to try to interfere with a debate on the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill which we expect will be received from the Senate well known and this motion is obviously too blatant an attempt by the Opposition to firstly, delay the business of the House and, secondly, to try to take control of the business of the House which has been laid down by the Government. In these circumstances and in view of the arguments that have been put by the 2 Opposition members who spoke to the motion-thos e arguments were almost facetious in their intent, the comments in most cases being completely irrelevant and dealing with matters other than those relating to the Electoral Bill-thi s also is an obvious indication of",31,Suspension Of Standing Orders

The Minister said that the remarks of my colleague and myself were facetious, but I do not take a point of order on that. My point is that the Minister said we did not speak to the the Bill. You, Mr Speaker, should take action on that. 1 take his remarks as a reflection on you because I know full well that you keep all speakers within the provisions of Standing Orders. Therefore I would like you, Mr Speaker, to reprove the Minister for the remarks he made which, although they did not reflect so much on me, reflect on you. the Minister's remarks are in order. for Grayndler is t particularly sensitive today but he has not denied the fact that, as I said, a lot of the points that he and the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr is a motion before the Chair that the quesCross) raised were not related to the Bills tion be now put. before the House but to other matters which concern a certain State. Having said that, and in view of the fact that the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is designed only to waste the time of the House, we reject it.

Recently in this House the Minister took strong objection when something was said about newspaper reports in which his name was involved. Is he making a personal explanation? He has a lot of explaining to do if he is. remind the honourable member for Sturt that the Minister for Housing is explaining the basis upon which he made his statement in answering a question on housing. At this point, as far as I can recall from what I have been able to hear above the interjections, the Minister has only quoted tbe source of his information.

I call the honourable member for Prospect. Minister in developing his case, which as you have just mentioned he is entitled to do, referred to an alleged statement on the ABC news at 7.45 a.m. on 30th April. May I point out to you that when he handed the question to the honourable member for Wentworth that honourable member got it mixed up and asked a question about an alleged statement in yesterday's news broadcast. order arises. Dr S. F. Cairns-Furthe r to the point of order, I listened to the Minister at question time and I have listened to him now. I submit that he is saying nothing that he has not already said at question time. Therefore he is out of order. The honourable member for Reid has made a certain statement. The Minister is adding nothing to what he said before. He cannot be making a personal explanation because he is saying exactly the same things he said at question time. the point of order raised by the honourable member for Lalor, I point out that the honourable member for Reid made a personal explanation in which he said that a statement made by the Minister for Housing was incorrect. The Chair is not competent to decide whether that statement was incorrect. When the Minister for Housing made a personal explanation he stated the source of his information. Even though the Minister may have stated certain things in answer to a question, as long as he does not develop his personal explanation into a debate or go beyond the substance of the personal explanation, he is entitled to say where he obtained the foundation for his remarks. Whether that is correct is not within the competence of the Chair to decide. 76 refers to imputations of improper motives. I never intended to nor did I in fact impute improper motives. My intention was in fact to expose the motives. persona] explanation, 1 point out that the Minister for Housing( Mr Kevin Cairns) misrepresented me when he said that I made these utterances in a speech at Sydney University.

I present papers or address gatherings at universities my speeches are prepared and they are distributed to the Press before I deliver them. I will therefore go up to my office, with your permission, get the document and table it. The Minister says the speech was made on 29th April?

That is in accordance with the understanding which I made with the honourable member for Stirling. to take these amendments as the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Lynch) has suggested. There are 2 amendments made by the Senate on which we ever, at the moment the Committee is dealing with the other amendments, and I want to pass some comments on them although we do not intend to vote against them. I will explain the reasons. Let us take clause 12, for example, which is amendment No. 3. Of course, the Labor Party opposed the clause in this place as it proposed giving commissioners an increase in salary to $16,250. It was opposed also in the Senate, and the result is that the salaries of the commissioners remain as they are at present, and the Government has now accepted that situation. Even some Government Senators voted against increasing the salaries of the commisdown the salaries of others. Of course, the Government has got its desserts. The commissioners are already in receipt to give them an increase of $4,450 per spective to 4th November 1971. These are by $4.70 only a few weeks ago and gave tradesmen a miserable increase of $2 a",37,Organizations

146,Mr Webb (Stirling) (3.46),"We agreedI point out to honourable members, as I have done before, that if the workers want their wrongs righted, they must produce witnesses, must call evidence, and must prove conclusively that their claim is justified. Even then the Commission can refuse to grant those just claims if to do so would not be in the public interest, in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the public interest. Employers, on the other hand, can raise prices at their own whim and fancy. They do this in the secrecy of the board room without any thought for the public interest or without calling witnesses to give evidence. The Minister for Labour and National Service lay the blame for increased prices on the workers and on their demands for increased wages to meet increased costs of living. Yet they will do nothing about prices. 'Public interest' has been expanded in this amending Bill to take into account the state of the economy. I ask the Government: Did it take into account the state of the economy when Broken Hill Pty Company Ltd recently increased steel prices by 5 i per cent and in some instances, particularly in regard to building materials, caused price rises of between 9 per cent and 10 per cent? No charge is ever made by the Government that such companies are taking too much of the national income, thereby endangering the economy and causing living costs to rise. Is it any wonder that the workers take direct action and threaten to withdraw from arbitration and to rely on negotiation to have their wrongs righted? The Government is even trying to interfere at the present stage in the waterside workers case. The worker has never been in a worse position financially than he is in today. At one time the worker's wage was adequate to meet the ordinary financial needs of the home. Today no worker and his family can live on the base wage. Consequently, he has to have 2 jobs or work overtime or his wife must work in order to make ends meet. That is the situation in which families find themselves these days. The Government supports an increase of $4,250 a year, or about $84 a week, retrospective to November 1971 for certain statutory office holders while at the same time it adds sections to the Act to lessen the workers' chances of getting increases which may be approved by the employers. I instance again the intervention that is presently taking place in the watersiders' case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Government wants to stop employers and employees reaching amicable agreements on wage claims. The Opposition opposes strongly any suggestion of a wage freeze. It believes in the 2 main principles of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which are to promote goodwill in industry and to encourage conciliation with a view to amicable agreement, thereby preventing and settling industrial disputes. Unfortunately, this Government seems to have lost track of those principles. The amendments since the Act was initiated in 1904, whether they were entirely satisfactory or not, had a set purpose-to try to improve those principles. But this Government seems to have got away from that. This amending Bill works in the other direction. It is purely political. No attempt is made to improve the Act in line with the thinking of the trade union movement and the more advanced employers. In fact, its aim is to create dissension in the community for political purposes. Before the Minister for Labour and National Service brought down the December 1971 statement of intent, meetings had taken place between the employers and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to investigate ways in which the Act might work more smoothly. A lot of progress was made in 1971 and a satisfactory stage of agreement had been reached between the parties. It was at this stage that the Minister stepped in and refused to accept the understanding that had been arrived at. What had been achieved by the unions and the employers was sabotaged by this Government. All that the Minister would do, following on earlier successful meetings, was to hear views, but he would not enter into worthwhile discussions. After hearing the views he said he would consider them. The next move was the statement of intent. The attitude of the unions was not even considered when that took place. Then this Bill was introduced. The other clause on which I wish to comment briefly is clause 41. I draw attention to the fact that this deals with the exercise of the court's jurisdiction.

It was moved to improve the workings of the Act as far as we could see it. A further amendment proposed by the Senate was accepted by the Australian Labor Party Opposition in the Senate, and consequently the amendment to which I have referred was withdrawn. The Opposition does not oppose the amendment as it now appears. I will leave it at that. I have expressed my views on these matters. The Opposition does not intend to call a vote on the matter.

The and National Service( Mr Lynch) has Minister, somewhat reluctantly, was dancreferred. I draw attention to the fact that ing to the tune of the DLP. My accusation when this Bill was before the House and can be proved. Honourable members will the matter was being debated clause 2 recall his statement of intent of December read: 2 -(1. ) The following provisions of this Act of intent he said: shall come into operation on the day on which this Act receives the Royal AssentThen it numbered all the clauses, including the clauses which are now in dispute. When this matter was before the Senate the following sub-clauses were proposed to be inserted: (2.) Sections 41, 49 and 53 of this Act shall come into operation on such respective dates as are fixed by Proclamation. (2A.) Sections 51 and 68 of this Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on the twenty-sixth day of May, One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two. The amendment from the Senate backdates the operation of 2 vital sections of this Act to 26th May 1972. That is why we are opposing it. Let me explain the reasons why. These are the sections dealing with amalgamation of organisations. It will be remembered that when the debate was taking place here in Committee I raised the question under clause 68 as to whether it affected the amalgamation of the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society, the Sheet Metalworkers Union and the Amalgamated Engineering Union which was in process at the time. These unions had been working on this amalgamation for a period of about 3i years and had almost completed the necessary procedures. The House will remember that the Minister was very reluctant to answer the question I put to him. He said that section 68 was a mere tidying up. It was clear that the Minister was hiding something-in my opinion anyhow and, I think, in the opinion of some other members of the House-and that the aim was to prevent if possible the amalgamation taking place. Finally, after unions could be disadvantaged depending tion of deregistration of some of the unions which was before it at that time. So the Government was in a very awkward situation as far as the amalgamation of these unions was concerned. It is clear 1971. At paragraph 95 of that statement We will amend the Act to prevent unions from enforcing compulsory unionism. This did not stop the Democratic Labor Party, because most of its support in the industrial movement comes from the Federated Clerks Union, which would be a difficult union to organise without compulsory unionsim. I am not casting any reflection on that union. It has every right to try to keep compulsory unionism and we are pleased that it has been successful. From then on the Minister forgot all about the matter and let it drop. So his intention to abolish compulsory unionsim disappeared entirely. However, something that was not mentioned in his statement of intent was included in this Bill. That was a proviso to make amalgamation of the unions more difficult. His speech at the Central Industrial Secretariat dinner on 2nd March showed his earlier attitude towards amalgamation. This was a dinner connected",40,Organizations
148,Mr Lynch (Flinders,Minister for,41,Organizations
149,Mr Webb (Stirling) (3.55),"The Oppothat the Government, under pressure fromwith the formal opening of the Central Industrial Secretariat for the purpose of amalgamating 2 employer bodies-the Employers Federation and the Chamber of Manufactures-to co-ordinate their industrial relations policies. At that dinner the Minister said: Basically, the philosophy of the current and previous Governments in relation to organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is that they are voluntary organisations and the Government should not interfere in their affairs unless it can be demonstrated that there are or are likely, to be dishonest practices which would prejudice the rights of members or groups of members. He also ridiculed the idea that 50 per cent plus of the total membership should vote. He pointed out to this body that the reasons which prompted them to form their body were no doubt those that motivated the metal trades unions to amalgamate. He pointed out tbe advantages of amalgamation. In fact, his whole speech showed that he supported the amalgamation of smaller unions into bigger unions. Then at the behest of the DLP he brought in these amendments designed to make amalgamation much harder. However, the progress of the metal trades unions was too great and despite the efforts of the DLP their amalgamation has become an accomplished fact. However, the backdating of the commencement of this proposed new section to 26th May means that other unions which have made considerable progress towards amalgamation will have to start all over again. I do not know the names of all the unions which are in the process of arranging amalgamation, but there are several. They include the Iron workers and Chemical Workers Union and the Theatre Managers Association is another. Also, the Bacon Employees Union in Queensland is seeking amalgamation with the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union; I know that negotiations in this case have been going on for about 2 years. The amalgamation of the metal trades unions as the Minister well knows took about 3 years to complete. There are several other unions which under this legislation will have to start their negotiations all over again. I would like to quote from an article entitled: 'Union Law Backdated'. It reads: The Ironworers' national secretary ( Mr Short) yesterday condemned the retrospectivity issue and sent a telegram asking the Federal Government to defer the proposed legislation. Late tonight the Senate was still debating additional clauses of the Bill. . . . This shows that the union was opposed to this measure because it interfered with the steps it had already taken. If tbe Bill had been returned in the form in which it left this chamber-that is, to come into effect on a date to be proclaimed-union s would have been able to commence and complete the amalgamation proceedings. If the proclamation had been held up for a period they would not have been disadvantaged. These amendments seem to be aimed at the amalgamation of the iron workers, chemical workers and the others I have mentioned. Why should this control be restricted to the unions? If this is to be the new way of life why does it not apply to employer bodies and companies which amalgamate? The Government should be making amalgamation easier instead of more difficult. The Minister, if he were free to do so, would admit this. For example, amalgamation could prevent all of the demarcation disputes that occur. Mr Morgan of the Metal Trades Employers Federation saw the wisdom of this. He supported the unions being free to amalgamate. Instead this Government is placing obstacles in the way of amalgamation. How different it is when commercial interests are concerned. It has taken the Government over 10 years to do something about the Trade Practices Act which is not yet law. The Bill has not even been introduced despite many promises. But when it comes to interfering with the unions legislation becomes a matter of extreme emergency. This Government will go down in history as being biased towards trade unions and not interested in industrial relations except to stir up strife for political purposes. So much for that part of the legislation. There is just one other point to which I would like to refer. We oppose the amendment to clause 51 to which the Minister has referred. I refer here to amendment No. 7 in the schedule of amendments made by the Senate. I do not want to go into the details of it. What we wanted in our amendment, which I do not have time to quote, was that in circumstances when a union which had membership of less than 5 per cent of the membership of the host union was being absorbed, the host union would not be required to have a ballot. This was a reasonable provision particularly if we look at paragraph (a) of our amendment which states: . . . which special circumstances the Industrial Registrar could refuse the exemption. The Government's amendment now before the House was obviously moved by the DLP with the connivance of the Attorney General (Senator Greenwood) who no doubt assisted with its drafting. It is indefinite and leaves ground for a lot of litigation. Our amendment was a definite proposition, was reasonably clear and in fact left it to the Industrial Registrar, to decide whether he did not want to grant the amalgamation, even though the question that was at issue was only whether the union seeking amalgamation had a membership equal to only 5 per cent of the host union's, the host union did not have to take a ballot. 1 think that was a reasonable amendment. I regret that the Government did not see its way clear to do something about it. The Opposition intends to vote against this amendment as well as the other one which I have mentioned. rise to support my colleague the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb). I join him in opposing as strongly as I possibly can amendments Nos1 and 7 sent back to us from the Senate. To refresh the mind of honourable members. I point out that amendment No. 1-and it is not explained why this is the case-seek s to vary the date of operation of the Bill. I refer to clause 2 (2.) to which this amendment applies. This clause deals with proposed new sections 41, 49, 51, 53 and 68. The Bill states that the legislation will come into operation on the day on which this Bill receives Royal Assent. In fact, the amendment which was moved and carried in the Senate makes the date of operation, as I understand it, Friday of last week. Surely this action poses the question why it was necessary to back-date the legislation and why the original provisions of the Bill were not agreed to. The Government must have thought when the Bill was drafted that it would come into operation from the date of Royal Assent. In the short time in which I have been in this House this seems to have been in line with the common terminology of Bills. Yet, in this legislation an amendment has been moved by the Government in the Senate and agreed to after opposition from the Australian Labor Party in that place. This amendment would make the date of operation a day before the Bill even received Royal Assent or the concurrence of members of this Parliament. When one reads the clauses that axe to be affected by the date being set back I think the position starts to become a bit clearer. Clause 51, which is the clause on which I placed some emphasis before, is one of the clauses which will be affected by the back-dating of this Bill. We should bear in mind the fact that only on Tuesday of this week, I believe, Dr Sharp, the Industrial Registrar, finally came to execute all of the instruments necessary for the amalgamation of the metal trades unions. There were still some arguments going on in the metal trades unions, particularly in regard to the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society, on Friday of last week in regard to several pipelines which are to be laid in Port Phillip Bay. Does the Government or the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Lynch) intend that this new provision in the Bill should now be used to upset that amalgamation that has taken something in excess of 12 months-ver y nearly 2 years-to go through the procedures? Is the Government with one stroke of its pen going to place all of these negotiations and agreements and everything that has been done in jeopardy and require the union to go right back to square one and start again? I well remember the honourable member for Stirling, when this Bill was last in this place, asking the Minister at a very early hour in the morning whether this Bill in any way would affect the amalgamation of the 3 metal trades unions. The Minister could not answer because his adviser was not present. Only when finally pressed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) did the Minister say that there was no guarantee that the effects of this Bill would not be made applicable to these unions that had come within one inch, after having run a distance of many miles, of consummating their amalgamation. It is very obvious that the amendments are aimed at the amalgamation or nonamalgamations of unions and nothing else.",41,Organizations
150,Mr Keith Johnson (Burke) (4.7),"IAmendment No. 1 and amendment No. 7 are the critical amendments that deal with amalgamation. I think that members of mj own Party in this place canvassed the question of amalgamtion very well when the Bill was originally in this chamber. We made it quite clear that in our view this Bill ought to be retitled as a Bill for an Act to prevent amalgamations. Just before he resumed his seat, the honourable member for Stirling mentioned that the Minister for Labour and National Service had spoken about the need for amalgamation and, in fact, had lauded employer organisations which, for a variety of reasons, had chosen to amalgamate. The Minister has made it clear publicly that he believes there are too many unions and that there should be an amalgamation of unions, yet he has been instrumental in introducing this type of legislation which makes the amalgamation of unions virtually impossible. I wonder whether this Government, which is placing all these impediments upon the amalgamation of trade unions, which it seems to regard as different from every other organisation in the country, would be prepared to introduce into this House as an amendment to the Companies Act, the Trade Practices Act or any other Act, guidelines, rules and regulations to resolve cent and then we will not need a ballot'. the amalgamation of organisations such as Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, in respect of which we recently experienced a fiasco. Is there any need for organisations of this ilk to be bound by the very restricin this place and it has not been improved tive processes that will be established by this Bill in respect of organisations of working class people who come together to further their aims? Perhaps in the Government's view-onc e again, my friend the honourable member for Stirling mentioned this-trad e unions' standing in the community is different from that of other organisations. Is this Government really an anti-union government? Does it oppose the amalgamation and establishment of organisations that are formed primarily to support the interests of that section of the community which is not in the best position to protect itself? Or does this Government come down on the side of the very wealthy and powerful organisations and leave them to their own devices when it comes to a question of amalgamation? It is well known that the provisions contained in the amendment were asked for by the Federal Secretary of the Federated Iron workers Association of Australia, Mr Laurie Short, who, of course, was ably assisted by the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, whose general president Mr Maynes was seen skulking around the corridors of Parliament House only last week. He was conferring with his mouthpieces in the Senate. The amendment which has been produced is a direct result of the pressure which was applied by a minority political party in this Parliament, supported by a minority group in the community. As I see it, this leads to a cynical arithmetical exercise by any union which wishes to amalgamate with another union. The amendment provides that if the membership of the host union is not increased by more than 5 per cent in an amalgamation, the union can make an application to be exempted from a ballot. This amendment does not set out conditions that would preclude an unscrupulous act by somebody or any act which would be legitimate within the wide application of the amendment. A large union could say to a smaller organisation: 'We will dispense with enough of your membership to leave you with only the required 5 per Dangers of that sort are inherent in this situation. This amendment initially, is bad. We said that it was bad when it was proposed by the Democratic Labor Party, whose masters in the community insisted that certain amendments be carried. The provision has been worsened and, like my colleagues in the Labor Party, I intend to vote against it. Divisions will be called on these matters and we will vote solidly against them. We trust that enough wisdom will prevail on the Government side of the House for Government supporters to listen to the reason of the arguments that have been put forward and that they will join with us and have this iniquitous legislation thrown out. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN-(Mr Corbett)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Dr GUN (Kingston) (4.15)-It seems to me that amendment No. 7 which has been proposed by the Government is completely hypocritical. My disquiet is not in any way alleviated by the fact that, when this amendment was moved by the Democratic Labor Party in the Senate, no explanation was given by the Minister in charge of the Bill in that chamber. I hope that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Lynch) will give some explanation now as to why the amendment originally moved by the DLP in the Senate was so worded. 1 invite the House to examine the amendment that was proposed in the Senate by the Australian Labor Party. This amendment provided that paragraph (b) should read: the total number of members of the de-registering taken this action on this occasion. organisation or organisations is not more than five per centum of the number of members of the first-mentioned organisation. The amendment moved in the Senate by the DLP and supported by the Government purports to assist the amalgamation of unions or the absorption of little unions by big unions. I strongly suspect that the amendment moved in the Senate by the DLP, with the connivance of the Government, was brought about with the connivance also of the draftsmen of the Department or, perhaps, the Parliamentary Draftsman. The draftsmen certainly appear to have helped the Government to overcome certain problems in this regard. The Government's amendment states that (b) should now read: the total number of members that have been or could be admitted to the organisation upon and by any reason of the amalgamation. . . . It appears to me that the insertion of the words 'and could be' is quite critical. The Government would like to have us believe that the amendment will enable small unions, after a plebiscite, to be absorbed into bigger unions. A plebiscite would not need to be conducted in the larger union. However, the phrase 'and could be' which was introduced by the DLP with the connivance of the Government in actual fact will frustrate the supposed purpose of the amendment. No explanation was given by the Government in the Senate and I think that the House is entitled to some explanation now. In conclusion, I support completely the remarks of previous speakers from this side of the House. This is a very sorry attempt on the part of the DLP to try to block union amalgamations all along the line. The DLP is completely opposed to such amalgamations because it knows that union amalgamation is in the interests of industrial peace and of the advancement generally of the cause of trade unionists and workers. This is a sorry tale of betrayal of the working people by the DLP and, from speeches which he has made in the past supporting the cause of amalgamation, I think that the Minister for Labour and National Service knows this very well. I am saddened to see that once again the Government has connived with the DLP to defeat yet another amalgamation. I hope that the Minister will give some explanation to the House as to why the Government has Minister assisting the Minister for Labour and National Service) (4.18)-The basic philosophy behind the amendments that have been moved is a simple one. The Government believes it is important that new Part VIHA of the Act which deals with amalgamations of organisations should begin to operate as soon as possible. Honourable members opposite appear to believe that the amendments now being considered are aimed at inhibiting or preventing union amalgamation. I would like to make it quite clear to the Committee that these provisions are designed specifically to ensure that the control of organisations remains with the rank and file members of those organisations. Part VIIIA constitutes a new code as to what is required of organisations seeking to amalgamate and it is clear and specific in its detail. For the first time, it presents to organisations a set of provisions dealing specifically with amalgamation and, therefore, the Government believes that it should operate as soon as possible. The old provisions should not be continued, save for a limited time during an interim period. I would like to make clear to the honourable member for Burke( Mr Keith Johnson) that the amendment is not designed to interfere with the projected amalgamation of the various metal trade unions. If the honourable member reads clause 68 of the Bill carefully, he will find that that is made abundantly clear. That clause provides that the new Part dealing with the amalgamation of organisations is not to apply in relation to an amalgam as to which,",43,Organizations
151,Mr Street (Corangamite,"Assistantbefore the commencement of clause 68, certain applications had been made to the registrar and a valid request for deregistration had been lodged with him under the principal Act. As to the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and the applications for deregistration by the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society and by the Sheet Metal Workers Union, the Registrar signed the instruments of deregistration on 30th May, and deregistration will operate 3 months from then, that is on 30th August 1972. The objections to the deregistration were withdrawn when the Registrar had the matter before him on 29th May. Turning now to amendment No. 7, to which I think the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) specifically referred, this amendment is an amalgam of the amendments brought into the Senate not only by the Australian Democratic Labor Party but also by the Opposition and accepted by the Government. It proposes that a new subsection be added to section 158K which forms part of the new Part VTIIA which deals with amalgamations. The purpose of this amendment is to allow some flexibility as to the holding of ballots in connection with amalgamations, where a small body is to amalgamate with a large one. Part of the amalgamation processes provided for by the Bill requires all organisations involved Cairns, Kevin in the proposed amalgamation to hold a ballot of their members, but the amendment recognises that it would be unsatisfactory, for example, if where a relatively small organisation was proposing to amalgamate with a large one, the latter should be required to have a ballot of its members. Therefore, the amendment provides that where an organisation proposes to deregister and, by amalgamation agreement, have its members absorbed into an existing organisation, which would be the host body in an amalgamation, there need not be a ballot of the members in the host organisation if the total number of members in the deregistering organisation or organisations complies with the formula set out in the amendment. Under the amendment the host body would be required to seek from the Registrar an exemption from the ballot provisions, and the Registrar would be given a discretion not to grant an exemption if he considered there were special circumstances which could cause him not to grant it. There would, however, be certain limitations, as set out in the amendment, on the circumstances in which an exemption could be granted. That is a brief explanation of why the Government has proposed these 2 amendments. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Corbett)I call the honourable member for Swan.

153,.. .. 6 Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Ministe rmarketing. Other honourable members have expressed similar views. Speaking on behalf of members of the Labor Party, I can say we agree with them. We have made that quite clear. But the principal objectives of asking that the Parliament be recalled before 30th June 1972 are, firstly, to consider the Randall wool report, which clair) today informed the House has been received by the Government, and, secondly, to enable effective action to be taken to rectify the current uncertainty on wool marketing. I move this amendment because, as honourable members well know, on 7th October last year the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Bill was introduced into the Parliament by the Minister for Primary Industry. The long title of that Bill read: An Act to provide for Payments on behalf of tbe Commonwealth for the purpose of ensuring a Minimum Standard of Financial Returns to Producers of certain Australian Wool sold or otherof urgency. We will test those honourable wise dealt with on or after the second day of July, One thousand nine hundred and seventyone, and before the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two. In other words that Act officially concludes on 30th June next, and wool deficiency payments will not be made after that date. There has been no indication from this Government on whether wool deficiency payments will continue to be made after 30th June or whether amendments will be made to the Act before that time. This Act authorises the appropriation of money to make wool deficiency payments to ensure an average return at a certain level as specified in the Act within the prescribed period. The prescribed period is clearly defined in the Act as the period ending on 30th June 1972. Can any member of the Country Party or the Liberal Party tell me what will happen after 30th June 1972? What do they say to that question which every wool grower they meet asks them? The honourable member for Hume( Mr ernment is incapable of giving competent Pettitt) and the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Nixon) are trying to interrupt my speech with interjections. The honourable member for Hume will get his chance to vote and we will see how good he is. We all know how he will vote, just as he talks outside this Parliament. We know how the Minister for Shipping and Transport will vote. He will vote in the same way as he always does. The point I make is that the provisions of the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act 1971 cease to operate after 30th June this year. This House will shortly commence the winter recess. No amendment has been made to this Act, no amendment has been foreshadowed and no decision has been taken in regard to any new legislation to enable these payments to continue to be made after 30th June. The 30th June is an important date because the new wool selling season commences on 1st July. It is important that the whole scheme of wool marketing be clarified. Before this Parliament rises we should at least be in a position to know what will happen after 30th June. We have heard in recent weeks, both inside and outside this Parliament, a number of statements made by members of the Country Party about the need for an acquisition scheme, the need for a drastic reform with respect to wool marketing and the need to treat these things as a matter members in this House on their statements r just as the Opposition tested 3 key Liberals on the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill. We all know what they did. We will see the same thing happen in regard to this matter. Members of the Liberal Party and of the Country Party make big brave statements outside this Parliament but it is a different thing when it comes to saying them in this Parliament and showing how fair dinkum they are and whether they are prepared to back up their statements. After the Government has had a week or so to consider the Randall report the Parliament will debate it and the conclusions in it, and the Government will introduce an amendment to this Act to enable deficiency payments to be made for a further prescribed period or introduce new legislation with respect to a wool acquisition scheme or tbe marketing of wool. The Parliament knows full well that this Govleadership. A prime example of this is the Government's stalling in this place month after month with the excuse that it is waiting for tbe Randall report. The Randall report has now reached the Government. We do not say that next week a decision should be taken on that report, but what we do say is that because this Act expires on 30th June 1972 a positive decision has to be taken. If the decision involves",47,Special Adjournment
154,The Minister For Primary Industry ( Mr Sin,"money-obviousl y it must-som e explanation should be given to the Parliament on whether an amendment will be made to the Act or new legislation will be introduced. What will the Government do? Will it introduce some airy-fairy scheme which it will announce in the Budget Speech? The provisions of this Act will not apply from 1st July 1972. Until this Parliament resumes in August where will the wool growers stand? Every wool grower in Australia is asking the same question: 'What will the Government do?'. The honourable member for Moore( Mr Maisey) has asked time and again: 'What will the Government do?' In the television series 'This Day Tonight' the honourable member referred to the Randall report as a subterfuge. Lucock)-Order! I appreciate that the honourable member has to give the reasons for moving the amendment which seeks to resume the sittings of the Parliament on a date prior to that suggested in the motion moved by the Leader of the House. I have allowed the honourable member to mention certain points which need to be mentioned to make the amendment relevant, but I ask the honourable member not to debate, for example, the reasons behind the Randall report, otherwise this could develop into a debate on the substance of the wool industry. Dr PATTERSONI thank you, Mr House goes into recess, but no matter Deputy Speaker. The reasons why we on this side of the House believe that the Parliament should resume before 30th June are obvious. The whole wool industry wants to know what the Government intends to do. What action will the Government take? This action can be voiced only by an Act of Parliament such as the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act. As I have said, the Randall report is now before the Government. We can only assume that this is the final report because we thought it had beenfinalisedsome weeks ago. We have had no statement from the Government on how long the Government is to consider the report. All that is needed is some indication that a statement will be made prior to the next wool selling season which commences on 1st July. This is not good enough. This is the Parliament of the Commonwealth in which members represent electorates throughout Australia, including wool growing electorates. It is completely unsatisfactory for this Parliament to rise today without an effective decision being taken by this Government in regard to the important matter of wool marketing especially when we know that by an Act of Parliament the wool deficiency payments scheme will conclude on 30th June. For that reason it is of paramount importance that this Parliament be recalled at some time prior to 30th June to consider this most important question and if necessary, if the Government holds this opinion, to consider introducing legislation to do one of 2 things, either to completely nullify the wool deficiency payments scheme or to extend the period for payintroducing new legislation with respect to wool marketing in Australia. It is for those reasons that I have moved the amendment which seeks to have the House recalled at some date to be fixed prior to 30th June. Lucock)-I s the amendment seconded? the amendment. This afternoon the Opposition has made an attempt to discuss the Commonwealth Electoral. Act and the 75 other items on the notice paper before the requires debate orfinalisationbefore this House goes into recess more than does the marketing of the wool clip. However, as the Government has decided that the House will go into recess today, it is important that the House should reassemble before 30th June, for the reasons given this afternoon by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson). I remind members that in his report for 1971 the Chairman of the Australian Wool Board made a most important statement. I use it to illustrate the importance of the wool industry to Australia as well as the seriousness of the situation that is confronting the industry. In that report he said: This year was perhaps the most difficult experienced by the industry. Gross value of wool production slumped SI88m to 8547m-the lowest in money terms since 1949-50. Over wide areas this income fall has been disastrous for thousands of farm families and others in the rural community dependent upon them.",48,Special Adjournment

157,Mr Kirwan (Forrest) (4.51),"I secondMany are still suffering the consequences of this decline. Even though the situation has improved on last year, it still is serious and it is causing concern to people in rural electorates. The report continued: As income has fallen, farm debts have arisen alarmingly. Many of the industry's biggest debtors for Primary Industry( Mr Sinclair) are its otherwise efficient producers. That is known to be true by any member representing a rural electorate. While the honourable member for Dawson was addressing the House, Government members were interjecting: 'Where are the wool growers?' In reply one might well ask them: 'How will the wool growers vote on this particular issue? How concerned are they about their fellows on the farms and about the situation in the rural industries because of the inactivity of this Government over a long period?' It is all very well for Government members to say that the situation has improved. It has, but in spite of the Government not because of action taken by it. The Government now has an opportunity to show the level of its concern for electors in rural industries. It is of immense importance that this Parliament should reassemble to debate the Randall report, and that this report be tabled in this Parliament for distribution. As the member for Dawson said, we need to come back here to learn what the Government will do about the support scheme during the coming 12 months. Thousands of wool growers and their families and rural communities throughout Australia are in desperate need, but their needs can be met only as a result of Government decision and action. In the present circumstances it should be decision and action taken after regard has been had to the Randall report. Surely such decision and action ought to have been taken long ago. As I said in a speech I made in this House last week, in 1964 responsible individuals were advocating that total acquisition of the wool clip would be the answer to the industry's problems and that effect should be given to certain recommendations of the Australian Wool Industry Council. The present position has not come upon the Government unexpectedly. As I said in my earlier speech, it should have been prepared for it. It should have prepared legislation for submission to this Parliament before it went into recess, but now that the Government has decided that the House shall go into recess, surely it should ensure that the House will reassemble in order to debate the business that we have been advocating this afternoon. One Government member, who is a member of the political Party to which the Minister belongs-the Minister responsible for this matter-sai d last week that the Government had resorted to a subterfuge in this regard. for Moore( Mr Maisey). -Order! I point out to the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Kirwin), as I pointed out to the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson), that the subject matter before the House is the sittings of the House. I have allowed certain references to be made because I felt that it was fair to allow the mover and seconder of the motion to illustrate briefly the reasons for the amendment. However, I suggest to the honourable member for Forrest, as I suggested to the honourable member for Dawson, that we should not develop the argument into a debate on the subject matter of wool acquisition. remind the House that the honourable member for Moore has said that the Government has resorted to subterfuge. Here is an opportunity for the honourable member for Moore) -Order! I ask the honourable member for Forrest not to continue along the lines of debating the wool industry. an opportunity for the honourable member for Moore to avoid resorting to subterfuge. By voting for the amendment he has an opportunity to stand on the side of the people whom he represents in this place. Indeed, so can the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hallett). As both those honourable members well know, grave concern is felt throughout the rural electorates of this country, no less in Western Australia than in any other State of the Commonwealth. Because of the lack of security felt in the industry because people do not know what the Government intends to do",49,Speaker Mr Ments The Government Could Also Consider

Here is-t the end of this month or the end of next month in relation to the support scheme or in relation to wool marketing, it is essential that they should know what is to be done. All we get from the Government are statements. We do not want statements. What we want is legislation passed through this House. But first we want a debate on the Randall report before any decision is made and any legislation is passed through here. SoI support wholeheartedly the amendment that has been so ably moved this afternoon by the honourable member for Dawson. I commend it to the House and I commend in particular that the House reassemble before 30th June in order to debate the Randall report and the state of the wool industry, and in order that appropriate legislation be passed through this House. port the amendment. for Primary Industry) (4.58)-Ove r the not want them to develop the debate on past few weeks honourable members have the amendment into a debate on the wool become accustomed to hear motions being industry and the Randall report.

To it the Opposition has moved an amendment relating to the time for the resumption of the House and the purpose of that resumption. I have suggested, and I repeat my suggestion, that there must be some motivation behind the Opposition's action. If there is no such motivation, again the Opposition is revealed as having neither understanding of rural policy nor sound motives for wishing to pursue its course of action. Mr BryantI raise another point of order. The matter before the Chair is whether or not the motion should be amended. That has nothing to do with rural policy. The amendment was moved succinctly. ourable member for Wills, as I did to the honourable member for Dawson and the members were allowed to mention those 2 a motion that relates to the time when we would normally resume.

As I understand the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson, it suggests that a further opportunity should be given to this Parliament to discuss the Government's attitude to that report. I sugsoon as possible. It has been dependent gest that there is no reason for this House to meet at a time when it normally would not meet to discuss our attitude to the AWIC report. I believe at the same time that it is essential Dr PattersonI take a point of order. At no stage did I mention the AWIC report. I mentioned the Randall report. I accept the difficulty of the Minister for Primary Industry. NormallyI would have given him notice that I was to move this amendment, but he took me by surprise this afternoon. The blue paper setting out the programme for today listed a matter of public importance. It was only by mere luck that I happened to be here when other business was given precedence over this matter. I can understand the Minister's raised in this Parliament and for subseproblem, but it is not the AWIC report with which we are concerned; it is the Randall report and the fact that the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act concludes on 30th June. They are the only 2 reasons for my amendment. On 30th June the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act concludes. What are we going to tell the wool growers after that date? Lucock)I think the point of order raised by the honourable member for Dawson is fairly reasonable. As far as I am aware, the honourable member for Dawson did not mention the report he was concerned with. tioned the AWIC reportI appreciate the explanation given by the honourable member for Dawson-is that the Randall report is a document relating to the AWIC report, and presumably the purpose of the amendment is to enable us to discuss the attitude taken by the Government to the AWIC report. In essence what we are looking at is a matter of principle, the question of wool marketing, plus the second issue which the honourable gentleman raised, the question of wool deficiency paybelieve that an adequate case has been ments. Both these matters will necessarily have to come before the Parliament in the next session. Both are matters of consequence to the industry. As a result of questions from both sides of the HouseI have explained that a statement will be made by the Government on the attitude that it takes towards the AWIC report as upon the receipt of a report from the Randall Committee, which has just been received. It is the third report from the Committee. There have been 2 earlier reports relating to other aspects of wool marketing. The Government will be taking a decision, and it will be taking it in time to allow the industry to be advised of what the policy of the Government will be for the season that will commence on 1st July next. I do not believe that a case can be substantiated for this Parliament to resume to debate these matters prior to the commencement of the new wool selling season. I believe there have been opportunities for matters relating to the AWIC report to be quent debate to take place. I believe that the fact that this report was distributed in this Parliament, or was distributed through the agency of the ad hoc committee, the Vasey Committee of the AWIC, which is of course the body that prepared the report, enabled every member of this Parliament to debate the issues. For' that reason I do not believe that it is a matter which has been debarred from debate prior to this bers of a Parliament have an opportunity to debate significant policy matters. Of course it is significant for them to be able to consider matters of principle, but it is important that they take opportunities to do so while the Parliament is normally and customarily in session. I do not believe that in circumstances in which the Opposition has not taken advantage of opportunities previously available to it the Opposition should disrupt the customary proceedings in the course of a recess, which is designed to enable the preparation of the Budget and the planning of a wide ranging series of programmes which are normally undertaken by the Government before the commencement of the Budget session in August.

172,Mr Sinclair,"The reason I menestablished for accepting the amendment which the honourable member for Dawson has moved. I believe that members from both sides of this House have had adequate opportunity to raise the matters which the honourable member for Dawson has suggested should again be canvassed. The second matter which he suggests we need an opportunity to debate, the question of the wool deficiency payments, is also a matter which I believe either could have been debated prior to this or can be debated during the Budget session. It is a fact that this was the procedure that was followed with respect to the 36c price support scheme which was introduced by the Government for the present wool selling season. As to the statement by the honourable member for Forrest that this Government only makes statements, I think the fact that the wool market has recovered, the fact that the Australian Wool Commission has been constituted and the fact that there is a wool price deficiency payments scheme all speak for themselves. For that reason the Government does not accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson that the House should meet prior to 30th June 1972.

179,Mr Sinclair,"This means that the talks haveuse the very words which Foreign Minister Bowen used on 20th April this year in answer to a question on notice updating an answer which the present Prime Minister had given me on 23rd February last year on this very matter of the continental shelf, or shelves, in the Timor Sea. The wording which the Foreign Minister gave me on 20th April was: In February 1972, during the visit to Australia of President Soeharto, it was agreed to hold an early meeting of representatives of Indonesia and Australia with a view to completing the delineation of the boundary. I used precisely those words in my question yesterday. Referring to the communique by the President and the Prime Minister of 7th February last I find that the words were: They agreed that aU the outstanding seabed boundary questions should be negotiated at an early date. I believe the comments I made, which were reported in the Melbourne 'Sun' this morning, were not untrue. I believe my question was framed with complete regard to the facts coming from successive Foreign Ministers, one of them being the present Prime Minister. Discusion of Matter of Public Importance I have received a letter from the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to plan the orderly development and expansion of the Australian shipping, dredging, shipbuilding and docking industries. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places). (5.37)-The Opposition has brought forward this matter of public importance because the Government has been sitting on the Tariff Board report for almost 12 months. It has made various promises of bringing the report before the House but until today we have been unsuccessful in obtaining this information. I am pleased to say that as a result of the discussion of this matter of public importance we will finally flush the fox out of his lair. I believe that the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Nixon), when he follows me, will make reference to the Tariff Board report. So at least thi. decision of the Opposition to bring forward this matter of public importance will pay dividends, will produce a result and will force the Government into making a decision. About5 years ago the Government announced a policy of introducing Australian shipping into the overseas conference lines. This decision was supported strongly by the Opposition. Some4 years after this decision was made the Government has found itself in the position where we have only 4 ships trading in the overseas tonnage-namely , the 'Australian Endeavour', the 'Australian Enterprise', the 'Allunga' and the 'Matthew Flinders', and some time in the next 12 months no doubt there will be the 'Australian Exporter'. I think this is a disgraceful situation. We have some 5,000 sailings a year from Australian ports handling exports to the value of $4,400m and representing something like 100 million to 110 million tons of cargo. So there is any amount of trade for an Australian merchant fleet to carry. The Government should be getting on with the job. Even though the then Minister for Trade and Industry, Sir John McEwen, stated that the object of the exercise was to get a window into the conferences, up to this point if there is a window into the conferences the Government has not told the Parliament what it is. Members of the Opposition have tried to obtain information as to what is actually transpiring in this trade and what the window is disclosing. The report of the Australian National Line discloses no confidential information or no information of value to honourable members. All we know is that it would appear that the venture into the European conference in particular has been a failure, that the recommendations that were made originally for roll-on roll-off ships to be used have been borne out and that the decision of the Government to go into cellular container ships has not been the success that it was hoped it would be. As far as the coastal trade is concerned, at present I believe 17 Australian ships are",54,Personal Explanation

181,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle),"laid up with a displacement of 600 men who normally would man those ships. When another 300 complete their leave there will be a total of 900 Australian seamen unemployed because of the policy of this Government. We on this side of the House believe that something positive should be done about it. We believe that the Government should have taken action to move into the crude oil trade. In 1970-71 there were 3,001 million gallons of crude oil imported into Australia. All of this was brought to this country in foreign owned and manned ships. At the present time all ships in the New Guinea to Australia trade are foreign owned and manned. In the period including all of 1971 and up to February 1972-that is, a period of 14 months-2 7 ships carried phosphate from Nauru to Australia; 25 ships carried phosphate from Christmas Island to Australia; and 12 carried phosphate from Ocean Island to Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which I have already shown to the Minister for Shipping and Transport which very clearly gives the picture of the amount of phosphate that is carried from these islands to Australia. being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows): B.P.C. From: tons Nauru Ocean Island .. .. 161.800 Christmas Island 455,850 585,100 1,057,350 Nauru Ocean Island .. Christmas Island 95,350 Source: British Phosphate Commission. Minister and honourable members. Another matter with which I wish to deal in the limited time left to me-on e has to gallop when one has only a quarter of an hour in which to speak-is dredging. I commence my remarks on this subject with statements which were made in Newcastle and which appeared in the 'Newcastle Morning Herald' of 17th April 1972. The article stated: The Chairman of Westminster Dredging Australia Pty Ltd( Mr C. A. Alexander) said the Federal Government had forced his company and other companies to build dredges in Australia. It had then let foreign companies, which could operate at lower costs, compete for dredgingcontracts. | This is where I condemn the Government for its decision first of all to allow foreign dredges on to the coast. To give the picture 1 once again seek leave to incorporate in' Hansard a table setting out the number of dredges at present laid up. There being no objection, leave is granted.

At the present time, as this table discloses, there are 13 dredges tied up throughout Australia.

Dredging contracts in Australia .. 25,800 20,500 25,600 have been let to foreign owned dredging 61,700 25,600 companies. This is being done while we have unemployed Australians and ships, some of which were built in Australia, that are tied up on the coast. I take one case in particular, namely that of Bunbury. Some2 years ago an acrimonious debate took place in Western Australia where the trade union movement was trying to get work in Bunbury harbour carried out by Australian dredges manned by Australian crews. But the then Liberal Government of Western Australia insisted on acceptance of the lowest tender which went to a South Korean dredging company.

185,Mr Charles Jonesi Thank The,"Korean ship manned by a South Korean crew was sent here to do the work. Today that company is well behind in its time schedule. It has run into problems that Australian dredging companies knew existed. The Australian companies knew about a hard rock shelf which would present great problems. The South Korean company did not have the equipment to do the job at the time the contract was let and it still is in the same position. The result is that work that should have been reaching completion has been held up. It is well behind schedule. These are some of the things that have developed because of the Government's allowing foreign dredging companies to come onto the Australian coast to do work which should be done by Australian dredges manned by Australian seamen. Another matter I want to deal with relates to shipbuilding. Whilst the Government has made orders available, one of the tragedies of'the Australian shipbuilding industry is that at present the yards do not have a clear plan of continuity of employment. Once a tender for a ship has been submitted and accepted it takes about 6 to 9 months to organise the work and materials and get everything flowing. Unfortunately this Government has a stop-go programme of shipbuilding. This statement was made only recently in regard to the activities of Evans Deakin Industries Ltd in Brisbane: The immediate survival chances of Evans Deakin Industries Ltd shipbuilding activities at BrisBeroona bane appear to depend on one of 2 tenders it has submitted to the Australian Shipbuilding Board coming to fmitation within the next few weeks. On a sober market assessment of this happening, the chances appear to be very, slim. Here is a large industry-the second largest industry in Queensland-whic h is in a position where employment for approximately 3,000 men could be lost to that State. It is time the Government did something about shipbuilding. A Tariff Board inquiry commenced in 1969. The report of the Board was presented to the Minister on 12th June 1971. It has taken almost 12 months for the Government to make up its mind on the policy that has been recommended by the Tariff Board. If it had not been for the raising of the matter of public importance this afternoon I doubt very much whether the Government would even at this point of time table the Tariff Board report. In any case, we on this side of the House look forward with interest to what the report will contain. I would like to take the opportunity of commenting on it later. At least we are going to get the report tabled this afternoon-o r I hope the Minister will deal with it in a few moments. At present there are 38 foreign built ships operating interstate and 14 operating intrastate on the Australian coast. This makes a total of 52 ships. Also there are 3 oil drilling ships and one drilling platform, all of which were built overseas. The replacement of these ships by Australian built ships would make an excellent ship building programme for Australian yards. At least if such a policy were adopted the shipbuilding yards could plan their work and get on with the job of providing employment for Australian workers. I seek leave of the Minister to incorporate in Hansard another list of ships which shows all of the ships built overseas and operating on the coast. granted?

186,Mr Speaker,"Order! Is leave I thank the Minister and honourable members. Whilst the shipyards throughout Australia at the moment have current orders and work is under way, there is not sufficient work in the programme that is already under tender to keep any one of the 3 major shipyards operating in Australia fully occupied for 12 months. The tenders that are still open-eve n throwing in the extra 3 ships for which tenders have been called-whe n added to those yet to be allocated would not provide employment for one of the 3 major yards in Australia. Any number of ships built overseas are operating on the Australian coast. Replacements for these ships should be built in Australian yards. This Government should take action to do something about the situation. The other matter to which I wish to refer deals with docks. Once again the Government has taken too long to make a granted decision in this case. It has received the Mr Charles Jones asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice: (1) Which Australian ships were docked and repaired overseas in each of the last 5 years. (2) What was the (a) tonnage of this ship, (b) owner's name and (c) port in which the ship was docked and repaired in each case. member's question: The Australian trading vessels which have been docked and repaired overseas in each of the last 5 years are as follows: Calendar year 1967 1968 1969 'Kooringa' (5,976) 'Iron Endeavour' (40,316) 1970 'Gerringong'(14,504) ..

This report should have been tabled long ago. Very strong demands have been made on the Government by the Australian Chamber of Shipping. The Government was taken to task at a transport conference held in Canberra in March 1971 when speakers from various shipping interests strongly condemned the Australian Government's failure to do something about docks, and to provide adequate docks throughout Australia so that work could be carried out by Australian companies and not be given to overseas companies.

187,Mr Hunt,As Acting Minister fbr Shipping and Transport I supply the following answer to the honourable,58,Question B If Ships Involved In Australian Coastal Tradb Overseas Built
188,Mr Speaker,"Order! Is leaveHouse and tbe Minister. We on this side of the House are strongly in favour of ships operating on the Australian coast being repaired by Australian workmen in Australian shipyards and in Australian docks wherever possible. I wrote to the Minister only this week to draw to his attention the fact that a little old ship, the liquid gas carrier 'Arago', was to go to Hong Kong for a 4-year survey although this work could be carried out in Australia. This surcarried out by Australian workmen in Ausvey will entail a good deal of work. When I heard about this I got in touch with some of the shipyards that would be interested in this work. The State dockyard in Newcastle has a slip which is available, which will be made available and on which the work can be done immediately for the company which owns the ship. The position is that these overseas companies bring to Australia ships manned with overseas crews and, as soon as a quid can be made for the Australian workman and the Australian economy from the repair of these ships, the companies want to take them overseas to Hong Kong, Singapore or somewhere else. We on this side of the House are totally opposed to this policy of allowing foreign-built ships to operate on our coast when the ships which are needed could be built in Australian shipyards. The same remark applies to ship repair work. In conclusion I summarise the attitude of the Labor Party on the 4 questions relating to shipping that have been raised in this discussion of a matter of public importance. We believe that a reasonable amount of Australian trade should be carded in Australian ships, built and manned by Australians. I accept that countries which buy commodities such as coal, ore and other minerals from Australia have the right to transport these materials in their own ships but, in turn, we are entitled to transport in Australian ships our imports of crude oil, phosphates and other goods of that type which require a one-voyage journey. We believe that all dredging in Australia should be carried out by Australian dredges manned with Australian crews so that, at least, the work can be done to Australian standards of employment. We believe that it is time that there was a long-term, planned, shipbuilding probeen working on a statement relating to gramme to replace all foreign-built ships operating on our coast with ships which have been built in Australia. I have already provided the House with details relating to this aspect We believe that sufficient docks should be built, not financed completely by the Commonwealth but at least with reasonable Commonwealth assistance, to provide on our coast facilities to carry out the repair of ships that are operating around our coast and any other ships that could need assistance. If this were done, all this work would be tralian shipyards. member's time has expired. Shipping and Transport) (5.42)I am a little inclined to wonder why the Opposition has proposed this matter of public importance for discussion at this time. Let me relate to the House the wording of this matter of public importance. It states: The Government's failure to plan the orderly development and expansion of the Australian shipping, dredging, shipbuilding and docking industries. Each of those subjects is fairly wide-ranging. In all fairness to the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones), whilst I recognise that he has a keen interest in shipping, I must say to him that he has made no attempt to make a fair presentation of the facts in relation to Government policy towards shipping. I believe that, contrary to what the honourable member has said, the Government has policies which have led to the orderly development and expansion of the very things that he mentioned. I believe that I can easily prove my assertion by reading an account of each of the matters that I have before me. Regrettably, time will preclude me from establishing my case fully. Let me deal firstly with the report of the Tariff Board. The honourable member for Newcastle expressed a belief that he had flushed me out in regard to the Tariff Board report. The facts are that when I first heard that this matter of public importance was to be raised today, I rang the honourable member for Newcastle and said to him: T have the Tariff Board report because the Government has come to decisions and I was",58,Question B If Ships Involved In Australian Coastal Tradb Overseas Built

But if you proceed with this matter of public importance, I will be unable to complete the preparation of the statement on the Tariff Board report and to make the statement to the Parliament."" That is exactly what has eventuated. I am now forced by the actions of the honourable member for Newcastle in raising this matter of public importance to make a statement on the Tariff Board report, on which Government decisions have been made, outside this Parliament, after the Parliament rises, because 1 have not had time to complete the statement. This is quite contrary to the Government's wishes in regard to the statement. We were working at full steam to present it to the House and make the statement properly. unable to make it then because, as I have said, I have had to devote my time completely to this matter of public importance. I sat in the House for about 2 hours this afternoon while honourable members opposite wasted the time of the House with cheap political stunts. Against the wool grower? full well the value of Labor Party policies on rural industries. Do not start me on that. The honourable member for Dawson appeared on television one night recently and I happened to see the programme. I thought it was a delightful programme. It -was a great credit to the producers of This Day Tonight' that the programme should show him thundering forth in such fine fashion and denouncing the Labor Party's approach to rural industries, knowing full well that any chance he had of capturing a few votes in the rural areas had been destroyed by the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party. The rural electorates are fully aware of the cheap stunts that members of the Labor Party get up to in this House. Minister is getting a little wide of the subnew set of problems in the Australian ject matter that is before the House. little wide of the matter of public importance. I have been precluded from adopting what is the normal, customary procedure when making a statement on Government policy in this Parliament because the statement could not be prepared. The honourable member for Newcastle knows that; I told him that would be the case. I suppose he is prepared to take it as it comes. Mr Charles JonesMr Speaker, I take a point of order. The Minister said he would use this information in his reply to me. stance in the point of order. the point of order because what the honourable member for Newcastle said is not correct. You are quite right, Mr Speaker; I agree with you entirely. I am very grateful for your proper ruling on the matter. The statement on the Tariff Board report will be made as soon as I can get to it. The honourable member for Newcastle referred to the number of imported ships that are in this country and made a case to suggest that they were displacing Australian-built ships in the coastal trade. The Government has been impeccable, when allowing a foreign-built ship into this country for a special task or for a short time or for any purpose, in studying carefully whether an Australian ship should be built to take its place. We have had complete co-operation from the shipping industry and there has been a complete understanding by the shipbuilding industry of our policy in this regard. Indeed, I have a list of ships that have been imported, showing the purposes for which they have been imported, whether they have been imported for a short term one-off job or, if imported for a longer period, whether they have to be rebuilt. I would like to name just one or two of these ships. The reason I do so is to point out to the honourable member for Newcastle that I do not believe that he has an understanding of what is required in the fast changing technological shipping industry. For instance, the discovery of oil off the tanker-building industry. We had to import",59,Question B If Ships Involved In Australian Coastal Tradb Overseas Built

199,Mr Nlxon,"There is no substance intankers to cope with the short term problem, but they are being replaced by Australian ships or replacements are being built for them. I will just name a few of the ships to which I have referred. The 'Bayou Chico' came into Australia for a seismic survey. It was a specific short term survey task. In those circumstances it would have been quite irresponsible for me as Minister to ask that this task be fulfilled that we have had a window into the Conby an Australian-built ship. It was a short term, one job task and a proper survey was made of the Australian shipping industry to see whether there was available a ship comparable to the 'Bayou Chico' that could have done the job. However, none was available. So, it is quite ridiculous for the honourable member to suggest that an Australian-built ship should be used for this task. The 'Coral Sea', which is a grab dredge, came in for a specific task at Cape Lambert. Exhaustive investigations were carried out to ascertain whether an Australianbuilt dredge was available for the task. The same remarks apply to the 'DB1', the 'DB2' and to many others. One of the bigger ships to arrive here was the 'Ida Clausen' which was brought to Australia as a transport for livestock. She was brought in on the assumption that there would be a building commitment when the viability of the operation was established. I say to the honourable member for Newcastle that it would be quite irresponsible of me, as Minister, to refuse to allow a company to bring in a ship and try it out to see whether or not the company could establish a long term operation. The company brought in this ship to see whether the operation is viable. If the operation is not viable, of course, the ship can be sent back overseas. It is on charter. The company can do this instead of investing a great deal of capital and losing it. We have used some imagination in our policy and we have given consideration both to the commercial interests involved and to the employment of the Australian fleet. The facts are that all the ships used on the Australian coastline have to meet very vigorous Australian conditions, and this is one of our difficulties. The honourable member for Newcastle talked so blithely about the use of Australian seamen and even Australian docks for repair work. He totally ignores the commercial considerations and the added costs that have to be incurred because of the vigorous conditions which ships are obliged to meet, and which have a consequential effect on Australian exporting industries. In regard to overseas ships, the honourable member for Newcastle talked about our getting a window into the Conference system. The fact is ference system and it has proved to be a great success. The Australian Government has received interesting and useful information from it. For commercial reasons this information is not made public. We cannot publish everything that we learn. I shall mention one or two developments that have taken place as a result of our participation in the Conference system. The first is that the Australian National Line has joined with the Associated Container Transportation Ltd in setting up a pendulum service within the European Conference, and we believe that a much more viable, economic and efficient service will result from this venture. Our joining with ACTL has resulted from knowledge we have gained inside the Conference system. As I have said, we are using the Conference as a window. The second development is that a second ship, the 'Australian Explorer' is joining the run on which the 'Australian Endeavour' is engaged. We have the 'Australian Enterprise' on the Japan run. We are engaged also in the Pacific Australia Direct Line, or PAD, service. The Australian overseas shipping industry, through the Australian National Line, has become very important to the economy of Australian exporting industries. We have completely protected the Australian coastal shipping industry. The industry is fully aware of the steps which have been taken to protect it, and I believe that the claims of the honourable member for Newcastle fall quite flat. The honourable member also referred to the use of overseas dry docks. Again, this is a commercial decision; it has to be taken by the people concerned. The facts are that, regrettably, some of the demarcation disputes and political disputes that occur in Australian docks increase costs so greatly that commercial interests are unable to meet the higher charges imposed by Australian docks. It is all very well to be nationalistic in approach, but there also has to be some realism. In his opening remarks the honourable member for Newcastle said that a reasonable amount of Australian ships or a reasonable amount of employment Mr Charles JonesA reasonable amount of Australian trade. referred to a reasonable amount of Australian trade. That is open to any sort of interpretation. I suggest to the honourable member that in point of fact the Australian Government is meeting the needs and the wishes of the industries involved. Both in the Australian coastal trade and in overseas trade I believe that our policy has been successful. The honourable member for Newcastle also referred to dredges. I believe that we have taken every precaution to ensure that Australian dredges are used wherever practicable. He referred to a one-off situation. As I say, we have taken every precaution. Most of the Australian dredges that are not being used at the moment are too small and inefficient to be able to undertake big jobs. The last question which the honourable member for Newcastle raised referred to dock development. There is an IDC report, as the honourable member well knows, and the Government will make a statement on that report at the appropriate time, after consideration has been given to the final details. I reject the charge of Government failure made by the honourable member for Newcastle. gives me pleasure to support the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) who raised this matter of public importance which refers to the Government's failure to plan the orderly development and expansion of the Australian shipping, dredging, shipbuilding and docking industries. I understood from the honourable member for Newcastle that the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr a while before building a replacement ship Nixon) was going to table a report that has been eagerly awaited, by all sections of the shipping and shipbuilding industry, since it was first indicated, almost 3 years ago, that an investigation would be made into the shipbuilding industry. The report has been in the hands of a member of the Cabinet for 12 months, but this evening, the Minister now says that he has not had time to prepare a statement on the report. He may have had some difficulties within the Government parties, and I would not expect him to mention those difficulties in the House. The Minister said-and I take it that he said it in good faith-that the report would be presented during this session of the Parliament. I can only conclude from that statement that there are some difficulties within the Government parties concerning the recommendations contained in the report. But this has further confused the position for the people in the industry who are expecting some assistance from the Government. the report been delayed for 12 months? The Minister spoke for about 5 minutes before he referred to the questions raised in the matter of public importance. As I say, he said that he has not had time to prepare a statement on the report, and that he will release a statement after the House rises. The Minister mentioned a policy going back, I think, to just after World WarI when ships were allowed to operate on the Australian coastline with the permission of the Minister. This policy has not been changed, but what has happened is that there is some laxity in the application of the policy. I am informed that 52 ships which have been built overseas are operating in the Australian interstate and intrastate trade at the present time when, as the honourable member for Newcastle has said, 17 ships of the Australian National Line are tied up. It seems to me that the Minister is lax in allowing these overseas vessels to operate on the Australian coastline. As the Minister has said, there are new types of vessels. There have been some changes in vessels and in their operations. I agree with him that it would be better to bring in a ship and allow it to operate for in Australia and manning it with an Australian crew. I do not think that the Minister will receive any opposition on this score from the Australian Labor Party or from the maritime unions. This has been our policy ever since the days when the Millers brought theirfirsttanker to operate",60,Question B If Ships Involved In Australian Coastal Tradb Overseas Built

203,Mr Hansen,"Why has the tabling ofon the Australian coast line. I am not alone in my thoughts that the Minister is being lax in allowing overseas ships to operate on the Australian coast line. I refer to a report in the Brisbane 'Courier Mail' of 2nd May in which the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron), who is a member of the Liberal Party, referred to the Government's policy and said: My inquiries indicate that this policy is not being strictly applied, and extensions of permisshipbuilding and ship repair work there is sion to use imported vessels are frequently granted. He referred to the 'Iron Cavalier' and the 'Iron Clipper' which are owned by the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. The point is that there is a particular problem facing the Evans Deakin shipyard, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Griffith. This is an election year in both the Queensland and Commonwealth spheres and, Mr Speaker, I want to diverge for a minute because there is some concern about what is happening at the Evans Deakin shipyard and the possibility of the shipyard obtaining further orders. In fact on 6th May the Liberal Treasurer and Deputy Premier of Queensland said that the State Government was negotiating with the Commonwealth in an attempt to obtain sport said, there have been technological forward orders for Evans Deakin.

The honourable member for Wide Bay may continue. always a system of job to finish and I hope that this is the way this debate will work out. According to a statistical report concerning Australian shipping and shipbuilding there are 13 dry docks in Australia, the newest of which were constructed during the war. The Cairncross Graving Dock in Brisbane was never completed to its original size, nor was the Captain Cook Graving Dock in Sydney. From the total number of dry docks can be deleted the Frank Nicklin Dock, which is a building dock, and the South Brisbane Government dry dock which will close shortly. In the post-war period there has been no construction of floating docks or graving docks in Australia. As the Minister for Shipping and Tranchanges in shipbuilding.

The Minister said that the graving dock planned by the Government would be 900 feet long, 150 feet wide and would take ships up to 100,000 tons dwt, which is by no means the largest ship operating on the overseas trade at present. The Minister said that because of the shortage of dry dock facilities in Ausdebating a matter of public importance tralia he believed it vital for the New South Wales maritime industry to have a new graving dock built at Newcastle as quickly as possible and asked for a Commonwealth subsidya one-third shipbuilding subsidy and an additional one-third subsidy because of the significance of the dock to Australia as a whole. It is recognised that there is a need for a policy. The New South Wales Liberal Minister for Works agrees that there is a need. The Minister for Shipping and Transport has had time to study the report, even if he has not had time to make a statement. I look forward to his statement. I disagree with him that the present policy is in the best interests of the shipbuilding industry or of the operations of ships along the Australian coastline.

(2) What was the total tax levied on foreignowned companies in each of these years. (3) What was the total profit before taxation of all companies registered in Australia in each of the 3 years. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Some information in respect of foreign-owned companies is collected by way of surveys of overseas investment conducted by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. Although information is not available from these surveys on profits earned or taxes paid by foreign-owned companies, tbe Commonwealth Statistician has advised that the investment income (including interest) payable overseas by all companies in Australia amounted to $239m, $309m and $673m, respectively, for the 3 years 1960-61, 1965-66 and 1970-71. (2) No taxation statistics are available that would provide a basis for a reliable estimate of the amount of income tax assessed to foreign-owned companies. Furthermore, the information which I am supplying in answer to parts (1) and (3) of the honourable member's question would not provide tbe basis for a satisfactory estimate of the tax payable by foreign-owned companies. (3) Tbe Commonwealth Statistician advises that company income, as estimated for the purposes of tbe Australian National Accounts, would be the closest approximation to the total profit, before taxation, of all companiesregisteredin Australia. Estimated company income for 1960-61, 1965-66 and 1970-71 is $1,394m, $l,898m and 23,021m, respectively. The estimate, 1970-71, is preliminary and subject to revision.

The National Service Act prescribes only a penalty of a fine of not less than $40 nor more than $200. Mr David Martin was imprisoned in August last, at the direction of the Court on account of his faUure to pay a fine imposed on him when convicted of failing to register for national service as required. He was sentenced to 7 days imprisonment in December, when upon being convicted of failing to attend for medical examination he refused to undertake to attend for examination at a future date. He failed to report for service as required on 4lh January 1972. Mr Martin has written to me regarding his views on national service and has indicated that he is a Quaker. He is currently the subject of a direction under the National Service Regulations that the question of whether he holds beliefs which do not allow him to engage in military service should be determined by a court, a previous reference of this question having been struck out.

(2) Did he assure the House on the afternoon of 6th April 1971 (Hansard, page 1456) that he has already communicated a protest to the South African Government against its exclusion of black South Africans from this team. (3) Did he later omit to answer that part of Question No. 3801 (Hansard, 22nd February 1972, page 73) which specifically asked when this communication was sent. (4) Did be inform the House on 29th February 1972 (Hansard, pages 336-7) that on the morning of 6th April 1971 he had spoken to the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and had instructed him to convey urgently and immediately to the South African Embassy his personal concern at the exclusion of non-white players from the cricket team.

Overseas investment in Australia has played an Important role in the development of our natural resources. Japanese investment in Australia in the development of the resources is relatively small in the total of overseas investment. Japan is aware of and accepts our policy for projects to be carried out in association with Australian equity and management and for some of our natural resources to be processed in Australia, where economically feasible, before export. In implementing our policy on overseas investment in Australia no preferential treatment is extended to any investing countries. The right honourable member will be aware that the Treasurer tabled in the House on 16 May 1972 the Treasury economic paper 'Overseas Investment in Australia'. This paper analyses, from the Australian viewpoint, the principal economic issues raised by overseas investment in Australia and provides a basis for policy discussion.

The first four stages of this series have been completed and covered manufacturing and tertiary industries. In these surveys, results obtained from 2,704firms,employing 937,000 persons, indicate that over a three year period 3,615 employees were retrenched as a result of technological change, a rate of retrenchment of 0.13 per cent per annum. It should not be assumed that all of the 3,615 employees experienced unemployment following retrenchment. My Department's studies indicate that some of those retrenched obtain other employment either immediately or after an interval. In fact quite a number of employers actively assist their employees in obtaining alternative work. (2) There is a certain amount of discrimination against the older worker in Australia. The effect of this discrimination, and the age at which it may be experienced, varies according to occupation,",71,Department Of Supply
230,Mr Lynch,"The answer to the honourindustry, locality and the skill required; it is however not possible to specify its extent. Generally speaking, semi-skilled and unskilled workers and some categories of executives are likely to suffer most from this discrimination. Tbe Commonwealth Employment Service, operated by my Department, seeks to counteract this prejudice, where it exists. Tbe Commonwealth Employment Service encourages employers to recognise that many older workers bring to their employment experience, judgment and stable attitudes. Unless there is evidence that an individual's age has caused a decline in his capacity to perform a particular job, there is no reason why age _ should become an overriding factor in his selection. Tnxation (Question No. 56781 Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon purpose of the estimate were realised. notice: (1) What would be the estimated loss to revenue bined with additional tax payable under section 8 of the proposal to raise the income tax exemption of the Income Tax Act 1971-72, exceeding 50c per to tbe minimum award wage for a taxpayer with dollar apply to that part of an individual's taxable 2 dependants. (2) What would he the estimated loss to revenue the parts in excess of $10,000 of taxable incomes of the proposal to reduce the maximum marginal estimated for the 1971-72 income year, the resulting rate of tax deduction to 50 cents in the dollar. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no national minimum award wage as such in Australia. However, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has inserted in Commonwealth awards provision for a minimum wage for adult males. The6 State Capital Cities average minimum weekly wage for adult males under awards made by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is at present $51.10 per week which is equivalent to $2,657.20 per annum. To ensure that a taxpayer with 2 dependants earning an income of $2,657.20 per annum is exempt from income tax on that income it would be necessary to exempt from tax taxable incomes up to and including $2,137, i.e., it would be necessary to raise tbe minimum taxable income to $2,138. It has been assumed that the 2 dependants maintained by the taxpayer are a wife and a child for whom the taxpayer would be entitled to a deduction from assessable income of $520 for a full year.

Females aged 60 and over Females aged 65 arid over Age pensions current at 30 June Individual resident taxpayers in 30 June (a) Population figures exclude full-blood Aborigines. accordance Mith detailed results of the 1971 Census of Population. raising the minimum taxable income to $2,138 is estimated at about $300m. In this estimate, allowance has been made for 'shading-in', i.e., a reduction in tax otherwise payable on taxable incomes somewhat higher than the amount of $2,137. The purpose of 'shading-in' is to ease the transition from complete exemption from tax to liability for tax at normal rates. Under the 'shading-in' arrangement assumed for purposes of the estimate, the tax payable on the excess of the taxable income is limited to 47 per cent, i.e., the approximate rate (after inclusion of additional tax payable under section 8 of the Income Tax Act 1971-72) to which the tax payable on income falling within the 'shading-in' range under the present law is limited. Reduced tax therefore applies to taxpayers with taxable incomes up to the level at which tbe amount of tax calculated at normal rates equals the amount of tax payable under the 'shading-in' arrangement. This level would be $3,087 if the assumptions made for the (2) At present, general rates of tax, when comincome which exceeds $10,000.

Cigarette Advertising (Qnestion No. 5718) Dr Everingham asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Would a 2 per cent levy on cigarettes produce revenue about equal to the expenditure required to provide (a) equal time on television to combat cigarette advertising or (b) finance for television stations to compensate for loss of cigarette advertising. (2) If so, will he investigate the possibility, of such a levy and expenditure and publish his conclusions. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Insufficient information is available to say whether a 2 per cent levy on cigarettes would produce revenue about equal to the expenditures mentioned in the honourable member's question. (2) Duties on cigarettes, like duties on a number of other commodities including beer, potable spirits and motor spirit are levied by the Commonwealth for general revenue purposes. The revenue derived from these and other taxes is, under Section 81 of the Constitution, paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund where it is used to meet the overall financial commitments of the Commonwealth. To hypothecate, for particular uses, the revenue raised from a 2 per cent levy on cigarettes would cut across the principle that the need for particular expenditures should be determined having regard to the priorities applying to competing expenditure demands rather than the revenue yield of a particular tax.

238,Mr Swartz,"The Minister for Civil Aviaexchange facilities at Toprain within twelve months if the applicants reached agreement on the construction of lines to the exchange point at their expense. However, they were unable to agree between themselves on this aspect. At a later meeting in Brisbane in August 1971 between the Director, Posts and Telegraphs, Queensland, and Members of Parliament who were pursuing the matter on behalf of the applicants, the offer was repeated as a temporary measure pending the provision by the Post Office of standard Departmental lines which could not be programmed for some years. The position now is that, in the current 3-yeir works programme, an amount of $20,000 has been allocated for the construction of a trunk line from the establishment at the latter centre. It is expected that the trunk line will be constructed by the end of the 1972-73 financial year and the work on subscribers' line reticulation and supporting trunk line provision on main routes will then be undertaken, with completion of the project in its entirety being scheduled for 1975-76. However, when the Toprain trunk line is constructed, it is proposed to utilise' it for the establishment of a public telephone in) the area so that a measure of service will be available to the residents pending connection of their services. (3) Funds for the Post Office capital works are allocated to the various States as far as practicable in proportion to the demand for services and the physical capacity to meet the demand. However, it is not just a question of finance. The telephone system is complex and the provision of new services often involves the establishment of new exchanges and trunk line facilities, as iii the case of Toprain. Projects of this nature, requiring as they do highly trained staffengineers, technicians and the like-mus t be preceded by detailed surveys and exchange area planning to ensure that available resources are utilised in the most effective manner. Even if unlimited funds were available, this would not in itself mean that telephone services could be installed in all instances without delay, since the ability to expand capital within a given period is dependent on the extent to which resources of skilled manpower and materials can be devoted to the task. (4) and (5) The Government looks to the Post Office to conduct its activities on sound commercial lines as far as practicable. However, it seems clear that, if an organisation were operating .purely and simply as a business undertaking, it would not be prepared to provide telephone services in many of our rural areas. Rural telephone services are generally not an attractive financial proposition because of the heavy costs involved in their provision and maintenance for a relatively low revenue return. For example, in the Toprain case, total revenue was estimated in 1970 at $4,500 per annum for a capital investment of some $100,000. Such uneconomic projects can only be undertaken by the Post Office in its role as a public utility with the responsibility for providing telephone services in unprofitable as well as profitable areas.

For example, they are not suitable for F.27 aircraft. The existing range of domestic jet aircraft per(the Commonwealth Statistician has supmits the ready use of one aerobridge only per aircraft. Tbe same may be said of the Boeing 707. On the other hand, the Boeing 747 required 2 aerobridges and these are already provided at a limited number of positions in both Sydney and Melbourne. As the percentage of Boeing 747 operations increases the number of Boeing 747 positions with 2 aerobridges is being increased. Both TAA and Ansett Airlines of Australia are planning to effect major improvements to their domestic terminals at Sydney and your request for the provision of aerobridges will be brought to their notice. They also have in mind to increase the number of domestic aerobridges at Melbourne, for example, as the frequency, of use justifies the expenditure.

So far as the numbers of public servants receiving allowances are concerned a survey made in June 1971 produced a figure of 946 as at 30th June 1971. (6) Payments under Regulation 97 are made only to the officer involved.

Tne amount of contribution is greater for officers on higher salaries than for officers on lower salaries. The detailed procedures to be followed by Departments are set out in instructions issued by the Public Service Board. Payment of a rental subsidy has never been restricted to officers occupying premises which have been fair rented following application under the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance.

Medical Practitioners: Specialists In Ophthalmology (Question No. 5590) Mr Stewart asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: How many legally qualified medical practitioners requires to be considered in the light of claims specialising in ophthalmology are there in (a) Australia and (b) each State. able member's question is as follows: Under the provisions of the National Health Act, medical practitioners may be recognised as specialists or as consultant physicians for the purposes of payment of higher rates of medical benefits to referred patients. The numbers of medical practitioners recognised in the specialty of ophthalmology as at 31st December 1971 are as follows: (a) 393 (b) New South Wales* Victoria. . Queensland South Australiat . . Western Australia ., Tasmania. . * Includes the Australian Capital Territory, t Includes the Northern Territory. Commonwealth Medical Benefits: Visual Aids (Question No. 5593) Mr Stewart asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What are the reasons for the non-payment of a Commonwealth medical benefit to members of medical funds who are prescribed visual aids by either legally qualified medical practitioners or optometrists. (2) Will the Government consider amending the National Health Act to provide for payment of both Commonwealth and fund benefit when visual aids are prescribed by a medical practitioner or optometrist. able member's question is as follows: (1) The National Health Act makes provision for the payment of Commonwealth medical benefits to contributors to registered medical benefits organisations who incur expenses in relation to services rendered by qualified medical practitioners, or prescribed medical services rendered by approved dentists. The Act does not cover services rendered by optometrists, nor does it provide for payment of a benefit towards the cost of spectacles. However, in order to avoid discrimination between patients in the allied fields of optometry and ophthalmology in cases where spectacle lenses are prescribed, the Act specifically excludes the payment of Commonwealth benefits for attendances by medical practitioners which result in the prescription of spectacles. In this way, the patient is left in the same position whether the spectacles are prescribed by an optometrist or an opthalmologist. (2) From time to time, the Government has given consideration to extending the Health Benefits Plan so that it includes ancillary services but, to date, such an extension has not been practicable. As the honourable member will appreciate, any proposal for the provision of benefits in respect of any particular type of ancillary service for benefits over the whole range of ancillary services. This raises a major consideration, namely, the additional burden which would be placed on the Australian taxpayer who, in 1971-72, is expected to provide some $510m from the National Welfare Fund for health services. While the matter is thus kept under review, I cannot promise that any early action will be taken to include optometry in the plan. However, most health insurance organisations pay ancillary fund benefits where spectacles are prescribed, and pay fund benefits towards the cost of spectacles. The major organisations provide .. ..164 these benefits only where the services are ren.. .. ..102 dered, or the spectacles are prescribed, by medical .. .. . . 5 1 practitioners. Certain other organisations pay fund .. ..36 benefits for optometrical as well as medical prac.. 23 titioner prescriptions.

Funds for Research, Education, Extension and DevelopmentIn 1969 Parliament passed the Fishing Industry Research Act to establish a Fishing Industry Research Trust Account. Consolidated revenue is appropriated to an extent equal to contributions raised from the Fishing Industry under State legislation. All States except Queensland have now established trust accounts which are expended by those States and are matched by the Commonwealth. Queensland is preparing legislation to establish a fund. Grants totalling $464,000 have been approved for research projects from the Commonwealth fund in 1972-73. Australian/Japanese Fisheries AgreementThis agreement, which terminates in 1975, is continuing to operate satisfactorily. Entry of foreign fishing vessels into Australian portsAdministrative procedures have been adopted and are operating satisfactorily to prevent the (Living entry of foreign fishing vessels into Australian ports except in cases of genuine emergency. The Australian Japanese Fisheries Agreement permits Japanese tuna long line vessels to enter Fremanand tle, Hobart, Sydney and Brisbane.

Northern Fisheries Research CommitteeDiscussions between the Commonwealth and the States are continuing at a research level; particular attention has centred around northern prawn fisheries. Gear TechnologyThe Sub-committee of Standing Committee on Fisheries has been set up to consider the question of gear technology and to establish priorities of work. Partly due to the availability of the fishing industry research funds, all the high priority projects are now being undertaken. Environment PollutionClose collaboration has been established between the Commonwealth and State Departments having responsibilities in this field and considerable progress has been made in the area of oil pollution and the dumping at sea. Review of Commonwealth Fisheries ActThe Fisheries Bill 1971 is at present on the notice paper. The Department of Primary Industry keeps all Commonwealth fisheries legislation under constant review.

Grain Alcohol (Question No. 5686) Mr Collard asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) What investigations are being carried out currently by his Department or any other Department in relation to grain alcohol production and use. (2) If investigations are not in process or being arranged, does this indicate that he and his Nebraska, early in 1971, introduced an amending Department are convinced that (a) there is no Bill to provide a reduced fuel tax on fuels convalue, (b) there are disadvantages, or (c) there are taining grain alcohol and no lead. dangers in the use of grain alcohol for motor fuel purposes. (3) If so, on what grounds were these convicto safeguard the life, health, property, and public tions reached. able member's question is as follows: (1) Numerous representations have been made motor fuels containing grain alcohol as a substiby interested parties over a period of more than 2 tute for lead additives is necessary for the reducyears on various aspects of the production of tion of pollution and will further serve as an alcohol from grain and its use for blending with incentive for the agricultural economy in the automotive fuel. My Department has examined information, including reports prepared by various committees from Nebraska for the purpose of considering and research organisations, which has become whether similar legislation should be introduced in available, mainly from Canada and the United Australia; if not, why not. States. It is not carrying out investigations. I am not aware that any other Department is doing so. (2) and (3) Available information has left me in able member's question is as follows: no doubt that under present circumstances the establishment of an industry to produce industrial alcohol in gasoline was passed in the State of alcohol from grain would be economically Nebraska in 1971. The legislation provides, inter unsound. Studies made in Canada and the United States excise tax on motor fuels are to be: in recent years have resulted in the conclusion that it would cost more to produce alcohol from grain, even if the grain were supplied free, than the current ex-refinery prices of petrol in the respective countries. A further aspect of these studies is that industrial alcohol cannot be produced from fermentable materials as cheaply as it can be synthesised from ethylene. For this reason islation has been obtained. virtually all industrial alcohol in most countries is derived from ethylene. It is apparent that grain growers could not expect to receive a remunerative price for grain sold for the production of industrial alcohol. Other factors to be considered, apart from technical aspects such as the comparative efficiency of normal automotive fuels and alcohol blends include: (a) The blending with petrol of alcohol produced at costs substantially in excess of the ex-refinery price of that petrol would result, under present conditions, in higher fuel costs for all users of the blend. (b) This is difficult to anticipate in view of the necessary commitment by the growers to provide given amounts of grain over an extended period and the uncertainty of levels of grain production through adverse seasonal conditions. (c) The prospects of finding satisfactory markets for substantially increased quantities of carbon dioxide and spent grain, which are by-products of fermentation of grain, are anything but encouraging.

(2) Yes. (3) Information on aspects of the Nebraska legPoints to be noted include: (a) the legislation requires that the fuel be lead free in order to qualify for the tax concession; (b) the tax concession proposed is implicit recognition that the blend cannot be produced to compete on equal terms with gasoline; (c) Nebraska has contiguous borders with 6 other States. The need for even minor carburettor adjustments on vehicles using the blend would pose problems if those vehicles had to be refuelled in places where the blend was not available. This points up a major limitation on. the efficacy of this type of action on a localised basis; (d) there is considerable controversy as to the effects of different blends on air pollution. Some eminent authorities have disputed claims that the blending of alcohol in gasoline would bring about significant reduction in air pollution.",102,Bruny Island Ferry

289,Mr Sinclair,"The answer to the honourPapua New Guinea: Public Service (Question No. 5730) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: Has the Public Service Board in Papua New Guinea yet made any declarations that preference in promotion, transfer or appointment to an office or class of office in the Public Service shall be given to any efficient officer who is not an overseas officer. (Hansard, 9th March 1971, page 755). ourable member's question is as follows: No. The section of the Public Service (Papua New Guinea) Ordinance 1963-1971 relating to preference in promotion, transfer or appointment for local officers has been repealed by the Public Service (Promotion and Recruitment Procedures) Ordinance 1971 (No. 11 of 1972). The latter Ordinance provides for a new system of selecting officers for promotion or transfer and for appointments to the Public Service. The new procedures require that all vacancies which are to be filled must be advertised. Applications are considered by Selection Committees consisting of a chairman (an officer of the Department of the Public Service Board), a representative of the department in which the vacancy exists and a representative of the appropriate staff association. The appropriate Committee is required to select the most efficient applicant within the Public Service for promotion or transfer to the vacancy. If an overseas officer is selected as the most efficient applicant the Committee is required to determine whether any local officer applicant has a level of efficiency which would Number (1) Employed by Administration (2) Married (3) Married to employees of Commonwealth and Papua New Guinea Departments and Authorities (4) Typists qualified for following allowances: (a) Efficiency in typing at 50 words per minute or employed as Varitype operator (b) Employed solely on transcription by typewriter of recorded dictation (c) Efficiency in writing shorthand at the rate of(i) 80 words per minute (ii) 100 words per minute (iii) 120 words per minute (d) Engaged in the operation of a Justowriter machine enable him to satisfactorily carry out the duties of the office. If there is such a local officer applicant the Committee issues a 'localisation certificate' in respect of that officer. Where there is more than one so qualified the Committee certifies the most efficient. The successful overseas officer is then promoted but transferred to another position of equivalent classification, and the local officer named in the 'localisation certificate' is promoted to the advertised vacancy. The decision of a committee is not subject to appeal. In relation to appointment to the Public Service the new procedures provide that vacancies may be filled by recruitment from outside the Public Service only where there are no applications from within the Service or where the Selection Committee is satisfied that no internal applicant is suitable for the position. The engagement of overseas staff is limited to those categories of employment for which local persons with the required qualifications or experience are not available. Papua New Guinea: Female Administration Staff (Question No. 5732) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: Will he bring up to date the information which his predecessor gave on 23rd April 1971 (Hansard, page 2031) on female staff employed by the Administration of Papua New Guinea. ourable member's question is as follows: (a) Female indigenous staff (b) Female expatriate staff (0 (i>) (0 (ii) Typists Telephonists Typists Telephonists 172 plus 4 29 396 plus 101 63 stenographers stenographers 50 14 307 plus 49 35 stenographers 110 plus 24 18 stenographers 7 89 nil 5 9 50 nil 22 nil 11 nil nil",105,Bruny Island Ferry

They are Mr of the Barkly Tableland), John Akunai and Mr Toua Kapena, GB.E. There is no indigenous representation on the Papua New Guinea Superannuation Board which provides pension benefits for overseas officers.

(2) Will he confer immediately with the States and authorities concerned to ensure that the scheme is extended as a matter of urgency to cover all beef and dairy producing areas that are currently outside the operation of the scheme. able member's question is as follows: (1) The current campaign is applicable to the resources needed for expansion of the Campaign whole of Australia. Due to progress made throughout the continent. Particular attention is through past efforts of States, to differences in being given to the problem of tuberculosis in beef prevalence of each disease in various parts of the cattle herds of northern Australia. continent, to limitations in the availability of trained manpower, and to other factors, the nature and extent of the action so far taken in even greater emphasis through the recent United the campaign varies from State to State and States gazettal of restrictions on the import of within States. Broadly the position is: (a) TuberculosisTasmania is virtually free of the disease. Dairy herds in the dairying districts of east and southern Australia and beef herds in pastoral South Australia are under regular herd test. In the following parts of Australia, beef cattle herds thought (as a result of traceback from meat works) to be infected are tuberculin testedNew South Wales, Victoria and the South-Western Pastoral Division of Western Australia. The following parts of Australia are not presently covered by tuberculin testingWestern Queensland, Northern Territory (with the exception Western Australia (with the exception of the South-Western Pastoral Division). (b) BrucellosisTasmania is virtually free of the disease. In New South Wales, Western Australia and Northern Territory, blood sampling at slaughter is used to identify infected herds. Queensland proposes to adopt a similar practice. As a result of this and other experience, the following areas of Australia are not under active scrutiny for brucellosis as they are believed to be virtually freeCape York Peninsula, Northern Territory (with the exception of the Barkly Tableland), Kimberley Pastoral Division of Western Australia. Widespread vaccination campaigns are being conducted throughoutCoastal Queensland, coastal New South Wales, Barkly Tablelands, the whole of Victoria and South Australia. In the South-Western Pastoral Division of Western Australia, the Campaign has already advanced to the stage where it has been possible to move to brucellosis eradication by test and slaughter.

In the light of that United States action, the decision was taken here to prohibit the export of such meat in any form from Australia to any destination. The Australian Meat Board has made submissions about the problems facing the cattle industry following that decision. The submission includes proposals for an Australia-wide scheme for compensation against loss occasioned by bovine tuberculosis. Graziers organisations have made similar representations.

301,Mr Wentworth,"The answer to the honthe former Cambodian Consul-General in Melbourne. It was decided that it would not be proper for the Australian Government to intervene in the domestic affairs of another State.

However, it has been general practice by a private person who is interested in such matfor many years for references to the Board to ters. Should private bodies or persons wish to be made under Section 15 of the Tariff Board form such an organisation then it is, of course, Act as a whole, which includes (Section 15 (1) (h)) open to them to do so. If such a body were the question of whether a manufacturer was taking undue advantage of the protection afforded by the Tariff in regard to charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods or acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public.

National Health Act (Question No. 4946) Mr Keogh asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What amount was paid by the Commonwealth to Queensland (a) under the 'National Health Act as subsidies for both insured and uninsured occupied beds in public wards in Queensland public hospitals during 1969-70 and (b) under the amended National Health Act as a result of the requirement to pay a full $2 subsidy on all occupied beds during 1970-71. (2) What is tbe estimated difference between the amount paid under the amended Act during Civilian Workers' (Lombrum) 1970-71 and the amount which would have been paid if the amendment had not been made. able member's question is as follows: (1) (a) During 1969-70 there were three rates of Commonwealth hospital benefits paid on behalf of patients who received treatment in free public ward beds of public hospitals in Queensland. First, a benefit of $2.00 a day was paid for by the hospital benefits funds. A separate figure of the expenditure involved with this benefit for public hospitals is not available in respect of 1969-70. However, $666,642 was expended in respect of insured patients occupying free beds in both public and private hospitals. It can be assumed that the greater proportion of this expenditure was in respect of public hospitals. Second, a benefit of $5.00 a day was paid for pensioner patients who were enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Service. 'Expenditure of $4,132,574 was involved with this benefit. Third, a benefit of 80 cents a day was paid for the remaining uninsured patients who were not enrolled in ithe Pensioner Medical Service. A separate expenditure figure in respect of uninsured patients treated in free public ward beds is not available for 1969-70. However, the expenditure during 1969-70 for uninsured patients treated in public, intermediate and private ward beds was $764,009. (b) On 1st July 1970, as a result of an amendment to the National 'Health Act, a Commonwealth hospital benefit at the rate of $2.00 a day was introduced in respect of all non-pensioner patients, whether insured or uninsured, receiving free treatment in approved hospitals. Insofar as patients occupying free public ward beds are concerned, this benefit replaced the benefits outlined above in respect of insured patients treated in free public ward beds and uninsured patients. Total Commonwealth expenditure in 1970-71 by way of the new benefit introduced on 1st July 1970, in respect of non-pensioner patients occupying free public ward beds in public hospitals was $2,188,580. (2) $988,543. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 4524) Mr Hayden asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What was the cost to the Commonwealth of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in each of the last 10 years. (2) What was the (a) increased cost and (b> increased cost expressed as a percentage in each year compared with the preceding year. (3) Of the increased cost in each year, what was the (a) amount and (b) percentage due to (i) increased population, (ii) new items added to-",120,External Students Enrolled At Australian Unrversities
313,Dr Forbes,"The answer to the honourthe Scheme, (iii) relaxation of prescribing arrangements and (iv) any abnormal seasonal additional costs such as upsurge in winter compounding. (4) What was the Commonwealth expenditure in each year when the cost of items mentioned in part (3) of the question is subtracted from the total in part (1). (5) What was the (a) increased amount and (b) percentage increase in Commonwealth expenditure in each year when the subtraction in part (4) is carried out, using as the base the amount of Commonwealth expenditure for the preceding year as detailed in part (2) of the question. able member's question is as follows: (1) The cost to the Commonwealth of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in each of the last ten years wasYear ended 30 June 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 (2) Increased cost over previous Year ended 30 June 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 (3), <4) and (5) Information sought in (3), (4) and (5) of the question is not available in the form requested for the following reasons: (a) The cost of benefit drugs provided through public hospitals and miscellaneous services is re-imbursed to the appropriate authorities on a basis which does not require a record to be kept of the costs of separate drugs or prescription volume. It is therefore not practicable, to assess increased cost, in each year due to (i) increased population (ii) new items added to the scheme and (iii) relaxation of prescribing arrangements under this section of Commonwealth expenditure. (b) Changes in the schedules of benefits, including the addition of new items and relaxation of prescribing arrangements, are introduced at varying stages during each financial year. The effect of such changes, in the year of introduction is therefore not a true reflection of the overall impact on costs. Records of changes in the schedule of benefits have been maintained on a total cost basis, including the patient contribution and not on a basis of Commonwealth expenditure, (c) Changes in the schedule of benefits necessary to provide a service aligned with modern developments in the field of medicine have made it impracticable to assess separately, with an acceptable degree of accuracy, the effect of heavy prescribing, arising from abnormally severe seasonal conditions. Although records are not available which would enable provision of answers in the precise form requested, the following tables contain closely related information.

(4) If the information sought in parts (2) and (3) is not available to the Department of Health, tralia became a member of the Organisation for will the Minister take urgent action to obtain it. able member's question is as follows: '(1) The number of medical practitioners recogthe United States of America and West Germany nised as specialists and consultant physicians for and as it is at present doing in Belgium, Canada the purposes of the National Health Act as at 31st and Turkey. December 1971 is as follows: (i) Specialists (a) STATES New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania (b) TERRITORIES Australian Capital Territory Northern-Territory (2) (a) The National Health Act provides for the recognition of specialists solely for the purposes of payment for referred patients of higher rates of benefits. The Act provides that recognition shall be determined having regard to a medical practitioner's 'qualifications, experience and standing in .the medical profession and the nature of his practice'. The question of whether a medical practitioner is practising full-time or part-time Additional in his speciality is not an essential factor in the costs cost consideration of whether or not he is granted $'000 recognition as a specialist. 1,350 Furthermore, the Act provides for the automatic 2,453 recognition of those medical practitioners registered as specialists under a law of a State. Tbe 1,419 criteria adopted by the State authorities for the 417 registration of specialists vary and, as is the case 864 with the Commonwealth, part-time or full-time 1,982 practise in a particular speciality is not an essen2,148 tial factor in the registration. 1,477 Accordingly, information as to the number of 1,850 recognised specialists who also practise as general 8,588 practitioners is not available. (b) The position in regard to consultant physicians differs from that of specialist in that only the National Health Act provides for the recognition of medical practitioners as consultant physicians and recognition is granted on the basis of exclusive engagement in the practise of a speciality of internal medicine. The number of medical practitioners recognised as consultant physicians is set out in '(1) (a) (ii) and (1) (b) (ii) above. (3 This information is not available. (4) No. In view of (2) above it is not practical to obtain this information. and Development (Question No. 4980) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: What steps, if any, have been taken since AusEconomic Co-operation and Development in June 1971 for the organisation to review educational polin Australia as it has already done in Sweden, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, France, Italy, Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the (u) honourable member's question is as folConsultant lows: physicians No steps have yet been taken for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 1,900 453 to review educational policy in Australia.

315,Dr Forbes,"The answer to the honouricywith the Organisation's varied activities in education and in determining the areas in which Australian participation would be most valuable. Until such over-all assessments are made and priorities established, and any new forms of review established as a result of the current discussions within the Organisation are known, it would be premature for a decision to be made on the question of Australian participation in the programme of country educational policy reviews. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Question No. 4981) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: What steps, if any, have been taken since Australia became a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in June 1971 for the Organisation to review national science policy in Australia as it has already done in Sweden, Greece, Belgium, France, Britain, West Germany, Japan, the United States of America, Italy and Canada and as it is at present doing in Ireland and the Netherlands. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The OECD has recently concluded an examination of tbe directions that its future activities should take in relation to science and technology in Member countries. The Organisation is now planning to give greater emphasis to studies of selected aspects of science and technology which are of mutual interest and importance to a group of its Member countries. It appears that less emphasis will be given in future to studying in isolation the scientific and technological situation in individual Member countries. The activities of the OECD in relation to science and technology are being kept under review. Continuing assessment will be made of their relevance and expected value to the development of science and senting the Minister for Health, upon technology in Australia. Cigarette Smoking (Question No. 5022) Mr Hayden asked the Minister repreelected contributor representative on their governsenting the Minister for Health, upon ing notice: (1) Did the Minister state in reply to question the area concerned in each case; if not, what No. 3790 (Hansard, 9th November 1971, page 3202) other method was used. that the preliminary findings of Professor Ford's survey support medical evidence accepted by the the election of contributor representatives to their Government that cigarette smoking has a causal governing bodies. relationship with carcinoma of the lung.

If so, the answer is yes. 14211/72-R-[129 ] well as making demands on expensive health services, and are there also indirect social costs caused by the distress, disorganisation and other tensions imposed on families of persons affected by terminal carcinoma of the lung. (5) Is it a fact that life insurance premium rates are higher because of the higher incidence of mortality among smokers as a result of this habit and because of the practice of insurance companies of not discriminating between smokers and non-smokers in striking premium rates charged. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) In Australia, 3,244 persons died from lung cancer in 1970. This represents a mortality rate of 2S.9 deaths per 100,000 of mean population. It is not possible to assess the influence of smoking on this mortality rate with any certainty. (3) The Department of Health is aware of the content of authoritative reports such as those of the Royal College of Physicians of London and the United States Surgeon-General, and the relevant recommendations of the World Health Organisation. In a report to the Twenty-Third World Health Assembly in 1970 the main relationships revealed by prospective studies between smoking habits and mortality from all causes were presented. This report stated that the risk of developing lung cancer in heavy smokers is 13-30 times greater than in non-smokers. The risk of lung cancer was stated to increase directly in relation to the number of cigarettes smoked. (4) Yes. (3) This is a matter for insurance companies and I am unable to say whether premiums are affected by the factors mentioned.

Contributors to friendly society funds need not become members of a lodge or branch of the society itself, but members of the society are generally contributors to the society's funds.

A Gazette of 2nd December 1971, comparing the economic and social burdens of alcoholism with those of typhoid in an earlier age. (2) If so, will he provide similar statistics for Australia. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) While information specifically similar is not available for Australia, the following related information eould be of interest to the honourable member. In a comprehensive survey on alcoholism presented to the 29th International Congress on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence at Sydney in 1970, research participants stated that, in Australia, within the age group 15 years and over, approximately 80 per cent of men*, and 70 per cent of women* drink alcoholic beverages. It further showed that, within the same age group, 5 per cent of men and 1 per cent of women were estimated to be alcoholics. In an article published in 1968 in the October issue of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Sociology, an eminent research sociologist referred to New South Wales and stated that, during 1967, admissions and re-admissions for alcoholism to psychiatric centres and hospitals amounted to 21.7 per cent of all psychiatric admissions.? A substantial number of alcoholics are to be found amongst the patients of general hospitals. Some expert observers in surveys conducted in Australia during the last 10 years have judged that between 10 per cent and 14 per cent of adult medical admissions to general and private hospitals would have a basic alcoholic problem.t * From proceedings of-29t h International Congress Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (pages 12-13 Speaker: Dr Rankin. fThe Aust.

Medical and Hospital Benefits Funds (Question No. 5072) DrK Bugman, asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (.1) What are the names of the 2 (a) medical and (b) hospital benefits organisations in each State with the greatest membership. (2) Which of these organisations make provision in their constitutions for the election of contributor representatives to their governing bodies. (3) In each of the organisations what is the number of (a) people and (b) elected contributor representatives on their governing body. able member's question is as follows: (1) The2 medical and hospital benefits organisations with the largest memberships in each State are: New South WalesMedical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited The Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia VictoriaThe Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria The Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows* QueenslandMedical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited The Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows* South AustraliaThe Mutual Hospital Association Limited National Health Services Association* Western AustraliaThe Hospital Benefit Fund of Western Australia Incorporated Friendly Societies Health Services* TasmaniaMedical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited St Luke's Medical and Hospital Benefits Association. (* Friendly Society funds). (2) The constitutions of the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria and the National Health Services Association in South Australia make specific provision for the election of contributor representatives to their governing bodies. In respect of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited, the Articles of Association do not provide for the election of contributor representatives but do provide for the appointment of contributory members as contributors' representatives on its Council (the governing body). This Council comprises 24 persons, 12 of whom are contributors' representatives. It is the practice of the St Lukes Medical and Hospital Benefits Association that 3 Directors retire each year and their vacancies are filled by election at the annual general meeting of contributors. However, this is not specifically provided for in its Constitution. As regards friendly societies, the general procedure followed for the election of office bearers ensures contributor representatives can be elected. Although in friendly societies, contributors to medical and/or hospital funds need not become members of a lodge or branch of the society, usually all members of a society are contributors to the medical and hospital Funds. The usual procedure for election of office bearers to friendly societies is that members of each branch or lodge elect a delegate or delegates",125,Restrictions Controlling The Use Of Drugs As Benefit Items

Health Insurance Scheme (Question No. 5296) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that free outpatient treatment in the Australian Capital Territory is provided according to a means test. (2) If so, what are the details of the means test. (3) Under the subsidised health insurance scheme, would a man supporting a wife and 6 children and paying rent or housing repayments at the rate of $10 a week from a wage of $72 a week be excluded from any benefits of the scheme, but be entitled to free public hospital outpatient treatment in the A.CT. (4) If so, what is the basis on which the subsidised health insurance scheme means test has been constructed and why is it at sharp variance with the means test establishing eligibility for free outpatient treatment in the Canberra Hospital. (5) Will the Minister study the comparatively liberal means test applied by State Governments in determining eligibility for free treatment in (a) an outpatients clinic and (b) a public ward of a State public hospital as set out in the answer to question No. 4356 (Hansard, 7th March 1972, pages 658-60). (6) Has his attention been drawn to figures given by the Treasurer in answer to Question No. 4162 (Hansard, 7th December 1971, page 4254) which show that only about 3,100 or 0.2 per cent of the nation's adult male wage earners were earning in May 1971 the weekly income which qualifies a family for free health insuance under (7) If the Minister is concerned at the small test which is now denying assistance to tens of thousands of families.

(2) A person, normally resident in the Australian Capital Territory, and his dependants are 8.7 1.1 9.8 entitled to free outpatient treatment at the 6.6 0.7 7.3 Canberra Hospital if the balance of the person's 2.7 0.2 2.9 gross income remaining after making certain 2.6 0.3 2.9 deductions is equal to or less than a prescribed 2.0 0.1 2.1 wage. Deductions allowable are: 0.67 0.05 0.72 (a) for dependants-the amounts specified in 25.7 sub-section (2) of section 82B of the 2.4 Income Tax Assessment Act, 1936-1971; and (b) for house rent or repayment-the amount to be actual and not exceeding the average rent for government-owned rental dwellings as advised by the A.C.T. Assistant Secretary (Housing), Department of the Interior. Should a person not qualify under these provisions he may still be considered having regard to the following circumstances: (i) periods of any recent hospitalisation and cost of treatment; (ii) illness among other members of the family; and costs of treatment; and (iii) unemployment or loss of wages through illness. These conditions do not extend to dental treatment provided at the Hospital. (3) Yes. (4) The income limit applying to low income families under the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan, in respect of free health insurance, is based on the average minimum wage payable under Commonweaalth awards in the various States. In determining eligibility for free health insurance, no deductions are allowed from the gross weekly income amount. With regard to assessing eligibility for free outpatient treatment at Canberra Hospital, certain deductions, as described earlier in this answer, are made from a person's gross income to determine a net figure. If this figure is equal to or less than the wage prescribed for a 'Labourer not otherwise specified', employed under the Miscellaneous Workers (A.C.T.) Award 1968, the person involved will qualify for the full outpatient treatment. (5) I am aware of the means test referred to. (6) Yes.

(2) Will this difference exaggerate the differences among the States in common fee schedules for medical benefit subsidy purposes or will these schedules in the various States approximate each other leading to even greater disparities in observance of common fees among the States. (3) Will the periodic review of the schedules be influenced by consumer prices and State price fixing legislation which may have also influenced the extent of common fee observance. able member's question is as follows: (1) Generally speaking, yes. However, there are some services for which greater levels of observance are recorded in States other than South Australia and Western Australia. (2) No. (3) Consumer prices (in index form) are one of various economic and other considerations, which have relevance in the periodic review of fees recommended by the Australian Medical Association to its members and the periodic review of medical benefits by the Government.

Number of Medical Practitioners Graduating in Australia (Question No. 5597) Mr Calwell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Can the Minister say whether Russia graduates 30,000 fully qualified medical practitioners a year which is equivalent to one doctor for every 7,800 people in the USSR. (2) Is it a fact that Australia is graduating only 1,000 fully qualified medical practitioners a year which is equivalent to one doctor for every 13,000 people in Australia. (3) If so, can he indicate any reasons why Australia lags so far behind the USSR in graduating medical practitioners. (4) Can he say whether the Australian Medical Association believes that Australia is producing (a) too many doctors or (b) not enough doctors, or whether it supports a plan to graduate just enough medical practitioners annually so as to preserve the present low ratio between doctors and patients as a result of which doctors from India and Pakistan are being imported to fill our current need for more medical practitioners. (5) Have the Government or the universities in the various States any plans to facilitate the training of at least 1,000 more medical graduates a year. (6) Why was this problem not given greater priority at least 10 years ago. able .member's question is as follows: (1) Detailed information is not available concerning the number of fully qualified medical practitioners graduating yearly in the USSR. It is noted, however, that a report on 'Post graduate Education for Medical Personnel in the USSR', published by the World Health Organisation in 1970, indicated that over 30,000 doctors, stomatologists and pharmacists graduate each year in the USSR (2) In 1971, 893 students graduated as MB.BS from medical schools in Australia. (3) See (1) and (2) above. The need for newly graduated medical practitioners is dependent on a number of factors such as the current availability ot manpower, not only in the medical, but in the paramedical professions; the health facilities available; morbidity in the population; and the system",141,Local Government Authorities Revenue Debt Charges And Percentage Of Debt Charges To Revenue 1968 6 9

The need for a further expansion of training facilities is currently being examined by a committee of the Australian Universities Commission. Nhnmo Committee (Question No. 5606) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: When did the Government (a) decide and (b) announce that it would not proceed with the Nimmo Committee's recommendation that a National Health Insurance Commission be established (Hansard, 15th October 1970, page 2193; Senate Hansard, 7th March 1972, page 476). able member's question is as follows: In the reply to Question No. 1348 by Senator Poke (Senate Hansard, 7th March 1972, page 476) the honourable senator was informed that the Government does not intend to implement the Nimmo Committee's recommendation that such a Commission be established. Similar information was provided in reply to the honourable member's Question No. 3955 (Hansard, 12th April 197% page 1568). It is not considered appropriate to disclose when this decision was made. Companies Registered in Norfolk Island (Question No. 5649) Mr CaiweD asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Were 1,571 companies registered in Norfolk Island at 1st January 1972 and 1,531 on 3rd March 1972. (2) Are all these companies registered in Norfolk Island for the purpose of evading taxation. (3) Can he say whether Vila is another tax in the statistics tabulated for the 1968-69 income evasion haven. (4) Is it a fact that the Reserve Bank has deductions are at present available) amounted to placed no insurmountable barriers to the moveapproximately $235m. The cost to income tax revment of capital or funds because these are chanenue of allowing these deductions is estimated to nelled to other places; if not, what is the real be about $70m. position. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. A relatively small number of companies, locally financed and operating normal comstatistics which classify into a number of mercial enterprises, have registered to obtain the categories the numbers of persons attending normal benefits of incorporation and not for taxavarious educational institutions. Also, numbers of tion avoidance purposes. A smaller number of children for whom education expenses were companies-subsidiarie s or branches of large nonallowed in respect of the 1968-69 income year are commercial convenience rather than tax avoidance. The Commissioner of course applies the provisions of the law to stop in any way possible tax avoidance through Norfolk Island. Also the Government has under consideration some proposals for additional measures in relation to Norfolk Island. (3) There is strong evidence that the New Hebrides are emerging as a tax haven. (4) For Australian exchange control purposes, Norfolk Island is part of Australia. Accordingly, control is not exercised over the movements of funds to that Island. Transfers of Australian or foreign currency from anywhere in Australia or its Territories to any overseas country are subject to exchange control which is administered on behalf of the Government by the Reserve Bank. Such transfers are permitted only where the purpose of the transfer is in accordance with Government policy. This would include the making of a payment that is genuinely due to an overseas resident, the withdrawal by such a resident of his Australian funds which he has acquired in an acceptable manner, or the making of an investment which is in accord with the policy on investment overseas by Australian residents to which I referred in my statement of 22nd February 1972. Tax Concessions for Educational Expenses (Question No. 5667) Mr Solomon asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What sum in tax concessions was granted in respect of taxpayers' educational expenses in the latest financial year for which figures are available. (2) What proportions of the total related to education at (a) State schools and (b) independent schools. (3) How many taxpayers were involved in each category. (4) If thesefiguresare not available, what alternative means can be employed to adduce comparable statistics. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Deductions allowed for education expenses in the assessments of taxable individuals included year (the latest year for which statistics of these (2) and (3) Statistics of deductions allowed for expenses are not classified by type of school or other educational institutions attended by the child or dependent in respect of whom the expenses were incurred.

Paramedical Services (Question No. 5668) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) When was a working party established in the Department of Health to examine the question of the inclusion of paramedical services within the scope of the National Health Scheme. (2) What paramedical services are being examined. (3) When will this examination be completed and a report presented to the Department. able member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) An examination concerning the inclusion of paramedical services within the scope of the National Health Scheme was commenced in the Department of Health following the Government announcement of its decisions on recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance (Nimmo Committee). I announced in the House in June 1970 that all paramedical services would be objectively examined and priorities determined to enable decisions to be taken by the Government to include specific types in the Scheme. There is a wide range of paramedical services, including physiotherapy, optometry,home nursing, chiropody, speech therapy, etc. Because of the diverse nature of these services and the inter-relaapproved private hospitals, according to bed size tionships between them and medical and hospital treatment and Commonwealth and State financial arrangements, it will be appreciated that there are many implications associated with introduction of insurance benefits in this area which must all be given full consideration. The examination is proceeding but at this stage I cannot indicate when it will be completed.

Cigarette Smoking (Question No. 5719) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) As the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations claims that surveys show adult and peer behaviour is the main influence inducing children to smoke, will the Minister arrange for his Department to undertake or sponsor a similar survey to find what influences adults and children to stop smoking, or collate and publish existing findings on this subject. (2) As the Federation further claims that cigarette consumption rose after a ban on television advertising when advertising expenditure in other media rose, will the Minister publish especially findings which refer to other advertising media. (3) Will the Minister also publish replies to the 15 questions, quoted in the Federation's last annual report, from the United States House of Representatives. able member's question is as follows: (1) I understand that the 1971-72 Annual tors and (b) the Commonwealth Government durReport of the Federation of Australian Commering the latest 12 months period for which figures cial Television Stations contains statements along are available. the lines suggested by the honourable member. The statements are based upon a review of the world literature on this subject, current in 1966, the same period. which was made as a preliminary to a survey of the smoking habits of Australian schoolchildren, est available date. conducted by an hoc sub-committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council Fund to consolidated revenue since the Fund and published by Council in 1969. They do not came into operation; if so, what was the sura refer to the results of the Australian study. The involved. $ full text of the sub-committee's conclusions, which generally support the literature review, is as 28,969,983 follows: 10,848,304 (i) Smoking prevalence varies widely from 2,836,443 school to school and from group to group and depends on many factors including local community conditions. 42,654,730 (ii) There is an initial stage of experimentation in smoking. Some children do not progress beyond this stage while others persist in experimentation until, at a variable time interval, a state of true dependence or habituation is reached. (iii) This study suggests that smoking patterns and attitudes set by parents are important. Parental disapproval has an effect on the smoking behaviour of children and the attention of parents needs to be drawn to the fact that they can have a positive effect on their children's smoking status. (iv) Awareness of the health risks involved in valu smoking was the nio&t powerful influence in those children who gave up smoking. Regular smokers were certainly as well informed as the non-smokers of the hazards involved in smoking. Health education campaigns have produced a tolerably wellinformed community among school children, but smoking among school children is still alarmingly high. (v) The Sub-Committee does not see mass communications as an area where it is competent to undertake investigation but there are a number of unanswered questions in this field, the most important being whether the role of mass communications with regard to smoking is one of initiation or one of reinforcement.

Council has recomSection 76A (fi) specifies that the report shall mended that these strips should bear the following include 'details of how the reserves of the fund warning: have been invested'. I have recently tabled the report in respect of the 1970-71 financial year. No regulations have been promulgated in relation to investments by health insurance organisations. On 27th October 1971, in answer to a question asked by Senator Willesee, the Minister for Health summarised the policy adopted in regard to investments made by health insurance organisations. The following is the text of the reply the contributions from contribuMinister gave on that occasionThe reserves of medical and hospital benefits organisations are held in various forms. These include cash at bank, short term money market, bank fixed deposits, Commonwealth bonds and inscribed stock, semi-government bonds, local government shares, debentures and mortgages. Most funds hold a very high proportion of their reserves in trustee type investments. The various types of investments held are such that sufficient funds are always available to meet any contingencies in regard to the payment of claims. While there has been some investment in industrial type stock by some $ organisations, these have generally yielded satis52,636,000 factory results. .. .. 1,205,770 The Government examined the question of the investment policies of organisations when considering the recommendations made by the Commonwealth Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance (Nimmo report). It concluded that funds had generally exercised a proper sense of responsibility in the assessment of reserves and that non-trustee investments have provided good returns to the advantage of contributors. The Government therefore decided that the policies followed by organisations in regard to investments should continue without the imposition of specific restrictions'. (Senate Hansard, pages 1485-1486). Insect Control (Question No. 5787) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (.1) Is it a fact that the Australian Consumers Association has published information which that pest strip type Insect control devices are dangerous to human health. (2) If so, and as these claims are of concern to many people, has an examination of the safety of these devices been carried out by any Government (3) If an examination has not been carried out, will the Minister take steps to ensure that this is done. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes.

Council has also recommended a tolerance of 2ppm for dichlorvos in fruits, grains and vegetables. Shipping (Question No. 5807) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that Australian built vessels are priate. The report and its recommendations are now laid up while overseas owned vessels are operating under charter as a consequence of a permit issued by him under Section 286 (l)(b) of the Navigation Act. (2) Is it also a fact that as a consequence of bis action the 'Iron Somersby' is the centre of an industrial dispute which couid lead to a national shipping strike. (3) Does the Government agree with the contention of the Maritime Unions that Australian ships now laid up should be used for the transport of iron ore in preference to foreign owned ships. (4) Will he give his reasons for issuing a permit to Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd to operate the 'Iron Somersby' when Australian built and subsidised vessels belonging to the Commonwealth are idle. able member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) and (3) As Standing Orders provide that questions which call for an expression of opinion should not be asked, I must refrain from providing an answer. (4) A single voyage permit was issued to 'Iron Somersby' on 6th January 1972 for the carriage of ore from Port Hedland to Port Kembla. It would have been unreasonable to refuse the issue of a permit to this vessel when a coasting trade licence was to be issued to it a short time later. Handicapped Persons (Question No. 5808) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) When will the House debate the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare in respect of mentally and Labour and National Service, upon physically handicapped persons.

The Senate rejected in (0 each State and Territory and (u) debated the report on 11th May 1972. (2) The report ol .he Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare in respect of mentally and physically handicapped persons is very far reaching in its implications for both the Commonwealth and the States, and the recommendations of the report cover a wide range of issues which could affect questions of major policy in several Commonwealth Departments. The Commonwealth already provides substantial assistance in many of the areas covered by the recommendations of the report. The recommendations disclose certain areas where, in the opinion of the Senate Standing Committee, further Governmental assistance, both Commonwealth and State, would be approreceiving, and will continue to receive, serious consideration. Northern Ireland (Question No. 5811) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) What was the basis of the reference made to Northern Ireland in the annex to the ministerial statement of 9th May 1972 on Australian foreign policy. (2) Has he sought the views of the British and Irish Governments. (3) Have these Governments put their points of view to the Australian Government; if so, when and in what form. (4) If no expressions of views have been sought or given, what assurance is there that the reference is completely adequate and not one-sided. MrN . H .

However, it is not practicable to provide readily a reliable quantitative estimate of those immediate effects. As the terms of the honourable member's question imply, double taxation agreements have longer-term effects also-however , these too do not easily lend themselves to the processes of identification and quantification. Pre-school Education (Question No. 5853) Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Will he bring up to date and consolidate the information which he and his 2 predecessors have obtained from his Department, the Statistician and the Commonwealth Grants Commission on comparative State expenditure on pre-school eduVic.
