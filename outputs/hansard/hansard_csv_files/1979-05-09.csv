The fact that the whole, although their concern and their remarks Government has now taken a decision which were directed mainly at Howard Rotavator Pty does not provide additional short term assistance Ltd, the beneficiary of the bounty enshrined in to Norton Villiers to my mind completely gives this Bill.

For example, I was asand references made by speakers on the other tounded to hear the chief spokesman for the Opside of the House. position on the Bill, the honourable member for Adelaide, refer to this small engine firm in Ballarat as Norman Villiers.
