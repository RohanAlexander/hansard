I believe that a great many of these offences could be dealt with by ""a magistrate, and that the class tained is not, from his training, of the standing secured from a Justice of the High Court. wish to take is that what the Attorney General desires to do under this clause is to obtain proof of a contract, the existence of which is suspected. Without actual proof, he desires to assume the existence in all cases of a contract unless the contrary is proved. The intent must be proved, but that does not carry us very far, because in the bulk of cases intent will ba assumed by the Court, and it is left to the defendant to show that there is no intent. Uncier this clause a mere charge of the existence of a contract will be evidence of its exist[325] ence unless proof to the contrary is givem If there is such a strong suspicion as to I do not think that justify the intervention of the Comptroller General, there should be equally strong grounds to justify the issue of a High Court writ. When a High Court writ is issued, the most elaborate kind of inquiries may be made by way of interrogatories. These interrogatories must be replied to on oath by the parties charged, who must answer ""Yes,"" or "" No , "" as to whether the facts alleged are true. If there is anything in the shape of perjury, the usual criminal prosecution may follow.

This is an extraordinary travesty on parliamentary Government, legislation being enacted by the Government alone, with the help of one or two supporters. As a producer, I desire to put an end to trusts which are inimical to business; but I think that the Act should be tried, and proved inefficient, before further powers are given. The honourable* member for Fawkner has made a charge against the Attorney-General which should not be made. He inferential ly accuses the Minister of making a mis-statement regarding the cases inquired into by the Department, and asks him to test the Act before demanding additional powers. But the Attorney-General has told us that the officers of the Crown have made inquiries and are satisfied that the Act is not efficient. Sir JOHN tested it? in which the right honprable member held positions of responsibility, he was always prepared to accept the advice of expert officers, unless he had very good reasons for not doing so. loyal tp his officers, or more ready to defend them, than he was. therefore, that, were he in the position of the Attorney-General, he would be adopting the same attitude. question of law. is not always infallible. one can always get two opinions. The advice of the law officers of the Crown is dictated, not by hope of fee or reward, but in the honest discharge of their duties to their employer. The honourable member for Fawkner will not accept the statement of the Minister that cases have been inquired into. Does he wish the honourable and learned gentleman to give proof of his bona fides by mentioning the names of the persons concerned, their trades or occupations, and the offences alleged to have been committed? The Minister has done well in refusing to be drawn on this subject. AlthoughI asked for further information, I am now convinced that he acted properly in declining to give it. I accept Sis assurance that cases have been inquired into by the best experts which the Department has at its command.

We do not desire that the innocent shall be haled before the Courts to demonstrate the inefficiency of the Act.

The Postmaster-General of the day seized the second set, but had the weakness to hand it on, unopened, to the defendant. The late Mr Justice Molesworth tried the case, and my .recollection is that, when it was argued that the defendant was not called on to prove his innocence, he replied: "" T h a t is true; but the production of invoices in his possession would prove his innocence beyond doubt, if he be innocent, and I cannot understand an innocent man failing to produce .the proofs of his innocence when he has it in his power to do so."" The invoices not being produced, the jury disagreed, and the prosecution was dropped. It seems to me that „ any man knowing himself to be innocent, and having documentary proofs of his innocence, would be only too glad to produce them, instead of relying on the chances of an acquittal. In these cases the innocent party desires a verdict of not guilty, not a conclusion to the trial equivalent to the recording of a verdict of not proven. The honourable member for Angas seems to have overlooked the fact that in the cases coming under this measure the defendant would meet interrogatories with the reply that in answering them he might incriminate himself. That position has already arisen. General v. Simpson, the defendant, by his answer, set up his right to protect himself from pains, penalties, and forfeitures, by refusing to make specific answer to the information and interrogatories. held that in order to entitle the plaintiff to the relief claimed, it would be necessary to prove facts by reason of which the defendant would incur a forfeiture of the land under section 128 of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868, and be liable to a prosecution for misdemeanour under sections 127 and 129.

He pointed out that, under proposed new section 15c, the complaint has to be.made on oath in writing before the Comptroller-General can act, and he suggested that there should be the same preliminary required under proposed new section 15B. But it must not be forgotten that under proposed new section 15B, the. Comptroller-General merely asks certain questions, and requires the production of certain documents for inspection. The answers to those questions and the inspection of the documents may enable a person to swear that an offence has been committed, and consequently a complaint has to be made on oath in writing under proposed new section 15c, before documents can be required to be handed over. I suggest that the honourable member should move to amend proposed new section 15B so as to provide that a complaint must be made in writing' before the Comptjroller-General takes action. The complaint could not in that case be made on oath.

If the Magistrate had simply convicted without making any statement of his opinion, we could not have upset the conviction, because it might have been that the Magistrate was not satisfied with the defendant's evidence, and if the defendant's evidence was unsatisfactory, I think the Magistrate 'could have relied.on the provisions of the section and given effect to the section.

The judgment of Mr Justice Stephen proceedsWe are not No doubt prosecutions often fai l owing to the difficulty of proving the Crown case, and section 144 has been passed in order to obviate these difficulties, and to allow the information, or even a mere declaration or claim to be primd facie proof of the offence, which, but for the existence of the Statute, would have to be proved by oral evidence. I think, however, that where evidence is given it is still the Magistrate's duty to say whether he is or is not satisfied that the charge has been proved. In the 1 present case, extraordinary as it may appear, the Magistrate was not satisfied with the oral evidence given by the prosecution, yet he harked back to section 144 of the Excise Act, and convicted.

I quite sympathize with honourable members who do not desire to make repressive laws or do anything to interfere with the liberty of the subject. At the same time, all financial and industrial organizations receive from Parliament their power to iperate, and those powers may be revoked, at the will of Parliament. .

After the meeting in the cab, the orders of the Beef Trust used to go forth, and. if five.or six clever business men can meet together and arrange these matters by signs and symbols, how shall we prevent them? The Beef Trust has demoralized the United StatesWhen the to such an extent that every dog when he passes a butcher's shop stops and wags his tail, because he recognises a friend inside in the sausage, and he knows that some day he will be there. The honofable member for Illawarra contends that the Tariff creates trusts in America. But I understand, though I am not quite sure, that there is no duty on kerosene. of the source of supply. Trust is the greatest trust the world ever knew, and it ran the United States Government until Roosevelt became President. Those desperate men, who, as President Roosevelt says, have the genius to create these trusts, cannot be crushed by means of any little Simple-Simon legislation. There must be the power of the nation behind the movement, and, indeed, in my opinion, some of these men will have to be killed before we can succeed. The vast multitude of business men are honest; but I may say that in an election in South Australia.

A Judge who has to decide all questions of fact gives his reasons for arriving at a certain decision, and his judgment, as a rule, is beyond question. scuring the real point at issue. In the case in question, the magistrate could have announced his decision without giving reasons for it. He might, without comment, have arrived at the conclusion that he was not satisfied with the guilt of the defendant, and that, in accordance with the practice in British courts of justice, he should give him the benefit of the doubt, but that, having regard to the wording of the section of the Act under which the prosecution had been brought, he had no option but to convict. He could have arrived at that conclusion without expressing the reason for his decision, and had he done so the justices in the superior court, not being aware of what -was in his mind at the time, would have had to uphold his decision I am as anxious as is any honourable member that trusts should be put down. I do not think that any section of tlie House has a monopoly of the desire to defend the public interests from injurious attacks by combines and trusts. It is, I am sure, the honest desire of every honourable member to do what is fair and right to put down trusts in order that the public interests may be safeguarded; but in the effort to do so we must try as far as we can to avoid inflicting injustice by legal methods. It is because of such a desire that the Opposition suggests to the Minister a certain course, the adoption of which can do no harm, .but will un'doubtedly remove the element of serious injustice' which exists in the proposed section. delivered just now by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. He appears to be willing to support any Government proposal, irrespective of its justice or injustice. under our complex system of industry proposal is just, but will not go far enough. ber, at all events, is willing that one of the best known principles of British justicea principle that has come to be regarded as ""sacred-shoul d be disregarded in order that a conviction may be secured. which the honourable member objects appears in a dozen Acts. gross exaggeration of facts. It is all very well from the honourable member's point of -view, as long as it can be set in operation only against those whom he and those associated with him regard as their natural enemies. Buti f such a provision were put in operation against a union or a combine of an industrial character to which the honourable member might himself belong, I venture to say that his views would undergo a radical change At the outset he desired to condemn as injurious all combines and trusts, and challenged the Opposition to point to a beneficent one. When reminded of the existence of trusts like that in connection with the Newcastle coal mines, which members of the Labour Party, with whom the honourable member is associated, have always claimed to be a beneficent one, he shifted his ground. There may be a difference of opinion as to whether it is beneficial to the public that the price of an article of domestic use should be kept up by means of a combine, but there has been no doubt expressed by the Labour Party as to the beneficent character of the Coal Combine, which keeps up a monopoly price, with the special approval of the Labour Party, to the detriment of the public, who have to purchase coal from them. When this was pointed out to the honourable member, he changed his ground. Instead of condemning as injurious all trusts and combines, as he set out to do, he defended this and another combination, of which he is a member. There is no consistency in such an attitude. I refer to the incident, as showing how wonderfully flexible are the minds of some honourable members when they are called upon to view trusts and combines from an aspect in which they have either a political or personal interest. I was astonished at the speech As scon as they are associated with it, it loses its injurious character and becomes beneficent. I do not defend trusts and combines, though I recognise that, and commerce, there is a natural tendency, and in some cases, perhaps, justification, for certain combinations. As long as these combinations exist without injurious effect to the community, not much exception is to be taken to them. The difficulty is to know what combines or trusts are non-injurious.

Jew minutes, tried to get a legal definition -of prima facie evidence; but I can find only one which says that it is probably equivalent to sufficient evidence. Mr VV. H . IRVINE -The usual way of expressing what is ordinarily called prima facie evidence is to speak of '' proof until the contrary be proved."" the Bill' is the same as that of the Customs Act, under which there have been .hundreds of prosecutions without injustice or hardship. Is there any hardship, or anything contrary to British justice, in throwing the onus of proof on the defendant .in these cases? The rule of evidence is that where the subject-matter of a party's allegation is peculiarly within the knowledge of the other party, the obligation of 'disproving the affirmative is thrown upon him, although there are certain modifications which reduce the strength of that proposition. Phipson says thatJn many cases, however, the Legislature has now expressly thrown the burden of proving matters of defence which may be supposed to lie peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant upon the latter, e.g., under the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870, the burden is upon the builder of the ship to prove that he did not Jcnow she was employed in contravention of the Act. It is provided in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that' no employer shall dismiss an employee"" by reason merely of the fact that he is a member of an organization, and In any proceeding for any contravention of this section it shall lie upon the employer to show that any employee, proved to have been dismissed whilst an oflicer or member of an organization, or entitled as aforesaid, was dismissed for some reason other than those mentioned in this section. That was admitted to be just, because the cause of dismissal is in the mind of the man who dismisses, and when it is alleged that the employee"" has been dismissed for improper reasons, what hardship is there in calling upon the employer to declare his reasons ? say that, but it would be hard to prove it. made to the Arbitration Court by the employees under this section, Mr JusticeI f the averment is primd Higgins pointed out on the affidavits filed that, notwithstanding this provision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, they would have to be better prepared. If we wish to prosecute successfully, it will be necessary to iprove intent, and to adduce evidence of facts from which the Court will be able to infer intent. Mr W. H . IRVINE -And the proof of intent includes proofthat the restraint of trade is to the detriment of the public? in this provision, which is an absolutely necessary one, seeing that if we fail to obtain a knowledge of the contents of the agreements entered into by trading combinations, under the other clauses of the Bill we shall be in the position of shifting the burden of proof. There tre many other authorities which I might cite in this connection, some of which I mentioned last evening. But I may say that in the criminal law relating to coinage, to certain cases of forgery, and in the Explosive Substances Act, the principle of throwing the onus of proof of certain matters upon the defendant is distinctly recognised, because the matters to which it refers are matters within his knowledge, and it is easy for him to satisfy the Court of his innocence.

KELLY whether the averments are held to be proved in all essentials except so far as intent is concerned? a difficulty in view of the opinion expressed by the present Mr Justice Isaacs when a member of"" this House uoon the question of the ease of proving intent. I find that on the 19th June, 1906, in answer to an interjection of the honourable member for Gwydir, who saidWrongful intention would be pretty hard to prove, the late Attorney-General, who is at present a' Justice.of the High Court, saidI do not think so. The intention must be found from the necessary result of the acts at the time. The American Courts have not hesitated to infer intention from necessary results, and every man is presumed to intend the necessary results of his act. In view of that expression of opinion, I take it that this clause goes very much further than the Attorney-General has just indicated. If intent is such a simple matter to prove, the averments of the prosewhole offence. ber . wish the word "" in t e n t "" to be omitted ? understand its meaning. If it means what I think it does, it will be almost impossible to prove the guilt of a trust, and consequently it might very well be' eliminated. tice Isaacs thinks it means, this clause Atkinson, certainly goes very much further than Cook, Joseph the Attorney-General invited the ComKairbairn, G. mittee to go during the course of Forrest, Sir John his speech.

Law authorities examined the B ill caref u l l y, and were then of opinion that it would prove effective. If that be so, I cannot understand why the Attorney-General has not tested its validity. I think that he should have attempted to put its provisions into operation. Why should he wait upon the mere ipse dixit of one officer, who, however able he may be, is not infallible, and who only a few months previously was of the contrary opinion.

I agree that there are detrimental combines in the country, and that they are a growing evil. We do not blame those who take advantage ot this pluse of the capitalistic system, but Parliament will be to blame if the danger is allowed to go on and grow. The whole of this legislation"" is an innovation; but we pass measures to-day that forty years ago, or even twenty years ago, would not have been possible; and ten years hence there will be legislation that we should be afraid to touch now.

It is difficult to obtain information with respect to the operations of trusts unless it be secured from the parties interested.

The Government are unable, however, to take action against it under the principal Act, and the Attorney General now asks for these additional powers.

That amendment will not in any way lessen the powers given to the Government under the clause as it now stands; it merely proposes that they shall be exercised in the light of day and that there shall not be anything in the shape of Star Chamber proceedings. TheB ill relates to trusts, and in dealing with such gigantic combinations as the Government may have to cope with under this provision, the more publicity we have '.the ( better. . It is said that opportunity makes the thief, and I do not believe that we should give more opportunities than we can avoid to gigantic trusts to bribe or corrupt omcers who have to deal with them. In speaking in this way, I do not desire to cast the slightest reflection upon the Comptroller-General or any of the officers of his Department. We are now legislating for the future, and we can readily see how easy it would be for such a combine, as, for instance, the Standard Oil Trust on learning that a Comptroller General pro: posed, as the B ill now provides, to make inquiries in secret, concerning its operations, to put down a bribe that would tempt almost any man. the Comptroller-General, or the Minister, may delegate his powers to any Customs officer. ter that needs to be borne in mind, and serves to emphasize the demand for publicity. I do not think that we should give power to conduct these inquiries in secret. We know what is done in America where blackmail is often levied by Government officials, and we wish, as far as possible, to avoid the possibility of any officer squaring a case behind the backs of the people or the Legislature. In that respect alone, we find a very strong argument in favour of conducting these inquiries in public. It is necessary that the proceedings for which the Bill provides should be fair to both parties. There should be a feeling of absolute freedom from political sense of security such as would be given by a provision that these"" preliminary inquiries shall be made under the order of a Judge. If they are conducted at the whim of a Comptroller-General, or a Minister, there stead of prosecutions, taking place. ' By the adoption of the amendment we shall have, at all events, an assurance that all proceedings will be above board, and free from political bias, or influence of any kind. For these two very strong reasons, I propose to vote for the amendment. [S.50] -It occurs to me that the honourable member for Dalley is labouring under a misapprehension. He seems to be under the impression that the Opposition desire to lessen the power of the Attorney General to make these inquiries. That is not the purport of my proposal. it. honourable member will allow me to have an opinion upon even the effect of my proposal. Its effect will be to change every inquiry under this provision from a political into a judicial one. It will not lessen the prosecuting power; it will affect that power only by purifying it and eliminating from it the (political element. May I remind honourable members of some scenes that have occurred in this chamber during the passing of the Tariff. Have they not seen Ministers rise in tbeir places, and exhibit all the animus and bias of bitter political partisans against large firms ? Such a Minister is not a proper person to conduct a judicial inquiry into the bonafides of either a trust, or an individual. When men have criminal charges laid against them they should not be submitted to Star Chamber interrogations by. a Ministerf u l l of political bias and animus, and susceptible to the party influences of this Chamber. The amendment will not interfere in the slightest degree with the quality of the power proposed to be given; we merely seek to purify it , and so to strengthen it for the purpose in view. am prepared to admit that there are harmf u l trusts in Australia, and I agree with those who say that we should endeavour to make our legislation effective. Prevention is better than cure, and we need some fairly drastic provisions to enable the evil biasa to be coped with. A t the same time.

I am in sympathy with the desire to protect the public against combines and trusts which are detrimental to the common weal; but we must not act unjustly ; we must not unnecessarily harass them in the ""conduct of their business. Another point which occurs to me is that we have had a good deal of this class of legislation, and it certainly has borne very little fruit . We have not found out any persons committing these offences against the public, and it seems to me, therefore, that the evil has been greatly magnified. Otherwise we should surely have detected some one of the offenders. orable member that we have secured very f u l l reports in the case of several combines. we are having more than a f u l l dose of this class of legislation. ber himself gave us a f u l l share of it, seeing that he was a member of everv Government which proposed it . member is like a parrot.

I do not think that we require too much of this class of legislation unless some very good cause exists for it . We have been told that the provisions of the principal Act relating to trusts and combines are more drastic than are those to be found inany other part of the. world, and yet we have nothing to show If the person comfor them in the way of prosecutions. I do not know whether a large number of prosecutions will take place immediately this Bill becomes law, but I do say that even if under the Constitution we possess the power to do what the B ill seeks to do, we ought not to exercise it unless there is grave necessity for doing so. We do not need to enact more drastic legislation than has been found necessary in the older and more densely populated countries of the world. I am quite with the Attorney-General in his desire to safeguard the public interests, and It may be that I will assist him as f a r as I can. But so far I have not heard anything but general statements ports which we have received are necessarilv confidential, and their contents cannot be disclosed. this Bill becomes law I take it that those reports will be made public. I hope that the offending firms will be rigorously prosecuted, and that the Act will not be permitted to remain a dead letter. A t the same time, my own opinion is that these stringent provisions are not justified at the present moment. motives actuating honourable members in I can assure the right hontheir attitude towards this clause resolve themselves under two headings. Honourable members who do not agree with the amendment of the deputy leader of the Opposition are chiefly anxious that any person who is interested in trade and who wishes to give information to the Government concerning a combine whose operations are detrimental to the public, is adequately protected. I hope that that is a fair way of putting the views of honourable members opposite. Upon the other hand, supporters of the amendment are mainly A f t e r what he said toactuated by a fear that if proceedings against a trust are not openly initiated, opportunity will arise for the same class of corruption that has .disfigured American history.

Charges are often made recklessly in Parliament, and are found on inquiry to be untrue or exaggerated. A desire is exhibited to make things as uncomfortable as possible for a particular firm or individual, and the only check against acting on groundless charges, involving the parties complained of in considerable expense, is a liability to pay damages. A section of a Parliament having, for some reason or other, an antipathy to a particular firm or individual, in the absence of such' a liability,' would take care that a complaint was laid against that firm or individual for an offence under the Act. with the Comptroller-General, they would urge tlie responsible ""Ministei"" to institute a prosecution, and if he were not a strong man or belonged to a weak and yielding Administration, such as we have seen too often, he would use his influence, or the influence of the Administration would be used, to initiate a prosecution. member forgets that, after the initiation of a prosecution, the proceedings would take a long time.

I am not suggesting that this influence would come from any one section of any particular Parliament, but if it were brought to bear, it would lead to a complaint in writing being made, which would be followed by a demand in Parliament for the prosecution of the individual or firms concerned.

When honourable members in the' Labour corner become restive, the Government will institute proceedings against a trust. These will be prolonged indefinitely, and, in the meantime, we shall hear honourable members opposite applauding the courageous action of the Minister in tackling these large combinations, whilst all the time the Minister will mean, to do no-' thing of the sort. Amendment agreed to. When I last addressed the Committee, I foreshadowed an amendment which I intend to submit, and which there is no occasion for me to argue, at length now. Under the clause in its present form, any person supplying the Comptroller-General with information concerning the operations of a trust will be safeguarded from the vengeance of that trust. I wish to insert a proviso which will insure that inquiries made of members of a trust into the affairs of any trust shall be initiated in p u b l i c I can conceive of no better place in which' those negotiations ean begin than a Court of Law. It is absolutely essential that, so far as we possibly can, we shall limit the ordinary opportunities that a trust possesses for bribing officials with whom it may be brought into contact. buy the whole of the members of this Parliament. think that any honourable member can be bought by a trust, or that any of our public officers can be corrupted. But we must recollect that we are legislating for a future state of things, such as obtains in America to-day. Unless our officers and the trusts can come together to initiate proceedings only openly in a Court of Law, neither Parliament nor the people will know that they have been begun. I therefore move. That the following words be inserted in profeel much more humiliated by imprisonposed new section 15B at the end of sub-section ment than by a fine. 1 as amended :"" Provided that in the case of any person. whom the Comptroller-General believes to be a party to the offence, he shall by summons on affidavit apply to a Judge of the High Court, or to a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, for an order to compel the said person to answer interrogatories, and to make discovery of documents in relation to such alleged offence according to the practice of such Court in relation tu civil proceedings.""

479,Mr Kelly,"Before the Attorney-General accepts the amendment which has been proposed, I should like to know how far, in his opinion, it will affect the proviso in paragraph B of proposed section 15A, which provides that in all proceedings for an indictable offence the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence. How far will the amendment limit the free questioning which it is the object of the clause to permit ? ney-General) [10.35] I k e honourable as n i member for Wannon not to press his amendment. .

It must be remembered that this particular provision is not to be put in operation as against the trust or combine itself, but is for the .purpose of obtaining preliminary information before proceedings are taken under proposed section 15c. In a great many cases we are not able to obtain evidence otherwise than by means of questioning individuals who have been more or less under the influence of a combine; and the object is to compel such persons to give information.

The object is to honestly carry out the purpose of the original Act, and I think that the penaltv will prove effective. I am surprised at the attitude of the Attorney-General, because I should have thought he would have welcomed the amendment with open arms. I was much struck by the remark of the honourable member for Flinders, that it would be much more convenient to question the representative of a tsust if he were safe in gaol; and I think I may make a suggestion as to a method of torture which was suggested during the recent hot weather,, and which, I think, would prove effective. It is . a method which I fancy was not known even to the Inquisition, but I think it could be applied to extract information from those who are brought before the Comptroller General. When the heat was about n o in the shade I discovered on the beach that throwing hot sand on to the back of a person caused considerable inconvenience and pain, and I suggest that the Attorney-General should consider the matter, with a view of trving this method in cases under the B ill . ' I think that the Attorney-Gen-' eral ought to accept this amendment. [10.41] I am going to ask the honourable member for Wannon to withdraw' his It would be much amendment. it. Bill was under discussion, I urged that persons found guilty of a combination in restraint of trade,, which is a very serious offence, should be liable to imprisonment. The late Mr Seddon subsequently expressed the opinion that it was ridiculous to attempt to deal with trusts or combines by means of fines, and urged that imprisonment should be substituted for pecuniary penalties. He told us that the only other alternative was for the State to step in and take control; that he had found that the Meat Trust in New Zealand was so D o e s the Attorneyharmful that he intended to open State 'meat shops there. coal mines. A . penalty of ^50 lished a State insurance office, which is now in the ring. don made was in allowing private companies to operate in New Zealand after the State had entered the field of insurance there. I ask that the amendment be withdrawn, because I should not like to see a man imprisoned against whom a serious offence had not been proved. The offence of merely refusing to supply to the Comptroller-General, certain information which might tend to incriminate the person giving it is not sp serious as to warraht imprisonment, buti f the principal Act were under review, I should have no hesitation in urging the Committee to adopt the late Mr Seddon's view, and to substitute imprisonment for fines in respect of combinations in restraint of trade.

He may be any member of the community. The penalty applies also to any question. That has been made clear. penalty may apply to all.'sorts and conditions of persons, not necessarily wealthy members of trusts,.but possibly poor indi. viduals unassociated with a trust, who may not be able or may decline to answer questions. A man may be asked a question today, and be fined for refusing to answer. He may be asked a question equivalent to .the same one tp-morrow, and be fined every time he refuses to answer it. I was surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Hindmarsh towards the .amendment of the honourable member for , Wannon. He. did not object to punishment by fine for refusing to answer a question, but objected to punishment by imprisonment for a month, and yet, in the next breath, he said he would be favorable to imprisonment, for five years-for refusing to answer a question. This Bill is -now deficient in only one or two particulars. It 'contains all the machinery of the Spanish Inquisition at its worse, and includes a Star Chamber procedure. All that is lacking is the torturer, the rack, and thumb.screw, and questions put by the public tormentor, to make it an absolutely complete 'measure worthy of the middle ages and the' Spanish Inquisition. It is a marvel that those things have not been proposed, but I suppose the omission will be. remedied 'when the Bill comes back to us later. -In view of. the explanation of the At.torney-General and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I ask leave to withdraw my iamendment. am rather disappointed in the action of the pounds,"" proposed to be left out stand part honourable member for Wannon.
