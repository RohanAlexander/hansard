If so, will the Minister inform the House of the reason for this alinement? wards the partition of Palestine has been stated by mc with perfect frankness and fully debated in this House. In November last, the United Nations General Assembly decided, after a special commission had investigated the facts, that Palestine should be divided.

3,Dr. Evatt,"Australia' s attitude toplan was supported by Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. As I have already pointed out to the House, it was not merely a question of political partition, hut also of economic union and a special trusteeship to safeguard the sacred places of Bethlehem and Jerusalem. The attitude of the Australian delegation now at New York is exactly the same as that of New Zealand as expressed by Sir Carl Berendsen yesterday. The decision of the United Nations General Assembly made only a few months ago should not be set aside unless new information warranting such action can be brought before the Assembly. Above all, the decision of the Assembly should not be set aside because of violence, or the threat of violence, by anybody. That is a principle to which we have always endeavoured to adhere. I remind honourable members that America supported the partition plan. The fact that that country, within a few months, . has altered its view, does not impose any obligation upon Australia, New Zealand, or any other country to follow its example, in the absence of good reason for doing so. That is the view that has been taken by the Australian and New Zealand delegations, and, in my opinion, it is a just and impartial attitude. direct a question to the Minister for External Affairs, who was chairman of the United Nations committee which recommended the partition of Palestine. Will the right honourable gentleman inform me whether partition can be accomplished without the employment of armed force should the United Nations decide that partition is the best method for achieving a settlement of the unrest in Palestine? If armed force is found to be necessary, is the Australian Government prepared to provide some of the troops? on a previous occasion. It was never proposed by the General Assembly of the United Nations that armed force should he used except in pursuance of the decision of the Security Council, and in no circumstances of this case could armed forces be provided by Australia without the approval of this Parliament. LAND SETTLEMENT OF EX-SEEVIOEMEN. Post-war Eeconstruction seen the report in the Melbourne morning press of the 9 th April of a statement alleged to have been made at the annual conference of the Australian Country party by the State Minister for Health, Mr Dunstan, to the effect that soldier settlement in Victoria would lead to the writing off of Â£20,000,000 by the State? If so, what are the Minister's views about this statement? Has the Minister received, as stated in the same report, a letter from the Deputy Premier of Victoria, Mr McDonald, in which the Commonwealth is asked to leave the administration of the scheme to the State, but to contribute to the State the sum of Â£1,500 in respect of each soldier settled on the land by the State, and to provide certain financial assistance to the settlers? Did the Minister see in the same report a to the effect that, if he did not get a satisfactory reply to the letter, he would recommend that the State Government dissolve the partnership? ""Will the Minister inform the House whether there is any substance in these statements made by the State Ministers at the Country party conference? the press of statements alleged to have for Lands and Deputy Premier of Victoria, and by Mr Dunstan, an ex-Premier of Victoria. The stateforwarded to me a letter from the Soldiers' Settlement Commission of Victoria in which certain suggestions were marie in line with those mentioned by the honourable member is correct. I received a him that I would consider the request, and that, in due course, I would tender him advice thereon. I think that, it was outrageous conduct on the part of Mr McDonald that before I had time to reply to his communication and advise him of the result of my consideration of the request he should have made public the contents of the letter he wrote to me, but that is in line with the outrageous conduct which one associates with members of",12,Palestine

11,"Letter From Mr Mcdonald, And Informed","the Australian Country party. McDonald suggested that the partnership between the Commonwealth Government -and the Victorian Government should be dissolved, and that, instead of the two governments working in co-operation, the administration of soldier land settlement should be left entirely to the States, but that the Commonwealth should pay to the State Government Â£1,500 for every person settled on the land. I may say that the partnership existing between the Commonwealth and Victoria is not the only one of its kind; similar arrangements have been entered into by the Commonwealth with all the State governments. The experience of returned soldiers after World War I., when many of them were burdened with such a heavy load of debt that a great part of the remainder of their lives was wasted in trying to work off the debt, shows that the State governments themselves were not able to evolve a soldier settlement scheme anything like as successful as that now being put into operation. The suggestion that the Commonwealth Government should hand over its responsibility in this matter, and at the same time contract to pay to the 'State government Â£1,500 for every person settled on the land, is not worthy of consideration. I have advised say clearly and bluntly that even if Mr outgoing consignments of Queensland proMcDonald were to advise his government to dissolve the partnership between Victoria and the Commonwealth regarding the land settlement of ex-servicemen it is extremely unlikely Victorian Government would do such a foolish thing. Mr Dunstan's statement that the land settlement scheme would involve the writing off by the State Government of Â£20,000,000 is entirely without foundation. In arriving at such a conclusion, Mr Dunstan must have been influenced by the fact that, under the soldier settlement scheme of non-Labour governments in Victoria after World War I., Â£23,000,000 had to be written off because of the inefficiency of the system, and the impossibly heavy burdens placed upon settlers. I repeat that I think it was outrageous conduct on the part of a State Minister to publish the contents of a letter which he had written to a Commonwealth Minister before he had received a reply to it. Mr Dedman. Prime Minister read a report that 12,000 tons of cargo that 'was diverted to southern ports because of strikes has yet to be shipped to Queensland and that when certain ships have been dealt with a further surplus of 6,100 tons will be waiting to come from the south? Has he also read a report that three ships carrying British motor cars, crockery, carpets, foodstuffs, various manufactured goods and general cargo were held up iu Brisbane because no waterside labour was available? Is he aware that, according to the Brisbane Courier-Mail, more than 600 men have applied to join the Waterside Workers Federation in Brisbane in the last week, but that none of them is likely to be admitted, and that on Tuesday the port of Brisbane was 506 men short for the day shift and 125 men short for the night shift? Can the right honourable gentleman give the House any information on this subject? If not, in view of the urgent necessity for handling cargoes in Queensland, will he have inquiries made with a view to making a statement to the House to-morrow? The situation is aggravated by the fact that ducts have accumulated at ports in large quantities. that the the press reports mentioned by the honourable member. However, I have kept very closely in touch with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel and I have also been in touch with the Premier of Queensland regarding the problem of overtaking the lag that has resulted from industrial troubles in that State. One of the most important aspects of the problem is the delay in the shipment of raw sugar from northern ports to the south. Another serious aspect is the accumulation of f-argoes in other States, particularly at Sydney and Newcastle. This accumulation has been accentuated by the fact that consignments for Brisbane were removed from some ships during the industrial trouble. This was done because of the fact that if the ships had carried the cargoes to Brisbane they would have hoPT> IT-M up at thÂ»t. ^ort awaitir><r pn",13,Palestine

15,Mr Chifley,"I have seen none ofopportunity to unload. The alternative would have been to over-carry the consignments. All these matters have been the subject of discussion, and the Stevedoring Industry Commission, the Minister for Shipping and Fuel and the Director of Shipping, Mr Hetherington, have been doing everything possible to meet the requirements of Queensland. A shortage of labour on the waterfront is not an unusual circumstance at any port. men applied for membership of the federation at Brisbane, but none of them was accepted. thing about the applications, but I do know that frequently more men offer for work than can be employed. As a matter of fact, 1.500 or 1,600 men offer for work every day at some ports and, on occasions, no work is offered to them. There are many reasons for that, of course. Often the nature of port facilities makes it difficult to move ships to berths and they have to wait at anchor. Also bad weather sometimes interrupts the unloading of cargoes. I have discussed this matter with the Stevedoring Industry Commission and the shipowners. I have no knowledge of the particular circumstances whicli the honourable member has mentioned, but I know that unless we have thousands of surplus waterside workers waiting around for jobs, as was characteristic of this industry for many years prior to the war, just to meet an emergency on a particular day, there is, always likely to be a shortage of waterside labour on occasions. Generally speaking, the Waterside Workers Federation has admitted new members after consultation with the Stevedoring Industry Commission. I shall disenss that aspect with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel. AlthoughI do not propose to make a statement on the subject, I shall obtain for the honourable member all the additional information that I can about the matters which he has raised. loss of trade with Java, amounting to millions of pounds, which Australia has suffered during the past two years due to the ban imposed upon Dutch ships by the Communist-controlled Waterside for Commerce and Agriculture awareWorkers Federation, will the Attorneythat the manager of the Queensland"" General consult with the Prime Minister with a view to prosecuting the Communist president of the federation, Mr Healy, and other officers of tliat organization for this restraint of our national trade? As the question has been asked so frequently during the last few years, can the Attorney-General also indicate whether there is a possibility that the federation will lift this ban in the near future ? in the absence of the honourable member, a similar question was asked of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman dealt with the matter fully, and to his answer I have nothing to add. ter for Information a question concerning a publication entitled South-West Pacific, which is produced by the Department of Information from time to time. Because of the excellence of that publication and the valuable educational and historical information which it contains, will he consider making available copies of the publication to all schools in Australia ? by the tribute which the honourable member has paid to the excellence of the work of the Department of Information, and I am glad to observe that his opinion is shared by all honourable members. Unfortunately, the Treasurer has been unableto provide all the money which the department requires to further the production and circulation of this and similar works of high quality. If sufficient money and enough art paper were available to the department it would be able to supplycopies of each issue of South-West Pacific to every school in Australia. However, when conditions improve I shall makeanother approach to the Treasurer, with a view to obtaining additional money tofurther the good work that is being done-",14,Queensland Services Waterfron T Employment Ba N On Dutch Ships

22,Mr Adermann,"I s the MinisterCotton Board, Mr Young, has stated that the cotton crop which is now being harvested in that State is estimated to yield only 2,000 bales of raw cotton? Is the Minister aware that in the course of his statement Mr Young said: "" One of the principal factors holding up the industry's revival is the price paid to growers"" ? Has the Government considered offering a guarantee of a higher price for all cotton grown in Australia? Is it not evident to -the Government that .an increase of cotton production would be of great benefit to Australia's finances -during the present shortage of dollars, and would enable goods to be manufactured which are now almost unobtainable? statement to which the honourable member has referred, but I can assure him that the Government is aware of the importance of the cotton-growing industry. It is also aware of the difficulties which confront cotton-growers, which are accentuated because of the greater attraction -offered at present by other primary indusgranted to this company. The other tries. The price paid to growers of cotton is not the only factor which militates .against an increase of production. Expansion of the industry would necessitate the provision of greater supplies of water, and was leased for recreational purposes. and the construction of dams, channels -and so on would make demands on the relatively small amount of labour avail.able. However, the Government will consider the matter, and if it can assist the industry it will endeavour to do so. NEW for the Interior inform me whether an .area comprising approximately 205 -acres of Commonwealth crown land .situated at Henry Head, La Perouse, has been leased for a period of fifteen years from the 1st March, 1946, to the New South Wales Golf Club Company Limited, the registered directors of which are Messrs. R. A. Gale, H . A. Fisher, A. Butler, C. M . Glynn, F. I , Bowes, J. L. Dickson, M . Gulson, G. -Johnson, K. J. Pope and J. Prendergast? Is it also a fact that that club, which, according to its memorandum of association, was formed to promote the game of golf, will not admit Jews to membership, and that when vacancies have existed applications for membership received from Jew9, which were otherwise in order, have been rejected ? If those are facts, will the Minister inform the company that the demised lands are owned, through the Crown, by all the people of Australia? Will he also inform the company that the exercise of discrimination on racial and religious grounds is contrary to the spirit and intention of section 116 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which guarantees to every Australian the free observance and practice of religion? Will he also require the company to furnish immediate assurances in writing that the present policy will be altered at once, failing which the lease will be terminated and the grounds dedicated to public recreation? I have of this case is that a lease was matters raised by the honourable member call for examination by the Minister for the Interior, particularly as the land in question is owned by the Commonwealth When the Minister has completed his inquiries, the honourable member will be informed of the result. action taken by the Australian representatives at two recent conferences held under the auspices of the United Nations. At a conference relating to the status of women, a vote was recorded by the Australian delegate in support of the Soviet point of view and in opposition to a motion moved by the United Kingdom delegate seeking the release from Russia of the wives of some British soldiers. At a conference dealing with the freedom of the press, the Australian representative abstained from voting on a motion, proposed by the United States of America delegate, expressing regret at the absence from the conference of a Czech editor",15,Cotton

26,Mr Holt,"I direct the attention ofwho had been removed from his post following the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February last. Can the Minister say whether Australian delegates at such conferences vote in accordance with instructions received from the Australian Government or in accordance with their, own judgment on the issues that arise? If the latter is the case, does the Australian Government take any action to express approval or disapproval of the votes recorded by its representatives? If so, what action does it take? which dealt with the status of women, the vote to which the honourable member has referred does not appear to have been of any significance, because this is the first occasion on which it has been brought to by attention. At a conference of that nature, votes on many matters may be taken suddenly. That is illustrated by the second case to which the honourable member has referred. I have not yet received an official report on that matter because the voting took place only yesterday. I have no doubt that the honourable member's information is -derived from the press. It appears from press reports that, when it was proposed at the end of the conference that members should express their regret at the absence of aparticular delegate from a particular country, the Australian delegate did not record a vote. The delegates of a. number of the countries voted in favour of the proposal, thereby expressing such regret, and the representatives of the Eussian group of countries voted against it, thereby, I presume, expressing the opposite view. The Australian delegate, Mr ""Watt, did what I suppose everyhody with any common sense or with any knowledge of international conferences would agree was the right thing. He took the view that the proposal related to a matter entirely irrelevant to the business of the conference, and therefore abstained from voting. The honourable member has raised a broader issue, but I think I have already answered him in a sense, by taking these illustrations. On many occasions when a vote is taken it is impossible for the Australian delegates to ask for or to receive instructions from Australia. Much must be left to their common sense and discretion, which is exercised with wisdom in almost every instance. In cases where a vote was to be taken upon some special matter as to which a question might arise later on, there have been occasions when some instructions have been given. To pick out one isolated vote from a conference involving dozens of votes and to use it for the purpose of criticizing the Australian delegate or the Australian Government is utterly unfair. Proof of the excellence of the conduct of the business of the conference by Mr Watt is afforded by the fact that his proposal for the encouragement 'of fair and accurate reporting of international events and the discouragement of warmongering and war propaganda was unanimously accepted, not only by the Western group allied to the United States, but also by the Soviet group. That, I think, speaks well for Mr Watt's work. weeks ago the management of Australian Cotton Textile Industries Limited requested me to inspect the works of the company which were established at Woodville, South Australia, during the war years. The* company, which is manufacturing about 1,000,000 sheets and pillow cases each year for the Australian market, has expended large sums in the provision of buildings and plant,' and is very concerned because of competition from Japan and India, where low wages are paid. Has the Prime Minister recently read in the press, or heard over the air, a suggestion emanating from the United States of America that Australia is buying more cotton goods from Japan? If so, will the right honourable gentleman inform the House of the policy of the Government in relation to the protection of the Australian cotton textile industry?

Those goods have a dollar content, because the cotton used in their manufacture comes from the TJnited States of America.

Has he seen the further statement that the miners federation was responsible for the loss of 1,200,000 man-days because of strikes and that eight other Communist-controlled unions were responsible for the loss of 1,630,000 days? In view of these statements, does the Minister consider that members of the Communist party are honouringthe undertaking they gave when he lifted the ban on it in 1942, that they would do their utmost to promote harmony in industry and to minimize absenteeism, stoppages, strikes and other hold-ups? Attorney-General give effect to his declaration that if the undertakings were not observed, the Government would re-impose the ban? ments to which the honourable member has referred. I have also read in the press, either yesterday or to-day, a denial by some of the unions concerned in the allegation that they are Communist controlled. No doubt the honourable member repeated accurately the press references to the coal-miners federation; but I do not overlook the fact, which was acclaimed by every patriotic Australian a few months ago, that the production of coal last year was just short of the record output achieved in 1942. Having regard to the source from which the press derived its information, one would need to examine it carefully to see whether the allegation is wellfounded. With regard to the other point [35] know that the action taken in 1942 related solely to the war-time ban imposed upon the Communist party by a previous government before Soviet Russia was at war. The undertakings given by the Communist party had relation only to action taken under war-time regulations which have long since been repealed and are no longer the law of the land. industrial peace. nothing to do with the present position. They were abolished when the controls to which they related were lifted. Therefore, there is no point in the honourable member's last question. However, I have said to the House before, and I now repeat, unpopular though it may be to say so, that during the war period I believed as a responsible Minister that those undertakings were not dishonoured but were honoured. That is in no way justifying, or excusing, direct action, which 1 is opposed to the policy of the Government and of the Labour movement. As a matter of fairness, the true position should be stated.

In reply to his third question, I am not aware of the recent activities of Mr Campbell, who was, of course, a leader of a fascist organization in this country some years ago. However, during the recent debate on communism in this chamber I told the House that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Investigation Service to watch organizations of that character as well as those of the other extreme, and the officers are carrying out that duty. trickle of new motor vehicles, including cars and trucks, is coming into Australia, I ask the Minister for Transport whether it is the intention of the Government to endeavour to bring more British vehicles to this country and whether a special effort will be made to include a substantial percentage of utility trucks and panel vans. If this cannot be done, will the Minister ensure that arrangements are made to obtain more spare parts for vehicles already on the roads in this country? Mr ""WARD I can assure the honourable member that there is more than a trickle of new vehicles coming into Australia. Quite a large proportion of the imported vehicles are from Great Britain, and transport authorities believe that it may be possible to meet the demand for British cars in full within the next nine or twelve months. There is, however, a great shortage of American vehicles, due mainly to the scarcity of dollar funds. I shall ascertain whether it is possible to alleviate the present position by importing more spare parts. MEAT. of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs to the Commonwealth Statistician's report on food for the year 1946-47, which shows that although the rationing scale for couponed meats permits an annual consumption of 95.68 lb. a head, the actual consumption of these meats was 181.4 lb. a head. Allowing 20 per cent, for wastage in retail butcher shops, these figures indicate a consumption of approximately 145 lb. a head. To assist the people of Great Britain in their desperate economic crisis, which, according to figures published in to-day's press, is worsening, I ask the Minister what steps, if any, have been taken to reduce the consumption of meat in excess of the ration scale in this country ? submit the figures quoted by the honourable member to the Minister for Trade and Customs. I remind the honourable member that the staff of the Rationing Commission is already substantial; and that there is constant criticism by honourable members opposite of the alleged growing staff of bureaucrats in the Public Service. More intensive policing of the rationing regulations would necessitate the appointment of additional staff. This would be most difficult in view of the shortage of labour of all kinds throughout the Commonwealth.

I suppose that honourable members should regard themselves as privileged to have this opportunity to discuss private members' business because during the last four sessional periods the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has moved on each "" Grievance D a y "" that government business should take precedence over private members' business. gentleman moved yesterday that government business should take precedence over general business to-day, I thought that we were again to be deprived of this privi lege, but now I find that by some miracle we are to enjoy it for the first time in many months. There are many matters to which I should like to refer on this occasion, but in the 35 minutes allowed to me I shall have an opportunity to deal only with a few of them. The first relates to the activities of officers of the Prices Commission. Prices investigators have been travelling through my electorate and doing things that have not met with the approval of the people, or of myself. In fact, their actions would not be approved by any self-respecting citizen. against two men whose activities, I submit, have not been in the best interests of Australia. have been acting under instructions from the Prices Commissioner, who in t u r n has been instructed by the Govern(Grievance Day.) ment through the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Courtice). I assume, therefore, that I am getting right to the seat of the trouble by bringing this matter forward in the House. The two men concerned are W ill i a m Timms and Louis Lipshutt, both of whom are prices investigators. These men have travelled through as the Mallee, from which mallee holders, or to induce them to put a price upon the roots, Lipshutt and Timms have indulged in misrepresentation. I shall not offer only hearsay evidence of what has taken place. I have before me a newspaper published at Ouyen, under the title Ouyen and Northwest Express, ""which contains a report of court proceedings taken against certain farmers based on the evidence of the prices investigators. In the first case, according to this journal, William Timms, prices investigator, in sworn evidence at the Ouyen court on Thursday, the 11th March, 1948, said that he and When the right honourable Lipshutt saw the defendant, Stanley Edwin Kay, of Kayville, at the recreation ground at Kiamal on the 30th A p r i l , 1947, when some men were practising football. He told the defendant Kay that he was conducting a woodyard at Coburg, and urgently required mallee roots. K a y replied that he could not supply them then as he was too busy. He could not, he said, supply them before June.' Timms offered to pay for the first truck-load immediately. It was then only A p r i l, and the mallee roots could not be supplied until June or July, but the investigator, who pretended that he had a woodyard at Coburg, offered to pay for the first truck-load on the spot. He also offered to pay for the second truck-load in advance, but K a y said, "" No, you can't. You have to wait until you get a weighbridge ticket"". When asked the price, I shall make specific charges defendant replied, "" Thirty-three shillings on trucks here "". Timms then asked if he could rely on Kay-wh o then gave his I assume that the men name-to send some in June. I should think that farmers ought to be able to rely upon the Government's representatives, because that is what the inspectors",20,International Wheat Agreement Bill 1948
48,Mr Ttjenbull (Wimmera) [3.20],"are. This particular farmer believed that he could rely on this representative of the Government. But the fact is that Timms ma.de many false statements to induce Kay to sell mallee roots at more than the fixed price. Melbourne, less freight charges according to where they are loaded, but the investigator tried to get the farmer to sell the mallee roots at more than that. Kay, in his sworn evidence, said, "" I really believed that the price was 33s., but some friends told me that it was 30s., and I did not bother to send the roots "" mallee roots before? any for five years, and, on this occasion, when he learned what the fixed price was, he did not send the roots. Nevertheless, the Prices Commissioner went on with the prosecution, saying that the farmer had offered to sell roots at more than the fixed price, and he secured a convicition. The investigator interviewed Kay on the 30th May, 1947, but the Prices Commissioner did not see fit to bring the matter before the court until the H t h March, 1948, about nine months later. Let it be noted that William Timms admitted on oath that he had told the defendant, whom he had incited to commit a breach of the law, that he was conducting a woodyard at Coburg. These inspectors, also visited other places. William Timms has admitted on oath in court that he told another defendant, William James Ellery, that he was touring the country looking for mallee roots. That, of course, was misrepresentation. Surely the Government should see that its investigators do not misrepresent themselves. farmer, Ellery, on Sunday, the 27th April, 1947, and asked him to supply mallee roots.. that roots before June or July. Timms attempted to pay for the first truck-load then, but Ellery refused the payment. It is not hard to understand the technique of the investigators. Their method was to induce a farmer to accept payment for the first truck-load, and then it did not matter whether he sent the mallee roots or not. member mean to say that the inspectors went to farmers, who are not in the business of supplying mallee roots, and tried to make criminals of them? by the sworn evidence. Timms admitted in evidence that he had introduced Lipshutt as a man who had come on the trip with him because he had not previously seen that part of the country. By such methods the inspectors tried to build up cases against primary producers. There were plenty of other places where they could have worked with advantage. They could have tried to do something about the black market in motor cars in Melbourne. I know a young man who saw an advertisement in a newspaper offering a Ford car for sale at Â£230. He went out to the dealer in the suburbs and said that he would take the car at that price. The dealer laughed at him and said, "" Do you think I am Father Christmas""? The inspectors, of whom I have spoken, tried to induce the farmers to offer mallee roots for sale at a few shillings more than the fixed price. That is the kind of thing that is happening under this Government, and it is very difficult, when these matters are brought forward in the House, to get a Minister to reply. I hope that an answer will be forthcoming to the charges which I am now making. If no answer is given, it will amount to a confession by the Government that what I am saying is unanswerable. The investigators also interviewed Clifford Thomas White on the 29th April, 1947, although the case was not heard until nine or ten months later. The meeting took place near the Underbool Hotel, Timms visited the and the inspectors drank with Whitea fine example of Australian fellowship! Timms told White that he was starting Ellery said up a business, and wanted mallee roots he could not supply the urgently. White, in his evidence, said, "" He kept at me, and I told him that I might be able to supply him, but could not promise"". Evidence was given to the effect that they were in the hotel for three-quarters of an hour drinking together.

After they had persuaded Mr Pearce to enter into a deal for the sale of mallee roots they accepted his hospitality. Fancy behaving like that! ""When Mr Pearce was asked why he had not checked the price offered by Timms, he said, "" I trusted Mr Timms"". These men fostered a spirit of good fellowship by drinking at hotels and accepting hospitality until their victims trusted them. the old confidence trick. that the Australian is a trusting fellow. He does not expect prices investigators to go into the country and practise the tricks of confidence men. People in the Mallee treat men as men and expect them to conduct themselves accordingly. Then, when a couple of tricksters from the city visit them on this racket, they are caught out in a way that would disgust any decent Australian. Wherever they have gone these investigators have incited farmers to commit breaches of the law and they have not hesitated to engage in gross misrepresentation in order to gain their ends. However, I have not stated the worse of the cases. A young ex-serviceman came to the ex-servicemen's sports meeting at Warracknabeal on the 3rd September in order to meet me and tell me of his trouble. His name is K. Blythman. He was recently discharged after war service and is now a farmer at Patchewollock, an important place in the wheat-growing area. His story is not in the form of sworn evidence, as are the others I have dealt with, hut .1 know the man and I believe him. He told me that these investigators said that they wereconnected with some Housing Commission soldier settlement at Coburg, or some other place near the city, and that if hesold the roots he would, be doing somegood for his former ex-service "" cobbers "". They persuaded him to enter into somekind of a contract. They also went to R. district, and told him that they wanted; mallee roots urgently as they were starting in business in a wood yard. He entered into a kind of agreement to sell mallee roots to them at slightly more than the fixed price. One fact worthy of consideration in relation to these cases is that some of the men agreed to cart the roots to the railhead over distances of between 10 and 15 miles. As they pointed out, they thought that the cost of transport was worth something. The fixed price is for mallee roots delivered on trucks at the railway, but the regulation is capable of being misunderstood. Another fact is that there was a considerable lapse of time between the dates when the agreements were made and the date when the prosecutions were launched. The cases of Mr Blythman and Mr Clancy were brought on by the Commissioner within only one week of twelve months after the investigators had visited them. sell mallee roots? and delivered roots, but others did not make deliveries because they learned that the price agreed upon was above the fixed price. Nevertheless, the Commissioner proceeded with the prosecutions in all cases. The lapse of time between the visits of the investigators and the commencement of proceedings by the Prices Commissioner is of great importance.

64,Mr Turnbull,"If the honorableI want the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), who is at present in charge of the House to get the facts clear in his mind. I should like honourable members on the Government side of the House to co-operate with us to prevent a repetition of such trickery. Surely to goodness they do not condone it ! thing to help these growers? The situaAccording to the Ouyen and North-West Express, when the hearing was finished, Mr Taylor, who represented the defendants, said that nine months had elapsed between the date of the alleged offences and the issue of summonses. He claimed that the defendants' cases had been definitely prejudiced by the delay, and that the Crown, too, was in trouble. He said that earlier action should have been taken. The Police Magistrate, Mr Moloney, said he agreed that there had been undue delay, but the cases had been presented for him to hear and he had to hear them. Considering all factors-the misrepresentation by the investigators, the long delay in launching prosecutions, and the victimization of ex-servicemen and othersthis is a genuine grievance. I want the Government to make some definite pronouncement about this matter. Does it approve of such tactics? Did the responsible Minister instruct the Prices Commissioner to order his investigators to act in the manner I have described, or were those two officers acting on their own initiative. If they acted without specific directions, they must be condemned; if not, they must be absolved from blame. The Government should state its views on this matter immediately. The people of Australia will not tolerate this sort of thing, whether the Prices Commissioner favours it or not. It is not in accordance with the traditions of Australian conduct and manliness. I refer now to a letter which I have which is payable by consumers at Kerang received from Mr D. A. Cockroft, and Quambatook. honorary secretary of the Victorian Export Grape Growers Association. He have received a letter containing a recomplains that members of the associaquest to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley). tion are having trouble in securing refriThe league carried the following resolugerated shipping space to enable them to tion which explains the position:' send their grapes to Singapore and other places in the East.

Mr Cockroft himself was able to send only 120 boxes, although he usually packs about 6,000 boxes. Eurthermore, that small consignment had to be sent to Sydney. The fresh grape export trade is of great importance in Victoria. Can the Government do sometion requires immediate and careful consideration because of the importance of export sales to many of my constituents. I refer now to an application whicb has been made to the Government by the Shire of Kerang for a subsidy in connection with losses which it sustained in respect of electricity undertakings at Quambatook and Kerang. Many shires have received such subsidies because of the high costs which prevailed between 1942 and 1945. However, the Government has replied to the Shire of Kerang that, as the council has a fair credit balance, it is not entitled to a subsidy. Perhaps the Government considered that the council should charge a higher price for electricity. The council then pointed out that the money which it was holding, was earmarked for urgent road works.' At present neither the machinery nor the labour required for these works can be obtained, but when machinery becomes available and the labour position improves, all this money will be expended in this manner. The council also informed the Government that it did not desire to increase the cost of electricity. However, the two matters which I have mentioned are operating quite unfairly against the council receiving the subsidy, and, therefore, I ask the Minister to give further consideration to the position. The council has allocated its funds for important road works and does not, in the circumstances, desire to increase the charge for electricity From the Appin Farmers League, I That owing to the fact that farmers and wives must work extremely long hours, this League requests the Federal Government -farm hones a deduction for income tax purposes and as an incentive to their installation, thus helping to stem the drift from the land. Members of tbe League considered that as labour-saving devices are essential in country homes, the cost should be allowed as a deduction for income tax purposes, in the same manner as the cost of farm equipment is allowable. devices has the honourable member in mind? device which immediately occurs to me is a refrigerator, and there are also many others which could be mentioned. The League asks the Treasurer to give sympathetic consideration to its representations, because this tax concession would assist country people to increase the number of their amenities, and, in this way, would help to stem the drift of population from the rural areas to the large cities. That is urgent. Since the last census was taken, I have noticed a considerable transference of population from the country districts to the metropolitan areas. The population of Victoria increased by 234,989 between 1933 and last year, an increase of 12.91 per cent., but of this total, country districts secured only two persons. As I desire to give other honourable members an opportunity to speak this afternoon, my remaining remarks will be brief. However, I feel bound at this juncture to refer to the general policy of the Government. When primary producers ask for more tractors, the answer which they invariably receive is that the dollar shortage prevents the granting of their request. When they ask for fencing wire or galvanized iron, they are always informed that these materials are not available because of the shortage of manpower. Those are the stereotyped answers to these two demands. What is the real reason? All honourable members are aware that there is a dollar shortage, but we also know that during the last six or twelve months, goods valued at many thousands of pounds have been imported from the dollar area, although they are not essential to primary production. Unless farmers are able to maintain their agricultural equipment in a proper concarefully my allegations against the dition of repair, production will continue to decline, and, in that event, our standard of living will be lowered. We in Australia have always advocated a high standard of living, but that cannot be maintained with lowered production. Everybody knows that. What is the real reason for the shortage of galvanized iron and fencing wire? We know that there is a shortage of labour, and the principal labour-saving reason for that is that government departments are overstaffed. Eor example, Trans-Australia Airlines is employing 'a large number of men, and last year its operation resulted in a loss of more than Â£500,000. Large numbers of those men could have been profitably employed in productive works. In addition to the loss exceeding Â£500,000 on Trans-Australia Airlines operations, we must also take into consideration the loss that arises because of the absence of these men from productive employment. Probably thousands of persons are employed by Trans-Australia Airlines, and such government undertakings, and, in my opinion, they should be put to work as producers of goods which are essential to this primary producing country. The production of wool, wheat and other primary commodities involves many considerations including man-power, machinery and fertilizers. We must foster our primary industries, because they are the principal contributors to our national wealth. Our land is fertile, our farmers know their jobs, and, by and large, our seasons are ""favorable, but we cannot produce large quantities of primary commodities in this machine age without effective agricultural implements. In the country districts, machinery as well as housing and fencing has deteriorated to an almost unbelievable degree. That position must be improved, and the Government must realize that, if we are to maintain our present standard of living, there is more to be considered than the relatively small geographical areas of Sydney, Melbourne and the other capital cities of Australia. Surely the Government, realizing that, will in the future render greater assistance to the man on the land. I urge the Government to investigate",23,Lawson Memorial Roots Are Obtained I N An Endeavour Relief Streptomycin To Purchase Mallee Roots From Land
65,Mr Haylen,What,25,Lawson Memorial Roots Are Obtained I N An Endeavour Relief Streptomycin To Purchase Mallee Roots From Land
66,Mr Turnbull,"On e labour-savingPrices Branch.. which I have raised involve government .policy, and the Government must see the .position of the primary producer in its proper ""perspective, but the matter of the Prices attention, because even to-day, certain investigators may be doing the same job in another part of Victoria. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) mentioned prices control, and I , too, desire to refer to that subject, I have passed on to officials of the Prices more particularly because I have just received from the Prime Minister( Mr information which I have received. One Chifley) a written answer to a question which I asked some time ago and concerning which I asked a supplementary question this week. members, and I believe, every thinking citizen in Australia are anxious about some' aspects of prices administration. We are disturbed about some of the men who are administering prices control and about some of the things which they are doing. All of us have heard rumours about this matter. Some of us have heard more than rumours, and know that ugly things have been taking place under the administration of prices control. I agree that during a war and its aftermath, it is not always possible to have perfect administration. In war-time, a government gets the best men that it can in the emergency and they are not always the most desirable men. So, various abuses tend to creep in, and, in the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect perfection. But one does expect the government of the day to take steps to maintain the administration in as sound and efficient a condition as possible, and my view, which is -gained from a good deal of evidence, is that that has not been done. Indeed, the Government not only is careless about the matter but it also seems quite cynical and perfectly happy that there should be slovenliness, and^ indeed, dishonesty in some features of its administration. For ""instance, everybody knows that the administration of second-hand motor car 'sales is most unsatisfactory. On a previous occasion, I stated that 90 per cent. of second-hand motor cars sold in Sydney are sold on the black market, and The other matters I believe that to be a conservative esti= mate. In my opinion, practically no second-hand motor cars, particularly in the City of Sydney, are sold at the pegged price. However, the position is even Branch requires immediate worse. Statements which have been made lead me to believe that some of the officials who administer the regulations for the sale of second-hand motor cars know what is happening. Obviously, they must be receiving some encouragement to shut their eyes to certain things. Branch for investigation some of the aspect of the matter which causes me serious concern is the type of men who are appointed to administer the PricesA l l honourable Branch and similar government bodies, and the conduct of some of the officials appointed to make investigations. There are, for instance, officials such as those referred to by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull). I could mention many cases which show that the administration of those bodies is, if not corrupt, at all events slovenly, although I realize that my assertion may not be regarded as proof. However, I intend to mention details of two cases which possess a special significance. Some time ago, I asked the Prime Minister a question concerning an individual whose name I did not divulge and which I do not propose to mention now. The person concerned occupies a high position in the Prices Branch. I am at liberty to repeat the facts of this case because they were given in open court in Sydney. Last November the individual to whom I refer was prosecuted for a black-marketing offence in connection with the rental charged for a house. He did not appear to defend the case, and the Crown, which was, to say the least, very patient, obtained an adjournment in order to give him a further opportunity to appear to answer the charge. Such an opportunity would not, I should imagine, be given to an ordinary defendant. When the case again came on for hearing the defendant was represented by counsel and obtained a further adjournment. When the case was ultimately heard the Crown called certain witnesses to prove the alleged offence.",25,Lawson Memorial Roots Are Obtained I N An Endeavour Relief Streptomycin To Purchase Mallee Roots From Land
67,Mr Beale (Parramatta) [3.52],"Those witnesses had already given written statements concerning the commission of the offence. I know of what I am speaking because, as honourable members are aware, I have appeared in many similar cases. When the witnesses for the prosecution entered the witness box they then, for the first time, took the technical point that they were not obliged to answer questions, on the ground that they might incriminate themselves. That point was taken by two witnesses in particular. The magistrate before whom the case was conducted held that the objection was of too general a nature and declined to entertain it. It was alleged that the defendant had let a house and had charged a large sum of money for the key. When the witnesses were asked questions concerning the actual payment of money they declined to answer them, claiming that they might incriminate themselves by their answers. The magistrate was compelled, under the law of New South Wales, to uphold their objection, and no further evidence was given by the two material witnesses. The result was that the Crown was unable to prove its case and the prosecution collapsed. I emphasize that the reason for its collapse was the refusal of material witnesses to give evidence of the actual payment of money. Under the Landlord and Tenant regulations a person who pays money under certain circumstances is deemed equally as guilty as the person who receives money. However, the Crown does not usually prosecute the person who pays the money. When I asked the Prime Minister a question concerning the official who was the defendant in the case to which I have just referred, that man was still occupying a senior position in the Prices Branch, which, I understand, he still holds. I asked the right honourable gentleman whether he was aware of the facts of the case, whether he approved the retention in office of an official who had been involved in such a matter, and whether he would investigate the circumstances in order to establish the persons real guilt or innocence. Although months have elapsed I have not yet received a reply. I spoke to the Prime Minister privately about the matter, but all he did was to show me a file which indicated that inquiries were still proceeding. Yesterday, I asked a supplementary question of the Prime Minister, who apologized for the delay in answering my original question, and said that he had not yet received a report. Although the officer to whom I have referred is, if not guilty, at least under strong suspicion of guilt, he is allowed to continue in office, and may do so for years unless the pressure which I am now bringing to bear has some effect. I do not ask that the official in question be dismissed, but I insist that an investigation, be made to ascertain his guilt or inno-cence. If he is found guilty then heshould not be allowed to remain in a position of authority in the Prices Branch.. Important government positions must not be held by persons who break the very laws which they are appointed to enforce. For the sake of the public servants themselves, who are an honourable body of men and women, unworthy members of the Service should be removed. I might add that information in regard to malpractices in government departments has been given to me by public servants, who, as honourable men, are concerned that the reputation of the Public Service is being besmirched. I now turn to another case of official wrongdoing, which is of a much more Berious nature. Some time ago I asked the Prime Minister a question regarding the official involved in the matter which I am about to mention, but I purposely refrained from disclosing his name. When honourable members raise matters such as this they do so usually irpthe public interest and without intending to be personal. Nevertheless, it is our duty to safeguard, as far as possible, the purity of administration. The individual who was the subject of my question was until a day or two ago employed as the Prime Minister's personal delegate at Land Sales Control. One cannot imagine any more intimate relationship than that which exists in a political way between the Prime Minister and an officer who exercises the Prime Minister's function of consenting, or otherwise, to land sales. The man to whom I refer was convicted in 1940 on ten or eleven charges of forgery, uttering and false pretences, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment on each charge.

80,Mr Anthony,"It is serious for thefor sugar from the Proserpine and Inkerman mill areas, seems to have been given the worse deal of all. ""Whilst it is true that ships are now lifting sugar at Townsville, Lucinda Point, Mourilyan Harbour and Cairns, thus lessening the difficulties of the areas north of Inkerman, the port of Bowen seems to have been neglected. 1 ask the Minister in charge of the House to discuss this matter with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Shipping and Fuel, and to request that every possible endeavour shall be made to provide more adequate shipping facilities for the whole of north Queensland, particularly for the port of Bowen. At Inkerman, 12,500 tons of sugar harvested in 1947 is awaiting shipment, but there does not seem to be any immediate prospect of getting any further ships to l if t it. It is expected that the Inkerman mill will commence crushing in the first week in May. If the sugar left over from the 1947 harvest is not removed the mill cannot commence crushing and the whole of this year's cane will remain unharvested. That can only have the effect of creating mass unemployment among workers in the sugar industry, and in associated industries. I ask the Minister, with all the sincerity of which I am capable, to take this matter up with a view to providing as much shipping as possible to l if t raw sugar from north Queensland ports. [4.26] -The Herbert( Mr Edmonds) mentioned the accumulation of sugar in north Queensland ports, and the loss occasioned to primary producers by reason of this fact. He did not overstate the case. Loss is being sustained, not only in north Queensland, hut in every part of Australia, by both primary producers and the public Government cannot send ships. generally because of the sugar shortage. Always, as the season for processing fruit arrange to have the ships sent, as has been approaches, an attempt is made to hold up done before. It is unfortunate that the the production or distribution of sugar. Government does not institute some This is the third season in succession system of control to ensure that ports when the processing of stone fruits has are properly served with shipping. The been"" affected by a disturbance in the Government should also see that people sugar industry. The honourable member are made to do the work for which they referred to losses sustained by the sugar are paid. growers, and I am sure that he sympathizes with them, but he did not put his shortage of such essential materials as finger on the real cause of the trouble, namely, the apparent determination of the workers to go on strike. The workers have refused to load sugar for southern ports, and although attempts have, been made during the last few weeks to overcome the difficulty, sugar still fills the stores in the north, and the new season's crushing is about to begin. The strikers will not permit the sugar to be loaded because some paltry condition is uot satisfied. The Government should take a stand to prevent the wharf lumpers and other workers from inflicting such losses upon primary producers. The farmers, who have no forty-hour, week, suffer sufficient losses because of the vagaries of the seasons without having additional man-made losses inflicted upon them by those who set out to blackmail the primary industries. It is the responsibility of the Government to clear up the industrial trouble, so that preparations may he made for the new season's crushing. Accumulated stocks, amounting to 250,000 tons of raw sugar, should be shipped to the refineries. Already, for lack of raw sugar to process, refineries have closed down, and men have been thrown out of work. Soon, unless sugar is available, more workers will be unemployed, because the fruit processing factories will be unable to carry on. All these losses will be incurred because the Government does not l if t a hand to ensure that the ships sail. This is not a matter of loading ships for Indonesia; the ships are needed to carry cargo between Aushonorable member for tralian ports.

83,Mr Bernard Corser,"It cangalvanized iron, fencing wire, iron fencing posts, &c, so much needed by primary producers. In this connection, I draw attention to a reply which I received from the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), a reply which emphasizes the callous way in which he views the problems of the farmers. Frequent representations have been made on this subject, and Ministers invariably reply that the allocation of supplies is controlled by the States. We know that the State governments have assumed responsibility for distribution within their own areas of the quotas allotted to them, but it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to see that the quotas are sufficient to meet the needs of the people. Production has been so retarded by continual industrial strife in the iron and steel industry in New South Wales that persons with even the highest priority are a year or two years behind in obtaining supplies. In January last, I made strong representations to the Prime Minister himself by letter, and also in this House, asking him to arrange for the carriage of urgently required iron and steel products to Queensland by road. The right honourable gentleman was slow to reply, but on the 3rd February he sent me a letter which had a strong party political bias. The letter is as follows:Tn reply I desire to advise you that the production and manufacture of the goods mentioned in the communication received from the Stouth Isis Progress Association are not under Common weal tli control and are being produced entirely by private enterprise. many instances the reason for the insufficiency of supplies is on account of the shortage of manpower and materials and in other instances on account of not being able to secure sufficient supplies from overseas. The Prime Minister deliberately evaded the real issue, which has been raised so often by honourable members in this House, namely, that the shortage of iron and steel products is. directly due to the fact that men have been stood down because the materials have not been available upon which to work. The letter from the Prime Minister concludedPrivate enterprise is doing everything possible to meet the demand and in this regard the Government is assisting in every way within its power. The Government is not assisting private enterprise in this matter at all. It does Mr Bernard Corser. not l i ft a hand to ensure that the waterside workers shall shift iron ore on the waterfront for transport to factories urgently in need of it. It has failed to maintain continuity of adequate supplies of coal, and to prevent hold-ups, of transport services due to industrial unrest. On the other hand, the Government's inaction encourages industrial dislocation which has already resulted in colossal loss to the nation as a whole and has placed in difficulty producers in distant States who depend directly upon the production of heavy industry in New South Wales. The position is becoming worse. Recently, I communicated with the Co-ordinator-General of Public Works in Queensland with regard to the supply of roonng for a dwelling. In the distribution of roofing priority is given to buildings being constructed in certain areas and on certain classes of land, such as, movable black soil. The secretary of the Co-ordinator-General replied to my request as follows:By direction, I have to advise that since the dwelling in question is being erected in a black soil area, the use of galvanized iron is approved by this department. Accordingly, it is recommended that Mr. . . or his builder immediately lodge a definite order with a supplier for his requirements, ensuring that the priority certificate issued by the local authority accompanies the order for endorsement by him. It . is desired to point out, however, that the supply position of galvanized iron throughout Queensland still continues to be extremely acute and the limited supplies available are In not nearly sufficient to meet the heavy demands for the most urgent and essential approved purposes. Merchants in . . . and adjacent areas, in common with other suppliers, are approximately twelve months in arrears with deliveries of orders on behalf of clients, many of whom are in necessitous circumstances. I received that reply on the 11th Februrary last, and since then I have pressed the matter with the department. However, I read recently in the Brisbane press that the Premier of Queensland had visited Canberra for the purpose of making representations to the Prime Minister to make available to the Queensland Government supplies of roofing material for 500 State homes. The homes have been constructed for some time, but 500 of them were without roofs.

It is a matter which, I am sure, is agitating the minds of members of the Government, particularly that of the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard). As the years go on we find that the neurosis cases arising from World War II . are becoming more serious and more difficult to cure. Unfortu nately, despite that growing problem, there have been no dramatic developments in the treatment of mental wounds which,",31,Lawson Memorial Roots Are Obtained I N An Endeavour Relief Streptomycin To Purchase Mallee Roots From Land
84,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [4.45],"Iperhaps, are the worse of all war wounds. Neurosis cases have created a grave problem for the Department of Repatriation which, on the standards of the first World War, has been administered under a reasonably effective Repatriation Act, and has had a reasonable rehabilitation plan, and an adequate system of hospitalization. But the neurosis Cases from World War II. are different. They require a new outlook on the part of doctors, nurses, members of the various welfare organizations associated with our hospitals, and the public itself. The greatest anxiety is being experienced by the parents of young servicemen who, upon their return from the war, developed mental instability, and are now in institutions in which treatment is far from satisfactory, due largely to a lack of planning. The most serious injustice, to my mind, lies in the fact that war neurosis sufferers ment of Repatriation could take would are housed in civilian mental institutions. WhilstI admit that there can be no distinction between the suffering of civilians and ex-servicemen, we have decided as a general principle that ex-servicemen undergoing medical treatment, or convalescing, should be in the company of other ex-servicemen. In respect of neurosis patients this has not been possible, and the major trouble has arisen from the concentration of patients of all ages, and in all conditions, in one group. The State authorities who control the mental institutions are nonplussed and the Government and the Department of Repatriation have been Unable so far to cope with the problem. In the United States of America however, medical authorities have already come within striking distance of a solution. They have not succeeded in devising curative treatment for all cases-some of them are incurable-but patients into various groups. Some remarkable cures have been effected, and substantial progress has been made in the treatment as the result of scientific research. Unfortunately, so far as I am aware, the practice in this country is still to put war neurosis cases in Callan Park asylum in New South Wales, and in other civilian mental hospitals throughout the Commonwealth. are in the twilight stage of mental affliction are acutely conscious of the fact that Mr Haylen. they are in these institutions. It is most tragic for parents who have to visit these institutions to see their sons, some of whom are not yet 25 years of age whose mental affliction has developed from the concentrated service that they were called upon to give to their country in its hour of danger. Once these men have been declared to be in a certain state of mental degeneration, the Master in Lunacy assumes control of their estate. If a patient was in receipt of a pension, it is not transferable to his parents, either or both of whom may be in poor circumstances. Many parents who travel to the hospitals week after week, carrying special diet for their sons find the tram fares and other incidental costs a heavy burden. One immediate action that the Departbe to make some concessional allowance to parents who visit institutions in which neurosis patients are accommodated. There is an urgent necessity also for an improvement of the existing accommodation. WhilstI sympathize with the repatriation authorities in their problem of providing accommodation for these unfortunate ex-servicemen, I submit that war neurosis patients at least should be kept with ex-servicemen. As I said earlier, there can be no distinction between persons suffering mental affliction; nevertheless, psychiatrists recognize :the beneficial effects of having ex-servicemen amongst other ex-servicemen who understand them and can assist them greatly on the road back to health. Some of them unfortunately will never get back. Serious complaints have been made to me by some of my constituents concernthey have segregated ing the treatment of war neurosis cases at certain institutions under the present divided State and Commonwealth control. It is true that in some instances the warders looking after these young ex-servicemen are diggers of World WarI . and one would naturally expect them to be kindly attendants; but that is not always so. Some of them, because of their age, or for other reasons, are Patients who not fit custodians of mentally afflicted young ex-soldiers. I ask honourable members to imagine the feelings of a parent who spoke to me recently about her . son, who, before the war, to my own knowledge, was a fine young Australian undergoing a course in architecture at Sydney University. He is now suffering from mental deterioration which began in the Middle East and continued in the jungles of New Guinea. He returned to Australia a physical and mental wreck. He is a most intractable patient, and it is most tragic for his mother, who visits him twice a week, to know that after meeting her, he will not return to his room and has to be dragged there forcibly. I do not know what the remedy is in this case. The parent is quite reasonable about it, but it is most upsetting for her to be brought face to face with our rather rough-and-ready solution of a very serious problem. I have also been informed on the unimpeachable authority of the executives of the Burwood and Enfield branches of the Beturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia that shock treatment is administered to ex-servicemen in groups nnd that patients about to be treated have to stand and watch others undergoing treatment. I could not believe it until I made a check and found the statement to be true. One can readily imagine the fear engendered by such an experience. Most of the problems arise primarily through the shortage of staff at the mental hospitals. Unfortunately some attendants, and even doctors, are prone to consider this type of illness as a form of malingering. There is no true understanding of the mind of the sufferer. In addition, accommodation is poor. Recalcitrant patients are housed with the well-behaved. Then there is this undesirable practice of treating patients with others looking on. These problems must be tackled on a wide basis. They require a definite plan whereby the sufferers can be removed to some of the large country homes which at present are. unoccupied for most of the year. These buildings could be acquired and converted into sanatoriums for ex-servicemen. We should have representatives in other countries where considerable advances have been made in the treatment of these cases so that we may be aware of the most modern developments. We should be planning a scheme of welfare that would include, as it does in Britain, not only an organization for the treatment of these men, but also a village near the treatment centre where their parents or wives could live when visiting them. We have not begun to do anything about the treatment of the mentally wounded. It is ' not enough to say that they have to be put here or there because there is nowhere else to put them. Everything is possible when a nation is at war and after the war is over the treatment of those afflicted by it should not be niggardly. A complete plan, including the most important aspect of scientific research, to ensure the safeguarding against further deterioration and the improvement of the mental health of these young fellows ought to be devised. Those beyond scientific aid should at least live in circumstances commensurate with the sacrifices they made when they enlisted, ready to do whatever their country asked of them. The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) once referred to the establishment of "" worry "" clinics, which are necessary adjuncts to the treatment of war neurosis. The only "" worry "" clinic that I have seen in Sydney was established by ex-service organizations. It consists of a little room, nothing more than a cubicle, which, I think, would intensify rather than lessen the worries of a patient. The clinic is visited by doctors and the symptoms of patients are charted, but beyond that nothing is done, and if that is an attempt to establish "" worry "" clinics, it would be better to leave them alone. They must be provided on a more generous scale. I summarize my remarks thus: First, there must be better accommodation for these war victims; secondly, there must be scientific investigation of war neurosis; thirdly, as opportunity offers there must be a scheme for building more hospitals in which they can be treated and, fourthly, attention must be paid to an urgent human factor, namely, the problem of the parents. Their sons receive pensions, which are held in trust by the Master in Lunacy, but a temporary compassionate allowance should be paid to the parents to cover the costs of travel betAveen their homes and the hospitals at which their sons are undergoing treatment and the cost of extra food, dainties, which parents like to take to them. That would not place much of a strain on repatriation funds, and it would indicate to tlie people that we are aware of and are trying to solve the appalling problem of these young men. I approach what the Government has done in the rehabilitation and re-establishment of ex-servicemen in no critical mood. Indeed, it has done well. One instance of the good it has done is provided by the history of a young man in my constituency. His father is employed by the Mortlake gas works, and the best that he could have hoped for was that his son would complete his primary education and then get along in the world as best he could. The youngster however was able to stay at school until he gained the Intermediate Certificate. He then enlisted under age and went to the war. On his return, the re-establishment authorities took up his case and, with their assistance, he was able to matriculate and enrol at the Sydney University, where he is in his second year at the Medical School and is regarded as a star pupil. That story could be often told about other ex-servicemen, and it must be a great satisfaction to us all to realize that the reconstruction plan has succeeded. Criticism has been levelled against it, of course, because the field is so vast that there must be wide scope for criticism, even valid criticism. What concerns me is whether we are providing enough sustenance to trainees under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. Some trainees at universities and technical colleges frankly admit that the amount is sufficient, but there is a vociferous group that claims that it is insufficient. Between the two claims must lie the truth. We must consider whether the amount is adequate. The costs of re-establishment are diminishing. By 1951 we shall have paid war gratuities amounting to about Â£70,000,000. I suppose that payments on account of war pensions are increasing. We have, however, committed ourselves to the expenditure of about Â£80,000,000 on the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen and we had better not ""spoil the ship for a hap'orth of tar "". If the young men who fought for Australia are doing well in training for their chosen vocations in the trades or in the professions, we must ensure that they shall not lack strength in their struggle. The student who has had war service is not like the student fresh from a secondMr Haylen. ary school. . He was fighting the enemy for up to five years, far from the schoolroom atmosphere, and yet has virtually to go back to school to lay .the basis for his career. The five years that ex-servicemen have lost must be made up to them as far as possible. They are up against the time factor, always. To make a success of what we have begun we must ensure that they shall not suffer deprivations. I introduced a deputation on this subject to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), who .was astonished that some young Australians spent 10s. on amusements. His astonishment is more a tribute to his Scottish dourness and his achievements in this country than to his knowledge of what takes place amongst young people in Australia. They are living on short commons. Many of them have only the one suit to wear to the universities or the technical colleges. One student of dentistry at the Sydney University told me, in illustrating the development of a snobbish approach to ex-servicemen undergoing reconstruction training, that his professor had said to him that he could not fail him on account of his work, but that he would like to fail him because of his clothes. I wonder whether the professor would have objected to the clothes worn by that young man when he was in khaki with a pack on his back and a rifle on his shoulder. ber vouch for the truth of that? truthfulness of the man who told it to me, and I would not have repeated it had I doubted its truth. doubt of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale). I was astonished myself when I heard it, and so I made investigations. If the honourable member requires evidence of the fact that snobbery exists at the Sydney University, I refer him to what has been happening in the Medical School. The secretary of the British Medical Association, Dr. Hunter, said that we did not want any more doctors. .That was refuted by the Prime Minister, who said that we did need more doctors.

88,Mr Haylen,"I can understand themeant was, "" ""We do not want any doctors for the Government's free medical scheme when it comes in It was recently decided that first-year reconstruction trainees at the Medical School would be allowed no more "" posts"", and a by-law of the university was produced to show that that had always been the case. Whether the university authorities were generous or not I do not know, but, in 1946, if a medical student failed in one subject, or a group of subjects, all that he had to repeat was study of the subject or subjects in which he had failed, whereas now he has to repeat the whole year's course. There will not be any more of these soldier trainees, as a date has been fixed for the receipt of applications to come under the scheme. Few exTservicemen are beginning the medical course this year. There seems to be something wrong with the university attitude towards some ex-servicemen students. I have stated the facts as I know them"". I repeated the story of the dentistry student because I was asked to mention it, and, having investigated it, I believe it to be correct, although I have no sworn testimony to support it. That incident is symptomatic of what is happening at our universities. The points which I have raised in regard to the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen are worthy of consideration by the Government, and the plea for increased sustenance fees is of particular importance. The. value to the community of many hundreds of welltrained Australians cannot be assessed merely in terms of money. If the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme allowance is too small-and it is certainly very small-it should be increased. A period has been set to this training scheme. We know that, except for a few special cases, no new students will be admitted to universities under its provisions. Another serious aspect is that some craft crash. The statement made yesterstudents find the courses which they day by the Minister for Air( Mr undertake too difficult to complete. A Drakeford) made clear that proyoung fellow residing in my electorate visions governing the carriage of natives decided to study for a science degree. in the territory are much more humane In the first year of his course he to-day than in the past when, under the appeared to do very well. malaria and other afflictions not unparty governments, they were ferried by common to young ex-servicemen caused air from plantation to plantation, from his removal to hospital, where he remining plant to mining plant, from sea mained for some time. The result was that he began his second year of study well behind scratch. After a long conversation with the university authorities, he was advised not to persist with the course, but to undertake a different course of training at a technical school when he felt better in health. This was agreed upon, and he was advised by the Universities Commission that he would be permitted to terminate his studies. He returned home and awaited an opportunity to enter a technical school. During the month or more of waiting he was paid his reconstruction training allowance until it ceased at the direction of the Universities Commission. Before he commenced his technical training, he was informed by the commission that he was indebted to an amount of Â£20 or Â£30 as the result of over payment of his training allowance while he was not actually a student. He ignored this because he was obsessed by other problems arising from his illness and his plans for a fresh course of study, and, to his surprise, he was interviewed by a security officer. I asked some months ago that this sort of thing should be stopped, and action has been taken accordingly. Such practices in relation to the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen must not be permitted. Probably the visit by the security officer was only a routine check-up, but the law provides enough processes for the collection of debts without requiring security officers to engage in such work. I have mentioned all these matters because this House is the place in which to air them. I have been concerned for some time about the rehabilitation of natives in New Guinea. Australia has a trusteeship in that territory, and the eyes of the world are upon our conduct of its affairs. Last week we read of a tragic incident at Lae, where 37 natives were killed in an airThen administration of United Australia coast to sea coast, at so much per lb. The native was freight-jus t "" black cargo "". That was a most disgraceful state of affairs, and I am glad that the law has been amended to put an end to it. I believe that even the League of Nations in the past, and certainly the United Nations to-day, would criticize the employment of such methods of moving native labour recruits by a trustee power. I am glad that a modified form of recruitment of labour in New Guinea is operating to-day, thanks to the interests of the Minister for External Territories. We must realize that some people are still in New Guinea with the object of exploiting the natives and the country by persistcouncil in the territory as it existed ing with the old inhumane methods and therefore we must be particularly careful not to fall into the cornplacement belief that everything is well in the territory. I am satisfied that the Minister has worked valiantly to rehabilitate the natives, who had a very big share in the war-time campaigns in their own land. Many of them were detribalized, torn from their homes in the hills to work in labour gangs, to be organized by the Australian New Guinea Administration Unit, to be put into uniform in some cases. The trained natives in the constabulary served under arms, and they made a considerable contribution to the defence of the territory. The South Seas Commission has interested itself in the future welfare of New Guinea natives. It has reached the conclusion that the average diet is below normal and that tuberculosis due to nutritional deficiency is one reason why the native birth-rate is falling. Detribalization has meant that the natives are not living in a balanced world with a sensible economy. The attraction of the "" boys "" to the sea coast has had a very bad effect. Crowded nations near Australia, such rape the island of copra, rubber, and as India, China, Burma and Malaya, whatever other profitable crops it could which look with suspicion upon our White produce. A nation which is trustee of Australia policy, are represented at the such a territory should be concerned United Nations, and if we depart in any instead with the benefits that can be way from a high level of conduct in the brought to its people by means of sensible government of native races which are planning and human sympathy. under our control, we shall be castigated very severely indeed. The aircraft crash which I have mentioned has brought to Guinea during the war as ""fuzzy wuzzy our attention the fact that there are still angels,"". Yet such men were packed like breaches, in fact if not in spirit, in our cattle a few days ago into an aircraft Mr Haylen. code of treatment of New Guinea natives. The efforts of the Minister for External Territories to have natives trained to work as medical orderlies in their own villages and to produce profitable crops, such as cinchona and kapok, so that they may have money of their own are part of a well designed plan. We could not let anything interfere with our plans. In future discussions of foreign affairs in this House, we should pay particular attention to our duties to the natives as well as the white residents of New Guinea. I understand that consideration is being given to the recreation of the machinery of government by a legislative before the white residents broke off their peace-time pursuits in order to fight the Japanese. When local government is re-established for the white population, we must turn ourselves to the task of rehabilitating the natives. The story of our treatment of Australian aborigines is a sorry one, and we should be careful not to perpetrate the same mistakes of ignorance and neglect in the wider field of New Guinea. The suggestion has even been made from Japan, in one of those looselyworded statements that may have been official or just a "" furphy "", that Japanese nationals should be sent to Dutch New Guinea and British New Guinea as colonists. We must resist any such proposal to the limit, but we shall also have to answer for the way in which we administer our mandate. Therefore, we must do everything possible to ensure the welfare of the 1,000,000 natives of that territory. In the past, New Guinea was regarded as a field for exploitation. The general attitude in those days was that the white man should get as much out of the country as possible, that he should We referred to the people of New that was not airworthy and which crashed in the territory where some of our greatest victories were won. scarcely fair to the pilots of such aircraft. greatest co-operation from the Anglican to the pilots. were also killed. was referring to the fact that these natives were loaded on to the aircraft, not as passengers, but as cargo. That is a fair statement, and, in my view, the position is most unsatisfactory. The statements which the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford) and the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Ward) have made, cover this ground, but I desired, while I had this opportunity, to revive, in our minds, the dedication of New Guinea, which was our greatest battlefield in World War II . The country has more than exploitation behind it. It has the blood of men who died for Australia. It also represents a sacred trust to us, in that we have a subject racea dark race-to care for under our trusteeship from the United Nations. Those things are worth watching in view of what has happened at Lae. That is why I have referred to this matter. I shall now deal with a subject closer to home. Many years ago the Australian poet, Henry Lawson, died in New South Wales, and to our eternal disgrace, we have not yet erected a memorial to him near his birthplace, Mudgee. Hidden in the outer reaches of the Sydney Domain is a statue of Henry Lawson, with his dog by his side, looking back at the city in which he wrote so much verse. In the country, his former homestead is falling into decay. A man who purchased it said, "" I thought that it might be a historic memorial. The white ants got into the timber, but I let the chimney stand "". That is typical of our attitude to anything cultural in Australia. So, as a stark reminder of our indifference to Henry Lawson, there is only the remains of a chimney sticking up in the bush somewhere. When I was the president of the Fellowship of Australian Writers and before World War II . , an attempt was made to raise sufficient money to defray the cost of the construction of a seat outside the Church of England at Mudgee to the statement is memory of Henry Lawson. We had the I was not referring Church authorities, and assistance from the municipal and shire councils, but we were not able to collect sufficient money in New South Wales. The bulk of the amount of Â£250 which was required for I know that; but I the purpose, was subscribed by trade unionists-whar f labourers who were lovers of Henry Lawson, and members of the Australian Workers Union. Incidentally, the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson), who was formerly president of the Australian Workers Union, is a lover of Henry Lawson's works, and is able to quote his verse verbatim by heart. We collected the required amount of Â£250, but war broke out, and our idea of building a little seat, where Henry Lawson's mates and admirers could sit and discuss him, had to be postponed. When the war ended and we again approached the contractor regarding the work, we found that the price of this simple plinth of granite, with an inscription, had risen to Â£700. We have not been able to obtain financial assistance from the Australian Government or the Government of New South Wales. In response to our request, the Australian Government replied that it had no authority in relation to monuments in New South Wales. That is the present position regarding the proposed memorial to Henry Lawson. A memorial to the great poet in Sydney is buried among the gum trees, some distance from the area where the crowd generally gathers in the Domain. Whilst approximately 10,000 people assemble in the Domain nearly every Sunday afternoon and 5,000 of them listen to political speeches and the other 5,000 listen to the exponents of various forms of crankdom, the attendance at the Lawson Oration in the Domain has never exceeded 200. I return to the position at Mudgee, where we have not been able to erect this simple little memorial because of the cost. I mention, more in sorrow than in anger, that neither the Australian Government nor the Government of New South Wales",36,Lawson Memorial Roots Are Obtained I N An Endeavour Relief Streptomycin To Purchase Mallee Roots From Land

92,Mr Haylen,"has been able to cut through the mass of red tape in order to say, "" Let some one. do the work now "". We have erected a number of unworthy memorials and useless stone monoliths which do not count for anything, but the simple gesture of constructing a seat where the mates and admirers of Henry Lawson may sit and talk about our great Australian poet would be a fine thing for Mudgee and for Australia. I mention this matter as the last of my grievances in the hope that something may be done in this Parliament or outside it to make tardy recognition of one of the greatest native Australian "" singers "". beginning of this month, the public was informed that the Australian Government had offered a gift of wool worth Â£1,100,000 to certain countries in eastern and western Europe as a part of postTJnrra relief. Subsequently, a Government spokesman said that this gift would come from Australia as a part of the general participation in post-Unrra relief plans, and he addedThe Australian Government made the offer of relief in this form after it had been recomwas sent to Czechoslovakia to assist in the mended by a technical committee of the United Nations. This gift will be distributed on the following basis:-Italy Â£250,000, Poland Â£250,000, Austria Â£150,000, Greece Â£150,000, Hungary Â£150,000 and Yugoslavia Â£150,000. It is noteworthy that wool to the value of nearly Â£550,000 will be distributed among the satellites of Soviet Russia. No honourable member and no Australian citizen will object to the gift in the form of wool to Italy, Greece and Austria. We all know that great distress exists in Greece, where almost interminable warfare has been raging. Italy, in the words of Mr and partly to the Communist supporters Winston Churchill, has ""worked her passage back into the comity of democratic nations "" and I believe thatj to-day, Italy is in every way deserving of assistance. Austria, which is an ex-enemy country, is now under American, British and Russian control. The American and British zones are poverty-stricken. As I stated, no one will object to the gift of wool to Italy, Austria and Greece, but Hungary, Poland and Jugoslavia are in a different category. They are now the satellites of Soviet Russia, and I believe that the decision to make these gifts to those countries should be seriously reconsidered by the Australian Government. I shall give my reasons for that suggestion. I realize that the Government, like all honourable members, is most anxious to relieve in every possible way the plight of destitute people, subject to the overriding consideration that our kinsfolk in the United Kingdom have first, call on us for assistance, because to-day they are "" hard-up "" in every respect. Assuming that we can meet their needs to a large degree, it is only right and proper that we should also grant assistance to other deserving countries. However, serious objections may be raised to the granting of aid to certain countries. It is not as if we do not know what has happened to gifts which have been made in the past to the satellites of Russia. I shall cite some examples. Mr Byrne's book, Speaking Frankly, reveals--ver y frankly indeedwhat occurred in the distribution of gifts which the United States of America sent to certain European countries. A large quantity of machinery and plant, which rehabilitation of that country, was forwarded to Soviet Russia, and Czechoslovakia did not derive any benefit from the gifts. Even more recently, Czechoslovakia received from America a loan of approximately 50,000,000 dollars, hut transferred it at a profitable rate of interest to Roumania, and the Czechoslovakian people did not get one dollar of it -Unrra sent gifts to Yugoslavia, but advice received from a number of sources has revealed that the gifts, instead of -being given to the peasants, who urgently required them, were distributed partly to the Red Army of Marshal Tito. The Government now proposes to adopt the same attitude in regard to the recent war. We know that when Unrra was functioning and was supervising the distribution of relief in Yugoslavia and other satellites of Russia, relief goods were diverted from the people whom they were intended to assist. Now that Unrra has relinquished control of the distribution it is even more obvious that the goods which we send to central",39,Lawson Memorial Roots Are Obtained I N An Endeavour Relief Streptomycin To Purchase Mallee Roots From Land
93,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [5.20],"A t theEurope will not reach, the children and -the destitute people whom they are intended to benefit. Instead, they will almost certainly be diverted to serve Communist purposes, and may even be passed to the Russian army. I do not know who comprised the technical committee which made the recommendations to the Government on which this proposal is based, but I assume that the recommendations were made by persons of proRussian sentiments. the honourable member is discussing could be mentioned more appropriately during the debate on international affairs. to certain European countries which the Government proposes to make. ""What guarantee have we that the gifts will find their way to the people whom they are intended to benefit? What plans have been made to supervise their distribution ? Those questions should be answered satisfactorily before the goods are sent overseas. What other countries have made similar gifts? Has post-TJnrra relief been offered by the United States of America, Russia, South Africa or by any other British country? We all desire to succour the weak, and I have no objection to sending gifts to the destitute peoples of Europe. Nevertheless, I am concerned that the gifts should find their way to people for whom they are intended and not to their political bosses. Accordingly, I suggest to the Government that we may be able to alleviate the sufferings of the people of warnot available to treat all the cases which torn Europe by consigning wool to the camps for destitute refugees in western Europe. Those camps are filled with refugees from Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and other countries to which the Government now proposes to send wool. The inmates of those camps are still claimed as' citizens by the countries from which they fled, and quite recently some refugees were returned to Poland and other countries because of requests made by the governments controlling them. Since governments still regard those refugees as citizens, they should not object to their nationals receiving help from outside sources. If the relief goods were distriduring the war are unable to be treated buted in the way I suggest, Great Britain would also benefit considerably. At the moment the United Kingdom is responsible for clothing and feeding large numbers of refugees in camps in western Europe, and the receipt of gifts by the inmates of those camps would certainly lessen the demand which they make on Great Britain's meagre stocks. I understand that negotiations are to be conducted with the Governments of Yugoslavia and Hungary before the gifts are made, but I think that it would be preferable to do as I suggest. If the Government does not adopt my suggestion, it should, at least, ensure that the relief goods are distributed under proper supervision, so that we shall have the satisfaction of knowing I am discussing the gift that they will reach their proper destination. first matter which I propose to mention is the shortage of streptomycin, a drug which is employed in the treatment of meningitis and certain types of tuberculosis. I know something of this matter because I have been endeavouring to assist tubercular patients to procure supplies of the drug. Streptomycin is of great assistance to sufferers from tuberculosis, and I know of two or three patients who have been cured by its use. Most of the supplies come from the United States of America, and 17,000 drachms had been imported prior to the 1st July, 1947. Statistics are not available in respect of the quantity imported during the last nine months, but it is common knowledge that sufficient streptomycin is require it. I understand that licences are granted to import streptomycin under an arrangement that preference is to be given to the requirements of public hospitals and the Repatriation Commission, and that when the requirements of those institutions have been satisfied the balance is to be made available to general practitioners. However, general practitioners do not seem to be able to procure the drug, and this constitutes a serious weakness in the scheme of distribution. Of those who suffer from tuberculosis, by no means all are eligible to receive treatment from the Repatriation Commission, and many sufferers who were not in the armed forces with streptomycin.

96,' Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [5.27],"Th ethe United States of America restricts the export of streptomycin, and whilst the exact nature of Australia's present requirements is not known, it is obvious that sufficient quantities of the drug are not available. Some considerable time has elapsed since the Ministerf o r Health (Senator McKenna) has made any announcement matter, but I appeal to the M in ister representing him in this House to bring the matter to his colleague's attention. The drug is also made in Australia at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, but only, I understand, in small quantities for experimental and research purposes. I should like the Minister to explain why streptomycin cannot be manufactured in this country in sufficient quantities for distribution to hospitals. If it can be made for experimental purposes, surely it can also be made for general use. I urge the Minister to examine that aspect of the matter. The Government is to' be complimented on having in November, 1946, abolished the 15 per cent, import duty on this drug, which now comes into the country free of duty. It is to be hoped that the dollar shortage w ill not affect the importation of adequate supplies. Importsf r o m the United States of comic strips and syndicated material for magazines should be reduced rather than imports of streptomycin. applies to films. Streptomycin is vital to the health of people stricken with a terrible disease and should haye the highest priority in respect of imports from the dollar area. I do not think the problem of arthritis is being treated sufficiently seriously in this country. For nearly six years I visited hospitals weekly, and during that time. I saw many hopeless cases of arthritis. Those who suffer from the disease in an acute for m have a feeling of despair that I have not noticed in any other people except those afflicted with cancer. They are immobilized and unable to work. They have to be helped about the house, or, if they are in bed, assisted in all their activities. In many cases the disease need not have reached an acute stage had the problem of its treatment been dealt with more scientifically during the last twenty years. Arthritis immobilizes a far greater number of men and women in Australia than is generally realized. The removal of any person, whatever his in regard to this occupation, from industry because of arthritis means a loss of production. I suggested to the Minister for Health that Dr. Metcalfe, the Director-General of Health, should examine the methods for the treatment of arthritis used in GreatB ritain and see whether they can be adopted in Australia. The Ministeri n timated that he had instructed D r . Metcalfe to investigate the British methods of treatment before returning to Australia after attending a conference of world health organizations at Geneva. Recent issues of medical journals indicate that this problem is being attacked in B ritain in a more determined manner than in this country. There are no arthritis clinics in Australia. Sufferers from the disease in an advanced for m are almost pushed aside from the ordinary stream of life, and very little can be done to assist them. Treatment with drugs was attempted, but with little success. The drug ertron, for example, was used in Western Australia and, I understand, did not even reach the eastern States. Sufferers from arthritis who experience a sense of despair and W h a t about films? loneliness that it is almost impossible to The same remark understand deserve much more attention from our health authorities. BecentlyI asked the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr. Barnard) what action his department was taking in this matter. The honourable gentleman said at first that he thought that two of his officers who were shortly to go overseas would examine the problem in England, but subsequently he retracted that statement. In his last letter to me, the Minister saidI have since discussed the matter with the chairman of the Repatriation Commission, who has informed me that two specialists will be going overseas shortly, but that neither will be able or competent to undertake a complete inquiry, as arthritis is not their speciality. According to expert medical opinion, an inquiry into arthritis by an expert would take at least three months. I regret, therefore, that there does not appear to be any immediate",41,Lawson Memorial Roots Are Obtained I N An Endeavour Relief Streptomycin To Purchase Mallee Roots From Land

98,Mr Duthie,"prospect of medical practitioners attached to the Repatriation Commission assisting in your problem. It will be of interest to you to have the further information that was supplied to me -by the principal medical officer of the Repatriation Commission. He says that all forms of treatment for arthritis as recorded in overseas medical journals are already practised in Australia. I Lave not seen much, evidence of that in the hospitals I have visited. The letter continuedI t seems that a quick study could only be made by a practitioner with long experience of the treatment of arthritisa generic term covering a very wide field. In fact, two experts would probably be necessarya physician and a surgeon. Recent medical opinion is iu favour of the setting up of special clinics in larger centres, just as for tuberculosis, cancer, &c, where patients not responding to ordinary methods of treatment . may be sent. That is sound advice. I hope that when Dr. Metcalfe returns and makes his report the Government w ill he able to tackle the problem of arthritis w i th as much energy as the problem of tuberculosis is now being dealt with. I now wish to refer to the Commonwealth A i d Roads and ""Works Act. There is a movement among municipal councils throughout Australia for an increase -of the grant from the income derived from the petrol tax. The tax on petrol is now approximately 10^d. a gallon, and the revenue derived from it amounted to Â£15,750,000 in 1947-48. Of that sum, Â£4,500,000, representing 3d. of the lO^d. tax on each gallon, is allocated to the States. receive Â£1,000,000. That is an entirely . new allocation. The sum of Â£500,000 is .allocated Â£100,000 to the road safety organization, .and Â£9,650,000 to consolidated revenue for general purposes. The representatives .of many municipal councils in Tasmania have referred to the Government'9 action as a move in the right direction. Tasmania receives only Â£50,000 of the Â£1,000,000 allocated to local authorities, but each of the 49 municipalities is paid ,a sum ranging from Â£1,000 to Â£1,200. The scheme has now been in operation for nearly a year, and the municipalities ' realize that the sums allocated to them, .although a great help, are not sufficient to enable them to cope with their road problems. A new organization recently formed was called the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, which consists of representatives of all the municipalities of the Commonwealth. A deputation from this organization recently waited upon the Ministerf o r Transport ( Mr Ward) and presented a case for an increased grant in the next financial year. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) and I represented Tasmania. The deputation pointed out that the rates charged by municipal councils had almost reached the maximum impost that could be levied, having regard to the capacity of the ratepayers to meet them. Accordingly, there was no prospect of solving the real problem that confronts them by the imposition of higher rates. The only sensible source from which increased revenue could be obtained is from the petrol tax, and therefore the deputation urged that consideration be given to an increase of that tax when it is reviewed again by the Government. The local government rating system, which provides most of the revenue of municipal councils, was designed many years ago to meet purely local needs, including the provision of roads suitable for horse-drawn vehicles. The emergence of the motor vehicle as the normal means of road transport has created demands which are beyond what was originally contemplated. Better roads are needed for war and defence purposes in the national interest, as well as for ordinary purposes. Thus, the proMunicipal and shire councils vision and maintenance of roads has almost become a national responsibility. When this matter is again reviewed by to Commonwealth roads, the Government it should be looked at from that angle. Gravel roads giving access to the main highways are mostly under the control of the municipal councils, and are subjected to great strain by heavy and constant fast motor traffic. Many of these roads were constructed for traffic no heavier than buggies and gigs. In New South Wales, out of a total length of approximately 126,000 miles of roads, 101,171 miles are under the direct control of councils. In Victoria the corresponding figures are 105,000 and 100,700 miles, although in respect of approximately 12,000 miles of road some financial assistance is provided by the Country Roads Board. cipal councils to maintain these roads is an urgent matter. petrol tax an amount of Â£4,500,000 is allocated to the States for State ways, but only Â£1,000,000 available roads The the amazing fact that the greater proportion of the total road mileage is under the control of local authorities and that it would have been fairer to reverse the allocations, States authorities. lorries are used to transport the timber mills which have been established in towns linked -with the hydroelectric supply. establishing mills in the bush is being abandoned. established in towns where the workers live, and electric power is available to drive the machinery. tremendously increased haulage on roads which are constructed and maintained by the local authorities. hauled into the towns from the few outback mills that still exist. of tons of pulpwood are hauled to the railheads and to the paper mills at Burnie and Boyer. their activities, thus increasing the wear and tear on country roads traversed by vehicles bringing in timber-for The increasing use of heavy vehicles to move the potato crop is also damaging country roads. hydro-electric scheme is proceeding and heavy being roads which were not constructed carry traffic of that kind.

The honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller), who is a member of a municipal council, has stated that the municipal rates imposed in his district have reached their limit and that if they are further increased many farmers will be forced to abandon their farms. is also the case in many in Tasmania.

103,Mr Pollaed (Ballarat,"Ministe rthe contraction of the import demand for wheat by many of the large European importing countries. The export price of wheat in Australia fell from about 5s. in July, 1929, to about 4s. in July,'1930; but in July, 1931, it was only 2s. 3d. This contraction was brought about by the attempts of governments, with varying degrees of success, to protect their own producers from the worse effects of the depression; and, in the case of the importAustralian wheat in the United Kingdom ing countries, to increase domestic output fluctuated during the 1930's. of wheat in order to lessen foreign exchange difficulties and for other reasons. Nearly all these measures had the effect of restricting the free flow of trade, of piling up wheat surpluses and of increasing the pressure of these surpluses on an ever-dwindling market. During the five years 1932-37 world net imports of wheat averaged about 550,000,000 bushels, compared with about 650,000,000 bushels during the five years 1909-14 and 750,000,000 bushels during the ten years 1922-32. On the 1st August, 1933, and again on the 1st August, 1934, world stocks of old season wheat exceeded 1,100,000,000 bushels, against what was then a normal carry over of about 600,000,000 bushels. These large stocks were held principally in the United States of America and Canada. A succession of bad seasons in North America from 1933 to 1937 had the effect of removing the abnormally high stocks and a balance that proved to be temporary only was restored between world supplies and world demand. Prices recovered, but fell again in 1937 as world production increased. It had become evident by 1930 that world per capita consumption of wheat had ceased to increase. The demand for wheat in the main consuming countries had become inelastic, so that changes in world purchasing power conditions did not have as much influence on the demand for wheat as on the demand for industrial products and for many other primary products. It thus seems that in accounting for the fluctuations in the price of wheat, tralia was obtaining 19s. 6d. a bushel for much emphasis should be laid on the variation in supply. This variation, it was clear, came from changes in seasonal conditions and from responses to price changes by producers. When prices rose Mr Pollard. producers went into wheat production; when they fell many went out of it again, but only after they had suffered considerable losses. It came to be recognized, therefore, that wheat growing was very uncertain, and that whilst production sometimes gave satisfactory returns, very unsatisfactory prices inevitably followed. The following record of prices shows how the landed price of (Prices in sterling a bushel.) s. d.

Australian export price of wheat was around 2s.. Australian currency, a bushel. Some transactions took place at about Is. lOd. a bushel at this time. Two years previously the average f.o.b. price was around 5s., Australian currency. For some years after the outbreak of the recent war accumulated supplies and harvests were such that prices rose very slowly., At the end of 1943 the Australian Wheat Board's export price was 4s. l i d . f.o.b. bulk, for sales west of Suez and 4s. 7fd. for sales east of Suez. At the close of the recent war there was a worldwide food shortage. There was a delay in getting European wheat countries back into production. Prices obtainable by exporters rose to record heights until in November of last year the price on the Chicago market for the shortest term futures rose to 3 dollars 20 cents, the export equivalent for shipments from Gulf of Mexico ports being 3 dollars 30 cents, or 20s. 9d. Australian. At this time and for some weeks afterwards Aus-. its wheat. Later, the Australia Wheat Board increased its price to 20s. 6d. a' bushel. It is difficult to say precisely what ""world prices"" are, and it is clear that there is no world price in the pre-war sense. In normal times wheat was traded freely at exchanges in ""Winnipeg, Liverpool, the Baltic, in London, and at Chicago and Minneapolis. Now Liverpool and Winnipeg are closed, and the business at Chicago and Minneapolis deals largely with the huge American domestic consumptiona Canadian and Australian production put together. At the end of January of this year, when the negotiations for the agreement now before the House opened, Canada had a contract, entered into in 1946, to sell a substantial proportion of its exportable surplus to the United Kingdom up to the end of July, 1950. The price for deliveries during the year, the 1st August, 1947, to the 31st July, .1.948, was fixed at 1.55 dollars or 9s. 8d. ment will be asked to export. If a slackenAustralian a bushel in store Fort William/Port Arthur. For deliveries during 1948-49 the price is to be 2 dollars or 12s. 5d. Australian a bushel. In January, Canada was selling to other countries at prices around 3.25 dollarsabout Â£1 Australiana bushel, which were comparable with the United States export price. Australia had negotiated contracts with the United Kingdom and India for the sale of 105,000,000 bushels, at prices of 17s., equivalent to about 2.7 dollars a bushel, in the case of the United Kingdom and of 18s. 6d*, equivalent to about 3 dollars a bushel, in the case of India. The Australian Wheat Board's export price at the end of January was 20s. 6d. a bushel. The Argentine was selling at about 5 dollars or over SOs. a bushel. With all these varying prices, and with so little wheat being sold on a free market, it is clearly unsound to refer to a "" world price "" A world price, of course, means competition between suppliers. ""Now no competition exists. Where there is competition it must be expressed in comparable prices in the buying markets, whether these prices are brought back to f.o.b. for quotation or left c.i.f. Where a supplying country, taking Australia as an example, has one f.o.b. quote for all countries it is evident that there is no world price, since it means that each country is paying a different landed price for Australian wheat because of the difference in cost of freight. The Chicago market has been assumed by some to give world prices, but it is clear that this is not so when Argentina can obtain prices much higher than the export equivalent of the Chicago price. However, it can be said on the following reasoning that Chicago prices give a good figure exceeding the indication of the trend of the market. Chicago prices, in the main, over a period are influenced by the quantity of wheat the United States Government takes off the domestic market. This quantity is influenced by (a) current American harvests and known prospects of forthcoming crops and estimates of the quantity that the United States will have surplus todomestic requirements; and (b) by harvests in other countries which influence the quantities the United States Governing in demand on American export wheat reduces pressure on Chicago, prices fall there and American wheat for export falls correspondingly. As soon as there is sufficient wheat coming from other countries to cause an exporter to offer wheat in the same market as America, competition will arise. A world price will then be quotable, and in the different supplying countries quotes will be based on competitive landed prices in importing countries. I have gone into this poirt in some detail, because (a) the Australian Wheat Board was on sound grounds in establishing its export price as the f.o.b. Australia price which was equivalent to the c.i.f. United Kingdom price of American wheat shipped from the Gulf of Mexico;, (o) it illustrates how varying export prices of the different supplying countries will ultimately come together when competition returns, and, incidentally, how Argentina will be forced, as soon as world supply overtakes world demand, to reduce its export price if it wishes to dispose of its wheat; and (c) in assessing the price ranges contained in the agreement, it is correct to use the export equivalents of prices in Chicago as an indication of present values. It is further correct to say that the fall in prices of futures at Chicago, which took place in February last, though influenced to a degree by speculation and other elements-possibl y even by the negotiations for the agreement which were proceeding at the time-di d arise out of a reassessment of ideas of the conditions likely to obtain in future months, and particularly the revised estimates of the United States 1948 crop prospects and the possibility of bountiful harvests in Europe. With the accumulation of stocks in the late 'twenties and the fall in prices, growmade to work out a new agreement. The ing attention was being given to the possifall in prices during 1938 led to discusbilities of some kind of an international arrangement to bring greater order and stability into the international trade in wheat. The matter was considered at a conference held under the auspices of the International Institute of Agriculture, which met in Rome early in 1931. In May of the same year, Canada called a conference of exporting countries at which Australia was represented. At these meetings restriction of production was freely advocated and a sharing of the world market amongst the exporters was contemplated. Though resolutions were passed approving these principles, no governmental action was taken. Proposals for a conference again came from Canadian interests early in 1933. Following upon a conference of wheat growers, the Australian Government was asked through a deputation to support a conference of exporting countries. After several meetings in London at which restrictions of acreages and export quotas were fully canvassed, a scheme was drawn up by the four main exporters. This scheme was submitted to a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers on the 1st July, 1933. The proposed agreement dealt with limitations on exports by the four countries-in effect, export quotas-but it was designed to operate for two years only. The Danubian exporting countries also joined. The undertakings implied the use'of measures to limit production. quotas were based upon a net world import demand of 560,000,000 bushels. The conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers supported the proposals, and in 1933 a bill to give legislative effect to them was introduced into this House by the then Minister for Commerce, the Honourable F. H. Stewart, now Sir Frederick Stewart. The bill in due course became law. Mr Pollard. The agreement of 1933 did not operate successfully, mainly because of reviews required by Argentina, and the lack of obligation on the part of importers to accommodate their importations to the quotas of exporters. The International Wheat Advisory Committee that had been set up in 1933 continued to function, however, and intermittent attempts were sions of a possible conference. From January, 1938, to January, 1939, prices in Australia fell from 49. 3d. to 2s. 6d. f.o.b., and at one stage wheat on some Western Australian farms was worth less that Is. a bushel. On the 1st December, 1938, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation wrote to the then Prime Minister advising that it favoured an international conference. In January, 1939, the International Wheat Advisory Committee prepared a draft agreement and submitted it to governments for comment. In Australia the proposals were considered by a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. The main principles dealt with export quotas, ranges of prices, control of production, and maintenance of adequate reserve stocks. The conference approved the principles contained in the proposed agreement. Later, more concrete proposals were considered and approved generally by the premiers. Difficulty was experienced at the international meetings in reaching agreement on export quotas, however, and the outbreak of war interrupted negotiations. Following an exchange of views between their governments, officials of Argentina, Australia, Canada, the United States of America and the United Kingdom met in Washington in July, 1941. A preliminary report was submitted in The August, 1941, in which the principles of acreage control, price ranges and export quotas were again put forward. The Governments agreed that their representatives should meet again to work over the details of the proposed agreement. The conference was resumed in October, 1941, and met at various dates up to April, 1942, when a memorandum of agreement, to which was attached a draft convention, was drawn up and accepted by the Governments of Australia, Argentina, Canada, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. This memorandum amongst the four principal exporters upon quotas. Upon the basis of aggregate exports of 500,000,000 bushels, the percentages were, Canada 40 per cent., Argentina 25 per cent., Australia 19 per cent., and United States 16 per cent. From 1943 to 1946, frequent attempts were made to reach an agreement on price ranges for incorporation in an agreement for the stabilization of trade during the war and early post-war years. The stumbling block was always the price ranges, the United Kingdom being unable to meet the views of the exporters. By 1943, the Australian Wheat Board was in existence. It was constantly consulted by the department on details. One major difficulty that always arose was the basis for arriving at Australian, f.o.b. equivalents of the basic Canadian price. The attitude we adopted throughout-whic h was agreed upon between the department and the Australian Wheat Board-wa s that in sales for delivery to the United Kingdom and north-western European markets, we would agree to our f.o.b, price being based on our competitive c.i.f. position in the United Kingdom. In markets close to Australia we sought a higher f.o.b. price but one no greater than the Canadian f.o.b. This caused a lot of controversy though, as we shall see later, it was ultimately resolved in our favour. At the various discussions from October, 1941, to September, 1944, Australia was represented by the Secretary, at that time the Assistant Secretary, of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. Upon his return to Australia late in 1944, he explained the position at length to a special meeting of the Australian Wheat-growers Federation. At a further meeting of that body in Adelaide in 1945, he gave further details arising out of discussions then proceeding. in London and Washington in 1944 and 1945, were attended by the present General Manager of the Board, who was then Assistant General Manager. At the conference in London in March, 1947, it was made clear that Argentina would not be a participant, and a new approach was attempted, the new feature that was introduced being guarantees by individual importers to take specified quantities. Though agreement was not indicated agreement reached on all details, the principles stated in 1947 were used as the basis of negotiations at the recent conference in Washington at which full agreement was reached. This review of the various attempts which have been made over the past fifteen years to reach an inter-governmental agreement on the international trade in wheat clearly shows that in Australia the principle of such an agreement has been accepted by all interests concerned. Growers, through their organizations, have given it their support, whilst, at various times, governments of different political views, both State and Commonwealth, have clearly associated themselves with the view that should such an agreement be brought in, Australia, if satisfied on details, should participate. It remains for me to refer to the details of the agreement which are contained in the schedule to the bill now before the House. Whilst, as I have said, the approach is different from that contained in earlier drafts, it still contains the main provisions of those drafts. These are export quotas, and maximum and minimum prices, together with obligations in certain circumstances to provide minimum carry-over stocks. The agreement is not difficult to understand, but the following explanatory notes are submitted. The quantity of wheat covered by the agreement is 500,000,000 bushels, of which Australia's share is 85,000,000. Australia is bound to supply this quantity if it possibly can. If it cannot provide 85,000,000 bushels, the United States and Canada will be first asked to make up the discrepancy. If they cannot do so, then Australia is released from its obligations, provided that its failure is due to crop losses and is not due, for example, to having made large sales outside the agreeMeetings ment. If Australia has more than 85,000,000 bushels to sell, it may sell additional wheat outside the agreement, either to countries not parties to the agreement, or it may make increased sales to countries within the agreement. From conversations not yet on a formal basis, it is apparent that the United Kingdom, together with the colonies for which .Britain has assumed responsibility in the agreement, will require more than the quantity provided for it in the agreement -180,000,00 0 bushels. Some of this extra quantity will certainly be drawn from Australia outside the agreement. The 85,000,000 bushels is considered to be adequate. In fact, it was not considered that Australia would be justified, under the terms of the agreement, in seeking a higher figure. It is estimated that this will require an average harvest over the five years of about 170,000,000 bushels, and that an average of 180,000,000 bushels would not be an embarrassment. These figures, though they cannot be definite at present, are arrived a t as follows:Bushels. Domestic flour . . Feed .. .. 25,000,000 Farm retention, including seed . . . Export under agreement . . Export outside agreement 170-180,000,000 which I have already alluded to, were In the first year of the agreement it is certain that we will be able to sell all of our excess over the 85,000,000, and it is almost certain that we shall do so in the second year-August, 1949 to July, 1950-and that we shall enter into the third year of the agreement with a low carry-over. Even with heavy harvests, therefore, some increase of carry-over in the later years of the agreement could be accepted without difficulty. No provision is made in the agreement for restriction of production, but if supAustralia would get a lower f.o.b. return plying countries produced more than their quota, and other quantities they could sell outside the agreement, they might be forced to limit output. However, it should not be necessary for Australia to contemplate restriction of production during the course of the agreement. It is, perhaps, of some interest to comKingdom purchases for delivery to pare the export shares under the present agreement with those contained in the draft convention negotiated in 1941-42. There, Australia had an export quota of 95,000,000 bushels. This, however, re.ferred to total exports, and compares with 85,000,000 plus additional spies outside the present agreement. Some addiMr Pollard. tional sales are certain. Since 1941-42, also, consumption of flour within Australia has increased. Sales of wheat for poultry have also increased very heavily and, in view of our egg contract with the United Kingdom, this expanded outlet will continue to be effective during the period of the agreement. Under the 1941-42 proposals, Australia could have looked for average harvests of about 160,000,000 bushels, as against the volume of 170,000,000 to 180,000,000 bushels which I have mentioned in relation to the present agreement. In selecting a price range many bases were considered, but rather early in the negotiations in 1941-42, in fact Canadian sales were adopted as a basis, with equivalents to be worked out for .. 35,000,000 Australian and United States sales. Although this basis was reviewed at 20.000.000 different times, it was ultimately adopted. 85,000,000 The views of Australia in regard to the 5-15,000,000 treatment of sales to "" nearby markets "", accepted and given effect to in the formula set out in the agreement. This formula means, in effect, that in sales for delivery to the United Kingdom when prices are at the top of the range, Australia will charge the same c.i.f. as Canada, subject to any agreement for a difference on account of quality between Canadian and Australian wheat. As freight between Australia and the United Kingdom is greater than that between Canada and the United Kingdom, on the same c.i.f. price than Canada. On present freights, Canada would receive the maximum of 2 dollars or 12s. 5d. Australian, and Australia would receive 12s. The same price would apply to such European countries as Holland, Belgium and France. We might call this category A. In the case of India, and United Ceylon and Malaya, the Canadian c.i.f. price would be much higher than the Australian c.i.f.; consequently, when the Canadian f.o.b. equivalent was the basic price of 2 dollars (12s. 5d.), the Australian f.o.b. equivalent would be much higher-perhap s 14s. 5d. In this case, under the agreed formula, Australia will charge 12s. 5d., the basic f.o.b. maximum. Canada cannot compete in these "" nearby markets"" because its c.i.f. quote would be much higher than the c.i.f. equivalent of Australia's 12s. 5d. Thus, in sales to these countries Australia's maximum f.o.b. price will be a straight conversion from the Canadian f.o.b. to the same figure in Australian currency. This group of countries might bÂ© called category B. It follows that, over the whole of our exports, the return Australia will get on exports under the agreement will depend on the proportion of category A to category B. A fair estimate is one-third A and two-third B. On present freight charges and rates of exchange, this would give 12s. 3d. as an equivalent of the 2 dollars. If a quality differential of, say, 6d. were agreed to in the case of sales to the United Kingdom-ther e will be no quality differential for sales to nearby countries-the average would be about 12s. In the case of the minimum, much the same principles will apply, although in certain circumstances the Australian f.o.b. price for sales to "" nearby markets "" would come down to the minimum f.o.b. price for sales to the United Kingdom. In the case of markets equidistant from Canada and Australia-e.g. , Shanghai, when Canada is shipping out of Vancouver-it would be necessary for us to be able to come down to such a price in order to compete with Canada on a c.i.f. basis in those markets. However, where countries such as India, New Zealand, Java, Ceylon and Malaya want wheat, or flour, they will naturally come to Australia for it and pay the Canadian f.o.b. prices-converted , of course, to Auscan say what the severity or duration of tralian currency. Here, again, the actual minimum return overall, would depend upon the proportions of the 85,000,000 bushels that go to the different destinations. A fair estimate would be that, if prices fell heavily and reached the minimum of 1 dollar 20 cents throughout the fourth year, the average return would be about 7s., and that, if they went to the minimum of 1 dollar 10 cents in the fifth year, the average return would be about 6s. 4d. The calculations which have been used in arriving at these figures .are conservative. [30] Alterations of freight rates would affect sales in category A. If freights fell, our f.o.b. return would increase. If they rose, the reverse would be the case. Alterations in exchange would also affect these equivalents if such alterations affected the relationship between Australian currency and the Canadian dollar. A special clause in the agreement provides that, if the Canadian dollar depreciates on the American dollar, there will be no change in the basic prices. There is no commitment under the agreement that wheat shall be preferred to flour. In practice, Australian mills should be able to sell their full output. The United Kingdom allotment under the agreement covers flour for the United Kingdom, Ceylon, Malaya and British commitments in .respect of other colonies. The Netherlands quota includes flour for the Netherlands East Indies. These, with the requirements of the Pacific Islands, should keep our mills going. In the opinion of the Government, the agreement is essentially sound from the point of view of the Australian wheat grower. It is obviously difficult to assess any balance between concessions given and received by producers. It is true, of course, that in the first year Australian growers will make a monetary sacrifice; they will receive less under the agreement than if there were no agreement. This position might obtain also in the second year. It could even continue further. As time goes on, however, the risks the grower takes with no assured minimum become greater. When the slump comes-and all close observers say it will come sooner or later-the consumer will be the loser and the producer will gain. But no one the slump will be. Summed up, the agreement seems to strike a fair balance between the early contributions of the producer and the later contributions of the consumer. However, with heavy crops in all wheat countries, it could be a real boon to the producer. To my mind, its real service to the Australian wheat-grower is that it gives him security. While enjoying good returns, he may look forward for five yearsI personally hope the agreement will be renewed long before the expiration of five years-wit h confidence that he will not have to face disastrous price falls such as the wheat-growers of Australia have experienced in past years. In conclusion, I pay tribute to the Secretary of the Department of Comto whom credit for the successful conclusion of this agreement is due in large measure.

Debate resumed from the 21st April (vide page 1022), on motion by Dr. That the bill be now read a second time. [8.40] -We have before us, at long last, the threatened legislation in regard to the increase of the number of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and to the method by which the Senate will be elected. preamble to the bill sets out clearly the powers under which the Government proposes to increase the number of senators, and, through that, to increase the number of members of the House of Representatives. With that preamble one can hardly have any quarrel, because it is a recitation of what is contained in the Australian Constitution. The framers of the Constitution, rightly or fact, did give to this Parliament, and to this Parliament alone, the power to determine from time to time whether the number of members should be increased or decreased. They also prescribed two safeguards. The first was that no original State may have fewer than six senators, so far as I can see, the government of the and in tbe two bills now under consideraI t is customary, when we are considering legislation of a vital and far-reaching character, to compare it with the political policy of the government of the day. We heard a little about this aspect last night from the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), who referred to the Government's "" blank cheque "". WhatI should like to know is whether the Government will repudiate publicly the cheque which it has filled in and signed. If honourable members will examine the statement of policy of the Australian Labour party, they will see that for a number of years members of that political body committed themselves to do certain things in regard to the Parliament of the Commonwealth if ever they had a majority in both chambers. For several years after I became a member of the House of Representatives, I often heard from members of the Labour party, which was then in Opposition, laments-in fact, sometimes almost moans-that they could not do certain things that they wanted to do because they lacked a majority in both chambers. Their minds went back to the time when they had a majority in the The House of Representatives, but were in a",45,Speaker Hon J S Rosevear The Representatives Of The Governments Of

It is most interesting to note that the statement of policy of the Labour party to which you, Mr Speaker, among others, have subscribed, contains a section entitled, "" Amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution"" and under that heading is this objectiveTo abolish the Senate. The Labour Government, which now has a majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives and which claims to have been given a "" blank cheque"" by the electors to do what it likes, is now prepared to repudiate its own signature. Instead of abolishing the Senate, the Government now proposes to increase the number of senators by 66$ per cent. You, Mr Speaker, will be familiar with other interesting objectives of the Labour party, which are contained in its constitution. One of those objectives isTo invest the Commonwealth Parliament with unlimited legislative powers and authority to create (or re-order) States or Provinces with delegated powers. In the past, we have not heard very much about that objective, but I direct attention to another declaration of policy which the Labour Government repudiated in 1942. I refer to the statement that the Australian Labour party will "" assure that no Australian citizen can be conscripted for military .service"". under the heading of "" Constitution "", I find this objectiveNo imperial federation and no imperial honours for Australian citizens. If the Government adheres strictly to that objective, there may be regrets in some quarters next year. The Labour party also advocatesThe abolition of State legislative councils and State governors. A political party which committed itself publicly to these objectives, should at least attempt to live up to them. is the honourable member reading? official report of tbe proceedings of the seventeenth Commonwealth triennial conference of the Australian Labour party, held in the Trades Hall, Melbourne, on the 26th November, 1945. It was on the proceedings of that .conference, I believe, that the Labour Government was returned to office in 1946. Its policy is governed by the triennial conferences, which, I understand, meet shortly before each Commonwealth election, and give the Minister for Information and his colleagues their riding instructions for the next race, and tell them whether their mounts are to be black, grey or piebald. Towards the end of this document, there is an even more interesting provision relating to Commonwealth elections. I warn the Minister for Information that, in committee, I propose to test the sincerity of the Government on this issue. The policy of the Australian Labour party includes this provisionCommonwealth Electoral Act amendment to remove the existing disqualification of State members as Federal Parliamentary candidates, and the repeal of any Commonwealth law preventing the removal of the existing disqualification. Possibly the Government has overlooked that item of policy for the time being, and the Opposition might be beaten to the post, but, at any rate, I shall be interested to see how the Government faces up to these matters. its supporters may even allow the Governor General to run. might recover his old form. able member for Barker has been in Parliament long enough to know that the name of the Governor General must not be used for the purposes of influencing debate. introduce the name of the Governor General into this debate, and I have only just attained my parliamentary majority a mere 21 years as a member, first of the Parliament of South Australia, and now of the Commonwealth Parliament. The position of the Senate has deserved the attention of this Parliament for many years. In 1928, the Bruce-Page Government appointed a royal commission to",52,Evatt

From memory, I believe that the commission did not present its report u n t i l after the Bruce Page Government had been defeated at an election which followed the dissolution of the House of Representatives. A t that election, senators did not face their masters. The royal commission unanimously recommended that. proportional representation, should be adopted for the election of senators, but that recommendation was not made effective. ""When a new Senate was sworn in on the 1st July, 1935, the Liberal party and the Australian Country party had 33 supporters, and the Labour party had three. In the present Senate that position is reversed. On both occasions, however, the three senators constituting the Opposition have represented Queensland. In 1935 the only Labour elected were those elected to represent Queensland. the President Brown), those days. For three years there was no effective Opposition in the Senate. ever, amongst the senators who supported the Government of that day were certain gentlemen, including two or three from South Australia ber, who scrutinized proposed measures of their opinions and those of their electors. Opposition in the Senate comprises only three members, and within the ranks of the Government supporters in that chamber there is not one who is prepared to step outside the narrow lane of political opinion prescribed for him by the Australian Labour party. did pass beyond that narrow avenue I have no doubt that an untoward would overtake him. General (Dr. Evatt), who introduced the measures now before us, had declared that the Government from its publicly professed policy of providing full employment, understood him, because no one to-day can contend that the Senate is either or gainfully employed; in fact, because of its present political composition, it is virtually an unemployed doubt a good deal of dissatisfaction Mr .Archie Cameron. heart-burning is experienced by Government supporters in. the Senate because they are not afforded an opportunity to express their views on many matters. Because they are not permitted to express themselves as freely and as often as they might, they cannot avail themselves of the publicity secured by the .broadcast of parliamentary proceedings as much as they wish. One does not need to be a clairvoyant to realize their feelings. The Government now contends that a Senate of 36 members is not sufficiently large, and that its membership should be almost doubled. Of course, that contention completely overlooks the fact that during the first parliamentary sittings held this year the Senate was not called together at all, and that it hasmet for only three days during the present sitsenators tings. It is now in recess and will not resume until next week. The GoIncidentally, they included vernment has completely disregarded 1 of the Senate (Senator that fact, and instead of formulating who was very vocal in some reasonable plan for the reform of the Senate, it proposes that the number of Howsenators shall be increased from 36 to60 at the forthcoming elections. The method of election which the GowhomI well rememvernment proposes has my support; invery carefully deed, I have always supported the prinlegislation and subjected ciple of proportional representation sinceto criticism in the light I have taken an active part in politics. Furthermore, the South Australian At the present time the Country party has consistently supported that principle and has advocated its application to the election of senators. Therefore, I still believe that the introduction of proportional representation would be a worth-while reform. Theadoption of that system for election of If any of them the Senate would give that chamber the only chance that it will ever have of befate coming a reasonably useful legislative If the Attorneybody. Furthermore, the application of that system would result in the election cf a politically balanced chamber, behad decided to depart cause the party which held the majority of seats would have sufficient power, and I could have the party, or parties, whose members were in the minority would have ample fully opportunity effectively to express their views. A f t e r all, that is the very basis of democratic government. Under such chamber. No a system, the majority can rule, but and the minority is represented according toits numbers, and is able to express its views on every matter which comes up for consideration. The political situation presented by the present composition of the Senate is one of some difficulty. I tended, that the adoption of the system of proportional representation at this stage would ensure a majority of supporters of the Australian Labour party ir. the Senate for three years after the next elections. I believe that that is a reasonably sound assumption. Nevertheless, when one has regard to the fairly even balance of the adherents of the poliwho precipitated a double dissolution on tical parties in the community, it is unlikely, since seven Senators are to be elected by proportional representation for each State, that any party, or combination of parties, will secure more than 24 of the to that of the ""no election party"" or the 42 seats to be filled. I propose to consider now the effectivetion ( Mr Drakeford) who observed last ness of the Senate. That chamber cannot initiate money bills, cannot impose any tax, and cannot amend any bill which would impose a tax or authorize the expenditure of public money. ""When such a measure comes before the Seriate, all that it can do is to pass the measure, reject it entirely, or return it to this House with a request that certain provisions be reconsidered or certain amendments be made. However, from my experience of the Senate and my knowledge of its history, I believe that no government is ever likely to be seriously embarrassed by it. Although constitutitionally it may be able to bring about a double dissolution of the Parliament it has only done so on one occasion in its history. The result of its action on that occasion was such that the political parties represented on this side of the House have no reason to feel proud of their action. The elections of senators on that occasion resulted in the return of 35 Labour adherents and only one candidate of the opposing parties. Indeed, I believe that the election of the one non-Labour senator, who was returned for South Australia, was nothing more than a political accident brought about by the sudden death of Senator MacGregor. Labour supporters and five non-Labour There is no need to resort to random supporters were elected to the Senate. the correction in regard to the numbers, although it does not affect the substance of my contention. The fact remains that a legislative body, elected on the basis of It may be contended, and adult franchise, which is so unbalanced! believe that it has been conin its composition cannot discharge its : normal functions in the manner expected' of it by a democratic community. Should' the general elections to be held next yearresult in the return of a majority of non-Labour members of this House, the Australian Labour party will still command/ a majority in the Senate. However, in view of the unhappy fate of the. senators the occasion to which I have referred, I believe that its supporters in that chamber will change the title of their party "" no double dissolution party "". I think that it was the Minister for Civil Avianight that a general election, conducted under the system of proportional repre>sentation, which has been occasioned by a double dissolution, will not result in the representation of any party being entirely obliterated from the Senate. Nevertheless, the tendency of electors to change their political allegiance, and even to change their representatives without forsaking their particular party, was clearly illustrated in the last elections for the Tasmanian Parliament. Therefore, adoption of the system of proportional representation will not assure any member of the present Senate that he will necessarily be chosen by his party to contest an election under its aegis. There are certain features of the Government's proposals with regard to the system of proportional representation proposed to be adopted which I should like explained when the bill is in the committee stages. However, I make it perfectly clear now that I do not agree with the remark made by the Atterney-General, in the course of his speech, that candidates may be selected at random in order to complete a voting "" ticket"", and that they may be elected simply because of the mechanics of the tactics such as those which are sometimes",53,Evatt

115,Mr Archie Cameron,"I acceptemployed in poker schools. That is unnecessary and indefensible, and should not receive the support of the House irrespective of the source from which the suggestion emanates. I propose to say something now with regard to the terms for which it is proposed that the new senators should be elected. I have always been under the impression that I can comprehend any idea which is expressed in reasonably clear English, but I must confess that I cannot even pretend to understand the 'meaning of sub-clause 4 of clause 5 of the Representation Bill now before the House. I should have thought that any competent draftsman could have expressed, in approximately six or seven lines of type, a clear conception of the Government's proposal. By its proposal to increase the number of senators from 36 to 60 the Government will increase the number of representatives of each State from six to ten. The Constitution makes it quite clear that the Parliament may make whatever provision it likes in regard to filling the places of senators. Therefore, if we follow the procedure which was adopted at the first election of the Senate, and at the election following the only double dissolution which has taken place, it stands to reason that the candidates who arc first declared elected will serve a longer period than their colleagues There will be only two senators, the sixth and the seventh, who will serve for the shorter term, that is, from the day of the first meeting of the Parliament until the 30th June, 1953. I have read this bill several times and discussed it with many people, but I am still unable to determine whether the sixth and seventh senators retire on the 30th June, 1953, or whether, in the event of their being sitting senators, they do not retire until the divisions represented by members of the 30th June, 1956. That should be explained so that there will be no misapprethat proper attention cannot be given to hension.

That, of course, applies to who do not seem to be able to get outthat there should be a considerable inThe largest electoral division in Australia crease in the number of members of the -and I believe in the British Empire Mr Archie Cameron. House of Representatives. I have never accepted that contention. I do not think there is any necessity for an increase in the number of members of this Parliament. That is not a decision I have arrived at lately. In its relations with the Australian people the Australian Parliament stands in a different position from the Parliaments of the United Kingdom, the Dominion of Canada, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Union of South Africa. In each of those countries the dominion or Imperial Parliament is supreme. In New Zealand and Great Britain the Parliament possesses 100 per cent, of the legislative authority, and in Canada and South Africa the Parliaments have all the legislative authority not specifically handed over to the provinces by the Constitution. The position in Australia is the exact reverse of that. Section 51 of the Australian Constitution gives specific powers to the Australian Parliament, and all powers not mentioned in the Constitution remain the legislative province of the States. The Australian Parliament, therefore, is one with limited responsibility and authority. Its authority is so limited that since the conclusion of the recent war and to some extent before then the history of the present Government is one of almost incessant attempts in the High Court to prove that the scope of section 51 of the Constitution is much greater than many people in this country are prepared to concede. In those circumstances it is reasonable to say that members of this Parliament in their relationships with the Australian electors are not in the same position as the members of the other parliaments to which I have referred are to people whom they represent. It has been argued that the electoral Australian Parliament are too large and them. I am not prepared to concede that that is so. The electors of the Diviopinion that I am better able to do the every honourable member of this House. so far as area is concerned-is Kalgoorlie, whicli is now represented by the Minister for the Interior( Mr also argued that a bigger Parliament Johnson). If this legislation is enforced strictly, the Kalgoorlie division will have to be increased in size. There are just over 36,000 persons on the Kalgoorlie electoral roll. According to the official figures circulated by direction of the Australian Government, Western Australia will have eight seats and 320,000 electors. Although the quota will be reduced to 40,000, Kalgoorlie will fall short of it by nearly 4,000. the census would have compelled the Kalgoorlie division to be enlarged in any case. the same will apply to the Kennedy, Wakefield and Grey divisions. This legislation will not affect the Grey division materially as far as area is concerned. All that will happen will be that Yorke Peninsula will be excluded from it, but the division will still extend from Port Lincoln to the Northern Territory and from the vicinity of Hawker to the Western Australian border. I ask honourable members to study maps showing the divisions of Wakefield, Darling, Maranoa and Kennedy. It is stupid to suggest that the size of the divisions will be materially reduced if this _ bill becomes law. The size of my own division of Barker, with about 70,000 electors, will not be much altered. There is little substance in that argument. It has been argued that a larger Parliament will mean better members, but I contend that that is a false argument. I ask honourable members to consider the House of Commons in Great Britain, the House of Commons in Canada and the Congress of the United States of America. Does it follow that because there are 640 members of the House of Commons in Britain, they are better men than honourable members of this House? There are approximately 240 members of the Canadian House of Commons, but is the average standard of the Canadian members higher than that obtaining in this Parliament? If the number of members of this Parliament is increased, much the same type of member as at present will be elected, and the only difference will be that the number will be greater. It is means a better ministry. I do not believe that statement to be true. The history of ministries in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and everywhere else shows,as a former member for Wakefield said, that no ministry can carry on successfully if more than about 35 per cent, of its members are other than passengers. In all ministries there has to be someone to go out to show the flag and to discharge the functions of leadership, and the other ministers do the drudgery and the administrative work without which no ministry can carry on. That is true of ministries whether they consist of 10 or of 25 members. I am not a betting man, but if I were I should say it was fair bet that if the number of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate is increased, the next Government, especially' if the Labour party has a majority, will"" discover that there are not enough Ministers and that the number should be increased. For what it is worth, I should like some member of the Cabinet, preferably the Prime Minister, to declare to the country that an increase in the size of Parliament will not mean an increase in the number of ministers. As the ministerial team is organized at present, I should say that the principle of unemployment in the Senate nearly applies to the ministry as well. It would be enlightening to hear what the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) does except to move the "" gag"" and why, under present conditions, there are five Ministers dealing with service matters. There are other problems to be considered, and I do not know whether the Government has devoted any attention to them. One, Mr Speaker, affects your own department particularly. Assuming that you will be occupying the chair in a House of Representatives with some 120 members, I ask you whether there will not need to be a serious review and amendment of the Standing Orders and of the general conduct of business in this chamber. A question time limited to an hour at the most, and often less than that at the will of the Prime Minister, will afford very little opportunity for",55,Evatt

117,Mr Archie Cameron,"Muchhonorable members to ask questions without notice. If we are to ensure that the enlarged Parliament is to function we would do well to examine closely the method adopted by the British House of Commons, under which questions without notice may not be asked except on certain days. I do not express my opinion very loudly about some questions that are asked now because some of mine might come under the classification, and rightly so, of being somewhat disorderly. There is also the question of the passage of bills. Is it the belief of the Government that, with a House of 121 members, we shall be able to devote, in a committee of the whole House, that consideration to legislation which ought to be devoted to it if it is to stand the test of experience and of contest in the courts? If the number of members of this House is increased there will have to be evolved some method under which many bills are referred to certain committees which will deal specifically with them. There will have to be au acknowledgment of the method which, I understand, is employed in the House of Commons and in other legislatures, under which there is no debate on what is known as unopposed legislation. If bills which are introduced do not meet with hostility from the Opposition, there is no point in having a long debate on them. Both you and I , Mr ticable, twice the number of the Senators. Speaker, could recall instances in which legislation has been passed by this House very slowly and painfully, despite the fact that not one speech was made in opposition to it, members merely talking to their electors. I am not questioning their right to do so but I am questioning the capacity of the House to tolerate the continuance of that practice if , after the next elections the number of members is to be increased by 56. I have dealt with a few of the matters which I think are important from the general point of view of honourable members. They are matters which, if they do not receive the attention of the Parliament at this stage, will force themselves upon the attention of the Parliament as soon as the legislation now before us has received the assent of the Crown and has been put into operation. listened with very great attention to the expressions of opinion by honourable members opposite relative to electoral reform. The apologetics indulged in by them were truly astounding. Each of them has said in effect, "" I do not know why we did not do something about electoral reform years ago, but if you do anything about it, we will vote against your proposal"". Now that the Government has seen fit to apply itself to the problems of electoral reform, every conceivable kind of bogy is raised by them in an endeavour to terrify the people. It must be remembered, however, that the method by which we propose to enlarge both the Senate and the House of Representatives, was not chosen by the Government as a free entity but was laid down in the Constitution by our fathers, in an attempt to rule us from the grave. In order that the people may know the difficulties with which we are confronted it might be well for me to read section 24 of Part III . of Chapter1 of the Constitution, which deals with the constitution of the House of Representatives. The section reads as follows:The House of Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly as pracThat is the first provision specifically laid down for us by our fathers. was the number of members fixed as twice the number of the senators? what the Constitution provides. In pre^scribing the manner in which a quota shall be ascertained the phrase, "" twice the number of the senators "" is again used. Having ascertained the quota, the number of members to be chosen in each State is determined by dividing the number of the people of the State by the quota. The Constitution, which was written almost half a century ago, in addition to prescribing the machinery by which the number of members to be chosen in each State shall be determined, contains the following extraordinary proviso:But notwithstanding anything in this section, rive members at least shall be chosen in each original State.",57,Evatt

Even to-day, half a century afterwards, there are only 250,000 people in that State, and but for this extraordinary proviso, the number of members noAV representing Tasmania would at most be only three. The machinery for determining the number of members to be chosen in each State which is specifically laid down in the Constitution is inflexible. We are hamstrung by it . Whether we like it or not, if we desire to enlarge the membership of the House of Bepresentatives we must also automatically enlarge the membership of the Senate. It is proposed to elect senators to the enlarged Senate by the Hare-Clark system of proportional representation. It is amazing that while every honourable member opposite who has spoken on this subject has admitted that a reform of this kind is desirable, no attempt was made by governments which they supported to bring about such a reform even when they had a majority of 35 to 1 in the Senate. Now that we propose to do something about it we are subjected to severe criticism. Honourable members opposite have raised all kinds of objections to the Government's proposals, not only on the floor of this House, but also elsewhere. Though they have said that thi9 Government has no mandate to enlarge the Parliament, they have made it clear that had either of the two opposition parties been returned to office, it would have had to do the very thing which they say this Government has no mandate to do. On the 2nd of August, 1945, the Melbourne Herald, the handbook of the Liberal and Australian Country parties, published this statementThe proposal to enlarge the Federal Parliament to about double its present size, which is now included in Mr Chifley's election programme, was last put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Menzies, before the 1944 referendum. The writer went on to say that the Prime Minister had suggested "" the enlargement of the Federal Parliament to about double its present size "". The principal argument advanced by the Leader of the Opposition last night was that this Government had no mandate for its proposals, but that because he had referred in this House. I to the desirability of increasing the size of the Parliament in his policy speech, he Tasmania at the time the would have had a mandate to proceed with his policy of reform had he been returned to office. The Government, therefore, has a clear mandate from the people to bring about this desirable reform, and to proceed with thisproposal in accordance with the machinery laid down in the. Constitution.

But how else could we constitutionally enlarge the House of Representatives? Honourable members opposite know that the Constitution provides that membership of the House of Representatives shall be as nearly as practicable twice that of the Senate. They also know what scant consideration a referendum on the abolition of the Senate would receive from the Australian people at present.

127,Dr. Gaha,"My honourable friendsthe moronic level. The membership of the House of Representatives can be increased only in accordance with the Constitution, and an increase of its membership automatically entails an increase of the Senate membership. By referring to the fact that, under this proposal, Tasmania will not be entitled to more members of tbe House of Representatives, tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), who, unlike so many of his colleagues, has some claim to intellect, has drawn Tasmanian members into the debate. It is not the Government's fault that under present conditions Tasmania cannot be given increased membership of the House of Representatives. A government composed of honourable gentlemen opposite could not constitutionally allow Tasmania more members. The Parliament should increase the membership of the House of Representatives to 121 and of the Senate to 60 and then ask the people at a referendum held conjointly with the next general elections to eliminate section 24 of the Constitution, which sets out the constitution of the House of Representatives, with a view to inserting in its place a provision specifying the number of representatives of each State in the House and that the total membership shall be, say, 150. That would enable Tasmania to have three or four more members in the House. I do not see why it is necessary for membership of the House to be fixed mathematically. It is evident that the' framers of the Constitution did not favour a mathematical basis, because they decided that Tasmania was entitled to five members, notwithstanding that, on a mathematical calculation, that State would, at the time, have been entitled to only two members. I am aware that, under this legislation, Tasmania will have more representation in the Senate, but I think it is also entitled to more representation in the creative house. I believe that if the people had before them a proposal that each State should have a specific number of members in the House they would be fully aware of what they were voting on and would agree to it. I do not imagine that the people in the less populous States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania would vote against their having more representation in the House of RepresenDr. Gaha. tatives. I am certain that the people of Tasmania would prefer eight or nine members to five, and that the people of Western Australia and South Australia would welcome greater representation than they have now or will become entitled to under this legislation. I cannot imagine that the people of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland would vote against such a proposal, because their position would not be endangered. ment already has power underthe Constitution, without the need for a referendum, to increase the representation of Tasmania. honourable member cannot get away with that. Another reason why the Prime Minister ought to examine the provisions in the Constitution relating to the Parliament is that section 15 provides that if the place of a. senator becomes vacant before the expiration of his term of ser 7 vice, the Houses of Parliament of the State for which he was chosen shall choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the term, or until the election of a successor at the next general election. I propose to illustrate how that may work out under the Hare-Clark system. Assume that after the next general elections Labour had 31 seats and the Opposition parties 29 and that three months later two Labour Senate seats became vacant in States where Liberal governments ruled, as could easily happen. The parliaments of those States would nominate Liberals to replace the Labour senators whose seats had become vacant. That would mean that the Liberals would have 31 senators as against Labour's 29 when, in reality Labour had won 31 seats at the general elections. Such a position would be untenable, because in those circumstances, following the death of two honourable senators the Governments of the States which they represented could, in effect, reverse the state of parties in the Senate and thus defeat the will of the electors. The HareClark system provides that in such circumstances vacancies shall be filled by candidates who polled the most votes cast for unsuccessful candidates at the preceding general elections.",59,Evatt

129,Dr. Gaha,"That is not so. Thetion does not contain such a provision. The Government should give urgent consideration to providing for the eventuality -which I have indicated, because in that way vacancies would be filled, not by the appointment of nominees of State Parliaments, but according to the choice expressed by the electorsin the States concerned at the preceding general elections. I urge the Attorney-General to give serious consideration to my suggestion that the Government should seek an amendment of the Constitution by deleting section 24 and by making specific provision to permit of an increase of the number of members that may be elected to the House of Representatives by a small State like Tasmania when an increase of the population of the State warrants such action being taken independently of considerations applying to the Commonwealth as a whole. That would be in accordance with the principle which the framers of the Constitution had in mind when dealing with the Constitution of the National Parliament. Such a provision would give great satisfaction to the people of Tasmania as a whole, and would do justice to the less populous States. My second suggestion is that the Government should adopt the principle of the Hare-Clark system in respect of the filling of vacancies which may occur in the Senate and thus ensure the expression of the will of the electors in the filling of such vacancies. Although one usually listens with interest other vital issues. I can see no reason to speeches made by the honourable member why the Government should not take the for Denison (Dr. Gaha) in this chamber, opportunity which will be presented at the arguments which he presented to-night the approaching referendum on rents and were very weak.

As the tion. The Minister for Information ( Mr result of certain happenings during Calwell), with the same purpose in view, also quoted articles from Sydney metropolitan newspapers. I challenge any honourable member who represents a Queensland electorate to produce one report published in a Queensland newspaper that the Labour party, at the last general elections, indicated its intention to introduce this legislation. The plain fact is that at the last general elections the people were not made aware of the Government's intention. No Labour party candidate, at that time, advocated enlargement of this Parliament. Such tactics, of course, run counter to the accepted practice in this country that a political party discloses all of its intentions in the policy speech of its leader and that the party which succeeds at the polls will not introduce, during the life of the ensuing Parliament, legislation which has not been forecast in its leader's policy speech. However, we again find this Government ignoring the will of the people just as it refused to consult them on the nationalization of banking. The honourable member for Denison asked what would be gained by submitting this issue to the people, and he added that obviously the people would turn down these proposals. That sums up the attitude of the Government towards the will of the people. Similarly, after the people of Queensland decided, by a large majority, against the State Labour Government's proposal that the Upper House should be abolished, Mr E. G. Theodore, who was then Premier of the State, ignored that expression of the people's will and abolished that chamber.

132,"Mr Adermann"" (Maranoa) [9.34]","the life of this Parliament, it is obvious that the Government would have little hope under the present representation system of being returned at the next general elections. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), in his second-reading speech, -endeavoured to justify this legislation on the basis of the increase of the population of Australia since federation. Of course, our population has greatly increased during that period. I was surprised that he did not try to justify the enlargement, of the Parliament also on the ground that the volume of work of honourable members individually has increased considerably since federation. On that point, I support the views expressed by the .honourable member for Barker( Mr ment's legislation. Unfortunately, the Archie Cameron). I do not believe that ^an increase of the number of members -of either this chamber or of the Senate -can be justified on that ground. The Government is undertaking work which :more properly should be left to those -engaged in industry. In the sphere of primary production it has taken complete control of matters, particularly the marketing of primary products, which should be left to the producers themselves, and could be carried out more effectively by producer-controlled boards. The Government is also interfering unduly in the control of housing materials. The present shortage of building materials is only temporary, in the sense that it could be rectified by a government which would refrain from harassing private enterprise and preventing it from increasing the production of urgently needed commodities. Such a government would encourage increased production by reducing taxes. Clark) I ask the honourable member to will mean industrial domination. I do confine his remarks to the question before not suggest for a moment that the great the Chair. ing to show that the work of members of the Parliament, but, under this scheme, Parliament individually has not increased the representation of the cities of Sydney to a degree that would justify enlargeand Newcastle in this chamber will be inment of the Parliament. As the honorcreased from 16 to 29. able member for Barker has pointed out, heard it said that the increase will be the majority of Ministers have, in fact, from 18 to 31, but, so far as I can very little work to do at present. That ascertain, the figures that I have given is only too evident. The principal objects of this legislation of Melbourne is to be increased from are to increase the number of members of 12 to 22. Therefore, of a total of 121 both chambers and to provide for theelection of senators on the basis of proportional representation. Frankly, I agree with the latter proposal. Under the present system it is possible for a large body of electors-anythin g up to 49 per cent -to be without representation in the -Senate. A strong opposition in a Parliament always makes for better government because it can.prevent the Government from becoming too smug and complacent. I am not referring specifically to any political party when I say that a substantial and enthusiastic opposition is everwatchful of the country's welfare and can offer valuable criticism of the governmeasures that we are now considering have sprung from the exigencies of the situation in which the Government finds itself to-day. WhilstI appreciate that an increase of the membership of the House of Representatives without a corresponding increase of the membership of the Senate would require an amendment of the Constitution, I believe that that would have been a more desirable course. Constitutional difficulties could have been overcome by a convention of representatives of the States, or by permitting the people of Australia to vote upon the issue at a referendum. An increase of the membership of the Senate is an unwarranted imposition on the people of this country. This legislation represents another step by the Government in the direction of the centralization of government. We of the Australian Country party believe in the decentralization of government and of industry. The enlargement of the Parliaindustrial movement of this country should not be adequately represented in I have are correct. Representation of the City",61,Evatt
133,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Ment According To The Present Proposals,,62,Evatt
134,Mr Adermann,"I am endeavourmembers of the new House of Representatives, no less than 51 will represent the three cities that I have mentioned. Whilst there can be no doubt that our secondary industries are of great worth, it hardly seems fair that the industrial cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, Ballarat and Geelong will together have equal representation in this House with the rest of the Commonwealth. That will uot make for equitable government, and the proposal will not be acceptable to country residents whose products form the basis of our economy and contribute so largely to our national income. How many interests will these 51 members actually represent? It is true that they will represent a great number of people -perhap s 2,000,000-bu t the interests of these people are almost identical. In contrast, consider the diversity of interests that I represent in the very important constituency of Maranoa. The products of that electorate include beef, mutton, bacon, cotton, dairy produce including butter and cheese, citrus and deciduous fruits, wheat, maize, peanuts, vegetables, tobacco, hay, chaff, grain sorghum, sudan grass and navy beans. In addition, pigraising is as large an undertaking in Maranoa as it is in any other electorate in Queensland. In short, every primary industry of any consequence in Australia, excepting perhaps sugar cane-growing and banana-growing, is represented. I believe that I have represented these varied interests satisfactorily. At any rate, the electors of Maranoa indicated their satisfaction with my work in no uncertain manner after my first term of office in this Parliament. In addition to primary industries, we also have some secondary industries, including iron foundries and coal mines in two separate areas. Mr Randolph Bedford, a former member of the Queensland Parliament pointed out on one occasion that the electoral division of Maranoa was approximately three times the size of Victoria. Is it fair, or is it in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole that, in this chamber, there should be 51 representatives of three cities, and only one representative of an electorate of such great importance to Australia as that which I represent ? Obviously, one member cannot do the job efficiently. If I were to concede that increased representation was necessary at all, I should say that it was necessary only in part. Certainly it is not necessary in the cities. It may be advantageous in electorates such as Maranoa. However, I understand that country people generally are against the proposal to enlarge the Parliament. The recent census has revealed certain anomalies in the present electoral boundaries. In Queensland, there is one electorate in which the number of voters exceeds the legal maximum, and another in which the number is less than the prescribed minimum. This necessitates an alteration. I understood also that in the normal course, two States were to lose seats and Queensland was to gain one. For those reasons a redistribution was necessary, but that could have been done quite easily by departmental officials. Whilst there may be justification for a larger Parliament on the ground of increased population and the additional duties imposed upon members, I contend that these arguments apply only to one House. Admittedly, an enlarged House of Representatives would give to a government a wider field from which to choose its cabinet, but it does not necessarily follow that the incoming members would be any better than those who now occupy the benches in this chamber. There is no need to increase the membership of the Senate. After four and a half years' experience of this Parliament, I have seen no evidence that senators are overworked. The honourable member for Barker pointed out that the Senate had sat for only three days since the beginning of this year. Senators do not even have enough electoral work to do to justify returning to their States during a long adjournment. The present membership of the Senate is 36, consisting of six from each State, which is ample. The Senate was intended to be a house of review, and one of its functions was supposed to be to safeguard the interests of the States. However, for a long time past, it has been simply a party house, and legis^ lation is rushed through it to suit the convenience of the government in power. Recently, the House of Representatives spent five weeks debating tariff proposals, but tbose same proposals were rushed, through the Senate in two days. The Opposition in the House of Representatives. L3 sometimes criticized by the press for not keeping debate going longer, but there is no indication that senators even try to discuss properly the legislation which comes before them. It would merely aggravate the present unsatisfactory position if the membership of this "" house of rest"" were increased to serve the interests of the supporters of a politimembership of the Parliament. The cal party. Casey saying something like .that once. that the Minister for Information ( Mr bers, so that it is no longer necessary for Calwell) agrees with it. Eveni f it is desirable to increase the membership of the House of Representatives, there can be no possible justification for enlarging the Senate, and a proposal should be put forward for altering the Constitution to enable the House of Representatives to be enlarged, while leaving the Senate as it is. We know that when members of the public wish to place something before a member of Parliament, in 95 cases out of 100 they communicate with a member of the House of Representatives. It is a crying shame that the country should be called upon to suffer the imposition of paying for a bigger Senate, and I make no bones about stating what I feel regarding the proposal. I have no wish to reflect upon present company; it is supto this benefit. The relevant section of posed to be .bad manners. However, during the life of a previous, Parliament, a senator who was sitting at a table with me remarked that he had received a letter. I said, "" Y o u have actually got one?"" and he admitted that it was the only one he had received for a week. The Government has brought forward these proposals in an attempt to save its own life at the next elections, and, Action should be taken to alter the Conin bringing them forward, it has ignored stitution so as to make it unnecessary to that plank of its own platform which enlarge the Senate at the same time as provides for the abolition of the Senate. the membership of the House of RepreI t has also ignored the will of the people, sentatives is increased.

Instead of doing that, crease of the membership of the however, it has put forward a scheme which, it hopes, will give Labour control of the Senate until 1953. I summarize the position as follows: Whilst it is necessary, as a result of the information revealed by the recent census, to correct certain electoral anomalies, this could have been done without increasing the size of the Parliament. The honourable member for Denison said that redistribution was necessary. That is true, but it need not involve increasing the population ofelectorates has increased, and so have the parliamentary duties of members of the House of Representatives, but that situation has been met by the granting of secretarial assistance to memthem, to pound out their letters with one finger on a typewriter. They are now able to give their attention to the discharge of what are their proper parliamentary duties. These bills furnish another example of the tendency of the Labour Government to bring in legislation which is outside the scope of its stated policy, and sometimes even contrary to it. Moreover, under the proposed scheme, government will be centralized to an even greater degree than at present. Advantage should have been taken of that provision in the Constitution which says that regard may be paid to the size and industries of country electorates Certainly, if some electorates are to have a smaller population than others, rural electorates are entitled the Electoral Act provides that the commissioner shall, when fixing the boundaries of electoral divisions, give due consideration to(o) Community or diversity of interest.

Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [9.59] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), in opening the debate for the Opposition, divided his speech into two parts-""Why this thing is being done"", and "" How it is being done"". I propose to divide my observations under the same two headings, and to add one or two conclusions of my own. When discussing why the Government proposed that the Parliament should be enlarged the Leader of the Opposition, and the Deputy Leader of the Australian gave a number of fantastic reasons, mostly conjured out of their own imagination, why the Government was acting in this way. The Leader of the Opposition first attacked the bona fides of the Government because, he said, no mention had been made of the proposal during the 1946 election campaign. The Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) showed that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) had referred to the matter during that campaign. But whether that was so or not does not really matter. I have repeatedly stated in this House that when a government is elected in circumstances such as attended the election of this Government, with a blank cheque from the people, it is entitled to do everything possible under the Constitution for the welfare of the people. It is not inhibited from doing anything at all, subject to the limits of the Constitution. Consequently it does not matter at all whether this matter was mentioned during the 1946 election campaign. On this point, the Leader of the Opposition developed an argument in which there was a fallacy which would be obvious to any pupil, however backward, in a primary school. The right honourable gentleman said that because he advocated enlargement of the Parliament in his policy speech-and he had the support of the Leader of the Australian because his party was defeated at the elections, then automatically it followed, by inference, that the electors had turned down the proposition and voted against it. The plain fact, of course, is that that was only one of a very large number of points of policy expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in his policy speech. I do not think I need to tell the right honourable gentleman, or his supporters, that the reason for the defeat of the Opposition parties at the elections was not that they advocated enlargement of the Parliament. The fact was that the people did not trust them to form a government. The right honourable gentleman's argument was based on completely false logic. He said that the Government's proposal arose from the fact that the 45 members on this side of the House were trying to save themselves from the wrath to come. That involves a very naive assumption that the Labour party is going to be defeated at the next elections. I make bold to say that not one of the 45 honourable gentlemen who sit on this side of the House would fear defeat, even if the elections were contested within the existing divisions. assumption. I am as much entitled to make assumptions as is the Leader of the Opposition. In fact, I have greater justification for doing so than he has, because he donned the mantle of a prophet and it is well known that a number of his prophecies in regard to elections have been completely false. _ I have engaged in three general i lections since I entered this House, and on each occasion the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party prophesied that they would gain great victories. On each occasion they and their parties were defeated. Just as the right honourable gentleman has been wrong in the past, so he will be proved wrong again. I repeat that the 45 members on this side of the House would not fear the results of the next elections even if the electoral boundaries were unchanged.

Therefore, the argument that the Government has introduced this scheme merely in order to protect its own members and supporters falls down. I also say that the 45 honourable members on the Government side of the chamber do not fear the outcome of the next elections because each one of them pulls his weight. That cannot be truthfully said about the 29 honourable members of the Opposition. If it were true that the proposal would strengthen the positions of present members on this side of this House, I should be a little doubtful about the value of the scheme because it would provide security of tenure for a number of "" dead beats "" on the Opposition benches. The plain truth is that all of the reasons conjured up by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member introduction of this measure are quite erroneous. The reason why this, legislation has been introduced is that the Government considers that the best interests of the nation will be served by of the House of Representatives, we are increasing the representation of the people in this Parliament. The Minister for Information has shown clearly that the number of electors which each honourable member represents to-day is very much larger than the number represented by each member of the original Parliament. In fact, honourable members to-day are unable to look after the interests of such large numbers of 121. constituents in a proper manner. It is also true that the legislation which this Parliament is required to consider to-day is of a very much more complicated nature than the legislation of earlier years, when the number of members of the Australian Parliament was originally decided upon. It is in the interests of the nation that such legislation should be not criticized that number. considered by a larger number of representatives than the people now have. Having proved that there should be an increase, I pass on to the question no member of the Opposition has said of bow the enlargement is to be brought that the membership of the House of about. Consider first of all the memRepresentatives should be increased to bership of the House of Representatives, 96, or 144. Mr Dedman. which is the more important of the two Houses of this Parliament. Our Constitution clearly lays down that the number of members of the House of Representatives shall be twice the number of senators. Because one-half of the number of senators representing each State must go to the people every three years, there must be an even number of senators for each State. Therefore, any increase of the number of senators can be only by twelve or a multiple of twelve. The number must be 36, as at present, 48, 60, 72 and so on-a n arithmetical series increasing by the number twelve. Again, it follows automatically under the Constitution that the number of members of the House of Representatives must be double the number of senators. Any increase of the number of members of the House of Representatives must be to approximately either twice 48, or twice 60, or twice 72, and so on. That means that the number in the House of Representatives, if there is to be an increase, must be a number in the arithmetical series 96, 120, 144 and so on. When increasing the number of members limited as to choice. We must select a number in the arithmetical series. The number chosen by the Government is 120 which, in the terms of the Constitution, is as nearly as practicable double the number of senators. vernment's proposal, the House of Representatives will have a membership of ber for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) knows the reason for that, and I shall not waste the time of the House in dealing with it.

The House, in dealing with this legislation, is limited in the choice that it can make. I emphasize that it must decide on a membership of 96, 120, 144 or a number in that arithmetical series, and members of the Opposition have not advocated that the number should be 96 or 144. selected .120, because each member would then have approximately 40,000 constituents, and the Government considers that an electorate of that size is large enough for any member to look after properly. In addition, that number will give a membership in this House that will be adequate for the consideration of legislation, which, as I have explained, is more complicated now than in the early days of federation. The larger House will also provide a wider field of selection for Ministers, and that will be all to the good. When we have decided that the number of members best fitted for present-day requirements is 120, the Constitution itself automatically decides how many members each State shall have. Section 24 of the Constitution lays down how the number of members for each State shall be arrived at. The Leader of the Opposition strongly criticized the provision that the number of members representing Tasmanian electorates will not be increased. The right honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that, under the Constitution, Tasmania cannot be allotted any additional members of the House of Representatives. tion does not provide anything of the sort. Opposition and the honourable member for Barker know perfectly well that unless we increase the membership of the House of Representatives substantially in excess of the Government's proposals, Tasmania cannot be allotted more than five members. the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) raised the issue ""city versus country"". The honourable member for Maranoa appeared to be unaware that the number of electors allowed in any particular constituency is provided not in the Constitution, but in the Commonwealth Electoral Act; a latitude of 20 per cent, is permitted in relation to each electorate. If the honourable member for lndi had examined that act when he was Minister for the Interior some years ago, he would have known The Government that the government of the day could have varied that percentage. Under section 24 of the Constitution, it still is possible to make the value of votes in country electorates substantially greater than the value of votes in city electorates. To take a figure at random, I point out that we could allot 20,000 voters to country electorates and 40,000 to city electorates. That is possible by a simple amendment of the Commonwealth Electoral Act withouth an alteration of the Constitution. If the honourable member for lndi and other members of the Australian Country party who, no doubt, will raise this issue during this debate, feel so strongly about this matter, they should have demanded an alteration of the Commonwealth. Electoral Act to meet their wishes when they supported anti-Labour governments some years ago. The plain fact of the matter is that the honourable member for lndi makes a practice of snivelling and whining in this House about things which the present Government will not do, but which he and his colleagues in former governments failed to do. As he had that opportunity for years, it ill becomes him now to raise that issue. ter object to doing it? always believed in the principle of "" one vote one value "".

I think that what I have said disposes of the issue of city versus country seats. The Leader of the Opposition said that Tasmania will suffer if the Government's proposals are adopted, but I believe that his argument that tine adoption of the present proposals will result in the centralization of federal powers in two' States is fallacious. He cited certain statistics and said that that combined representation in this House of New South Wales and Victoria would confer on those States 22 more seats than the aggregate number of seats held by other States. He went on to point out that adoption of the present proposals would increase from 22 to 39 the margin of seats held by New South Wales and Victoria above those of the other States. But since the number of voters residing in those two States is already so much greater than the number residing in all the other States that their parliamentary representatives greatly out-number those of other States that does not really matter. If the parliamentary representatives of those two Statesi n this chamber do not realize that they owe a duty to the smaller irregular method of increasing the numStates, then it is immaterial whether their majority be one or 100. If the representatives of New South Wales and Victoria desire to act unf airly in regard to the other States they could do so even now. The position certainly will not be substantially different when these measures are enacted. In support' of his contention that the quota of electors for metropolitan electorates should be larger than that for country electorates, the honourable member for lndi made a grossly exaggerated statement. He said that the economy of this country is dependent on wool, wheat and other primary produce. Australia's economy depends as much on the workers in every industry primary producers. Without the services of the men who operate the railways and other transport services, maintain the roads, and render all the miscellaneous that in his opinion there was not a great services which modern society requires, deal of work for the Senate to do, and Mr Dedman. primary producers could not function. It is true that primary producers render a very great service to the people of this country, but that service is no greater than that rendered by the thousands of workers engaged in industry. That is why I believe in the principle of one vote one value, and why I am opposed to increasing the quota for city electorates in order to provide additional parliamentary representatives for country residents. From what I have said it should be clear that once it has been decided that an increased membership is necessary, the method by which that increase is to be made is already provided by the Constitution. The only point remaining to be decided then is the exact number of seats to be allocated to the Senate and to this House. Because of the provision in the Constitution, that the number of members of this House shall be approximately twice the number of senators, and that only half the senators shall retire every three years, we are confined, for practical purposes, to a choice as to whether the membership of this House shall be 96, 120 or 1.44, or any other figure in that arithmetical series. From the criticism uttered by honourable members opposite, one would imagine that the Government was endeavouring to prescribe some ber of members, but as I have pointed out, the Constitution limits the choice of the number of members to a particular mathematical series. The same consideration applies with regard to the proposal to increase the membership of the Senate, and I believe that the Government's approach to the problem is the correct one. Since this House is the more important of the two branches of the legislature, the Government first selected the most appropriate number available to it and that determined the corresponding increase of the membership of the Senate which would have to be made. A membership of approximately 120 was selected as being the most appropriate number for this House, and it as the followed automatically that the number of senators should be 60. The Leader of the Opposition said that a good case might he made for a reduction of the present number of senators. But the right honourable gentleman knew that if we wished to increase the membership of this House there was, constitutionally, no alternative to in creasing the membership of the Senate. shortly, and the Government could quite easily have included its proposal in the matters to be submitted at that referendum. to submit this matter to a referendum honourable members opposite would certainly have opposed it . I remind the House that at the election campaign in 1946 they advocated the proposals to increase the membership of the Parliament which they are now attacking. Honourable members opposite do not know whether they are coming or going. Honourable members opposite support the principle of proportional representation proposed to be adopted at the next election of senators, but the Leader of the Opposition criticized the adoption of that system. He used strong language, alleging that the proposal was "" indecent"". However, I point out that if proportional representation is ever introduced it w ill inevitably be introduced in circumstances similar to those now existing. The right honourable gentleman suggested that there should be a double dissolution. The Ministerf or Informatio n pointed out that that was impossible unless the Constitution was tampered with to the degree of faking a double dissolution in order to put such a proposal into effect. It is a grave abuse of the English language to term "" indecent "" a proposal by which the Government refuses to tamper with the Constitution in the manner that would be necessary if effect were given to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. The plain fact is that once it is decided to introduce proportional representation, the system must be introduced in the manner in which this Government is doing it . If honourable members opposite had decided to introduce proportional representation when they occupied the government benches, they would have done exactly what is now proposed. It boils down to the fact that members of the Opposition support the principle contained in this bill. The Ministerf o r Informatio n has already quoted extensively from press reports and from the speeches of the A referendum is to be held Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for Darling Downs. I want to put on record again the concurrence of the Leader of the Australian Country party in the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition in his policy speech in August, 1946, regarding an increase of the size of the Australian Parliament. The Minister for Information did not include a paragraph from the right honourable gentleman's speech dealing with the issue of city versus country. In his policy speech, delivered at Toowoomba on the 3rd September, 1946, the Leader of the Australian Country party saidI cordially agree with Mr Menzies with respect to the increase of membership of the Parliament. As the only way in which it can he carried out under the Constitution is by increasing the number of Senators, we believe that such increase will give a new opportunity for putting into practical effect a continuous policy of proportional representation for that chamber. An increase in the number of members of the House of Representatives and the SenateW it h no alteration to the Constitution; exactly in the way in which this Government is now proposing to do it will increase the number of advocates for rural development and proper balance in national life. Ultimately, this course will lead to great national economies due to increased familiarity with and concentration upon our problems, and the wider choice of human material for ministerial positions. An increase in the membership of this House and of the Senate was advocated by the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party at the last general elections. In the d r a f t platform of the Liberal party, under the heading "" Constitutional "", the following words a ppear:3. A substantial increase in the number of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

TION DURING CAPTIVITY ROYALAUS That the House do now adjourn. wish to refer to a matter that I have raised several times in this House and upon which I have received no satisfaction, although I believe the Ministerf o r the A r m y ( Mr Chambers) is making some inquiries into it . Many Australian soldiers were promoted in the field or during captivity, but their promotions have been repudiated by the Australian Government, and the pay appropriate to their ranks has not been credited to them, although two years have elapsed. That is a disgraceful thing. I propose to read a letter addressed to me by the president of the ex-Prisoners of War and Relatives Association, of which I am a member. The letter beginsConcerning promotions, I was actively interested in this matter as A.D.M.S. "" Blackforce"" for some months after repatriation to Australia. These were some of the anomalies. I ask the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) to heed me, and to apply some pressure upon the Minister for the Army or whoever is the obstruction standing in the way of these men getting justice. The letter continuesPre-eapitulation promotions. To my certain knowledge, at least a few members of the force in Java were promoted during the campaign to appointments on unit establishments, but owing to local conditions not permitting adequate 2nd Echelon procedure, such promotion and pay was subsequently not granted, although fully supported by the G.O.C., A.I.F. I am talking of These men were promoted in the field. Second Echelon is the records branch. If , for some reason, the records branch broke down under the stress of war and did not promulgate these promotions, that was not the fault of these men, who bore the risks attaching ""to their ranks in battle and later in captivity. The letter goes onFor example, Lieutenant Ian Cameron, A.A.M.C., of my own unit was appointed Quartermaster (Hospital Establishment Q.M. Captain) but never received this rank. He subsequently rationed camps of thousands of men throughout captivity . . . Post-capitulation promotions. Despite extreme wastage by death and sickness Honourable members opposite are not listening; they do not care whether or not these men receive justicepromotions were extremely sparingly made, and were undoubtedly necessary under circumstances where members were exercising authority and carrying responsibility far beyond their rank. The writer of this letter is a colonel in the Australian A r m y Medical Corps who performed outstanding deeds of self-sacrifice while in captivity. He would not say so himself, but I can say it for him. The members of this association, on whose behalf he is writing, are not men who sit down and strike. They only want justice, and it is time that something was done. The letter continuesSuch promotions, in my experience, were infrequently recognized by the Japanese. They were recognized sometimes by the Japanese, but never by the Australian Government. This gentleman writes with no bitterness, but merely factually. The letter goes onIn any case, the difference in pay of other ranks amounted to at most a few pence a day, and pay of officers, apart from a small monthly pittance of uniform nature for all officers, was represented by a specious credit in the Yokohama Species Bank! Throughout captivity, in order to keep vast numbers of sick men alive, we introduced heavy taxation at source according to pay, so that, in fact, extra pay represented scant material advantage.",69,Evatt

Only a small percentage of the prisoners were allowed to remain in the camp to carry out camp duties; the rest were sent out on working parties. Those who worked at the aerodrome or the gardens at Changi or were employed in building funk holes into which the Japanese hoped to crawl when the invasion came, were in charge of our own non-commissioner officers. Commissioned officers were not sent out with workwill not turn this man away without ing parties. If any of the men did something wrong, it was the non-commissioned officer who generally took the beltings which were handed out by the Japanese as a punishment. Just before the capitulation, certain men were pro'moted to non-commissioned rank. the last few days before the capitulation those promotions were published in what are called ""Part II. Orders"". Those who were lucky enough to have their promotions so published carried the higher rank during the whole term of their captivity. not recorded in Part II. Orders they did not become entitled to the higher pay, although they had to carry out all the duties associated with their rank. In the last days of the defence of Singapore many non-commissioned officers died at the hands of the Japanese, and it became necessary to appoint others iu their place. Those who were appointed to higher ranks in the prison camps carried out their higher duties throughout the whole three and a half years of their incarceration. When these men came back to Australia honourable members asked the Government to recognize these promotions by giving them the pay appropriate to their rank and the additional responsibilities they had to carry in the prison camps. The Government, however, did nothing about it. I shall cite a specific case. Last year, a man now living in Canberra, who was promoted in this way, interviewed me in the King's Hall in this building and produced his pay-book, showing that his promotion was authorized by a high ranking officer in the Australian Imperial Force. I handed the pay-book to the Minister for the Army and said, "" Surely this man should be paid the rate of pay prescribed for a sergeant. I know he played his part well, because I know what he did in a camp "". Mr Turnbull. The Minister, who is generally sympathetic, said, "" I shall have investigations made into this case"". I assume that some official at Army Head-quarters, or elsewhere, made some kind of investigation, after which the pay-book was returned with a letter stating briefly that nothing could be done. SoI again approached the Minister saying, "" Surely, in view of the entries in his pay-book, you paying him for the services he has rendered!"" The Minister said, "" I shall look into it again "", and I thereupon again handed him the pay-book. However, I have not heard any more about it, nor has the pay-book been, returned yet. PerIn haps the Minister is still investigating the case. It is to be hoped that when a decision is given it will give satisfaction not only to the man concerned, but also those similarly circumstanced, and to Australians generally. If the promotion was If any men deserve the pay, these men do. Previously in this HouseI have asked that former prisoners of war be paid the 3s. a day sustenance to which they are entitled, and I am not finished with that subject yet, but to-night I am dealing with a specific case. The Government should give full and symypathetic consideration to what has been said by the honourable member for Balaclava who quoted Lieutenant-Colonel Dunlop, who did great work in Malaya and Borneo and made medical history in the camps along the Burma railway. One may depend on it that what he says is absolutely true. I ask that the Government lend a sympathetic ear to the claims advanced by the honourable member for Balaclava on behalf of certain ex-servicemen, and by me on behalf of the man whose case I have mentioned to-night and of ex-prisoners of war generally, to whom I have referred in detail before. They did a great deal for Australia, and ought to be given justice. my support to the second matter referred to by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White).
