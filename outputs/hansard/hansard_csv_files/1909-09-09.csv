Personally, I quite agree with your remark, Mr Speaker, that if ever there was a question that should be seriously debated, it is the question before us now, and that we should, if possible, leave out of consideration the particular papers or person, and deal with the matter purely as one of principle. I have heard your predecessor, Mr Speaker, time after time, refuse, except in the case of Budget papers, to allow figures or reports to be inserted in Hansard, unless they were read. On one occasion, the Treasurer of the Deakin Ministry desired to have a long table inserted, but the late Speaker refused permission unless it was read, and other honourable members have been similarly treated. yesterday analogous to a Budget speech? circumstance is that, when the Prime Minister was told that the tables could not be inserted unless they were read, he said he would move that they be printed as papers, The matter was then left until the question of leave arose, and, as we all know, leave was .refused. I concur thoroughly in the view that these returns should, as a matter of convenience, have-been embodied in Hansard, but I regard your direction, Mr Speaker, after leave Ind been refused, as wrong altogether-as a fatal blunder, if I may say so with due respect. Either you, sir, had to obtain leave of the House, or you could order the incorporation of the document on your own [»7] motion; and evidently you thought you should have leave. Under the circumstances, it appears to me that the tables should have been printed as papers. 1 was struck by the remark of the Prime Minister that, having said he would have the tables printed as papers, he left the members represented that it would be more convenient to have the tables inserted in Hansard, and it was agreed that that should be done. I wonder, however, when that request was made, and by whom, and when the agreement was come to that the tables should be inserted. I noted the words of the Prime Minister, and thought they were very significant; and, at any rate, the agreement was never made in the House. I wondered whether the Prime Minister made a mistake, as I certainly hope he did; but, at any rate, it is a matter to be cleared up. for the insertion of the tables from all over the House. Government Whip has to say, but he certainly always has more to say for the Government than, any member of the Government itself. 1 agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that, however wise or agreeable it might be for honourable members to have the tables inserted without their having been read, there is, at the same time, possible danger in leaving the responsibility to Mr Speaker or any other member of the House. As the honourable member for Wide Bay said, if there were a saint in the Chair, he could not give satisfaction to everybody in such a matter; and it is desirable that such a task should not be imposed on the occupant of the Chair. Perhaps a question of the kind might be decided by some sort of committee; but, at any rate, it ought not to be left to the Speaker to discriminate. It is, I agree, exceedingly convenient to have tables inserted in Hansard, but there are regulations in regard to that matter, and these ought not to be departed from. With others, I think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is to be thanked for bringing this question before the House. I confess I was surprised when the honourable member got an affirmative reply to the question he put to the Speaker; but now that the matter has been ventilated, we may hope that something will be done to provide a satisfactory procedure, which will",20,Privilege Additions To Hansard

I understood Mr Speaker to say that there ought to be very little ground for complaint at the enlargement of privileges of honourable members, but it is possible that the case under discussion may represent the enlargement of the privileges of only some honourable members. either the Speaker or the authority suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland ought to be given a discretionary power in matters of the kind. Either every honourable member has a right to have matter inserted in Hansard, or he has not; and we all know that the moment there is discrimination, no matter how impartial or fair the decision may be, there is bound to be dissatisfaction, or, at any rate, the risk of dissatisfaction. The only safe course is to allow no matter of the kind to go into Hansard. the honourable member for Melbourne, and partly agreed to by the honourable member for Darwin, that discretionary power ought to be given in certain cases. In my view, such a power might be very greatly abused, .and, in fact, is almost certain to be abused. should be a limitation. able because it is short, it may be ten times more valuable if it is long. We have to thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for submitting the motion, and I think it has served the purpose he has in view. Let us hope that in the future there will be no discrimination, but that the Standing Orders will be carried out thoroughly and impartially. The thanks of every member are due to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for raising this question. The Prime Minister said it was a storm in a teacup ; and doubtless there would have been a storm if no notice had been taken of the remonstrance made. Minister to the humblest, is hound by the Standing Orders. offence on this occasion lies in the fact that we have precedent after precedent, by both the late Speaker and various Chairmen of Committees, for the ruling that the Standing Orders shall not be departed from except by the unanimous wish of the House. I cm recall quite a number of instances in which Ministers of the Crown have attempted, without asking leave of the House -whic h would probably have resulted in. leave being granted-to have various schedules and so forth inserted in Hansard, but it has always been borne in mind that the Standing Orders must be obeyed by all/ and the privilege has been withheld. On this occasion the Prime Minister, finding that he would be out of order in inserting the tables without reading them, asked I do not think that leave of the House through you, sir. did nothing of the sort: that is not correct. Prime Minister said he would ask leave, and lha't you, sir, subsequently did ask leave for him. At any rate, leave was asked, and the House, within its undoubted rights, refused it. ber for Parkes knows that in all British Parliaments in Australia and elsewhere, it It has been suggested by is the privilege of one member to object to the abrogation of the rules; on such occasions, one member, for all practical purposes, is the House. If the honourable member affected wanted to take some other means to achieve his object, he could do so. On this occasion, you, Mr Speaker, asked the leave of the House practically for the suspension of the Standing Orders for the time being, to allow the Prime Minister to do something that he could not otherwise do. That leave was refused. It has been asked for in other cases, and has been refused in the same way; but whenever that has happened on previous -occasions, no attempt has ever been made -to get behind the refusal. On this occasion, an attempt has been made to do so; and I can only presume from what the Prime Minister himself has said, that he communicated with you either personally or in some other way, and pointed out to you that you had certain powers. With all due deference to yourself, or any one else who may occupy your position, it would be a dangerous innovation on the rights and Every member, from the Prime privileges of the Housei f the Prime Minister could thwart the will of the House, or The gravamen of the if the Speaker could override the decision of the House by doing something that the House said should not be done.

This matter is sufficiently serious to warrant* the honourable every purpose that he had in view, and-1 member for Kalgoorlie in taking action upon it, and in seeking to test the opinion of the House by putting his motion to a vote. -The question of whether the table is included in the record or not is a very minor matter, as compared with the very serious question of whether the decision of the House has been overridden. been brought before the House has, I am certain, achieved this much, that it will never occur again. As has been pointed out, if one honourable member objects he really becomes the House for the time being, and expresses the will of the House on that occasion. The House by its Standing Orders'has provided that if one honourable member objects to a certain thing being done, it cannot be done. That honourable member, therefore, for the time being is expressing the wish of the House according to the Standing Orders; and no Speaker has a right to override the deliberate decision of the House, even if that decision is expressed through only one member. If the House decided, as it did on this occasion, that those papers could not be taken as read, it was.not a proper proceeding for anybody, Speaker or any one else, to decide against the wish of the House that the papers should be inserted in Hansard. Matters relating to the control of Hansard have been brought before the House more than once. On one occasion I happened to quote something that 1 heard spoken in the House, but when I turned up HansardI found that it was not there. The question arises as 'to how far the correction of proofs should be allowed. Speaking with some little expert knowledge, I think the Hansard reports as prepared by the staff are quite equal to any reports of the kind in any part of the world. It has often been a wonder to me how have recorded not only what members have said, but very often what they intended to say but did not express fully owing to interjections. I think the less the Hansard proofs are interfered with, and the fewer directions come from the Speaker, who is in control of Hansard, the better it will be for the correct and honest interpretation of honourable member's speeches as published. Apart from that, on the ques[ l T 7 ] -2 tion now before the House, I think the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has served hope he will not press the motion to a division. I think he has made it certain that in the future, when the House expresses a deliberate opinion, that opinion will not be ignored by anv one. regard the matter that is now being discussed as of very serious, importance. I was surprised to' find that, after what took place yesterday, tbe decision of the House The fact that the matter has had been set aside by some one, ostensibly, I take it, through your agency, Mr Speaker, and that certain matters which the House had decided should not be inserted in Hansard were to appear in its columns. I remember that a little while ago, when you were appealed to for an opinion as to whether certain customary methods in connection with inserting headlines in reprints of speeches from Hansard should be followed, you deliberately refused to take any action, to give any advice, or to interfere in any way witb the Hansard reports as they left the reporters' hands. then, except as to the inclusion of objectionable matter. matter is always taken to be a privilege of the Speaker, the exercise of which no honourable member would object to; and when you took up the position to which the honourable member for Dalley refers, you took up one that was absolutely unassailable. It is because you so recently expressed that opinion that I feel the more concerned about your action in this case. I should not like to say that it savours of favouritism that this matter has been inserted in Hansard because it was the Prime Minister who desired that something should be included in his speech which he had not included in the ordinary way-bu t I do say that the treatment meted out now to the Prime Minister, as contrasted with the treatment meted out to exceedingly well the reporters other honourable members a little while ago in regard to a similar matter, requires explanation from those who are responsible for it. I do not agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Darwin that we should Americanize our Hansard. No man who desires Hansard to be a true reflex of the utterances of honourable members would seek to introduce a method by which the public might be deceived and misled as to what took place in this Chamber.",22,Privilege Additions To Hansard

That is a great tribute to the Hansard staff. When the matter was before us a little while ago, you, Mr Speaker, laid it down clearly that you would not interfere with, but would follow, the decision of your predecessor that Hansard as it went from the Reporting Staff to the printing office should not be interfered with. But now we find that, because the Prime Minister requires to insert a table of figures, that wise deciyou have been over-persuaded by some one sion which was asserted so emphatically then has been set aside.

I have seen honourable members compelled to read for twenty and twenty-five minutes figures or extracts which they had asked the Speaker's permission to hand over to Hansard unread. He vvas always adamant in his determination not to allow the privileges of the House to be in any way assailed or undermined by action of the kind now taken. If I agree we allow this kind of thing to begin, we do not know where it will end. The serious part of the matter is that it was done in this case after the House had spoken. The Prime Minister sought to have these figures inserted. You, Mr Speaker, put the question to the House, and the House have beautiful said, "" No."" The House is above the Speaker, and above every other man who holds office within these walls, and) when the House says "" No , "" its "" No "" should not only be respected, but should be absolutely! unalterable. When the House has said : "" We shall not allow this precedent admirable reto be created, we shall not permit the thin end of the wedge to be inserted even by the Prime Minister, whereby a misrepresentation may find its way into the pages of our official records,"" it is a serious matter for any man, Speaker or otherwise, to interfere with that decision of the House. For that reason I feel very strongly on the matter, and I hope that the fact of its being brought up in the House will be an object lesson to those who, were responsible for taking this step. I do not wish to press the motion to a division, although I could do so if I chose, but ' I think sufficient has been said.; and I believe that in all probability in this case, and have strained a point to do what you may have thought to be' a public service.

When that honourable gentleman treats the flouting of the will of the House as "" a storm in a teacup "" one must recognise that he does not view the privileges of this House as they should be regarded. I object to the insertion in Hansard of anything that has not been actually read by an honourable member unless the permission of the House is given to its inclusion. That practice has been followed since the inception of the Parliament, and it is in accordance .with the custom of every Legislature of which I have anv knowledge. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [3.57] I do not object to the inclusion of these tables in the Hansard report of the Prime Minister's speech, but I certainly wish to know whether a like privilege is to be extended to honourable members generally. On several occasions whilst the late Sir Frederick Holder occupied the Chair, I brought forward tables that I had prepared, but Mr figures in question on the table. No one Speaker refused to allow them to be incorporated in the Hansard report of my speech unless 1 read them. On 26th November last, in the course of a speech which I delivered, I had occasion to allude to a set of figures, which 1 had been at some trouble.to prepare, relative to the appreciation of Australian' banking shares, and owing to the late Speaker's ruling I was compelled to go through the tedious task of reading the table in order that it might appear in Hansard. Seen in tabular form these figures immediately conveyed to the reader what I desired they should convey, but it was wearisome to the House to listen to their recital, and the task of reading them was certainly a tedious one. We shall shortly be entering upon a lengthy debate on the financial question and various honourable members will probably desire to place before the House some tabular statements bearing on the question. In the circumstances, therefore, I ask that honourable members shall be afforded the privilege that has been extended to the Prime Minister. question I feel it my duty to make a few observations. I have refrained hitherto from speaking in order that honourable members might have an opportunity to express their views upon the matter as it presented itself to them. It is rather unusual for a Speaker to be charged with a bieach of the privileges of the House, and 1 fully realize the gravity of the situation. The facts, however, may be briefly stated. When the Prinie Minister was speaking yesterday upon a matter affecting an amendment of the Constitution he desired to incorporate in the Hansard report of his speech certain figures vvhich he had not read. He said, in the most casual way, "" Instead of reading these figures I will hand them to Hansard,"" and of my own volition I at once informed him that he could not do that. I mention this to show honourable, members what was my feeling in the matter. It was subsequently pointed out to me by a few honourable members that it would be advantageous to have the figures included in the Hansard report of the Prime Minister's speech. The Prime Minister himself neither directly nor indirectly-I ought not to have to say this but feel constrained to do so because of certain remarks that have been madecommunicated with me with regard to the matter from the time that he laid the on the Government side of the House spoke to me on the subject, but it was represented to me that it would be an advantage to allow the tabulated matter to appear in Hansard. presentation made? me to mention names. I take the full responsibility for my action and am not going to attempt to put it upon those vvho spoke to me on the subject. I certainly do not desire that the responsibility should be placed upon any one save myself, and it is for that reason that I refer to this phase of the subject. It was because of the representations made to me that I informed the House that I intended to ask for leave to take the course suggested. As honourable members aire aware, however, I am new to the position, and it was not long before I recognised that, in asking the leave of the House, I was propos; ing to do that vvhich was unnecessary. It is necessary to ask for leave only where it is proposed to do something contrary to the Standing Orders. As a matter of fact, there is no standing order affecting Hansard. Some honourable members have spoken in such a way as to suggest that a standing order had been disregarded; but",24,Thomson Wha T Stand Should Have I F In The Future We Rind

Before taking action, I first saw the returns, and then made inquiries as to what had been the practice. I found that, upon at least three occasions-onc e in the case of a Minister, and twice iri the case of private members-m y predecessor had allowed statements of a similar character to be inserted in Hansard, although they had not been read. I then gave instructions to the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to embody these tables in the report.

I have only to say that I recognise the inalienable .right of every honourable member to bring before the House a matter of this. kind. When I was asked to-day why the tables had been embodied in Hansard, I said that I had acted in accordance with practice and precedent. I have precedent to support my action; but I frankly admit that it was with great reluctance that I agreed to the insertion of the tables. It was only because of their character, and not because of the honourable member who presented them, that I allowed them to be inserted. I was also influenced by the fact that I had at least three precedents to guide me. your action is to be regarded as a precedent? occasion presents itself before I give a ruling. Having listened to the debate, and to your own statement, sir, I feel that the object I had in view in submitting this motion has been achieved. It was ungraciously suggested by an honourable member that I was induced to take action because of personal feeling against the Prime Minister; but 1 assure the House that I was influenced by no such motive. I should not endeavour to avail myself of the rules of the House to give vent to such feelings, even if I entertained them. I did not, and do not, think that any harm will result from the insertion of the tables in Hansard. Indeed,, honourable members may benefit from what you state, Mr has been done; but I recognised-and I think you, Mr Speaker, thoroughly appreciate-the danger of allowing such a custom to grow up. It would certainly be prejudicial to the safety of honourable member;,, and would place you, sir, in a most invidious position, since you would have redetermine what should and what should not be inserted in Hansard. Having achieved my object, I desire, by leave of the House, to withdraw my motion. This is a plain stateMotion, by leave, withdrawn. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S NEW WORKS.

Our chief anxiety in time of war will be to know when and where raiding cruisers make their appearance in our waters. Such vessels will not come within sight of land, so that they can be reported, but will lie in wait in Their presence in our waters might not be known until it was noticed that vessels leaving, say, Fremantle for the eastern States, or going in the reverse direction, were missing; and that there was an interruption of trade. I suggest that we should establish at such places on the coast, as experts may recommend, wireless telegraph stations, and that the mercantile marine should be fitted with similar installations. Then, directly an enemy's ship made its appearance, the authorities on shore would be warned by the first Australian ships tn sight it, and shipping masters could be notified of the danger threatening them. It is obvious that this would be a more efficient and cheaper way of getting intelligence than the suggestion of Captain Creswell for the employment of vessels faster than the eneny's ships. Even if it were possible to efficiently distribute such vesthe money for remedying defects, and sels throughout Australian waters, the gain in time following a discovery would be only the difference between the intervals needed by both to reach their destinations; whereas, were a report transmitted by wireless telegraphy, the notification would be instantaneous. I have been informed that the cost of a shore installation, including buildings, would be between £6,000 and ,£7,000, and that such an installation could receive and transmit messages over a distance of 500 miles. The cost of maintaining and operating such a station would be £1,388 ios. per annum. A number of installations would be necessary for defence and the convenience of shipping. Probably it would be well 10 begin with a large installation somewhere on the eastern coast, to connect with New Zealand, and with one on the Leeuwin, where most of our trade routes converge. Some time ago, 'before wireless telegraphy had been so much developed as it is to-day, the defence authorities recommended the establishment of ten installations; one at Cape Yorke, one in New Guinea, one at Brisbane, one at Sydney, one at Melbourne, one in Tasmania, one in Adelaide, one on the Leeuwin, and one north of Perth. These installations were each to operate over a radius of 350 miles. Now, however, the radius could Mr Kelly. be extended to 500 miles without increase of cost. That recommendation would have covered the coast-line from Rockhampton to the Australian Bight, and from Albany to beyond Geraldton in Western Australia, as well as Torres Strait, and would have been very advantageous to the Defence Dethe track of our commerce. partment. an installation at Port Darwin? mended at the time; but I should like to see an installation placed there.

It would be wise to start with no more than two stations, so that we may ascertain the preliminary cost of establishment, and the cost of working. have the stations? of the. professional and expert advice is that the two most important and prominent stations would be-on e on the eastern coast, of which the centre would naturally be Sydney; and one on the western coast, of vvhich the centre would be Fremantle or Rottnest. These are the two centres that will probably receive first attention. Island? Island, and also Wilson's Promontory, and the north coast of Tasmania, will come on for consideration. We must start, however, with what we are advised are the most important points.

A station on the western coast will naturally command the whole of the incoming and outgoing traffic in the case of Europe, South Africa, and America, and it is considered to be a position quite as commanding and important as that of Sydney. I propose, with the concurrence of my colleagues, to commence what I think will be a successful experiment. It is proposed to make the service revenue-earning, so that it may not be a burden on the Department."" We cannot afford to give free wireless communication, either for defence purposes or for the convenience of the public; and I have asked the officers to submit a scheme by which we shall probably be able to earn an income from messages transmitted to steamers, or from steamers, and delivered on shore. I have no reason to doubt, from the information I have received, that we shall be able Since then, to start with a small but increasing revenue. That is the commercial aspect; but, of course, the defence aspect is of supreme importance; and if we couple defence with commercial utility and profit, I think we shall be able to justify our experiment.

I need not offer any apology for submitting this motion. mark, but the true meaning and intention of all such measures as I advocate, is the protection of the public. Medical Acts in both the Old Country and in Australia are nearly in every instance for the protection of the people from quacks and charlatans, who, if allowed their own sweet will, may do very serious injury. It is often suggested that the medical profession is a "" ring "" or union, into which no one can be admitted. That is quite an erroneous idea; because the organizations in the profession are altogether apart from any question of registration. rough for the man outside. pends on the conduct of the man himself.

Of course, the registration of the professions is at present beyond the Commonwealth Constitution, so that the motion is really a suggestion that at some time in the future the Constitution should be amended in order to give us the necessary powers. There is great disparity amongst the various State Acts. Some of the Acts are very old, and some of them of more recent years; but the general tendency of all is to register those who come before the public as professional men, and the best of them', and one.we could very well copy, is that in force in Tasmania. Under that Act there is a power, not found .in Victoria or New South Wales, to deal with a practitioner guilty of unprofessional conduct; so that, if a man has been convicted of a criminal offence, the Medical Board has power to remove bis name from the register. A similar power is exercised in Great Briton the register. If he does so he may be ain, where, of course, there are thousands of medical men, and where the Medical Council does a considerable amount of good in safeguarding the interests of the public. The whole trend of all the Acts that have been passed throughout Australia is to form a Medical Board, composed always and almost entirely of members of the medical profession. As a rule the Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Governor-in-Council, but in some cases is elected by the other members. Tn Victoria. New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland those boards have the power only of considering the claims of those who desire to practise medicine in. their particular State, and to put the name upon the register or not as they find the qualifications set out in the various Acts are or are not complied with. In the most out-of-date of all, there is an additional power, allowing members of the medical profession who have been registered in the United Kingdom to practise in that State. The reason of that, I take it, was becauseI think the Act is from thirty-seven to forty years old-it was found very difficult in the early days of settlement in Australia to get medical men to go to out-of-the-way places. In the first place, there were not the numbers of them, and in the second, they often came out direct to different parts of the States, and wanted to practise straight away. In New South Wales, the law has always been very lax. The South Australian Act is, perhaps, most deficient, and the New South Wales Act comes next in that respect; but all the Acts, with the exception of those of Tasmania and Western Australia, are out of date. It is certainlv desirable and necessary that the Medical1 Board, wherever it exists, should have power to deal with medical men who are guilty of unprofessional conduct, or who are convicted of some criminal offence, and whose names should certainly be no longer allowed to remain on the medical register. medical boards to deal with those who profess to practise medicine outside of the profession ? difficulty. The general trend of the Acts is simply to say that no man shall practise as a medical man, or call himself, or lead the public to believe that he is, a legally qualified medical practitioner, unless he is fined, and in some cases imprisoned. If a man presents himself before the board with falsified diplomas, or degrees, or qualifications, the board has power to imprison him for such falsification, but the power mentioned by the honourable member for Perth is not given in any of the Acts.

He may profess all these things, take people's money, and practically charge what fee he likes, but the Medical Act gives no power to deal with him. That really is the crux of the matter. The motion brought forward by the honourable member for Barrier, with which I was in complete sympathy, goes still further. It deals with the question of the admission of patent medicines. Many patent medicines, drugs, and appliances were being brought in, and not only imposed on the credulity of the public, but were doing the public a very serious injury in many cases. Yet we, as a Parliament, appear to be powerless to assist the people in this direction. It is a direction which is altogether -desirable, because it is really a case of an ^unscrupulous person hitting a man when he is down.

He has no power to practise in the other States as a registered medical practitioner. He may wish to practise in Tasmania or New -South Wales as a locum tenens, but when he does so, unless he is registered in those States, he is really not a registered medical practitioner, and suffers certain disabilities. For instance, his evidence at inquests, and his certificates of death, may be questioned. Many other things that arise in the practice of his profession may be questioned, but as a general rule they are not, because he signs after his certificate his degrees and diplomas. unregistered man from giving a certificate. of an unregistered man is not accepted. -certificate of an unqualified man. I was pointing out that if I went into New South Wales, I should not be registered there, 'but as a matter of custom my certificate would be accepted because of my degrees. I think the honourable member for Hunter is registered also in Victoria. If he is not, I think he has practised in Victoria, because I remember the honourable member for Wentworth and myself sending him some cases on a certain occasion. Medical men who desire to move about from State to State are under the disability of being really unregistered practitioners outside their own State, although they may possess the highest qualifications that can be obtained. This difficulty generally arises in some remote country centre, so that it is really the people in the remote districts who are hurt by the present state of the law. Of course, in the bigger centres no such difliculty arises, because generally any number of medical men are available. The members of the legal profession seem to be controlled only in New South Wales and Victoria by special Acts. In each of the other States there seems to be a Law Institute of some sort which controls them. I have found considerable difficultyin discovering the actual position of that profession in the other States. The Law Institute, or whatever it may be called, seems to be a body which has established itself, and which controls the practice of the profession in each State. In Victoria the Judges of the Supreme Court are the arbiters in the mat. A medical ter, and outside of them there is the Lav may register in Victoria, but Institute, which decides what qualifications a man sball possess before he may practise as a barrister or solicitor. In Victoria a barrister may be a solicitor, and a solicitor may be a barrister, and a similar position seems to exist in South Australia. There seems to be no Act dealing with the legal profession in Tasmania or Western Australia. The Victorian Act dealing with members of the legal profession goes into the matter very thoroughly. Any man or womanI think women are admitted now in this State-desirin g to enter the profession must pass the matriculation or an examination substituted by the Supreme Court, be articled to a solicitor or barrister, and then pass an examination in law approved by the Supreme Court, when he is called before the Court and admitted. He may be admitted either as a barrister or solicitor. If he becomes a solicitor of certain standing he may become a barrister, and a barrister may relinquish his position as such and become a solicitor. It is not always apparent to those outside the profession why these things should be done, but in Victoria many members of the legal profession practise both as barristers",30,Professional Registration

It is certainly explicit, however, with regard to the admission of barristers and solicitors to practise. To become entitled to practise as a barrister, one must pass certain examinations. The graduates of certain universities are exempt from those examinations, but in other cases, the Judges of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General for the time being, and two barristers are elected to constitute a Board to deal with applications for admission. to have a quorum. {Quorum formed.] honourable member for having called attention to the state of the House.

As a matter of fact, however, there is great necessity for the regulation of these professions, and it is the more pressing in the case of the law since an unscrupulous man, having been admitted to. practise, might inflict great wrong on his clients. We have all heard of widows and children who have been left small estates which have been swallowed up in legal expenses', or have been appropriated by a member of the legal profession. In the circumstances, therefore, it is very desirable that the legal lic as to his actual qualifications. All this profession should be carefully regulated. Tn New South Wales barristers appear to be placed upon a higher pedestal than are those belonging to the other branches of the law. Applicants for admission to the Bar, having passed certain examinations, have to appear before a Board, consisting, as I have said, of the Judges of the Supreme Court, the Attorney-General, and two barristers elected by the barristers practising before the Court, within certain months. If the applicant satisfies the Board that he possesses the requisite qualifications he is admitted to practise. In reading the New South Wales Act, I was much struck by a sentence which does not appear in similar measures in operation in some of the other States, although it is to be found in two relating to the medical profession. I refer admission must be of ' good fame and 1 character."" Those words have doubtless been copied from some old English Statute, and I think that they might well appear in all Acts relating to the learned professions. The succeeding sentence in the New South VVales Act, curiously enough, is to the effect that this provision does not apply to members of the Middle or Inner Temple, and certain other persons. Owing to the way in which the Act is drafted, some people might think that if an applicant for admission to the New South Wales Bar is a member of the Middle or Inner Temple he need not be of good fame and character, but the assumption really is that the character of a man who has been admitted to either of those Courts must necessarily be beyond question. There seems to be no definite provision in the New South Wales law as to the terms upon which a man may be admitted to practise as a solicitor there. have been articled to a solicitor, or have passed certain examinations; but it is difficult to find any definite provision as to the qualifications for admission. governed by regulations made by the Supreme Court Judges. presume, under the Act.

We are getting information from members of the legal profession which we could not have expected.

In the legal profession many restrictions have been re moved by the establishment of the High Court, before which lawyers from every State may appear, although not permitted to appear in the lower Courts, except in the States where they are registered. Th( dental profession is one of great importgiving certain notice ance.

Therefore, it is important that only proThe New perly qualified persons shall be allowed to practice dentistry. But persons so qualified and registered should be allowed to practice throughout Australia, whereas now their activity is confined to the State in which they are registered. Nurses, again, when properly trained, are most useful members of society. When a nurse has acquired a proper knowledge of her profession, she should be allowed to practise it in any part of the Commonwealth. The same remark applies to the veterinary surgeon.

So little regard has been paid to the profession hitherto that there are comparatively few qualified and registered veterinary surgeons in Australia. But such men should be allowed to practise throughout the Commonwealth. I shall not deal with civil engineers, surveyors, and others, but simply say that it is desirable, for the better protection of the people, to have uniformity, under the control of the Commonwealth, and to have it provided that, when once a person has been admitted to any of these professions he shall be free to practise in any part of Australia. The motion must appeal to any one who has given any thought to the question. I should like' the honourable member for Corangamite to clearly understand that it was not through any ill-will that I insisted on a quorum when he was speaking, but simply because I regarded the subject as of great importance. I shall be glad, if , during the course of my remarks, a quorum is not present, some honourable member will call attention to the fact. There ought to be one system of registration throughout the Commonwealth . In the olden times, the 1 recognised professions were, first divinity, then law, and last medicine; and, even up to comparatively recent times, the professions were in so chaotic a state that, perhaps, the less said about them the better. There are something like 400 different religions represented in the city of London alone; and I do not see very well how they could come under any registration scheme. I know that, when a marriage is performed, it is not considered civilly legal until the documents have been sent to the RegistrarGeneral, so, in that sense, the ministers of religion are recognised. member for Corangamite will remember when the present Mr Justice Isaacs introduced and carried a Bill in Victoria pertaining to the legal profession, and debarring fellow Australians in New South Wales from being permitted to practise in this State. I do not say that all the fault is on the Victorian side; but if my memory serves me aright, I then took the view that the law was being made too stringent, and that there should be more reciprocity between two communities living under the same flag, and speaking the same language. Any one who is qualified to practise law should be permitted to practise in any Court up to the highest; and I go so far as to urge that, if a client cannot afford to pay legal fees, he ought to be able to obtain the services of some one, even a layman, to put his case clearly before the proper tribunal. I look on all law, even in the highest Courts, as a farce,_ when I compare it with justice. In the High Court of Australia, it is not justice that is wanted, but judgments on technical points, and an interpretation of the law; and if justice were screaming out for vengeance, and a point of law were raised, justice would be swept aside. We are told that he who has the longest purse can win most cases in the law courts of Australia; cases are dragged out to such an extent that even the Judges have taken action. I have heard it stated, and I am inclined to believe it is a fact, that, wherever the liberty of an individual is at stake, it would be wise, in the future, when a jury has once been chosen, to keep the members of that jury, and also the barristers and others concerned, within the precincts of the Court, so as to prevent such cases as that we read of recently in the newspapers. It is an English aphorism, ""The law is an as""; and I certainly do not think that the law will ever be the means of impartially dispensing justice until the legal profession is nation-' alized, and the lawyer, like the policeman, made the servant of_ the public. If legal practitioners were paid by the State, we should have far fewer technical points raised, and less miserable repetition and dragging out of cases day by day. I be.lieve in the nationalization of all the professions ; and I point to the fact that, today, the Republic of France has nationalized religion, in the sense that every religion, no matter what its ethics may be, has a claim on the finances of the country, in proportion to the congregation. Thank The honourable goodness, we have no national Church in Australia, where every one is free to worship as he or she pleases. However, the law -is different 'in the various States; .and I have had some experience lately. A case in which I was interested was taken from Victoria to the High Court and then to New South Wales, and the first member of the legal profession whom I consulted subsequently got two years for some offence, while the second I consulted "" rooked"" me of £ 6 0 , and was afterwards sentenced, to seven years' imprisonment, but escaped owing to a technicality. Both these men, who were "" gentlemen "" by virtue of their profession, lived in the State of New South Wales. In the case of the medical profession, I am even more",33,Professional Registration
193,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.26],"convinced of the necessity for nationalization than in the case of the law. The late Dr. Gresswell, as a public servant, did more good for the health of Victoria than all the other medical men of the State in their individual capacity; and he could have done far more had he been given larger powers. The present chief of the Health Department of the State is a man of very high honours, and, though some people might prefer another considered by them a little more distinguished, he won his spurs at the Melbourne University, and has competed with credit in the outer world. I feel sure that Dr. Ham will follow in the footsteps of Dr. Gresswell; and I may say of the latter that his mother university, Cambridge, and other learned bodies of the Old Country .greatly regretted the loss of his services when he came to Australia. At the present time the great white plague is killing more persons than were killed in the battles of any century. plague has to be dealt with in a national way; and, if there be one mode of / registering the profession, it wiJ.l make it easier for some advanced Government of the future to declare that the public health is far too sacred to be in the hands of any private individuals. I can look forward to a time when all sickness will be treated in hospitals, and when there will be no medical men in the present sense. If a man of wealth takes ill or meets with an accident, he will probablv be attended'at Menzies' Hotel by a medical -nan who may bring with him the germs of other diseases; whereas such dangers would be averted if all cases were treated in properly appointed State hospitals. The present infirmary system in England is growing rapidly; and while it will be admitted that no hospital is absolutely perfect, yet it is now impossible for the average genera! practitioner to keep his studies up-to-date. A lecturer at one university at Home said that a medical man who could not examine sputa with a proper up-to-date microscope was taking his fees under false pretences. qualified men in Australia can afford such instruments? greatest analysts in Great Britain, has declared that the analysis of water is one of the most difficult that a chemist can undertake, although such knowledge of analysis is not necessary for the ordinary medical man. of the individual is more valuable and sacred than property; and yet, while we have publicly-paid Judges and policemen, with gaols, and so forth, all mainly for the protection of property, the security of the public health is lett to private effort. If the medical men were, so to speak, policemen to guard the public health, and were, of course, paid by the State, we should not find Collins-street and other thoroughfares crowded by doctors. Our big cities would not then be overmanned by surgeons and physicians as they are to-day. When the Kelly gang were terrorizing portion of Victoria, if any man away out in the back country was likely to be robbed, he had the whole police force at his back to support him, without a penny of cost to himself; but if the wife of such a man were hovering between life and death, about to bring forth a new unit in Australia's population, and the doctor were 20 miles away, his fee would have to be paid. I am not pointing a finger at the That fee, and no one knows better than the two medical men opposite that a doctor in the country cannot stay with all his patients. He may make a perfunctory visit, but if there is danger, he stays until the trouble is over, and then away back over the 20 miles by which he came to visit again on the second and fifth day. Our community cannot claim to be civilized until we rate the health of the human being above the care of property, and under a proper State system of medicine and surgery, no mother would be left without the care that she deserved in the hour of her need. In New Zealand, thanks to the Democratic leadership of the late Mr Seddon, no woman to-day need fear that she will lack the medical and nursing attention which are her right in her time of trouble. We cannot claim that that is so in Australia, nor do I know any other country in the world where it can be claimed; but New Zealand, so far as that reform was concerned, regarding the woman and the future child, stands on the highest pinnacle. If there were one system of registration throughout Australia, it would help But how many» to pave the way for any State which was wise enough to take over the control of Professor Luff, one of the duties which should not be left in the hands of a few self-elected individuals, who have the power, which they should not. have, of admitting, or refusing to admit, applicants to registration. It should be puf'down in plain simple language in the The health Act, so that no little galaxy of selfesteemed talent should have the right to refuse admission. One instance of which I knew in Western Australia was, 1 believe, due to a personal animus. A man had practised in that State and gone away. Ten years afterwards he wanted to be registered. guineas, took his money, and said they would return it if fhey did not register him. But they did not do so, and a little later they asked him for another two guineas, and got it. That was when Western Australia was under the sway of the man who was known as the King of the West-the head of the "" six families ""-the right honourable member who now represents Swan. I would point out the ridiculous absurdity and absolute farce that exists at the present moment of any medical man being able to register himself as a dentist. I do not know a single medical man in Australia-and I speak after four months' experience in a dental hospital under the late Mr Hayward, one of the greatest dentists in London1 challenge any one to point to a single medical man in Australia who can do bridge work, crown a tooth, take a proper mould, or properly clean out, asepticize and stop a cavity in a workmanlike manner. If there is one, 1 shall be glad to know his name. It is easy enough to remove a tooth, but an up-to-date dentist will not sacrifice a good tooth. If a man, on the other hand, asks a doctor to draw a good tooth, the doctor will generally do so. When I was practising in Western Australia, a man asked me ro draw a toqth for him. AlthoughI told him it was a good tooth, and that he should not have it drawn, lie insisted on having it out, and as I had a ride ot 50 miles ahead of me before the evening, on not too good a road, I at last consented to draw it. Afterwards, I asked him why he insisted on having a good tooth drawn, and he replied: "" I have been paying you for a couple of months, and I thought f might have some work for my money."" I should not have believed that if it had not happened to myself. If the profession of dentistry, as well as of medicine, were nationalized, much better arrangements could be made for the inspection and examination of our school children. Paris, which gives in charity £r,ooo"" for every pound that the municipality of Melbourne does-or did six years ago, when I took out the figures. They have 150 specialists to regularly examine the children at every school in the citv and suburbs, in regard to the eyes, mouth, nose, teeth, Dr. Moloney. and throat. Compare that with the result of the Commission of Inquiry quoted by Sir John Gorst in connection with the schools of Edinburgh, which is called the Athens of the British-speaking world, and The Board charged him two whose educational system is supposed to he absolutely the highest under the British flag. That report showed that in the Edinburgh schools, 75 per cent, of the children were suffering from "" disease of the nose, throat or ears,"" and no less than 30 per cent, from starvation. That was the infamy branded upon the Athens of the British Empire, although Scotland, in her treatment of the woman and the child, stands pre-eminent over England, Ireland, and Wales. I give Scotland her meed of praise for that; yet with all her advantages thirty out of every hundred little children being taught in the schools of Edinburgh are suffering from starvation. The medical world of the present day is being divided into two schools, which the Germans call the drug doctors and the natural doctors. Every one should know that more can be done by dieting and nursing than by the too frequent administration of drugs. If drugs could cure as some people think, what a lot of drugtakers doctors would' be ! And yet they take very few drugs indeed. In France, no child is taught hungry in the schools. Each child is fed by means of a system of baskets hung on pegs, in such a way that no child knows whether its neighbour has brought a meal or has been supplied with it. The medical profession of Paris advised the French Government to see that the children in the schools were fed, because, they said : "" You cannot bring up a strong, healthy race without it, just as you cannot raise plant life in a cellar, or breed animals properly without proper food, light, and air."" Great Britain could take a splendid example from France in that regard. Let me come now to the veterinary surgeons, whose work, to my mind, is a branch of the medical profession. We all know how a character in Milky White, the. famous play in which .George Coppin distinguished himself, had great confidence, which is half the battle, Take the example of in a man because he cured his cow, for, he thought, if he could cure a cow, he could cure a man. I am told that great difficulties are being made now in the matter of entering the veterinary surgeons' profession. Far too many and heavy fees are being exacted, and the profession is being limited to a. very few. Want of brain power will not keep out the Australian youth, so that I should like to see the examination made as hard as they please, but let it be absolutely free. I think I might have a quorum present. [Quorum formed.] I regret to state that it has been related to me that to become a dentist nowadays is really more expensive than to become a medical man. owing to the fees that are charged. Twenty years ago I moved in this Chamber that the university fees should be abolished. Although I' obtained the support of the then Minister of Public Instruction, the late Professor Pearson, a man of fine intellect, Victoria was not ripe then for the reform. Perhaps, if Democracy sends more members into the House, the next Parliament may be wise enough to pass it. I am sure that any professor would sooner lecture to 500 students than to five. In the case of the dentists, it is an anomaly that a men who is fully qualified to practise in New South VVales is not allowed to practise in Victoria. ready shown the utter ridiculousness of allowing a medical man to register as a dentist simply because he is a medical man. Dentistry is a profession which has to be specialized, and the average medical man knows nothing about it. I come now to the question of nursing. The nurses have been relegated in the past by the governing bodies to a position that is quite unjustified. The late Sir Edward Henry Sieveking, physician in ordinary to the late Queen, and one of the first holders of the Royal Society medal, stated in a lecture that every woman who takes up the professon of nursing shortens her life by from five to fifteen years. A fellow student of mine was engaged to one of the sisters of the hospital where he was working for his diploma. She had one dav off a month, and the first thing they did when the holiday came round was to go out and have a good meal, for the food at the hospital was very inferior. WhenJ moved in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria that the eight-hours system should he extended to nurses, I was laughed at. No less a man than Sir George Turner said that he thought it would be very dangerous in a critical case to change the nurse. It is in such cases that changes ought to be made. If the honourable member who submitted this motion has ever had a case of hvdrophobia or tetanus, he will know that in such cases the nurses arc changed every hour. In the old days when efforts used to be made to form a clot in a large artery by the application of the thumb, the attendant who had to do this work never remained on duty for more than ten or fifteen minutes. Many women, upon whose education large sums have been expended, join the nursing staffs of our hospitals, and are absolutely sweated. They receive a very low salary, and have to serve a long period of probation. I know of no more dangerous calling than that of a nurse. A doctor's life, compared with that of. a nurse, is a comparatively happy one. He calls 011 his patients, gives his instructions, and knows that in an acute case the more closely his orders are observed by the nurse the better is the chance of the patient's recovery. Nursing ought to be placed upon a different footing than it occupies at present. Any honest woman devoting eight hours a day to the work of nursing should be able in one year to learn all that a nurse ought to know. There is not a diploma issued in Great Britain excepting, possibly, the degrees of M.D., I have aland M.S. of London, and the F.R.C.S. Eng., that could not be obtained by a man of average ability who devoted to the task every day three hours of consistent and persistent study. The nurse follows a dull, miserable, and dangerous profession, and when the State proceeds to control the health of the individual, recognising, with Ruskin, that life is the only wealth, then, and then only, will she occupy the high position that she undoubtedly deserves. It makes my blood boil to think of the hours and hours during which the nurses in our big institutions have to remain continuously on duty. I have condemned these long hours again and again, and shall continue to do so. I shoulrj prefer to see adopted in connection with the nursing staffs of our big institutions the system observed at sea, where saiiors remain four hours on and eight hours off duty. That system could be adopted without difficulty, and it would give the nurses a better chance than they at present enjoy of preserving their health. In Australia they are not treated so badly as in the Old Land, but charity has been made very often a peg upon which to hang sweating and other cruelties. Charity, after all, is only the make-shift of the rich, who wish to dull their pangs of remorse. We need to have a uniform system of registration throughout ti.e States, so that an Australian-born shall be permitted to earn his or her own living as he or she has a right to do, on being properly registered. If the honourable member for Corangamite proposes, as I gather from the wording of his motion, to introduce a Bill dealing with this question, he mav count upon mv loyal co-operation. D r . ' LIDDE LL (Hunter) [6.2] -It is to be regretted that we have no power under the Constitution to legislate upon this question. Dr. [Quorum formed.] was expressing regret that this Parliament has no power at present to legislate with respect to these matters, and that to obtain that power it would be necessary to ask for a referendum of the people on a proposed amendment of the Constitution. I do not know that the referendum is altogether desirable. It has its good and its bad points. take the good. thing like a horse, in that it is able only to make up its mind upon one thing at a time. We are supposed to be specialists in politics, and the people look to us for explanations and advice when any question is to be submitted to them in the form of a referendum. It is sometimes to be regretted that the necessity for such an appeal to the people should arise. The honourable member for Corangamite is to be congratulated upon the attitude he has taken up. He has moved that it is desirable for the better protection of the people to have uniformity of legislation on this subject, and I ' must confess that the words ""protection of the people"" and "" uniformity "" appeal strongly to me. I am almost reluctant tp speak in this House on medical matters, because they meet with little sympathy in an assembly of this description. No sooner does a medical man raise his voice than his ears are assailed with the cry ""Trade Unionism,"" or with ribald jokes. is one of the noblest. noblest, if not the noblest, of all the professions, and a man who enters it from sordid motives is unworthy of being a member of it. Unfortunately, the profession is sometimes prostituted. As education becomes more general there is a tendency to enter the medical profession on the part of some men who do not do so in good faith. social standing. there is a standing which education should give to every one of us. Education is the hall-mark of our standing; 'the nobility of humanity. The question is not whether a man is a KC.B. or a noble lord, but whether he has talents, and the sense and cation is not a preparation for life; it islife itself. We are none of us too old to learn, and from the cradle to the grave it is for us to educate ourselves, and so to make our jives more progressive. Reference has been made to the ethics of the medical profession. I take it that the meaning of the word "" ethics "" in this connection is simply ""the protection of the people."" We have in the profession a code of morals having as its basis the and protection of our patients. Under that code a medical man who, from anv cause has to cease attending a patient before he is convalescent must consult with his successor, and lay before him all he knows of the case. He must also inform him of the drugs that he has been administering. Serious results might happen if that were not done. Certain drugs are cumulative in their action, and it would be a serious thing if the successor were not informed of the drugs that had been administered, since he might continue their use in such a way as to imperil the life of the patient. Yet professional men are constantly spoken against because of their refusal to consult other than recognised practitioners. Uniformity of registration apd regulation throughout the Commonwealth is desirable. Federation was established to sweep away the fiscal boundaries which divided the States, to .substitute one Commonwealth system of defence for a number of State systems, and to secure uniformity of action in matters like that under discussion. I am qualified to practise in New South Wales and Victoria. qualified man practise in any part of the Commonwealth ? the chief reasons why there should be uniformity such as I speak of. To practise inNew South Wales a man must register there, and if such a man crossed into Victoria to attend a patient, without becoming registered in this State as well, he would be liable to criminal prosecution for malpractice.

To acquire a diploma in medicine a man must spend several years in study, must pay for the instruction which is necessary, and must maintain himself for several years during which he is earning nothing. On becoming qualified, he is entitled to be paid for his skill and knowledge, and to a return upon the capital which he has invested in his education. Now, there are many districts in Australia where the population is so sparse and scattered that it would not pay a medical man to settle in them. It has been suggested that the Government might well appoint medical officers in such districts. something of that kind may be done. But as things stand, it is questionable whether persons who, for want of a diploma, are not registered, should not be permitted to exercise what skill they have in alleviating suffering. Such persons may have only a limited knowledge of medicine, but unquestionably they often fill positions in which In some countries, they are needed. Of course, there are seme such persons who are mere imposters, whose only object is to exploit the public. to the appointment of Government medical We have acted very liberofficers in certain districts. somewhat of Socialisma word which strikes terror into the hearts of many persons; but, as we have Government railways and other public works, T do not see why it should not be done.

220,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay) [7.45],"Iideas j but it is clear that the Premiers could not have been more successful in their search for an advocate of the case they believe in and put forth to the people, if they had selected the Prime Minister for the position. The honourable gentleman is noted for his ability to make even a bad case appear a good one, and a late member of this House once said that the present Prime Minister could make the road to a certain place, which need not be mentioned, look attractive. I do not say that the present position is on all-fours with thatshall I say?-allegorica l statement of a previous supporter of the Prime Minister; but I do say that the honourable gentleman has not fulfilled those duties which, in my opinion, a Prime Minister ought to have fulfilled at the Premiers' Conference in protecting the best interests of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister told us in clear and distinct language that he and his Ministry had been able, for the first time, to come to an agreement with the States, and that it would be a great advantage to the people of the Commonwealth and of the States-who , he elaborately set forth, are the same people-if the two parties to the agreement worked in unison in matters of the kind. But I am not so sure about that, because, if it had been so, the Commonwealth should have agreed with the Premiers at the first Conference, and we ought not to have wrangled here one single day; as soon as the State Premiers contested the Commonwealth authority, we ought to have bowed and acknowledged their supremacy. however, did not do that, but took advantage of the rights which were conveyed to this Parliament by the Constitution, and which made us the guardians of the destiny of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister, if I understood him correctly, said that the guardians of the Constitution and the destinies of the Commonwealth were two separate entities that we were responsible up to a certain point, but that, in regard to State interests, it was desirable, if not imperative, that we should consider the States as guardians of the Constitution. I stated previously, when sneaking on the Budget, that the Prime Minister undoubtedly grafted the preamble to the agreement. If I am in error, I fullv apologize; but in the draft agreement we find the following'words:That to fulfil the' intention of the Constitution by providing for the consolidation and transfer of State debts, and in order to insure the most profitable management of future loans by the establishment of one Australian Stock a complete investigation of this most important subject shall be undertaken forthwith by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. This investigation shall include the question of the actual cost to the States of transferred properties as defrayed out of loan or revenue moneys. In my opinion, the Prime Minister, in that preamble, gains nothing and supports nothing, though he may delude the public regarding the true position. He proposes iii the next paragraph of the agreement to divide the Commonwealth revenue between thc Commonwealth and the States, and he sets forth that the provision to that end shall be put into the Constitution, and shall not at any future time be interfered with. agreement shall not at any time be interfered with? Government say to the contrary, they are not honestly presenting the true case to the public. What should we say of a number of men, who happened to be the Ministers of the Commonwealth, coming down to this House and temporizing with a matter of this kind, while pretending that they are going to secure for the people an irrevocable advantage? We expect better things of the Ministry, and yet we have the Minister of Defence following on the same lines as the Prime Minister, and saying that in this matter the Constitution may be altered now, and altered again later on. The circumstances are not the same to-day as when the Constitution The Commonwealth, was first drawn up by the Convention. Undoubtedly some of the delegates were exceedingly anxious, as we were entering into a new system of government-on e practically unique in the world's history-that the financial, provisions should be tested for a few years before being finally decided upon. But they left the power of dealing finally with the question of finance to the Federal Parliament alone, and it has been reserved for one of the principal representatives at the Convention to come clown now, as the advocate of what are called State Rights, but are not State Rights at all, with a proposition to divide the powers of the Commonwealth with the States, and prevent true national progress. The Government, and the head of the Government particularly, have sacrificed some of the national interests of the Commonwealth for the sake of a little temporary advantage.

I repeat that with the Labour party the question is not a party one. It is well that the Ministerial party should understand lhat, because I hear that they have been holding caucus after caucus to determine what should be their attitude. ' I presume that the question will be debated by honourable members opposite, and that we shall not have repeated in this House .what took place for the first time a week or two ago, when the State Premiers, after discussing this question with the Commonwealth delegation, declined to let the people know any of the reasons advanced at the Conference for the bringing about of this agreement. If we are to be told nothing concerning the counsels of the State and the Commonwealth, and honourable members opposite are to remain silent, the people themselves will suspect that more than the welfare of the Commonwealth is dependent upon this agreement. I am loth to leave the question of the transfer of the State debts, because I think the Prime Minister was weaker on that point than on any other which he touched upon during his speech. I understand that a Commission is to be appointed to investigate the question of the transfer of the State debts. be appointed. should hold in suspense the question of what shall be the revenue returnable to the States until that Commission has completed its investigation, and reported as to fhe best means of making the distribution. The Minister of Defence will admit that if the Commission is to be appointed forthwith, it must be the desire of the Government to hurry on some arrangement, .yet to be arrived at, to enable us to obtain from the States the necessary funds to enable us to deal with their loans and take over their present indebtedness. I presume that that is what the Government have in their minds. If it is it should be clearly stated. Regarding the future borrowing of the States, I should like to express an opinion that I have always held, although, perhaps, it is unpopular, and will not be acceptable to the House. I hold that the States should not be interfered with in any way, so far as their future borrowing is concerned. If this Parliament is what it ought to be-if its leaders are what they ought to be-the credit of the Commonwealth will soon be considerably better than that of the best of the States. That being so, we can rely on the good sense of the electors of the States, who are also the electors of the Commonwealth, to take care that the States shall not borrow outside the Commonwealth when they can borrow more cheaply through it. If that were done, a great deal of the opposition at present offered to the transfer of the State debts would be removed. It is only paltering with the question to try to confine the States absolutely to borrowing through the Commonwealth'.

I wish now to address myself very briefly to the position taken up by the State Premiers regarding the transfer of the debts. I should like the Prime Minister to tell us when the State Premiers were first converted to the proposal. At what time have they publicly stated that they are in favour of the States' transferring their .debts to the Commonwealth? The first intimation that we have had on the subject is contained in the preamble to the agreement, from which it appears that they have been bargaining with the Commonwealth. Under that agreement they have secured, for all time, a monetary payment per capita tor State purposes. We must bear in mind, however, the reservation which the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence have made, that if the agreement be embodied in the Constitution the people can amend it whenever they desire. amend the Constitution in this way, leaving in the public mind the impression that it is to be a tentative amendment, when it should be a permanent one, we shall get as near political immorality as I can conceive of. honesty about such a suggestion. possibility. sibility of altering the Constitution; but if we think that it should be altered again, we should say so now. what is likely to happen thirty years hence ? what the wisdom of the people of Australia may suggest years hence. The Labour party, recognising that fact, review the whole of their programme once in every three years. we put forward to-day as part of our programme will be reviewed in the light of our experience three years hence. I agree with the honourable member that no one can foresee the possibilities of the future; that no one can tell what political conditions may arise from the superior knowledge we possess in years to come. But that is hardly an argument in favour of the present proposal. The Government propose to make it impossible for the people to remedy the evils of the present agreement whenever those evils are recognised. It is said that if we do not embody the agreement in the Constitution, we shall have at every election wrangling as to the amount of money that the States will receive, or the Commonwealth may withhold. That may be true, but it is a charge against the political morality of the Parliament. While the Prime Minister was speaking, one or two on this side asked, ""What about the Sugar Bounty Act?"" That was a fair question. How often have Parliaments shown themselves ready to repudiate such arrangements? Does the Prime Minister say that if we made provision in an Act for the return to the States, during a term of ten years, of a certain sum per capita, the arrangement might be repudiated? Such a suggestion would be unworthy of him. If we passed an Act embodying an arrangement to have force for five years, time would be given for further investigation if necessary, and the matter would come up for consideration again when there might be a more liberal national feeling than there is now. The honourable gentleman said that this .Parliament has great duties to perform, and, therefore, needs an enlargement of power. I agree with him. He spoke There is not the shadow of of getting this increase of power by the separation of Commonwealth and State finance, of which he spoke. He said that his proposal would leave this Parliament free. He forgot that in any case it will be free in a very short time In 1910 the Braddon section will cease to bind us. What, then, is tp be gained by a settlement of this matter six months earlier than we forecast it need be settled? The Prime Minister made a great deal of the fact that by the proposed arrangement, the States would pay to the Commonwealth £600,000, and that we should get another £1,000.000 six months earlier than it would otherwise come to us. This is only a temporary adEvery political proposition vantage.

248,Mr Fisher,"No one can forecastdelighted at the prospect of avoiding Commonwealth borrowing. Undoubtedly the Gov ernment would have been seriously embarrassed had it put forward definite proposals for borrowing, and I agree that it would have been deplorable if , after having prevented Sir George Turner from raising a loan for £500,000 in 1902, we now proceeded to borrow for ordinary current expenditure. But Jet me go back to the genesis of the Conference, and read a letter which was sent to its president by a distinguished member of this House. I l is as follows :sident of the approaching Conference, I take the opportunity-and I do not think it will be considered a liberty-of impressing upon you and your brother Premiers the supreme necessity of a final adjustment, without delay, of the nnancial problems affecting the Commonwealth and the States. It seems to me that there is, whilst the matter remains open, an increasing danger of an arrangement, which can be determined in a short time, not by conference or compromise but by the will of the Federal Parliament. What an awful calamity to be imminent. Time is on the side of your opponents. I am more responsible than any other man for the termination of the Braddon clause, but I never wished to allow the States less than a fair share of Customs and Excise revenue, which is the only way in which the States can receive revenue from the masses of their inhabitants. The object of this letter is to 'make that sure for all time. I do not wish to introduce any views of my own, except to state that there are one or two main points in which I think the States should be considered, viz. :(1) They should have a fair share of the Commonwealth revenue. (2) That share should be on a fer capita basis. (3) It should increase automatically with the growth of the revenue and population, or at least with the population growth. (4) There should be no other point of contact in matters of revenue between the Commonwealth and the States. If I may add another word, I think the States should offer to pay the old-age pensions money until the end of the Braddon clause-thos e States, at any rate, which have been relieved of their pension systems, to the amount of such relief-otherwisee I think you may suffer permanently far more than can be imagined. Yours very sincerely, G. H . REID . That letter and the agreement are practicI understood that the Prime Minister was ally interchangeable. It was a singular a Protectionist; and my idea of Protection thing that a private member should think is that it involves duties sufficiently high Mr Fisher. it necessary to write to the Conference just at the proper moment from the point of view, not of the public interest, but of that of this Government. Every influence was sought to bring about the desired result. The Prime Minister was the ready and willing servant of the Premiers. He adopted their proposals, -practically without protest, or serious amendment. Except for the preamble regarding the State debts, which will be dead and buried as soon as this proposal is carried, he was able to insist upon nothing. The letter deserves attention, because the agreement practically coincides, with its suggestions. quite alike. The arrangement suggested in the letter would increase the State receipts as time went on. not absolutely word for word alike, but their general tenor is so much the same that if they were both read to an audience, it would be said that the agreement is only an extension of the suggestions in the letter. The agreement indicates that in a very short time the Federal Parliament wili proceed to impose any taxation it may please to impose, and would not have any particular source of revenue hypothecated to provide money for the States. Everybody knows that to be true; but we should not be more free than before, or than we should be at the end of 1910 without the agreement. The right honourable member for East Sydney stated in his letterI am more responsible than any other man for the termination of the Braddon clause, but I never wished to allow the States less than a fair share of Customs and Excise revenue, which is the only way in which the States can receive revenue from the masses of their inhabitants. Yet we have the Prime Minister saying that there is no intention to take more money from the inhabitants. In the report of a press interview with the right honourable member for East Sydney, subsequent to the Conference agreement, it is stated that he was in favour of that agreement, (because it was the only way that taxation should be got from the multitude. Is that the aim of the Prime Minister in entering into the agreement-to have an opportunity to increase the Customs and Excise receipts to such an extent as to enable him .to carry on all the purposes of the Commonwealth ?",45,Deakin

250,Mr Henry Willis,The two are not,46,Deakin
251,Mr Fisher,"The two documents areto enable industries to be established, which, of course, would practically deprive us of revenue from that source. If it is meant that the Commonwealth will be free to impose additional revenue duties, then I think the Prime Minister ought to say so. The .honourable gentleman speaks of the States having no resources in the way of Customs and Excise duties; and that is quite true. But they have every other source of revenue open to them, while we also have, every source open, plus the Customs and Excise. But the Prime Minister safeguarded himself -and again I am indebted to the press for the full report of the speech-by using the words ""except by direct taxation""; and that clearly means, that the Prime Minister had. not in his mind the idea of imposing such taxation. I now ask the Prime Minister whether he really believes, as.he invites other people to believe, that the time will soon come when the Commonwealth will be able to contribute to the revenue, through the Customs and Excise, an amount in excess of £ 3 ios. per head. The idea is ridiculous and absurd; and, in my opinion, that piece of special pleading was worse than worthless-it was not only absolutely useless, but, though not intentionally, misunless they appear in Hansard.

The Prime Minister made a good point of the fact that we are at present receiving from the Customs and Excise, towards our expenditure, the sum of only £2,700,000, and said that by the proposal of the Government there would be added> practically immediately, £2,250,000 to that amount. But, although there is to be added £2,250,000, how much will be added in the ten years from 1910-11 to 1920-1? Practically is. per head of the Commonwealth population; and all the growing expenses of those years will have to be made good from some other source. As a temporary expedient for two or three years, it may be all very well; but there is no provision in the agreement for a largely increased revenue in years to come If honourable members turn to page 5 of the agreement, they will find that the Treasurer has prepared two tables comparing ihe estimated payments to the States under the proposals of the Conference, with the estimated three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for the years 1910-11, 1 0 I 5 > and 1920-1.

However, I had better state the figures in these very important tables'.

The estimated amount payable to the States in accordance with the proposals of the Melbourne Conference, at £ 1 5s. per capita, would be £5,543,750, with a special payment to Western Australia of £250,000. The moiety of the special payment to Western Australia deducted from the States would be £125,000, leaving a net amount of £5,668,750; and showing the difference to the States, as compared with the book-keeping distribution, at £2,373,100.'

He knew that the views he expressed would have to be accepted by this Government. thought the right honourable member had a better opinion of them, and had regard for their independence, but apparently he did not think it necessary to consult them in order to enable his views to be carried at the Conference. He, therefore, took the stand of an independent member, and wrote to the President of the Conference, knowing well the kind of men that he had to deal with in the Federal Government. In that he paid a very poor compliment to the Ministry to whom he has publicly promised support, and from whom he, perhaps, expects to get certain necessary protection and support in return. It showed very little respect for them that he did not let them know what he was doing. I accept the statement of the Minister of Defence that they knew nothing about the letter. At any rate, the right honourable member for East Sydney deserves all the credit for this Conference agreement. I trust that he will take the field in favour of it in the same manner as he took it in favcui of the Commonwealth Constitution Bill. He being the author of this agieement, we shall expect him to address a large meeting, explaining its value to the people of the Commonwealth. If he balances his arguments then as well as he balanced them in that celebrated meeting in the Sydney Town Hall, I shall ask nothing better for the enlightenment of the people. from the Government about this matter, even up to the present time, long after the agreement was arrived at, that naturally some of us are apprehensive as to the reasons for their silence. We are apprehensive also on account of the want of frankness on the part of those who are bound sooner or later to take up a definite position upon the agreement. I do not think there was ever a time in the history of .any Parliament when on a big question like this members refused to commit themselves as certain members of this Parliament have done ever since the agreement came about. We have the Government meeting from time to time in the endeavour apparently to get an agreement among themselves to bind themselves irrevocably to this proposal. We also have the Prime Minister stating, or we have it indirectly stated for him, that this will be made a Government matter, and that the Government would stand or fall on it: If that is so, it becomes a question of I the existence of the Government, and consequently their supporters are not allowed to speak on it.

Is it not humiliating that such should be the case? see evidences of it every day. Mark the temporizing character of parties tottering in and out of office-wit h little courage, but with a magnificent ability to explain why they are in office, or why they should be there. No taunt in that regard can be hurled at me. From the moment that the Labour Government came into power, both the Prime Minister and the' Minister of Defence knew what attitude I took up. Even when an attempt was made, before we had been more than eight or nine days in office, to turn us out, I told them that they could take possession of the Treasury benches. Thus the taunt to which I have referred cannot be hurled at me. trouble that has arisen in the Federal Parliament has been due largely to want of courage.

No sensible man believes that we have reached a. critical period in the history of the Commonwealth. some very senseless people in the Commonwealth. there are many people, who, not knowing the facts, are under a grave misapprehension as to the present situation. Many think that the Commonwealth desires to steal money belonging to the States. If it did, and the people knew it, the trouble would soon be at an end. The responsibility for the misapprehension that exists outside with respect to this question lies largely with the Prime Minister, since he has failed to afford opportunities in this Parliament for more -discussions of the financial question than have taken place. Many of us have desired that more such opportunities should be afforded, and I feel confident that a number of honourable members could enlighten the public on this particular question. I trust that, late in the day as it is, some enlightenment will be given the people before this matter is determined by the House. In the course of his speech, the Prime Minister used the words ""beggar or bankrupt the States."" mean? Did he wish to suggest that any party would attempt to beggar or bankrupt them? Is it not utter nonsense to suggest that there are parties desirous of beggaring the States? From time to time proposals in regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and We more particularly in relation to the transfer of the State debts, have been put forward with the object of assisting both the States and the Commonwealth. Notwithstanding that this scheme is to endure for all time, it will help the States less than others that have been proposed would do. It will not help them nearly so much as it would if it provided for the Commonwealth taking over a proportion of the debts of the States, theannual interest payable on which would be equivalent to the 25s. per head of the population that. we are to return to the States. Under this scheme, this Parliament will be deprived of its national position. Labour Conference propound a scheme? several occasions, and, in the report of the Premiers' Conference at Hobart, the honourable member will find it clearly and distinctly set forth. At that Conference I stated my position in regard to the Brisbane Labour Conference scheme, and save for the fact that it was not proposed to embody it in the Constitution, it resembled very closely that proposed by the Premiers. It was a general outline of a sound scheme. The very first announcement of policy made by the present Government contained a statement that the scheme which they intended to submit so closely resembled that prepared at the Brisbane Labour Conference that it should . on that account be acceptable to us. It has the defect which I have stated. What becomes now of the cry that the Labour party is incompetent to produce any scheme worth considering? At the Brisbane Conference an alternative scheme was proposed. I have never concealed my view that, in the re-arrangement of the finances, the Commonwealth should take over the indebtedness of Australia.

The Prime Minister yesterday made an important announcement when he said that, had he had another week with the Premiers, he could have settled the debts question. After he had agreed to return to the States a certain fixed sum annually, he would have negotiated for getting part of it back ! What chance would there be of that? I know some of those with whom he was negotiating, and having carefully read his speech several times, in addition to hearing it, I recognise in it the language of some of the most bitter enemies of the Federation, men who have toiled and wormed themselves into Conferences, to defeat the purposes of this national Government. Having got the Prime Minister bound, they said, "" We graciously permit you to appoint a Commission to inquire as to the best means of dealing with the debts."" We know what Commissions can accomplish. When would such an investigation be completed? Might not the Commissioners think it imperative to visit London to acquire information, instead of accepting reports and published lists of securities ? In the meantime, would the States return to the Treasurer part of the 25s. to enable him to pay their indebtedness? No doubt the Prime Minister is innocent enough to believe what he said to be true. But we cannot accept his story. He tried to convey the impression that if the agreement were not endorsed, this Parliament would remain bound. But he, and every honourable member, knows that at the end of 1910 the Braddon section will cease to fetter us, if we desire to legislate in regard to finance. The Government apparently takes the view that those who return representatives to this Parliament cannot be trusted. by referring the agreement to them? able member. The agreement was drawn up as the result of an effort by the newspapers, Ministers, and Ministerial supIt was said, "" If we come to an agreement now, we shall be able to dish them. If you will scratch my political back, I will therefore, a scratch yours, and we shall thus be able to do something to the disadvantage of those who hold certain political views."" Those who are opposed to us occupy Ministerial positions in the. States and in the Commonwealth, and took advantage of the fact to advance their own political ends. Their present influence is such that, even though in a minority, they might be able to carry I have always this scheme through Parliament, and get a majority of the people and of tbe States to vote for it. But is it to be thought that what is the opinion of the people on this subject now will be their opinion two or three years hence? And does any one honestly believe that it would be as easy to strike the proposed amendment out of the Constitution as it would be to insert it ? The Constitution is defective. A majority of the people cannot carry a referendum. The Prime Minister would say that that provision was inserted for the protection of the minority. But the majority can return a majority of representatives to this House, which can carry its wishes into effect, despite the other Chamber.

308,Mr Fisher,"I shall tell the honoracceptance in another place, we may, after a term, pass it again, and compel the Senate to also face its masters. We have every kind of machinery to insure that the will of the people shall prevail in this House. It is undemocratic, if three small States-say, Australia, and South Australia-should decide against any referendum proposal, that the proposal should not be carried. From a Democratic point of view the Constitution is not sound on that point; and that is one reason why this provision should not be put in the Constitution, when there is a Parliament, both Houses of which are, directly elected by the people. Further, the Senate was designed particularly to represent the States, and, under the Constitution, the small State of Tasmania elects as many senators as does the large State of New South Wales. The interests of the States, financial and otherwise, are thus guarded. I have always held that Premiers' Conferences, while useful in their way, constitute an absolute reflection on the Senate, and, when I attended the Hobart gathering, and chatted over matters, I took care to show that I in no way lost sight of the fact that there was such a House in existence. Whatever may be the result of the Government proposals, the Prime ""Minister has, in my opinion, disappointed a large number of those who differed politically from him, but who, in'other respects, are extremely friendly, and desire to see him close his political life giving us a political lead from a national point of view. Of course, there are honourable members who are quite incapable of understanding anything in politics beyond their own personal interests-honourable members who have had no experience of facing the jicople on unpopular questions do not know the feeling to which I refer. There are men in politics who have always floated in on sympathetic waves, with the press behind them, or a great public leader in front; and they cannot understand such a position as I have indicated; but there are other. honourable members here, who commenced their political career without any support, and in the face of long continued newspaper vilification. understand the bitterness of political contest, they have ideas beyond the mere saying of their own political skin; and, whether they occasionally lose a seat or not, they can feel respect for those honestly engaged on the other side of the fight. But honourable members, who take the view that the agreement represents a passing phase of State apprehension, will be disappointed Mr Fisher. if they do not find in their leaders men who, while careless of political conditions, are careful of the national welfare of the people of the Commonwealth. I desire to take advantage of this opTasmania, Western portunity to draw attention to the Budget speech delivered by the Treasurer four weeks ago; but before I do so, I should like to refer to the closing words of the Leader of the Opposition, and follow them up with a different exordium. The honourable member, in the restricted area to which he and some of his friends belong, may regard the speech of the Prime Minister last evening as likely to lose the honourable gentleman a few, if not numerous, friends. But the Prime Minister is associated with every Premier throughout Australia, and, the agreement having been, arrived at in Conference, the heads of the Governments have left for their States, and will soon be recommending to their Parliaments, and through them, to the electors proposals, which I am sure the majority of the people throughout Australia will endorse. We are still under the influence of the glamour of the great speech delivered last night by the Prime Minister, a speech from which our minds can hardly more, even though twenty four hours have elapsed, and which will dwell in our memory for years, and cause us from time to time to speak of the honourable gentleman's oratory as becoming a great man and a great statesman. No speech which the Prime Minister has delivered here or elsewhere will go down to posterity conveying a clearer idea of what can be accomplished by a man of his ability; because the speech was worthy of the occasion, and the occasion was worthy of the speech. I am sure that the Prime Minister's utterance will be read by our constituents with very much pleasure. The people to whom the honourable gentleman has rendered great services, though he may have been mistaken in some of the work he has attempted, will, I feel sure, be perfectly satisfied with fhe results of the Conference. I now desire to refer to the speech of the Treasurer. If such members A Budget speech is looked forward to by the people with more than ordinary interest, representing, as it does, a statement of their assets and liabilities.

Undoubtedly the increase in the number of factories and hands employed is principally attributable to the fact that we have raised a high Tariff.

You accomplish the one purpose of Protection by assisting your factories to manufacture goods, and by increasing the number of persons employed therein, but you also bring in good revenue. So in its first year the Lyne Tariff, under abnormal circumstances, I admit, £11,600,000, which came down, last year to what may be regarded, as the more normal revenue of £10,843,985, and the Treasurer, after consulting with the officers of the Customs Department, estimates it at £10,800,000 current year. I am not at all disposed to disagree with the right honourable gentleman. .When he first delivered his Budget, I arrived at the conclusion, without very much consideration, that that might be considered a fair estimate. But we have to-day to rejoice, if an increase of revenue is a matter of pleasure, at the fact that a period of two months of the current financial year has already given us nearly £200,000 in excess'of its proportion of the estimated revenue, so that the £10,800,000 which was estimated to be realized is likely to be considerably exceeded. We have in that a further testimony, seeing that our imports have 'so largely increased during the last nine years, to the prosperity of the country and the people. But the idea of a scientific Tariff altogether disappears. There is no science in the matter at all. There is simply the imposition of a larger amount of duty here and there, but the result defies all your powers or purposes of Protection, because your revenue greatly benefits, and let us hope that the people benefit also. tion of a high Tariff, we naturally come to the question of expenditure, because the revenue which we receive must find an outlet somewhere. I mention this only to sound a note of warning, in the hope that every honourable member will recollect that we must look forward to many drains upon the revenue in the future. That consideration should make us just as careful with the public revenue as we should be with our own-to make provision year by year for circumstances which may arise. Let me in this connection call attention to the very large amount which we have spent upon practically nothing. ""nothing,"" I am not raising any objection to the old cry of a White Australia. I believe in it myself, and I should like to accomplish a purely white Australia, but we have spent a vast sum of monev in accomplishing practical'v nothing in that Sir Philip Fysh, direction. I know that as a member of the first Federal Parliament I am partly responsible for this, and I am blaming no one. I am simply using the fact to show that we should be very much more careful when indulging in expenditure to see that brought in We know what we are doing. We have got rid qf 4,000 Kanakas, and we have remaining over 60,000 Syrians, Japanese, and Chinese. . If we could have cleared the whole of them out, we should have accomplished a White Australia; but to say that for the we have done anything to realize that ambition of the people is simply misleading. We have spent £14,000 in deporting the Kanakas; we have given £2,300,000 in sugar bounties, and there must also be added the difference of £2,106,000 between the sugar duty and the Excise; so that we have spent, to get rid of 4,000 Kanakas, a total of £4,420,000. Unfortunately, we find from the statistics that the Treasurer has given us that the output of sugar in Queensland during the current year is expected to fall off very considerably, so that the Excise is estimated to be only £150,000, as against £257,000 last year. ber attribute that to the departure of the Kanaka? we have given all this to Queensland, hoping to encourage a larger output. We expected, of course, that she would monopolize the whole of the sugar trade of Australia, or I suppose some of us would not have voted for some of the great changes Passing from the questhat we made, or would not have voted, at any rate, for the difference between the Excise and the duty, or for the bounty. I allude, therefore, to these matters as reckless finance, in the hope of securing attention to the necessity of being more prudent in the future, and of watching the Treasury Department closely with respect to its expenditure. I need not dwell upon tjje fact that we have spent £14,000 in viewing Federal Capital sites. It is to be hoped that our expenditure in that direction, after the £5,000 put down for this year is spent, will have nearly ceased. In connection, again, with our revenue from Customs and Excise, I think there are sources In using the term of income which are altogether overlooked. The Excise paid on tobacco during the past year was £651,000, at is. per lb.; and owing to the difference between the duty on manufactured tobacco and that on unmanufactured tobacco, allowing for the Excise, we are losing another £650,000.3 year.

In order to save the Commonwealth £120,000 per annum by way of interest on loans, we have robbed the poorer classes, who would have accumulated this money, and obtained from it a yield of from 8 to 10 per cent. that way relieved a man of taxation amounting to £ 1 , what interest would he have got from that amount? who puts money in the Savings Bank desires to add to it. Even if, in the case of an individual, the saving effected would amount to only about £ 1 , in the aggregate it would amount to £360,000. The Scotchman says, "" Many a mickle makes a muckle,"" and if we teach the people to be thrifty, we shall have accomplished a great work. I shall offer no excuse for quoting from an article on "" Federal nnd Strte Finance Problems,"" published in a brochure by Mr R. M. Johnston, the very capable Government Statistician of Tasmania-wh o is also a phenomenal worker-in which he deals with the question of loans, and shows how borrowing has paid. He writesSince the year 1842, the six States of Australia have practically entered into partnership with local and foreign capitalists in the construction of all such important works, and in no other way would it have been possible to have succeeded in making the initial outlay of over £240,000,000 in a period of about sixty-four years, or at the rate, of about £3,750,000 per annum. Notwithstanding that, the total interest burden on such State debts has thereby nominally increased by 24s. 8d. per head, And this is the point which I wish honourable members particularly to noticesince 1870, such has been the marked increase in the profits of working State railways alone, namely, 25s. i d . per head, that the total interest burden connected with the total State debt of £240,000,000 has actually diminished by 5d. per head. In other words, we have borrowed more, and paid more interest, andyet the expenditure has been a reproductive outlay. The quotation reminds me of the statement made by the honourable member for Parkes a few nights since, that it is better to borrow for reproductive works than to spend our revenue upon themThat is, the profit to the State"" Treasuries from the working of State railways alone, apart from the unmeasurable material benefit resulting from the opening of vast areas of virgin lands by cheap and rapid mode of transit and communication, has already almost wholly wiped off the taxpayers' interest burden on the whole of the accumulated debt of ,£240,000,000,. I hope that honourable members follow that statement. The difference between the old carriage rates by road and the new carriage rates by rail is of so much importance that it has already almost wiped out the whole of the interest burden on the capital sum of £ 2 4 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . In spite of errors in the initial practical work of . carrying out the industrial policy of the State, it has resulted in giving room and a productive field of work to a population 2.55 times the number so employed in the year 1870, and, after deducting the share of our local ancl foreign capitalist co-partners, we find that the income of the people of the Commonwealth has a present capital value which exceeds that of the year 1870 by as much as £3,473,000,000 sterling. In addition, we have a valuable asset in our 14,060 miles of railways to bequeath to posterity, and the effect in the saving of cost of transit alone is estimated to be equivalent to a present capital value of £826,000,000 sterling. I thought that statement worthy of reproduction in Hansard, so that the people may know that in borrowing money for reproductive works we are doing them not only an immediate good, but one that must go on increasing year by year. tion that at the same time we are bequeathing to posterity an annual obligation of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ?' ing to posterity all the advantages of our railway systems,, and are accomplishing year by year in connection with those railways that which the honourable member desires-the settlement of the people on the land. It is idle to talk of settling the people on the land whilst by our Tariff we are inducing them to settle in our cities. When we can make railways and roads into parts of our great States where the people can be settled on the land, I shall hold up both hands for settling people on the soil as fast as we can. But until we have such means of communication, whether it be in Tasmania or elsewhere, it is idle to talk about land settlement. settlement. taken notion. A land tax will be of little service in that regard, unless we extend our railways and roads into the interior. I am with the honourable member in his desire to settle the people on the soil, provided that we proceed along honest lines, and by buying the lands we require frcm tliose to whom they belong.

319,Sir Philip Fysh,"That is a misthe Melbourne of to-day with what it was in 1835, when Batman and Fawkner came here-whe n I think of the work of the pioneers from 1835 to 1855 I am astonished that any honourable member should be in favour of so imposing taxation as possibly to confiscate the lands which their descendants have inherited from them. The policy of borrowing, if proceeded with on proper lines, must be beneficial. I do not suggest that we should adopt the method favoured by the Labour partyI do not suggest that we should commandeer £8,000,000 of the reserve funds of our banking institutions and pay no interest upon that amount. Nor do I suggest that we should issue Commonwealth notes to the value of £4,000,000, as suggested by the honourable member for Wide Bay at Gympie, and keep a gold reserve of only £2,000,000, thus saving 3 per cent, on the remaining £2,000,000, when at the present moment the banks are paying z\ per cent, and 3 per cent, on £4,000,000. In that way we should lose the duty on the present bank note issue, of about £3,500,000, and gain by the saving of 3 per cent., which I have mentioned, only about half that amount. Therefore, the issue of notes in the manner suggested in the Gympie speech would mean a loss to the Commonwealth. If the Government should find it necessary to raise a loan, I trust that it will obtain the money locally, to any considerable extent. I .was assothough the arrangements made in the recent Conference may avoid, for the present, the necessity for borrowing. gained by borrowing locally? ter to borrow locally than to go to England for a small sum. comes within the scope of the question before the House. pursue it further, though in dealing with the Budget, and with the results of the Premiers' Conference, we shall hardly be able to avoid the consideration of how funds are to be raised, not immediately, but in the future. No one rejoices more than I do that the Conference was able to come to an agreement with the representatives of this Government. So many Conferences were without result that we were vejry (desirous that a scheme should be agreed to on this occasion which Parliament could recommend to the people. Personally, I applaud the Conference for the work which it has accomplished. It may be said that Tasmania will benefit more than the other States by the proposed arrangement.' No doubt 'for that we shall have to thank the people of New South Wales, who will lose £100,000 a year so that Tasmania may gain £1,000 or £2,000 a year. But Tasmania will have to make a large contribution for the payment of old-age pensions, and the net sum which she will receive this vear will be less than she would otherwise receive. Indeed, she will gain nothing this year. The circumstances of the States differ so much that their contributions to the Customs and Excise revenue varies greatly per head of population. The average Customs and Excise revenue for the Commonwealth is £ 2 ios. 8fd. per head of population, and the average contribution of Tasmania about £ 2 per head, or nearly double what she will receive under the proposed arrangement. It may be that our contribution is low, because we have fewer miners and less agriculture than the other States, or because our people are more thrifty, and consume fewer luxuries and semi-luxuries. Prior to Federation, the Tasmanian Customs and Excise revenue was £ 2 ios. per head of population. Although we are not going to continue to receive three-fourtjis of our contribution to the Customs and Excise revenue, it is satisfactory to know that, under the proposed arrangement we shall not lose ciated with the Conventions which met between 1891 and 1899, was a member of the Convention which framed the draft Constitution, and travelled to England to present that instrument to the Imperial Government. I have, therefore, taken great interest in constitutional questions, and have looked forward with hope to the time when the bookkeeping system would be abolished. The honourable member for North Sydney is the only Minister who has expressed the opinion that the time has come for its abolition, and he did so when Minister of Home Affairs in the ReidMcLean Administration. It still continues, however. Next year the Braddon section will cease to have force, and contemporaneously it will be impossible for the States to demand three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise. Therefore, if the Conference does nothing else, it will have done well should it bring these results about. Alternatives have been suggested to the proposal to pay to the States 25sper head of population, but each has had its defect.
