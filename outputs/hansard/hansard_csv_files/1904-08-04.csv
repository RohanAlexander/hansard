In submitting the motion to the consideration of honourable members, I desire, in the tion which it contains as to the unscientific lian Tariff.

13,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke),"I moveof the State' a constituency of which I have the honour to represent was declared to be a high Tariff. House composed of free-traders, revenue-tariffists, and protectionists, each and all jealous of the other, and each striving to impress upon the Tariff their particular views. The result has been what might have been expected, namely, dissatisfaction to every one concerned. We had free-traders asking for revenue only. Then there were farmers' representatives who were quite content that duties of 60, 70, or 80 per cent, should be imposed upon the products from their districts, whilst they were willing to give the manufacturers of the implements used by their constituents the benefit of only 10 or 12 \ per cent, duties. We had labour representatives who advocated a White Australia policy, and objected to the introduction of contract labour, but who were at the same time quite prepared to agree to, and, indeed, helped to bring about, conditions which permitted of the introduction of the products of black labour and sweated workmen. ""Under these circumstances, I think I am correct in saying that the Tariff ultimately became a thing of shreds and patches, which no one was willing to father, or disposed to speak of with anything like pride. The effect of whittling away what little protection we had by the combined operations of the labour free-traders on the one side, and of the ardent free-traders on the other, who forgot, if they ever sought to keep, the compact, "" revenue without destruction,"" has been to bring about a most unsatisfactory condition of affairs. farmers' representatives, who thought that they would help their constituents by imposing high duties upon the products grown in their district, whilst cutting down the duties upon the implements they used, injuring the home market. cates of a White Australia, who were opposed to the introduction of contract labour, have failed to provide work for those whose interests they sought to advance, because, as I think I shall prove, the result of their policy has been to provide additional employment for Japanese, Javanese, and other foreigners, whom we should least desire to support. The motion affirms that the Tariff is unscientific in its operation. I say that advisedly, because when the Tariff was under consideration, we did several things which, in my judgMr Hume ment, tended to make it unscientific. For instance, we attempted to levy duties in Thus we had a accordance with the ultimate use to which imports were to be put An article which might be used as a medicine was admitted free of duty; whereas, if it .could also be used as a food, one rate of duty was imposed, and, if it could be used commercially, a different rate, was levied. The duties were not fixed according to the essential character of the articles, but in the manner described, and the result has been chaos. Then we imposed duties upon raw material, as well as upon finished products. If the duties had been placed upon raw materials such as could be produced here, our action might have been justified, but in many instances imposts were levied upon raw materials which had to be obtained from abroad. By also imposing duties upon the finished articles, we placed our manufacturers at a double disadvantage. In that way, also, Ave helped to make the Tariff unscientific. Then, again, Ave levied what might be termed sentimental duties; and I might mention, as an instance, the action taken in regard to spirits. Some honourable members thought that it did not matter A'ery much Avhether Ave imported the spirits Ave used, or produced them locally. The industry Avas one in Avhich no one took any great pride, and moreover it was pointed out that some of the persons engaged in it were making large fortunes at the expense of the consumers. We Avhittled away the protection that had previously been enjoyed by the distillers, Avith The tlie result that thei'r business has been most detrimentally affected. If Ave had reduced ithe consumption of intoxicants, improved the moral tone of the people, provided further employment for our own citizens, or cheapened the article to the have succeeded only in consumer, the . action taken might have The advobeen justified. But no good result has folloAA'ed, Avhilst the industry has been practically ruined, and a number of men haA'e been thrown out of employment, the business of making spirits for our OAvn consumption has gone by the board, and nearly all we use are imported. As a further instance of the unscientific character of the Tariff, I Avould point to the very large number of decisions' Avhich have been given by various Ministers in connection with its administration from its inception up to a feAV Aveeks ago. These decisions run into Cook. hundreds, and even thousands. In such regard would think the administration would be cessarv for me to again call attention to the very simple, no less than sixty decisions fact that numerous conversations are prohave been given; in respect to bicycles, ceeding in various parts of the chamber, eighty; and in connection with drugs, and consequently it is difficult for the honorwith which I admit it would probably be able member to proceed. I would ask a little more difficult to deal, 150 decihonorable members to discontinue conversions. 200 decisions have been recorded, and so elsewhere. on ad infinitum. As a matter of fact, three Ministers have registered over 2,000 sepa1899 the Geelong tanners employed some rate decisions in connection with the Tariff, 500 men, whereas to-day they employ only and I do not know that I could deduce any sixty. They formerly paid wages at the stronger proof of its unscientific characrate of £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year; they now pay at ter. Of these decisions, many are in conthe rate of £ 5 , 0 0 0 . Similarly in 1899 the flict, and help to aggravate the troubles of Austral Otis Company, which is referred to our merchants, and the worries of the shipin the newspapers this morning, employed ping clerks. We were told that the Tariff 600 men, whereas at present it employs only was so simple that anyone could underabout 100. That company previously disstand it, whereas it has required the combursed £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 a year in wages; it now bined efforts of three Ministers to make it pays only -£21,000. These are a few inplain. absurdity of the whole business I am endeavouring to demonstrate. I have also affirmed that the Tariff is mischievous in its operation, and I propose to prove that assertion' in two ways. I shall not weary honourable members with any more figures than are necessary, but I desire to direct attention to the facts connected with six or seven cases in which industries have been injuriously affected by the Tariff. One firm, engaged in malting axles, which in 1899 employed sixteen men, now has only five hands in its factory. That, I admit, is a very small industry, but still the reduction has been very large comparatively. Another firm which manufactures springs for vehicles had fifty men employed in 1899, as compared with only sixteen at present. Then, again, a firm which makes machinery connected with the leather trade, had sixty men employed, as contrasted with only twenty to-day. I have already referred to the distilling business. Messrs. Joshua Brothers have published some figures which show that prior to the introduction of the Tariff they employed seventy-two hands, to whom they paid £ 8 , 0 0 0 per annum in wages; whereas to-day they can find work for only twenty-seven hands, who receive in wages £ 2 , 3 0 0 per annum. tanners have issued a circular in which they state that in 1899 they employed 500 hands. to which almost any .one honourable member take his seat. It is neI n the case of oils, nearly sing aloud or to continue their conversations stances which illustrate the influence which 5 tries, which, I admit, have been affected to a greater extent than have any others. in Sydney the iron industry is poorly employed notwithstanding that the duties were increased ? good reasons, I presume, for that, and before I conclude my remarks I will show why industries might have been expected to do a little less business this year than they would do at other periods. I prefer, however, to put my argument in my own way. I find also that there has been a reduction in the number of hands employed and the amount of wages paid in a number of other industries. For example, in the brush and broom trade, the furniture trade, rope and twine factories, and clothing factories-in deed, in almost every industry affected by the T a r if f I learn from official figures that the number of workmen employed has decreased, with a consequent shrinkage in the amount of wages paid. As a typical instance of what may happen under the Tariff, I propose to cite some figures in connection with the leather trade. If there is any industry which is natural to Australia, I think it is that connected with leather-the tanning trade. But What is its present position ? As the result of the The Geelong unscientific and mischievous Tariff at present operating, the leather business of Australia has very considerably decreased.

That in itself is an enormous decrease, and largely accounts for the figures which have been put forward by the Geelong tanners, who say that, whereas they formerly employed 500 men, they now employ only 100. Mr G. B. EDWARDS How can the operation of the Tariff affect exports? leather has been reduced, with the result that, instead of tanning the leather locally, Victoria is exporting the raw hides. return which was presented to this House, at the instance of the honourable and learned member for Corio, goes to show that whilst the tanned leather business has declined, the export of the raw material from this country has increased. For instance, in 1901, 143,961 hides were exported from Victoria, and 687.970 skins, valued at £ 8 3 1 , 9 3 1 . In 1903, the number of hides exported had increased to 430,066, the late to Victoria alone? number of skins to 1,123,256, and their value had increased to £1,5531322, a difference in two years of £ 7 2 1 , 3 9 1 .

That loss of 6,000 adults. Tariff [REPRESENTATIVES.] Re-adjustmeut. fact was largely due to disasters of various kinds which this State had experienced, in the shape of drought, the land boom, and the banking crisis. But, prior to the imposition of the Federal Tariff, Victoria had been steadily overcoming these disasters, with the result that, in 1899, the loss of population, which had been gradually diminishing, was less than it had been for some time previously. Immediately following the imposition of the Federal Tariff, however, the loss of population began to increase, and in 1901-accordin g to A the figures supplied by the Government Statist of this State-the emigration loss was 1,428,' of which number 1,100 were adults. In 1902, that loss had increased to 13,716, including 11,864 adults. In the following year it had still further increased to 16,570, of which the adults numbered 12,885. 1901 and 1903 the loss by emigration increased from 1,428 to 16,570, whilst the Most of those total loss for the two Tariff years, 1902-3, runs into 30,286 persons, of whom 24,749 I admit that a were adults !

I personally am satisfied, whatever other honourable members may be, that no matter what the free-traders in this country may say, what they propose to do is quite another thing. Under these circumstances, we also propose to do something. which we think will be in the best interests of the people of this country, and will do most to promote industry and to develop the natural resources of Australia. I now desire to draw the attention of honourable members to the next portion of my motion-that which has regard to the promotion of the agricultural and manufacturing industries of Australia. upon as being more important in this House and outside of it .than the promotion of the agricultural and landed interests of Australia. But, whilst that is so, those who urge the promotion of those particular industries take divergent views. Some suggestions have been put forward as to what should be done to improve the condition of the farmers and settlers generally. House we have proposals for the insertion of special provisions in the mail contracts as to the carriage of frozen produce, fruit, and commodities of that kind. had discussions as to the necessity for providing schemes of water conservation and irrigation. good and wise proposal for the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau. other suggestions, which I do not for the moment recollect, have also been put forward. Outside the House we are told that the proper thing to do is to provide cheap land, and plenty of it, together with easy terms for the acquisition of it; that there should be narrow-gauge railways to open up the back country for the benefit of those who wish to take up land; and, above all things, that there should be low railway freights and bonuses. paper, and other journals, are now beginning to say that the proper thing for the farmers to do is to form co-operative societies, and by means of co-operation to gain concessions from the shipping which they cannot obtain otherwise The farmers are also urged to establish special agencies mostly out of Australia-for vantageous All these things are in their way good Mr Hume enough; but I think that some of the I do not essential first steps have been missed by those who make these proposals, and I intend to give my views in respect to that matter at a later stage. In the meantime, let me say that those who think that land settlement is the beginning and end of all progress in Australia make a serious mistake. Land settlement is not, and canWe propose to do that not be, the cure-all. No countiy was ever grfeat which depended wholly and solely on agriculture; no country has ever yet become a world power without developing manufactures and providing diversified occupations for its people. The rise of the German Empire may be said to date from the time when the policywas adopted of importing from Great BritainI know of nothing that is looked competent 'workmen in variouslines of industry to teach the German artisans. And Japan, a little while ago, followed the example set by Germany, and imported British and American workmen with the same object in view. The rise of Japan dates from the time when she commenced to adopt western methods and ideas, not merely in regard to civilization generally, In this but also in regard to the arts and manufactures. Primary production must, of course, play a large part in the development of a country such as. Australia, as We have it must of every country where there are huge areas of land. But un,less we also do something to promote manufactures, We have had an exceedingly we shall find, as, indeed, we have already begun to find, that we cannot make Some that material and substantial progress which we should under other circumstances. We are told that if we promote agriculture manufactures will follow ; and I only wish that that were true. We have promoted agriculture and the settlement of people in Victoria for years and years; and I have before me a table of figures which show that every year for ten years, past, and for long before, the number of persons going on the land has The Argus .newsbeen steadily increasing. For the period 1894-8 there were 6,985 approved applicants who took up 869,130 acres in Victoria under the residence section of the LandA c t ; between 1899 and 1903, 16,394 companies applicants took up 4,825,877 .acres; in the year 1902-3 there was a still further increase. According to the census returns of in London and elsewherethe Government Statist of Victoria, it apthe adpears that in 1891 there were in that State selling of their produce. 85,138 persons engaged in producing from the soil, and in connection with the landed Cook. interests; and in 1901 that number had in0 creased to 95,920. It will be seen, therefore, that a great deal has been done, and, to a large extent, successfully, to promote land settlement in Victoria. Very much the same conditions apply to Australia as a whole. In the year 1899, 531,580 acres were granted in Australia, and those figures had in 1902 increased to 1,184,618. the Tariff? The same Tariff has not hitherto prevailed all over Australia. present of land settlement, and, if the honin 1902, only 57,767 were employed in orable member will allow me to proceed in my own way, I shall show how my arguments affect the Tariff. There are those who say that the only way to make Australia prosperous is to have land settlement; and I am showing that people have been encouraged to go on the land and engage in primary production. I am going to show that, in spite of those efforts, we have not helped the people of the country to the extent we might have done. member does not say that the rate of land settlement is adequate? that, because there is no doubt that the rate of land settlement might be greater than it is. Land settlement cannot be greater than at present, but will certainly be less in future if we do nothing to provide of 2,957 male employees. Could anything home markets, instead of as at present compelling producers to export a large proportion of their produce, and dispose of it at the world's price. Mr G. B. EDWARDS Increased land settlement and decreased population, after thirtv-five vears of protection 1 that increased land settlement brings in its train increased manufactures, is not substantiated. I have already proved that manufactures under the Commonwealth Tariff have decreased in spite of the fact that agricultural settlement has increased. The increase of land' settlement does not require any proof, because the fact can easily be seen; but I should like now to show that manufactures, so far from having increased, have decreased. the Government Statist of Victoria, there were in that State 1.68,534 industrial workers in 1891, whereas in 1901 there were only 146,233, showing a decrease of 22,301 in the"" ten years. I do not contend that these figures are particularly convincing, seeing that they cover a period only 6R2 part of which is affected by the present Tariff. Buti f we take another view, namely, that of the number of persons engaged in the factories.during the operation of the present Tariff, we find that there has been a decrease, and that the Statist's figures are but an indication of what has son Ord, the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, issued his report a few days ago, and showed that while there were 59,440 persons employed 1903. The Melbourne Argus points out this morning that that is an exceedingly small decrease-onl y 1,673d eman phasizes the fact that Mr Ord believes it to be the result of the drought. But the Argus writer probably forgot that in the course of the article, it is stated that the figures are eighteen months old. If that be so, I should lik'e to know what the figures are up to date. If the figures are eighteen months old, the fact proves that the Tariff was more instantaneous in its effect than I had thought, and that the loss must be greater than we believe it to be at present. But the significant fact about the figures is one which the Argus omits to state, namely', that while there was a decrease of 1,673 m 'he total, there was an increase of 284 in the number of females employed. The net result shows a decrease be more significant ? of protection. the iron trade and other great industries which employ males, have been so heavily hit by the Tariff that those previously engaged in them have had to emigrate to New Zealand and other places, in order to get employment, with the result that the women left behind, and other women, have had to get such employment as they could obtain.

38,Mr Hume Cook,"The fact is thatsettlement has increased, there has been a population loss. That loss is not amongst those who have taken up land, but must be sought in other quarters. the Factory Inspector, and the individual cases I have quoted, indicate that the loss is amongst the artisan classes who ought to be engaged in factories. The figures further show that the prosperity about which we obtained I think they also prove conclusively that manufacturing does not and cannot follow merely upon land settlement. We must do something more, and, in my opinion, the initial necessary step is to make a wise use of the Tariff, and create, first of all, for the land settlers of this country, a home market. Without a home market/ land settlement cannot be successful, and those already on the land will probably begin to find that they must leave it. 'Certainly, we cannot hope for any considerable increase of land settlement unless we have an increased local consumption. In my judgment a home market is to be obtained by the creation of industries, the development'of our own natural resources, and the employment of our own people rather than of Japanese, Javanese, or any other coloured races, whom we have no desire to employ. I affirm without hesitation that the quickest, safest, and most legitimate way in which to provide a good home market for our producers is to make a wise and proper use of the Tariff to that end. We have not clone that. We are not getting what we require, and, in view of the facts I have given, I contend that there is a necessity to re-open the Tariff along the lines I have indicated. The advantages of a home market are realized in other countries, if not in this. I have no desire to dilate upon those advantages. Every one must admit that the better the local market the greater the advantage to our producers and to those who sell their goods. As compared with an export market, there is not the same expense in the shape of freights and insurance, there are not the same risks of loss, the same agents' charges, and the other disadvantages of an export trade, which are evident to any one who knows anything -about the subject. member explain how the honourable member for Melbourne Ports turns .£10,000,000 into £ 2 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? mental arithmetic. I have said that other countries realize the advantages of a home market. The figures which I am going to quote were used some time ago by the HonThe figures of orable Theodore Fink, in the Victorian State Parliament. Owing to pressure of work I have not had time to verify them ; but, coming from that authority, they may be accepted as fairly correct. Mr Fink gives for Great Britain talk so much is not to be a local consumption of £ 4 2 per head, and by land settlement only. a foreign trade of £ 1 8 per head. For the United States he gives a local consumption of £ 4 4 per head, and a foreign trade of £5 per head. When we come to deal with the figures for Australia we find that they are absolutely reversed,, and that our foreign trade is vastly greater than our home trade. Until we have profited by the good example even of such a free-trade country as is Great Britain, we shall not do what is right by our own people in this respect. America to a greater extent than Great Britain conserves her home trade, and the figures go to prove that; but even in such a country as is Great Britain, we see that care is taken that the home trade is vastly superior to the export trade, great as that undoubtedly is. If Australia does not follow on similar lines, all I can say is that we shall be amongst the decadent peoples. Unfortunately, every effort in Australia at the present time is in the direction of opening up foreign markets, and securing trade elsewhere than in the Com-' monwealth. All our efforts are directed towards securing a market for our produce in London, on the Continent, or some other place outside of Australia. Hence we are concerned with such matters as cheap freights, swift carriage, cool chambers, special agencies, and I do not know what besides. We have failed to lopk at the fact which is staring us in the face, that we produce ten times as much in Australia as we consume. I asked the Government Statist of Victoria to give me the figures for some twenty lines of food-stuffs produced in Victoria, and the local consumption of those articles. The figures came to hand last night,"" and they show that Victoria produces £12,000,000 worth of these food-stuffs, and that we consume in this State about £1,200,000 worth. plus ? to export the surplus.

He is referring only to particular articles. consumption in Victoria? figures. I am dealing now only with some twenty lines of food-stuff. We know, as a matter of fact, that farmers, fruit-growers, vignerons, and other agricultural producers are by no means satisfied with their returns. We know that the results of our export trade in wines, preserved fruits, and other produce of that description are not satisfactory. What do we see, for instance, in connection with such a line as butter, which is a very great Australian export? I have here the report of the London season of 1903-4, issued by R. T. .TurnbuU and Co., who are amongst the greatest authorities upon this subject in the world. In the course of their report they sayAt no point in the past season can there be said to have been a really animated market, and published in the Sydney Morning Herald the losses which have been made on purchases in the colonies are said to have been exceedingly great. How can we expect to keep up a butter export if this statement by TurnbuU and Co. is correct? We must encourage production in another way, and that other way, in my judgment, is the creation of a local market. un impression of that kind to go abroad, because there are great prospects in the butter trade. great prospects in the butter trade, but we representative fruit-growers of the State of New 88 should encourage local consumption to a very much greater extent than we do. The average price of butter in London has ranged from 5d. to iod. per lb., whilst in Victoria it has been from iod. to is. i d . per lb. It is all very well to send away so considerable an export of butter, but I imagine it would be better for the producers to secure the higher local prices if we could only do something to increase the local consumption. The way in which it is to be increased is not by the adoption of free-trade methods, but by some such methods as those which I have suggested. What do we find in connection with the fruit business ? Only a few days ago the Argus newspaper published ,this statement: The Australian apple season just closing in London has been by no means satisfactory from he say the the exporters' point of view. The leading importers calculate that, during the season 703,000 cases of Australian and Tasmanian apples were imported, and that they resulted in a loss to the exporters of ^50,000. What encouragement is there for our fruit growers, if they are to continue to lose £50,000 a year? Although last year there was a big harvest, and consequently a large export, the season was practically only a normal one. The preceding years were droughty, and the production of the soil was therefore much less than might have been expected under other conditions. Now, if in a normal year the exportation of butter, fruit, and other products results in a loss, what are the future prospects of land settlement in this country, and what is to become of the man on the soil ? The figures I have given are very significant. Fruit-growers themselves are beginning to realize in certain parts of Australia the significance of these facts, and are asking that this Tariff, which some people say is such a good one, shall be altered. My authority for this statement is a paragraph of 1st inst. It appears from this paragraph that a Conference of fruit-growers was held at Baulkham Hills, near Parramatta, on the preceding Saturday, at which representatives of the Fruit-growers' Association of Castle Hill, Kenthurst, Seven Hills, Pennant Hills, and the surrounding district were present. The Conference proceeded to the consideration of what. should be done in the interests of the fruit-growers, and after deliberation they carried the following resolution: That, in view of the present depressed state",20,Honourable Members O H

53,Mr Hume Cook,"Certainly there are of the fruit-growing industry, this meeting ofSouth Wales is of opinion that considerably higher duties should be placed on imported fruits, and that we communicate with the fruit-growers of Victoria and other States, with the view of united action being taken to secure this desired object. They also passed this second resolutionThat, in the opinion of this meeting, it is desuch a commodity. What, then, are the sirable that a fruit-growers' union of New So.uth Wales be at once organised, and that its first work be the carrying out of the object of the preceding resolution. Therefore, the fruit-growers of New South Wales have awakened to the fact that the Tariff does not suit them. The Argus this morning says that people may be trusted to look after their own business. This is an instance in which people are looking after their own business, and are asking that the duties in the Tariff shall be increased. There is, too, now sitting at Brisbane a Conference of persons connected with the Chambers of Manufactures of the several States of Australia, and they are urging that the Tariff shall be altered. According to the report of their proceedings which appears in to-day's Argus, several resolutions were passed, but that to which I wish to call particular attention is as follows :That this federal council greatly regrets the injurious incidence of the Tariff in certain established industries, and recommends the chambers to immediately make investigation in their several States, taking evidence relating to anomalies and the injury done to the local industries, with a view to presenting their united deductions to the Commonwealth Parliament at the earliest opportunity available. not a Victorian Conference. representing all Australia. says that people know how to mind their own business, and that it is not my duty to teach them what they want. To that I reply that the members of this Conference are people who know their business, and that they are asking for an alteration of the Tariff on the lines suggested by me. What is true in regard to the exportation of butter and fruit is true in regard to the exportation of other products. Our producers have exported onions from Australia, and this is the result, as recorded in the Age of 29th JulyOnion-growers who, for some seasons past, have been struggling hard against a strenuously depressed local market, will not derive much consolation from the experiment just made to test the merits of the London market. . . . The proceeds of the sales will not pay half the cost of sending the consignment home. Lastly, I ask what is the outlook for the hay-growers of Australia? In the same newspaper there is an article in which it is stated that there is about ,£1,000,000 worth of hay in Victoria, for which buyers at profitable prices cannot be found; and it cannot be profitably exported, because of its bulk, and the heavy freights charged for hay-growers of Australia to do, unless we provide them with a home market? The facts which I have stated show how necessary it is to build up, concurrently with the settlement of the land, local manufactures, and thus increase local consumption. If we fail in that, we shall fail in our duty to our constituents, and it will be impossible for Australia to progress. If we allow the Tariff to remain as it is, emigration from the Commonwealth will increase; there will be a still greater lack of. employment, a steadily decreasing local market, and a still further loss to our agricultural producers. It must be borne in mind that it is more necessaiy to Australia to be self-dependent than it is for some of the other countries of the world to be so. She is situated so far from foreign markets that her producers are at a great disadvantage in respect of freights, insurance, and other charges connected with shipping transport, as compared with the producers of other countries. Formerly Australian producers had in some respects an advantage over producers in other parts of the world, because of the difference in seasons; but American growers are taking advantage of perfected refrigerating machinery, and are now able to place their apples on the London market at the same The Argus time as Australian apples are sent there, and, apparently, in the future, the difference in seasons will be of no advantage to our growers, while American producers will make tremendous inroads into their markets. What applies to apples will apply to other exports. Unless we look keenly after our interests, we shall lose not only on the exportations to which I . have alluded, but in other directions as well. Dealing with the subject from another point of view, what do Ave find? I have stated that there are farmers' representatives in this Chamber who were, quite ready to vote for duties of 60, 70, or even 80 per cent, on farm products, and Avho, at the same time, under the belief that they were helping their constituents, Avould not consent to the imposition of higher duties than 10 or 12J per cent, on farming implements and machinery. The result",21,Honourable Members O H
54,Mr Mauger,"That is an Australian,",22,Honourable Members O H
55,Mr Hume Cook,"It is a Conferencehas been that a great many farmers' requirements which should be manufactured in Australia are now imported. Let me take four items. In 1899-and , in the comparisons I am about to make, I contrast the years 1899 and 1903, because the former was the last normal year under the Victorian Tariff, and the latter the last year for which we have information under the Federal Tariff-the total value of the agricultural, horticultural, and fruit-farming implements and machinery imported was £112,004; but, in 1903, the importation of such machinery had increased to .£204,147. The Argus to-day makes a comparison between the importations of 1901 and 1903; but it is improper and unfair to accept the figures for 1901 in this connection, would be surprised if he knew how much since in that year, and in the preceding year, imports were being rushed into Australia under the belief that the Federal Parliament would pass a very high Tariff. The importation of apparel and ready-made clothing, such as farmers, fruit-growers, and others connected with the landed industries use, was £180,989 in 1899, and in 1903 j£3 9Al*In 1899 the value of the boots 2 and shoes imported was £33,676, and in T 9°3> j£59! °In9 9 the value of hats 12 and caps imported was £50,055, and in 1903, £78,504. The importations of those four classes of goods show an increase of ^395>5 8 for the year 1903, when comT pared with importations of 1899. That increase is equal to nearly 150 per cent. Readnamely, the proper relative proportion being those figures in conjunction with the figures which I have given in regard to the decline in exports, the mischievous effects of the Tariff are easily seen. Then, every farmer requires a vehicle of some sort, and I am told, on reliable authority, that the importation of vehicles for the first eight months of the present year exceeds in value and quantity the importation for the preceding eighteen months. If our farmers wish to find local buyers for their produce, they must themselves buy in the local market; but if they persist in buving in foreign markets, they must look to foreign consumers for the purchase of their produce. The man who buys in a foreign market must sell in a foreign market, and the disadvantage of that method of trading is that the man who sends his goods for sale to a foreign market has to sell them at the world's price, while what he purchases in return he buys, not at the world's price, but at the manufacturer's price. prices fixed by a ring. cargo of wool or wheat is sent to London or Antwerp to be sold, it is necessary for us to buy foreign goods in return; but while we sell at the world's price, our producers, who wish to buy wool presses, sheep-shearing machinery, or other things in return, buy them, not at the world's price, but at the price of the local manufacturers, and are thus at a double disadvantage. fore we shall have a population sufficiently large to consume our wheat and butter ? is already consumed locally. by the effect of the wise stimulation and development of natural resources and production in America, and remember the modern rate of speed, we should make even greater progress than that country has made. The briefest of glances at American progress serves to show that the adoption of methods similar to those which I l8 think we should follow has led to the development of her manufactures and her resources to such a marvellous extent that no other country can show a similar recprd. The reference to America brings me to another question, tween the agricultural and manufacturing interests. In America we have a country much like our own. Her exports of wheat and other cereals are probably greater than those of any other country. The agricultural industry has been developed there to a greater extent than elsewhere, and her manufacturing industries have also progressed by leaps and bounds. The figures given in the Statesman's Year-Book show that 10,000,000 persons are engaged in agricultural and kindred pursuits generally, whereas those engaged in the manufacturing and mechanical operations number 7,000,000. In Australia, according to Coghlan, the persons engaged in agriculture and like industries aggregate 402,000, whilst those occupied in manufacturing and mechanical industries number 254,000. In America, the proportions of agriculture to manufacturing are as ten to seven, whilst in Australia they are as twelve to seven.

In connection with our huge deposits of iron ore, we should be able to find employment for a great number of our people. The encouragement of the iron industry was one of the principles for which we fought at the last election, and yet no practical result has been achieved up to the present. I do not know whether the figures supplied by one honourable member of the late Parliament were correct, but he said that if we developed our iron deposits we should be able to provide sustenance for 620,000 persons. If we could establish an industry that would provide for one-third of that number we should confer the greatest possible benefit upon Australia. In this matter, the present Government will have an opportunity to distinguish itself, and If the honourable merhber to earn the plaudits of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. The Labour Party fought for a White Australia, and I helped them to secure it, because I thought that the social and economic results would be most desirable. But in order to make a White Australia effective, we must adopt not only the safeguards afforded by such legislation as Ave have passed, but also those which are afforded by protective duties. What has happened? We have excluded Japanese and other coloured foreigners from the Commonwealth, but we have not shut out the products of their labour. I find that in Victoria alone the imports from China and Japan and other Eastern countries have increased in value from £ 3 8 9 , 2 2 1 in 1899 to £ 9 8 5 , 5 9 4 in 1903, or an increase of over £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in four years.

It Avould be far preferable to HIIOAV these coloured foreigners to come into our midst, because then we could regulate them. | them something in return ?

What is the use of legislation in respect of non-contract labour, if by the operation of the Tariff we force our own people to make contracts for labour elsewhere? The very thing which we condemn, we are forcing our own people to do. We are compelling them to go to South Africa and New Zealand to obtain work, because they cannot secure it here. These are serious matters. The fact that we have not adopted judicious and proper means to render our policy effective calls for immediate attention. In all Commonwealth contracts we insert a condition providing for the payment of a minimum wage. We insist, that our own people shall obtain a fair rate of pay for the work which they perform, but we cannot insist upon the insertion of a minimum wase provision in contracts for the production of goods in other countries. We can prevent the sweating of our own employees, who are engaged in production, but we cannot prohibit sweating in other countries. that we should exclude from Australia sweated goods, as well as sweatersthat we should protect our own people through the Customs House as well as through the Factories Act. Until wedo that it is useless to talk of building up a nation, developing industry, and restoring prosperity. In the German woollen mills the employees are compelled to work sixty-two hours a week for a wage of 12s., whilst in the Italian hat mills they labour sixty-four hours weekly for a wage of 20s. How is it possible for us to compete with them ? In his address to his constituents during the recent election campaign, the honourable member for South Melbourne made the following significant remarks: Now suppose that there had been no Labour protectionist men in the Labour Party for Vic-toria, it is not too much to say that the protective duties in the Tariff would have been less by 10 per cent Therefore, let protectionists see to it that they do not break entirely with the Labour Party, for the inevitable result will be that the balance of power will be in the hands of the free-trade Labour members of New South Wales, then good-bye to protection in the Commonwealth. The salvation of protection lies with the Labour Party, just as much as, I believe, the salvation of labour lies with protection. I trust that the free-trade members of the Labour Party realize that what the honourable member says is true-that the salvation of protection and of the industries of Australia lies with the Labour Party. I think I have said enough to prove that there is great reason for the readjustment of the Mr Hume Cook. incidence of the Tariff upon some of its leading' lines. I am bound to bear in mind that we have certain revenue obligations which must be respected. We must discharge our constitutional obligation to provide the States forming the Federation with a certain sum of money each year. Whatever we do, we must see that their solvency is assured. That obligation cannot be neglected. But it should be remembered that we have certain other patriotic obligations to discharge. One of these is to see that no destruction of our industries takes place, and that no lack of employment is caused by any overt action of ours. Another of our obligations is to provide for the further development of our resources, and for an increase in the number of persons employed in our midst. It isour duty to stimulate production, real wealth, and general advancement. These are obligations of a patriotic nature which it is quite as incumbent upon us to discharge as it is to preserve the solTherefore, I claim vency of the States by guaranteeing them the return of a certain revenue each year. We can best fulfil these obligations by making a wise, judicious, and proper use of the Tariff. We can encourage manufactures by excluding foreign products. We can foster local industry, provide home markets, increase land settlement, stimulate primary production, and find. employment for our people, chiefly-almos t wholly-by adopting a policy in respect of fiscal matters which will lead-as it has done in America and elsewhere-to the development of our own resources. In my judgment, prosperity depends chiefly upon population, and population depends upon employment. If no employment is to be had in Australia we cannot expect to attract people here. They must be provided with employment in factories, workshops, or mines, or else they must be settled upon the land, or must engage in business upon their own account. Without employment in one direction or the other, population cannot increase. Employment can be encouraged by the creationof home manufactures as well as by the development of land settlement. Home manufactures can be stimulated by our making proper use of the Tariff. I regret to say that we have not made proper use of it. We require to readjust its incidence. We need to take some steps which will result in the establishment of industries, which will attract population, and which above all other things will insure to the employees engaged in those industries a fair rate of wages and to the employers a fair share of profit. cient evidence has already been adduced to warrant the alteration of the Tariff which I seek. More than enough facts have been submitted to justify the carrying of this motion. alteration is effected the adverse conditions upon which I have commented, and the decreases which I have noted-mor e particularly in respect to employment and population-wil l become accentuated, until in spite. of all efforts to the contrary, the public of Australia will demand from whatever Government may be in power a thorough revision of the Tariff, so that that stimulus may be given to local industry which is consonant with national energy and national advance. journed. move-That the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday next. In submitting this motion, I merely wish to insure that the vote upon the Seat of Government Bil l shall be arrived at in a f u l l House, and I also desire to intimate that my colleague the Minister of Home Affairs proposes to continue the debate upon that measure this evening, with a view to concluding it before the House adjourns. for the purpose of protesting against these continual adjournments; they have become a feature of almost every week-end. During the past four weeks we have scarcely sat upon one Friday. only occasion on which the House has sat upon Friday during the past month. If we had no business to transact-if honourable members attended here merely for the purposes of pleasure-ther e might be no objection to adopting the course that is proposed.

My protest is against the waste of time caused by adjournments over what should, be sitting days. It would appear to be almost a rule now that the House shall adjourn from the Thursday evening to the Tuesday; but such a policy does not commend itself to representatives from distant States, who have a right to expect the business of the country to be expeditiously transacted.

It is most extraordinary that the right honourable member should have been content to sit in this House for three months past, while the "" scandal"" has been going on, and should do nothing towards challenging the position of the Government. If the right honourable member and any other members of the Opposition object to the present Government, let them come up like men, as it is their duty to their constituents to do, and table an adverse motion. What is most demoralizing in this House is not the attitude of the Government, but the continual rumbling, and muttering of threats by the right honourable member and his confreres opposite.

I have given every consideration to the question, and, unlike some honourable members, I have taken an opportunity to visit every one of the sites -with the exception of the last, which has been suggested at, I think, a rather late hour, and from the first I took the objection to that site that, being right on the southern border of New South Wales, its selection would be outside the understanding entered into with the people of New South Wales. ThatI shall presently endeavour to show. I shall ask the special attention of the honourable member for Gippsland to what I propose to say about Bombala; I think that the selection of Tooma, Bombala, or any other place situated on the southern border of New South Wales, would practically create a buffer State' between Victoria and New South Wales, and that that would be outside the terms of the arrangement as put before the people of New South Wales when the referendum was taken on the Commonwealth Bill in 3899. should not the Constitution have provided for a limit from the border as well as a limit from Sydney? been better if it had contained such a provision. But I shall ask the honourable member directly to listen to what was put before the people of New South Wales, not only by the leaders of the Federal movement and the advocates of the Commonw -.i'th B ill , but also by those who were leading the movement in opposition, and who were known at the time as "" Anti-Billites."" The statement put before the people of New South Wales at that time by the leaders of both movements was that the Federal Capital should be established within a reasonable distance of Sydney, and that it should be in such a position that Sydney would be its port. I do not propose to deal with the statements made by the lesser lights who followed the leaders of both movements, but. contenting myself with the observations of the lenders, I am sure that I can satisfy the honourable member for Gippsland that my contention in this matter is substantially correct. Some honourable members are particularly touchy with respect to promises, or supposed promises, made before Federation was agreed to. I refer especially to honourable members who represent Western Australia. We; have had the right honourable member for Swan, and other honourable members from that State, telling us that a promise was given to the people of Western Australia that if they agreed to come into the Federation they should have a Transcontinental Railway to connect that State with the Eastern States. and learned member vote for it? question when it is brought forward. WhatI ask of honourable members from Western Australia at the present time is that, if I am able to show that a promise was made by the leaders of the Federal movement in New South Wales that the Federal Capital should be established at a reasonable distance from Sydney, and in such a position that Sydney would be its port, they will give that fact careful consideration when deciding upon the site for which they will vote. It has been contended by various honourable members from New South Wales that, because that State must give the territory required, and for other reasons, the people of that State are entitled to some substantial If that view is correct, gain. As I took a fair amount of interest in opposing the Commonwealth B ill , I am aware that a large number of people in various districts in New South Wales were largely influenced in the votes they gave in connection with Federation by a consideration of the position in which they were given to understand the Federal Capital'would be established. When it was known that as the result of the Premiers' Conference the Federal Capital was to be established in New South Wales, and they were given to understand by the leaders of the Federal movement that it would be within a reasonable distance of Sydney, that had a material influence upon the number of votes cast for the Commonwealth B ill in the referendum taken in 1899. The honourable member for Ederi-Monaro, in advocating the Southern Monaro site last evening, said that we required a gateway to the sea for the Federal Capital. The gateway to the sea put before the people of New South Wales was the port of Sydney. There can be no doubt that the promise made to the people of that State was that Svdney should be the port of the Federal Capital, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and",32,Papers

A distinct promise, in the terms I have stated, was made to the New South Wales people by Sir Edmund Barton, the Honourable R. E. O'Connor, the Right Honourable G. H . Reid, and others leading the Federal movement, and honourable members representing New South Wales constituencies should, at all events, stand by it. But. in this Chamber we have some honourable members from New South Wales prepared to vote absolutely in opposition to the promise; Ave even have the honourable member for -Hume ready to vote against the distinct statement which he himself made to the people of Sydney and of New South Wales, when speaking at Waverley in 1899. propose to quote the honourable gentleman's observations on that occasion. learned member contend that the Committee should be bound by the promises of those individuals ? for a moment. AllI say is that promises were made to the people of New South Wales by the leaders of the Federal movement, and that when those promises are submitted to honourable members in the words used by the persons who made them, they should be given fair consideration. I do not for a moment contend that honourable members of this Committee are bound by promises made by Sir Edmund Barton, by the right honourable member for East Sydney, or by any other man; but I hope that honourable members from all the States will take these matters into consideration when deciding the site for the Capital. I find that Sir Edmund Barton spoke, in support of the adoption of the Commonwealth Bill by . the people of New South Wales, in the Temperance [REPRESENTATIVES.] Government Bill. Hall, Sydney, on the 1st May, 1899. The right honourable member for East Sydney, and a large number of other Federalists were present at the meeting, and, from their silence, I presume they agreed with the expressions used by Sir Edmund Barton on that occasion. The right honourable gentleman saidI am perfectly satisfied that the Federal Capital will always be in such a place that Sydney will be the trading port. That was the position put before the people of New South Wales by the leader of the Federal movement. . honourable member for East Sydney had agreed to the exclusion of Sydney. and learned member will pardon me. This meeting was held about three weeks before the referendum was taken in 1899, and after the right honourable member for East Sydney had agreed, in conference with the 1 Premiers of the other States, to the 100miles limit from Sydney. Speaking at Marrickville, a little later, on 13th June, Sir Edmund Barton saidWherever the Federal Capital was placed Sydney must be the trading port of the Capital. Those are very strong expressions from the leader of the Federal movement, and, naturally, the people of New South WalesI attached very great importance to what was said by the right honourable gentleman on that occasion. I find that the present Mr Justice O'Connor, who was one of the prominent supporters of the Federal movement in New South Wales, speaking at Balmain on 15th June, 1899, in connection with the Federal Capital, saidThe Capital being fixed in New South Wales, a vast advantage must accrue to Sydney. These quotations surely show that these leading representatives of the Federal movement fully believed, wished the people of New South Wales to believe, and induced them to believe, that when the Federal Capital was established Sydney would be its trading port, and that Sydney and New South Wales would necessarily get some advantage from the arrangement. The right honourable member for East Sydney, speaking on 16th June, 1899, at Goulburn. referred to this matter in the following words:I am not saying this to-night to please you. It said it in February last, when coming through Albury. They asked me if the Capital would be there, and I said that, in my opinion, it would be on the Southern line, a little below Goulburn.",33,Papers

167,Mr Fuller,"No. The honorableOther members of the right honourable gentleman's administration, including the Postmaster-General of New South Wales at the time, and a number of prominent men and members of Parliament in New South Wales, made use ot similar expressions. This all goes to show that the idea in the minds of those gentlemen, and the idea which they desired to convey to the people of New South Wales, was that the Federal Capital was to be established in such a position that Sydney would be its port, and that New South Wales, in that way, would derive some distinct advantage from the establishment of the Capital within that State. I have given quotations from the leading ""Billites"" in New South Wales at the time of the referendum. But it was not only the "".Billites,"" but also the "" antiBill ites "" of whom the honourable member for Hume was one of the leaders, who put this view before the people of New South Wales. I point out, in passing, that the honourable member for Hume went so f a r as to say that in consequence far south, it was entirely out of range, and could not be taken into consideration -at all. We find that the honourable gentleman is now advocating the selection of Tooma, which is right on the southern border of New South Wales, and which is fur. ther south even than Dalgetv. As one of the leaders of the "" anti-Billite"" party in New South Wales, the honourable gentleman made use of expressions in connection with the position of the Federal Capital very similar to those made use of by advocates of the Bill. Speaking here the other night, the honourable gentleman said that we should not be building this Capital for the present, but for the future, and that we should look forward to the time when the population of Australia would be very much greater than it is at present. He contended that in fixing the site of the Federal Capital we should take that into considetation, in order that it. might be established as near as possible to the centre of the population of the Commonwealth. In making these observations the honourable gentleman was advocating the selection .of the Tumut district, embracing the three sites of Tumut, Batlow, and the new site.at Tooma; but on 31st May, 1899, speaking in Sydney at Waverlev, the honourable gentleman took a very different view as to where the centre of population was likely to be. The honourable gentleman spoke at that time, not with a view to pleasing his constituents, but as a leader of the great movement in New South Wales in opposition to the Constitution Bill. He said The excess of population in the Colony in future would be to the north of Sydney, and not to the south of it , and the Capital should be placed at Armidale or somewhere in that direction. for Hume, when speaking on the Constitution Bill at Waverlev in 1899. then. man has found a new constituency since then. and the honourable gentleman is now advocating the selection of a site which is as remote from Sydney as any site in New South Wales can possibly be. He referred to the matter again on 31st May, 1899, when speaking at Sydney. The honourable gentleman was then strongly advocating of Eden-Bombala being so the claims of Sydney as the Capital of Australia. He saidPerhaps there might be something in the argument that Sydney should not be the Capital. Still, we had a right for the Capital to be placed within a reasonable distance of the metro, polis of New South Wales. It has been the subject of keen remark in New South Wales, and has come as a shock to the electors of that State who heard the honourable member for Hume say a few years back that if the Seat of Government could not be in Sydney it should be within reasonable distance of that metropolis, to find that he is now endeavouring to have it placed on the southern border of the State, and as far from Sydney as is possible. distance"" is used in the resolution of the Premiers.

That site is almost midway between the great cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and easily accessible by railway, because it is close to the main line which connects them. an advantage has, inasmuch as it fronts a large sheet of water, while its climate is equal to that of any of the other proposed sites. The selection of that site would have carried out the representations made to the people of New South Wales, and would have fallen in with what was said on the subject by the right honourable member for Adelaide. Lake George site was inspected under conditions which did not give it a fair chance. We were taken to the worse part of the site -to one end of the lake which, after ten years' drought, was almost d r y ; and'tlie day was a -bad one, so that the place was seen under every disadvantage. ently the site is now out of the running, and under these circumstances the next best site is, in my opinion, Lyndhurst. ney would certainly be the port of the Federal Capitali f Lyndhurst were chosen, and that site has all the necessary advantages of climate, accessibility, and so forth. ferently, but most of them have viewed it I am, therefore, anxious that the Lyndhurst site shall be chosen, and I ask honourable members in dealing with this matter to give fair and honest consideration to the fact that a great many of the electors' of New South Wales who voted for the acceptance of the Constitution were led to do so on the representations of Sir Edmund Barton, Mr Justice O'Connor, the honourable member for Hume, and the right honourable member for East Sydney, which I have alreadv quoted. fore beginning my remarks on the Bill, I by the honourable and learned member for should like to answer the criticism which Wannon. has been passed on the action of the Government in bringing the measure forward for discussion before the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill had been finally dealt with. That criticism appears to me very unjust, in view of the events of the last three months. of the Seat of Government is the question before the Committee. only briefly to the matter with which I am In my opinion, dealing.

177,Mr Carpenter,"I shall alludethat; but its ghost still lives, and a few honourable members, especially representatives of Victoria, are always ready to bring it before us. I hope that parsimonious ideas will not. take possession of the minds of honourable members in connection with the building of the Federal Capital. I would rather see the matter delayed for fift y or 100 years than have a cheap and nasty place erected, in accordance with the ideas of Kyabram. We can afford to wait for our Capital, but we cannot afford to disgrace the country by building a city of tin shanties. Let us erect a city of which those who come after us will be proud. I do not blame honourable members-for dealing with the subject from the local point of view. We were sent here to represent particular districts and Stales, and we cannot forget the fact, no matter how much we try. But, in dealing with a great national question such as this, parochial interests must be left out of view. At the present time -only the fringe of this great country is populated, but I believe that in the future the whole of Australia will be settled. In my opinion, Central Australia will in future carry a very big population, and coming generations will wonder why we were so short-sighted in fixing the site of the Federal Capital as to consider only the existing population on the coast. berthink that the centre of Australia is capable of carrying a large rural population ? To my mind there is no doubt about it. future generation must be constructed like camels, and able to go for a week without water. experience of other places has shown that the settlement of Central Australia is more than probable. I am with those honourable members who contend that the Federal Capital should be centrally situated. But ideas on the subject appear very vague, and very much at variance with actual facts. true centre. to be looked at from the Australian standpoint, the Capital should be placed as near to the western borders of New South Wales as is possible. Of course, the matter has hitherto been argued only with regard to the present location of population. It is I am aware of strange that honourable members have lost sight of the fact that during the last ten or twelve years the trend of population has been altogether away from the more populous States. Not only honourable members, but also the representatives of the States at the Convention, overlooked the important fact that population was trending westwards. wards. figures for the Northern States. According to Coghlan, during the period from 1891 to 1902-twelv e years-Victori a lost by excess of emigration over immigration 123,855 people. South Australia lost 21,142, and Tasmania 1,895I suppose it had not any more to lose. New South Wales gained 16,155, Queensland 18,675, and Western Australia 145,165. Thus the gain of Western Australia was four times greater than that of all the other States combined. These figures show that Western Australia has been entirely overlooked. I know that it is now too late to remedy the mistake that has been made. I find that the population per square mile in New South Wales is 4""53, as contrasted with i ' 8 in Victoria. When honourable 3 7 members who represent the mother State are speaking of Sydney as the hub of the universe, they should remember that there is something to be said in favour of establishing the Federal Capital in a localitv to the southward of Sydney, inasmuch as the population of Victoria is three times as dense as that of New South Wales. In that case theCanal? clopaedia Britannica ? to consider the possible effects of the Panama Canal upon Australian trade.

Before dealing the with the territories, or sites within those territories, I should like to say a word upon With the exception of what is conthe constitutional aspect of the question, particularly as it relates to the interests of New South Wales. It is a matter upon which, even in this House, there is considerable difference of opinion. Some honourable members hold that as the Constitution provides that the site must be within the territory of New South Wales, 7 no obligation is imposed upon Parliament beyond placing the site within that State. They urge that the particular portion of the State' in which the site is located but to the suitability is of no importance. In fact, several honI was orable members have expressed the opinion that in the interests of the Commonwealth the site should not be within the territory of New South Wales, as we understand it, Under instructions isbut uDon the border, so that New South Wales territory will actually be taken for site purposes, whilst the people living within it will have access to another State entirelv independent of New South Wales. The question of how this position was arrived at is very interesting.

That was one concession which Queensland received. proper one, but it was. a departure from the ideal of the framers of the Constitution for the purpose of meeting State needs.

Then, again, South Australia wished to have the rivers-particularl y those running through Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales, and meeting in her territory, per medium of the Murray-to be preserved for navigation purposes. That question affected such vital interests' in more than one State with regard to the development of territories by means of irrigation that it led to almost a dead-lock in the Convention.

At page 219 we read that the Premiers of the various States, in Conference, reportedIt is considered that the fixing of the site of in favour of Tumut, as against a border the Capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide; but, in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause, so that while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney, or in its neighbourdistance "" of Sydney? hood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. o I draw honourable members' attention to the words "" at a reasonable distance from that city,"" as showing the opinion of the Premiers who revised the Constitution, and who were responsible for the alteration which fixed the ioo-miles limit. issued by the Premiers, -not to the people of New South Wales for their guidance and information, but to the people of the whole Commonwealth, who were subsequently asked to endorse the Constitution as altered.

Could the selection of such a site be said to comply with the spirit which underlies the agreement entered into at the Premiers' Conference? I am supported in my present attitude by some of the leading men who took part in that Conference. The right honourable member for Balaclava, in one of his addresses, saidWe, in this Colony, have made a contract with New South Wales, and we are not going back on it. When, in the last Parliament, the right honourable member for Balaclava was asked to vote for a border site, which had considerable support from the press and representatives of Victoria, he refused to do so, and gave his voice in favour of the Tumut-Lacmalac site. To the honour and credit of that right honourable member, let it be said that he was the only member of the then Government who viewed the question from that liberal stand-point. ber knew the feeling of the Premiers' Conference. he was one of those instrumental in bringing about the agreement then arrived at. The Cabinet, when the voting on the sites took place, contained two representatives of New South Wales, but the right honourable member for Balaclava was the only member of the Ministry prepared to vote site. ber say that Tumut is within a "" reasonable more reasonable distance from Sydney than is Albury, Tooma, Bombala, or Dalgety. Sir Alexander Peacock, when occupying the important position of Premier of Victoria, is reported to have thus expressed himself in an interview with a representative of the Sydney Daily TelegraphThis document was Albury is too near to Melbourne, you know a province of Melbourne. You might as well have the Capital in Victoria as at Albury. .Oh, no; this is a serious business; Albury is impossible-w e admit it. Those utterances were largely instrumental in leading the people of New South Wales to suppose that, all things being equal, a site within a reasonable distance beyond the ioo-miles limit, would not be excluded from the consideration of this House. While honourable members are willing to. select a site in New South Wales, because the Constitution compels them to do so, they do not appear to be prepared to fix on a place within a reasonable distance of Sydney, but would rather locate the Capital on the border, either west or east of the mountains or of the Snowy River. voted for Albury; why not say so ? bers afjterwards transferred their votes. There was not a Victorian member who voted for a site further north than Tumut. Some honourable members view the Constitution as though it not only provided that the Capital site should not be within 100 miles of Sydney, but also that it must not be more than fifty miles from the River Murray or the Victorian border., That is the position to which I take exception, as not being in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution or fair to the interests of the State which I represent. desire New South Wales to provide the land, and to receive no benefit in return.",42,Papers

The disadvantages of sites not on the border may be more than compensated for by advantages which border sites do not possess; and, all things being equal, there is no unreasonableness in the position I am advancing. before, it is not enough to observe the mere letter of the law ; the spirit of the law is its very essence. the Premiers who met in conference indicate the spirit of the Constitution, and its words clearly mean that if a suitable site can be secured within a reasonable distance from Sydney, that site should at least receive fair consideration at our hands. I have been greatly disappointed with the attitude 'assumed on this question by some ""of the representatives of Victoria. Arrangements were made to enable honourable members to visit the different sites suggested that they might imake themselves personally acquainted with them-; but I regret to say that, whilst amongst the visiting parties the other States have been amply represented, honourable members representing Victorian constituencies' have not availed themselves of these .opportunities to the extent that might have been expected, and as the visits were extended northwards, and into the interior of New South Wales, the number of Victorian members joining in these visits of inspection became less. This has not been very promising, but I trust that Victorian representatives will not deny just treatment to the mother State in this matter. I am encouraged to view the situation more hopefully after the address I heard from the honourable and learned member for Wannon, who represents a Victorian constituency. In his able address, that honourable and learned member viewed the question, not from a provincial, but from a comprehensive national stand-point. He was preDared to admit that New South Wales had some claims to consideration which ought not to be ignored. One subject to If New South Wales is which the honourable and learned member referred is worthy of the special attention of the Committee, and that is the amount Buti f a border of expenditure involved on the sites under review. I am aware that the honourable and learned imember has been The fact of the matter is twitted with Kyabramism, because he has endeavoured to view this question from the economic stand-point, and because he suggested the selection of the site which WhatI want to would involve the Commonwealth in the least expense. Without any suggestion of cheese-paring, it must be admitted that the honourable and learned member has raised a very important question, which must"" be f u l l y considered in justice to the people not of any particular State but of the whole Commonwealth, because they will be expected to find the' money As I have said for the establishment and equipment of the Federal Capital. If one suitable site involves less expense than does another, that The words of should certainly have some weight with honourable ' members in its selection. The question of expense has a very important bearing on this matter. There are those who would appear to dissociate Federal interests from State interests. Because the Federal, authority is charged with the carrying out of a certain work, some people think that the States are not affected. But the Federal Parliament has to govern the same people as the States Parliaments, and the burden of unnecessary extravagance on the p.\rt of the Federal Parliament must f a l l upon the people of the States, in just the same way as if the extravagance had been committed by the States Parliaments. It must not be forgotten that the people of the various States will have to foot the bill for all expenses in connection with the Federal Capita) For this reason honourable members should closely consider the cost to the people of the Commonwealth of establishing the Capital at a particular site. As against an expenditure of millions, a few snowcapped mountains, or what honourable members may deem to be beautiful scenery, should not count. The various States are to-day,in connection with the pioneering work which they have had to undertake, carrying a burden of something like £222,000,000. A handful of people, numbering some 4,000,000, has to bear a burden of £222.000,000 of public debt alreadv in.curred, and honourable members should be very careful before they do anything which will add to that burden. It is our duty, not only to see that the people of",43,Papers

Honourable members can verify the figures I propose to quote from the official reports before them. Tumut district I am compelled to take the Lacmalac site as the basis of my comparison, because I have detailed information for the purpose of the comparison with respect to that site only. Of course, with respect to the newer sites submitted for our consideration, there is no information upon these points before us. that but Lacmalac Commissioners' report I find that the expenditure estimated for Bombala, and including the railways, resumption of catchment area, resumption of city site, and water supply amounts to no less than £11,000,000. actual expenditure necessary to give rea-sonable access to that site would be about £3,000,000, and the projected expenditure on railways necessary for a complete connection with the site is estimated to amount tio another £8,000.000. I should say that the estimate of £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 includes harbour accommodation on the lower scale indicated in Mr Oliver's supplementary report, and not on the more extensive scale set out in his original report. The estimate of £1.1,000,000 is for what would be required to make the Bombala site reasonably accessible from the chief cities of Capital into touch with the whole of , the people. With respect to Tumut, the actual expenditure necessary is stated a t £ i 5 5 : ° ; and the expenditure upon l [ 0 0 prospeclive railway extension' £7,522,000, bringing the grand total, in round numbers, up to £9.000.000. spised site of Lyndhurst has railway communication already provided so far as Sydney and Melbourne are concerned, and so far as Brisbane is concerned to a lesser legree. So that the actual expenditure in connection with that site, which would be largely in connection with water supply, as provided in Mr Pridham's estimate, and the resumption of catchment and city areas, is estimated at £ 4 5 6 , 0 0 0 . The expenditure necessary to complete the railways projected, as indicated in the Commissioners' report, would amount to £7,352,000.

Millions are easily said, but these figures should have some weight in determining the selection of the site for the Federal Capital.

I should like to point out that the It is estimated that the estimates of expenditure to which I have referred, are estimates based' on the probable cost of the resumption of the Capital site and catchment area, ' securing access, and water supply, and it must not be forgotten that the expenditure necessary to provide the buildings which we would associate with a city of this character, and which must necessarily be expensive, will be an additional charge upon the people of the Commonwealth I now desire to deal with the question of territory. We have to look to the reports upon the sites for the information necessary to guide us to a conclusion with regard to the territories. the Commonwealth-to bring the In other words, we have to adopt some particular site as a peg upon which to hang our territorial arguments. A great change has taken place since the last Parliament dealt with this matter. The sites most favoured then were Lyndhurst, Lacmalac, and Bombala. Now, judging from The much-dethe opinions expressed by honourable members, it would seem that two of these sites have been displaced. I cannot regard this change as due to the altered personnel of the House, and I am, therefore, forced to the conclusion that it has been brought about by the more complete information that has been placed at the disposal of honourable members. Owing largely to the inquiries and valuable report made by the right honourable member for Swan, Bombala has been displaced by Dalgety, which on the former occasion did not secure a",44,Papers

I have been surprised at the prejudice manifested by some honourable For instance, one honourable member, referring to Lyndhurst, described the country as very inferior, and devoid of vegetation, and stated that even the rabbitsto be found there were in a starving condition. I fancy that that honourable member must have worn coloured glasses when he travelled through the district. In contrasting the merits of the various sites, I shall endeavour to avoid following the honourable member's example. pleasure of visiting all the sites that have been brought prominently WhilstI regard some of them as having stronger claims than others, I do not think that any one can be said to be unworthy. We should not make a great mistake if we selected any one of them. The preliminary investigations were so complete that we were safeguarded against being called upon to discuss the merits of any really inferior site. New South Wales is not so poverty-stricken in respect to her territory that she cannot find a site for the Federal Capital possessing all the chief requisites for such a city. bers, myself amongst them, consider that a rich territory is one of the most important essentials. impossible to build up or to maintain the Federal city entirely upon Federal expenditure, and that if we are to attract to the Seat of Government a population of , say, 30,000 or 50,000, a large proportion of those who live in our territory must be able to sustain themselves upon the land. Moreover, if it is contemplated that the Federal Territory shall embrace a large area in order that the revenue derived and the profits accruing from the unearned increment may be applied to the improvement of the Capital, we must acquire land that will be suitable for agricultural It is true that many of our cities owe their existence to the fact that gold or some other Mr Brown. Then, in respect to the sites mineral has been discovered in their vicinity. We know of many instances in which towns containing a population of perhaps as many as 30,000 have been estabbeen seriously considered. lished as the result of the discovery of alluvial gold-fields, and that as soon as the I regret diggings have been exhausted the population has gradually decreased, and nothing more than a nucleus has remained. Agricultural development has afterwards taken place in the neighbourhood, and prosperity has been, at least, ito some extent,restored. This statement would fairly outmembers. line the history of many cities in the Commonwealth, and it is sufficient to show that a large proportion of the people who settle within the Federal Territory must maintain themselves on the land. Unless we can secure good land in the immediate vicinity of the Federal city, we cannot look forward to any appreciable growth of population. Some honourable members regard the acquirement of a rich territory as a secondary consideration, and an ample water I have had the supply has first place in their estimation. Others, of an artistic or poetic temperaunder notice. ment, attach the greatest importance to the beauty of the scenery in the vicinity of the Capital. So long as there are towering snow-clad mountains in the background they care little or nothing whether the site itself is suitable for building purposes or whether the surrounding territory is one that will support a reasonably large population. The considerations indicated by no less an authority than the present Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, Sir Samuel Griffith, should, in my view, have greatest weight with us. That eminent Judge has Some honourable memcontributed very largely to the development of the Federal idea, and to the building up of the Commonwealth. He took part I hold that it would be in the first Conference, of which the late Sir Henry Parkes, the statesman of whom New South Wales is so proud, was a member l i e largely assisted to lay the foundations of the Constitution, which was ultimately adopted by the Federal Convention, and the traces of his master-hand are everywhere to be seen throughout its fabric. He was, in my opinion, deservedly rewarded by his appointment to the position of first Chief Justice of Australia, and the Commonwealth did honour to itself by that appointment. In 1886, before the subject had consolidated to anything like a concrete purposes. proposal, he wrote a paper entitled, "" Notes on Australian Federation,"" in which, speaking of the Federal Capital, he said that it Should be central, easily accessible, not unduly The suggested railway of which I have exposed to the risks of war or invasion, and its climate should not be such as to render it an undesirable place to live in. We shall not go very far wroig if we consider the question before us frdm those points of view. Dealing first with the feature of centrality, I think that any honourable member who looks at the maps which have been placed before us, and reads the recommendations of the Commission appointed by the Barton Government to inquire into the matter, must come to the conclusion that, having regard to railway communication, present and prospective, Lyndhurst is much more central than any of the other sites. The Lyndhurst territory is situated on the main western line from Sydney to Bourke, and the branch which proceeds to Condobolin. It is also on the line which connects the Western system with the Southern. The Southern line, as honourable members know, is the great railway thoroughfare from Adelaide, through Melbourne and Sydney, to Brisbane. Moreover, it is now proposed by the New South Wales Government to construct a railway from Wellington to Werris Creek, not with a view to improve the communication with a proposed Federal Capital site, but to develop the country which such a line would traverse, and to connect the western and northern railway ' systems. When that line is made, Lyndhurst will be much nearer to Brisbane than it is now, and it is already nearer to that city than is any of the other proposed sites. Parliamentary sanction has also been given to the construction of a. railway from Cobar to Wilcannia. I understand that that line has been commenced, and that it is proposed to extend it to BrokenH ill . When that is done, there will be direct communication between Lyndhurst and Adelaide, and. if the transcontinental line, of which the right honourable member for Swan is so able and strenuous an advocate, is constructed, Lyndhurst will be in direct communication with Perth also. Furthermore, it has been suggested, as within the scope of future extension, that a second transcontinental line may be made from Bourke to Port Darwin. As honourable members are aware, the railway system of Queensland differs greatly from those of her sister States, inasmuch as, while the railways of Victoria practicallv all. converge on Melbourne, and those of New South Wales on Sydney, Queensland, in addition to her coastal line, has three inland lines which feed three separate ports. spoken would connect these lines, that is, the line from Brisbane to Cunnamulla, the line from Rockhampton to Longreach, and the line from Townsville to Winton. Such a railway would open up a vast area of rich pastoral country. The districts through which it would pass are noted for their great cattle carrying capacity. Although, within the past few years, the herds have been decimated by the drought which afflicted Queensland, as well as New South Wales and Victoria, the district will do in the future what it has done in the past. It has in the past largely supplied the meat markets of the southern States, and, in years to come, will do so to a still greater degree, and will, of course, be the great source of supply for the Federal Capital. The question of present accessibility, however, was dealt with so ably by the honourable and learned member for Wannon the other night that there is no need to again .quote the. figures which he gave, or to do more than refer honourable members to the information on the subject available in the reports of experts. It is evident, however, that taking into consideration the present location of population, Lyndhurst is much more central than any other site under consideration. Moreover, it has been proved that the centre of the present population of the Commonwealth is considerably north of any of the border sites, and is constantly trending northwards. Mr Coghlan, whose estimate is a very conservative one,puts the probable annual increase of our population at 2^40 per cent., and is of opinion that thirty years hence, of all the sites Lyndhurst will be the nearest to the centre of population. The probability is that when Australia has become largely populated, the centre will be still nearer to the Armidale site; but as that site is not now under consideration, we must give the more weight to the fact that of the present sites Lyndhurst will be the nearest to the centre. Sir Samuel Griffith regards as the next essential that the Capital shall not be exposed to the risks of war. No one will challenge the statement that, with the exception of Tooma, Lyndhurst is more completely protected from invasion than any of the sites. Both Lyndhurst and Tooma lie west of the great dividing range, which extends like an immense barrier between the sea coast and the interior. That range was pierced only after the country had been settled for many years, and at the present time there are only two or three places in which it is who visited the Orange site will recollect crossed by a railway. The Lithgow Zigzag, seeing potatoes under -cultivation there while giving communication between Sydney right at the summit of the ridges, plainly and the Lyndhurst territory, could be deindicating that the land along those ridges fended by a very small body of men against was very rich. As a matter of fact, the an almost untold host. tion which does not apply to the Monaro a very considerable elevation.

The Bombala area,, extending from the Snowy River lo the Victorian border, consists largely of undulating country with frequent granite outcrops. It is fairly good .grazing country, and parts of it are of a rich volcanic nature; there is not, however, a very great extent of it. Towards Bombala itself, the valleys become deeper, and a. greater area of rich soil is to be found there. These constitute the highly-cultivated parts of the district. When we recollect, however, that this country was occupied sixty years ago and before the western district was opened up, that about Xi,000.000 has besn expended in an effort to develop it, with very little success, it is at once patent that some very great natural disadvantages must confront the settlers there. On the other hand, the people in the western district originally had to contend with the barrier ot the Blue Mountains. Teams had to laboriously drag their loads over that range. It was only after considerable development had taken place in that district that the Government of New South Wales undertook the great engineering feat of constructing a railway across the Blue Mountains. To put the matter tersely, the railway did not develop the western district, but the western district developed the railway. That fact discloses a material difference between this site and its rivals, and one to which I would invite the attention of the Committee. The cost of connecting Cooma and Bombala by rail, according to the report of the Capital Sites Commissioners, would be £337,000, whilst that of constructing a line from Bombala to Bairnsdale I notice that the surveyors, who have since not From Bondi to Eden the cost would be £931,000. These are necessary lines, if the site which I have mentioned is to be chosen. of the Capital being located there, is based on the cheap water carriage to Eden. If that is to be of any advantage, there must be railway connection with the Capital. That railway would be perhaps as expensive a bit of work as any of the lines that have been mentioned. Then, again, there must be connection between Cooma and Bombala, in order to give railway communication with Sydney; and if Victoria is to be satisfied with that connection, it will mean a great detour round by Goulburn. But, assuming that Victoria will want to get as direct a connection as possible, it will be 6s necessary to construct the Bombala-Bairnsdale line, which will, on the estimate to which I have referred, cost _£ 1,181,000. SD that in these railways will be involved an expenditure of £2,449,000. £r,028,000 for the port. port-it is called a harbour by courtesy-if it is to be made of any value, the expenditure will be considerable. A human-made harbour has never yet been a success. mantle? mantle; but New South Wales has tried the experiment of making harbors on' the east coast, and practically the money might as well have been thrown into the sea. It is a most expensive work to undertake. But if a harbour that could stand could be constructed, there might be a justification for it. Engineers, however, have not been able to construct harbour works on the east coast of New South Wales that could stand against the varying influences of the currents, tides, and storms that obtain there. If the harbour is to be a success, Mr Oliver who had charge of the New South Wales harbors at that time-that an expenditure °f £ >° 8,ooo would be required to conI 2 struct the breakwaters, to say nothing of the wharfs and other facilities necessary for shipping. But suppose we take the lower estimate of Mr Oliver, produced in his criticism of the Commissioners' report. is estimated at £1,181,000. It is an estimate furnished by Mr G. H . Halligan, an officer of the Works Departexamined this site, have ment of New South Wales. He showed departed from that estimate. that a small breakwater, at a cost of £150,000, would give harbour accommodation of less than a mile. The actual area being 0.8 of a square mile. The depth One of the arguments in favour would be about four fathoms. He also indicates that for a further expenditure of £450,000, four and a half square miles of harbour accommodation might be provided, and that it would also be necessary to meet the shipping requirements to expend about £30,000 upon jetties, and so forth, -or a minimum of harbour accommodation. But this is not the only expenditure which the Commonwealth would be called upon to incur. The very position of the harbour, and the uses to which it would be put, would necessitate its being fortified. We know, from our experience in Mel-, bourne and Sydney, what enormous sums",45,Papers

That item has not been considered in the preparation of the estimates to which I have alluded. item-w e should have to subsidize the shipping companies heavily to get them to allow their vessels to go there. as there is considerable danger in navigating that coast. I do not know whether the ship-owners would require' subsidies, but they certainly would require the money which I have mentioned to be spent upon the harbour, to make the accommodation for their vessels reasonable. Even then our experience shows us that Ave could not guarantee to make the harbour absolutely safe. The necessary expenditure on account of the harbour on the lowest scale would be £ 1 8 0 , 0 0 0, which makes the actual expenditure £3,000,000, in order to give reasonable means of access to Bombala or Dalgety. If the harbour is to be of the character indicated by Mr cheaply than according to the Victorian esDarley, who reported upon it, another £1.000.000 will have to be expended. The Federal Capital Commission shows that Other railways will have to be constructed, and they estimate that their cost-that is, to give further facilities to connect the Capital with Adelaide and with the north --woul d be £7,000,000. total expenditure, in order to make Bombala or Dalgety anything like reasonably accessible for the purposes of the Federal Capital, and to provide a port, and a water supply for a population of 50,000 people, would be no less than £11.022,680. With regard to Tumut, the water supply is reasonably cheap. I wish to indicate that in dealing with the Tiimut site, I have to take the figures for the Lacmalac site as the basis of my estimate. The Lacmalac which we have any data. It is the cheapest site in the district, with the exception of Gadara. At Tumut the water supply would' cost ,£200,280. The resumption of the catchment area would cost £ 1 8 0 . The city site would cost £ 2 5 , 0 0 0. Railway extension, would nexion be made with Victoria-and we have every reason to believe that that connection is held by a large number of honourable members to be essential-upo n the Victorian estimate the line would cost ,£1,240,000. In addition, it would cost £ 6 , 0 0 0 to construct a bridge over the Murray. I am simply giving the lowest estimate, furnished by the Victorian railway engineers. But the other evening, the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, who is a practical man in connection with surveying, stated that he had thoroughly examined the country, and had arrived at the conclusion that, instead of its being possible to construct that line for £ 8 , 5 0 0 a mile-whic h is the basis upon which I make this calculation-it would cost nearer £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a mile to build the line from Tumut to the Victorian border. I can quite understand, from the little acquaintance I have with that country, and from its precipitous character, that it certainly would cost a very large sum to give it the benefit of railway connection. The actual expenditure on this site would be £1,515.000 on the lowest estimate; but if the testimony of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is of any value, the cost would be considerably more. But I do not think that the line can be constructed more timate ; and that means that, in order to give facilities for communication, an actual expenditure of £ 1 , 5 1 5 , 0 0 0 will-be necessary.

Chesterman's report, and as that is only a few days old, I presume that the gentleman who made it secured the most up-todate information. plored quite recently. this Parliament visited it only about three weeks ago. I have no desire to be unduly severe in my criticism of other honourable members, but I must say that the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Hume, with respect to this particular site, is most extraordinary when compared with the attitude which the honourable gentleman has adopted with respect to other sites. When this Tooma site was brought forward by the honourable member for Grampians in the last Parliament the honourable member asked the Government to remit it to the expert Commissioners for report. I know that the honourable member strongly im. pressed upon the Minister of Home Affairs at the time the necessity for extending the inquiry of the Commission to that particular site. ject, and I told him that I was opposed to all the sites on the border, but that if the Government intended to include AlburyI saw no reason why this site at Tooma should, not be included amongst those on which a report was to be made. It is neither more nor less a border site than is Albury. orable member for Hume, who previously objected to this site because it was too near the border, should have given his first preferential vote for Albury is a paradox which I cannot pretend to understand. ber for Hume now intend to vote for Tumut? .honourable gentleman inlands to vote now. The question of temperature is a very important one, and in this connection I shall not confine myself to the information supplied by the report of the expert Commissioners; I have also before me the information contained in the very severe, caustic, and, to some extent, deserved, criticism of the Commission's report by the late Mr Oliver. The figures he quotes are: For Bombala, highest i o 4 ' i degrees, lowest 15-3 degrees, and the mean annual shade temperature, 54-3 degrees. For Dalgety, he says that no official records If the honourable member is are available, but the expert Commissioners in their special report, at Highest temperature 104 degrees, lowest 14 degrees, mean from 70 degrees to 80 degrees -For Lyndhurst, the figures given are: Mean annual shade temperature 52-2 degrees, highest Q8'4 degrees, and lowest 15*4 degrees. For Tumut: Mean annual shade temperature 62 degrees, highest 106 degrees, and lowest 27 degrees. It will be seen that in the matter of temperature the western site shows to very considerable advantage. I wish now to, deal with the question of productivity, and I shall then conclude what I have to say. The expert Commissioners in their report had to consider whether the sites could afford reasonable support for ,a papulation of 50,000. It will be seen that in their report they give an estimate ot the acreage under cultivation,' and the productiveness at each of the different sites. They take for Bombala the counties of Auckland and Wellesley, and they give the average aiea under cultivation for eight years preceding March, 1903, for the Bombala territory at 12,513 acres, and for Dalgety He spoke to me on the sub33)329 acres, or a total for the district of 45,742 acres. At Tumut the area under cultivation was included in the counties of Buccleuch and Wynyard, and is staled a t 33)329 acres. Coming to the western sites, the area under cultivation at Lyndhurst is given at 179,303 acres. I should like the honourable memberwho told us that Why the honLyndhurst was in a third-rate agricultural district to explain how it is that there were 179,000 acres under cultivation in that district, whilst in the districts which he preferred to it, Tumut and Bombala, there were only 33,000 acres and 45,000 acres respectively under cultivation.

261,Mr Brown,"I do not know how theto consider the fifty miles radius, and the land under cultivation at Orange was 147,259 acres, and at Bathurst 119,488 acres. So that if we consider Lyndhurst, as including these three sites, there were there 446,050 acres under cultivation. The honourable member who, in the face of that, will say that, it is a poor agricultural distableland. For convenience, the statistitrict must consider that the men who work the land, and who should be the best judges of farming conditions, are fools. In view of the figures I have given, it must be clear district, which is under the dominance of that the contention against the productivity of the western district cannot survive the hard test of facts. When in Sydney some little time ago, I asked the Statistical Department to supply me with last year's figures of production for these districts. The figures referred to in the Commissioners' report were brought up only to 1903. supplied with figures brought up to 1904 tivation, and the produce taken from the different sites. From the return supplied to me, I find that Bombala last year produced 42,149 bushels of wheat, and Dalgety 51,317 bushels, or a total of 93,466 bushels for the district. Of maize Bombala produced 274,803 bushels, and Dalgety nil. Of oats Bombala produced 16,009 bushels, and Dalgety 31,014, or a total of 47,023 bushels for the district. The Monaro sites last year produced 93,466 bushels of wheat, 274,803 bushels maize, and 47,023 bushels of oats'. I find that Tumut produced 261,483 bushels wheat, 229,975 bushels maize, and 20,987 bushels of oats. Lyndhurst produced 2,852,859 bushels of wheat, 157,243 bushels of maize, 207,599 bushels 1,408,366 bushels of wheat, bushels of maize, and 185,4^ bushels of ' oats. Bathurst produced 1,146,525 bushels of wheat, 93,450 bushels of maize, and 165,047 bushels of oats. The total production of' the western sites was :-Wheat, 5,407,750 bushels; maize, 371,189 bushels; and oats, 558,058 bushels. I ask honourable members if , on the actual facts, they think there is any comparison between the productiveness of' the districts surrounding these three sites. 1 have given the produce of the sites' districts, but it should not be forgotten that Lyndhurst commands the great wheat territory to the west of the particular sites at that place,, and the railway goes through Lyndhurst territory, which carries the wheat from those districts to the Sydney market for export. In New South Wales we have only 1,500,000 acres under wheat, and yet last year we produced something like 27,000,000 bushels. According to our statisticians we have 20,000,000 acres of land in New South Wales fit for wheat cultivation, and most of it is on the slopes of the western cians divide the State into districts, in making their estimates of wheat production. The highest is the central western the western sites, and the southernwestern, a considerable part of which is under the dominance of the central western sites. The railway, carrying the products from those districts, runs through this central western territory, extending from Orange via Wellington, and Narramine to Nyngan; from Orange to I asked that I should be Molong, Forbes, Parkes, and Condobolin, and a small area on the southern line, emshowing' the area under culbracing Grenfell. On the central-western slopes, which are supplied with railwiy communication, there were produced last year 7,743,000 bushels, and on the southern-western slopes 8,798,000 bushels.. The southern border of the central-western slopes is the Lachlan River, and the railway to iForbes and Condobolin draws traffic from a considerable area to the south of that river, so that part of the southern-western slopes, including the counties of Gipps, Forbes, and part of Bland, would furnish supplies for the Federal Territory. Coming now to the question of water supply : If Lyndhurst has been attacked on one point more than on another, it is in regard to this matter. An anonymous communication, signed by one who term? himself of oats. Orange produced "" A resident of Carcoar-GnrJand,"" and 120,496 purports to speak from personal knowledge, has been printed in the Bombala Times. In it the statement is made that the water in the district is highly mineralized, and, therefore, unfit for city purposes. I am surprised that any sensible man should give weight to an anonymous communication of that description in preference to the reports of experts. The Capital Sites Commission investigated the matter thoroughly, and they say nothing about the water there being impregnated by deleterious mineral matter. If , in their opinion, the water in the district was unfit for human use, or to any extent affected by the presence of mineral substances, it would have been their duty to inform us of the fact. Some honourable mem-, bers 'have asked why a special analysis of the Lyndhurst water has not been made. But I would point out that analyses of the waier at Orange and Bathurst, both of which places are near to Lyndhurst and derive their water supply from practically the same source, have been made. tried to ascertain from those who have resided for a long time in the Lyndhurst district, and are well acquainted with it, what modicum of truth lies in the statement to which I have referred, and I have been informed"" that the only foundation for it is the fact that a small creek to the south-west of the site, which empties itself into the Belabula River, runs through some limestone country. is not within the proposed catchment area. If honourable members are not satisfied with the reports which we have already obtained from experts, why not have a special analysis of the Lyndhurst water? been further stated that the creeks in the -district are often d r y ; but to those who hold the opinion that the water supply there is not permanent, I commend the report of Mr Pridham, the report of the Commissioners, and, lastly, the report of the right honourable member for Swan, who recently visited the place. those reports they will find that a supply sufficient for 100,000 persons can be brought to the proposed city site by gravitation. one which can be so supplied.

On the contrary, they say that the catchment area there would, under the most unfavourable conditions, provide a supply sufficient for a city of 100.000 inhabitants, while Mr Wade says that at a reasonable expenditure a supply can be provided sufficient for the purposes of extensive irrigation, and to meet the requirements of an additional' population of 200,000, or in all 300,000 persons.

It was the worse that I have ever known, and my recollection extends as far back as 1865. In the midst of the drought, the river, instead of being the sand-bed that has been represented, contained a supply of water sufficient to meet the requirements of several large irrigation plants. One station proprietor, at a point about twenty-one miles below Forbes, fed seventy-five sheep per acre throughout the drought, by irrigating land on the banks of the Lachlan with water drawn from the river, and below that point, as far as Cowra, a considerable number of large irrigation plants were kept going continuously. I admit that the large quantities of water drawn -off from the river in this way, and impounded in dams that were constructed on the upper part of the stream, caused the river to run dry lower down, but the supply of water was not exhausted for a length of fully 100 miles. Therefore, the Lachlan could not be truthfully described as dry, and unreliable as a source of water supply. ber say that some of the land carried seventy-live sheep to the acre during the drought. a well authenticated case. The operations were carried out under the supervision of an officer of the Agricultural Department of New South Wales, with a view to demonstrate the advantages of irrigation, and the honourable member may, if he chooses, obtain further particulars by -consulting the official reports from which my information is derived. tell fairy tales, because the facts are sufficient to enable me to establish the claims of Lyndhurst. What did Mr Wade say with respect to catchment area in connection with the gravitation scheme mentioned by the Commissioners ? HesaidI am personally acquainted with all of these catchments, and am in accord with the Commissioners in their views as to basis of run-off, and consider that, by amplifying the storage, a population in round numbers of 100,000 people could be supplied with 100 gallons per head per diem. Mr Wade, who is the Chief Engineer of Water Conservation in New South Wales, pointed out that the Commissioners were well within the mark when they said that 100,000 people could be supplied. Then, dealing with the supplementary scheme, he saidThe drought of In addition to these gravitation sources, the Federal Royal Commission suggested the Lachlan River as an additional source of supply by pumping from the storage proposed for irrigation purposes by the State, at Wyangala. It was suggested that a supply for an additional 203,000 could be obtained. . . The Wyangala storage, if carried out to the fullest extent of the proposals for irrigation purposes, will store seventy-eight thousand million gallons,, and be capable of supplying 135 million gallons per day throughout the driest succession of years experienced on the Lachlan, such as 1901-2. Mr Wade has adopted a very safe basis for his calculations, and there need be no fear that his estimates will not be realized. I wish to say that, as the result of my own experience and observation, from the point of view of productiveness, and of the possibility of founding a city from its own latent resources, no site submitted for our consideration can compare with the western sites. I think I have amply demonstrated that, by showing the very wide margin which exists between them and othfer sites so far as productiveness and the areas under cultivation are concerned. That is an item which is worthy of very serious consideration -From the stand-point of splendid panoramic country, the Orange site stands unrivalled. On the other hand, for scenic beauty, in the shape of high snow-capped mountains, Tooma probably excels all others, whilst Dalgety undoubtedly would furnish the best water supply. But I would point out that we are not called upon to select a site simply on account of its water supply, or because it is within seventeen or thirty miles of snow-capped mountains. It must possess other qualifications. On the grounds of centrality, accessibility, general climatic I do not come here to conditions, altitude, facilities for defence, and of a reasonable water supply, I think I have shown, that the western site is at least deserving of very serious consideration at the hands of honourable members. I trust that the Committee will not say that because this site happens to be only seven hours distant by rail from Sydney, and eleven hours' journey from Melbourne, it should not be considered. I claim that the spirit of the Constitution, as well as its letter, should be respected. I trust that we shall make a selection which will justify our wisdom, not only to the present generation, but to the generations to come.",54,Papers

Its mineral resources are great, its agricultural capabilities very considerable. But when I have said that. I have, in my judgment, exhausted all the advantages which it possesses. Coming to the Bombala and Dalgety sites, I say that if there were no consideration affecting their claims other than that of the enormous expenditure which would require to be incurred by Victoria before they could be linked with this State by that would be sufficient to prevent them from being seriously considered. The district has very many advantages, which have been justly enumerated by my honourable friend who preceded me. have to confess that, although I . have had a business association with it, I have not inspected the area. But I have means of forming estimates of the character of the country, of its possibilities, of its mineral resources; and I have the knowledge which enables me to arrive at a conclusion that for the proper development of that country an expenditure would have to be incurred which we should not be justified in undertaking at the present time -As I have already indicated, I favour a site which, dav by day, is growing in favour amongst honourable members-that is the Toona He has supplied the Committee site. The visits which have been made to that site have impressed honourable members as to its great natural features.

272,Mr Knox (Kooyong),"I do not proalmost in the world. The site is practically at the foot of Mount Kosciusko and tlie magnificent ranges , that make a background to the district. The climate is not so cold as to be other than agreeably and healthily bracing. We want, as one of the essential conditions of any centre of future population, a permanent and enduring supply of water, fed if possible from snow-capped mountains. There is no other part of Australia where those conditions exist, except on the western side of the Great Dividing Range of which Mount Kosciusko is the prominent feature. Of course, my honourable friends who support the Bombala and Dalgety sites will remind us that the Monaro district alsi has great natural features. But I have showi thra the insuperable objection to it is ihe enormous initial expense which would be necessary, apart from other objections, to which I shall presently refer. Another consideration influences me, and it is this-that every capital city in the world is placed beside a stream leading to the sea. It may be said that, although the waters of the Upper Murray are permanent they are not, at the present time, very considerable in volume. seen in other parts of the civilized world what has been done'in the direction of the enlargement of rivers by weiring, and by various other methods known to engineers. The Murray at this site has possibilities of extension, because of the waters which can be successfully diverted into it from other sources, which we cannot at present adequately calculate. I , therefore, say that we have an opportunity of placing our Capital, and we expect that it will becorv.e a magnificent city, right beside this great ar.d isolated may be felt by honourable members who national feature of Australia-the high permanently snow-capped Mount Kosciusko. In this district there is also a river which connects directly with the ocean, and it has the further advantage that in the case of the approach of an enemy it would have the protection of a range of mountains. I honourable member who preceded me, that the latter advantage is possessed equally by Lyndhurst; but for resisting an aggressive attack, I say that Tooma is more advantageously situated. The main points which I urge are the great natural features I have described, including a river to the sea, and a fertility of soil which cannot be denied by any one possessing knowledge of the country. These are magnificent advantages which cannot be claimed for any other site which has been named. .But I have been forced, very much against my will, to consider the merits and demerits of the various sites. As I have said, I had earnestly hoped that ordinary common sense would prevail, and that this question would be deferred until there .ivas some justiheation for its immediate settlement. The debate has revealed a great diversity of opinion, and honourable members have advocated various sites with a political bias, which, no doubt, is unconscious; I do not suggest, for one moment, that that bias has been knowingly allowed to prevail. It is a great misfortune that a Royal Commission, comprising a Judge of the High Court of Australia, and perhaps also a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales-a n independent body-ha s not been appointed to take into consideration the opinions expressed in this House, the evidence supplied in the various reports presented to us, and also evidence which they might have collected independently. Such a Commission might have been allowed to practically decide the question. I am perfectlyBut we have aware that the Constitution provides that this Parliament shall select the Seat of Government, which in the meantime must remain in Melbourne. But the Constitution could have been complied with by the appointment of such a Commission as, I have suggested. If the choice had been limited to the three districts mentioned during the discussion, I am quite sure that the choice of an independent Commission would have removed all the heart-burnings which I am afraid have so strongly advocated certain sites. To my mind, such a course afforded the only possibility of a satisfactory solution of this question which naturally arouses local jealousies, and may disturb the good; feeling we all desire to see between honourable members, not only of this House, am prepared to admit, with the but of another Chamber. Indeed, I go further, and regret that we have not adopted the Canadian method. It will be remembered that the choice of the site of the Canadian Capital was left to Queen Victoria; and, in my opinion, it would have been a wise course to have supplied the King with the necessary information, and asked him to name the place. decided that this Parliament shall select the Capita] site.",56,Papers

Notwithstanding that it has been decided that this House must make the choice, to me it is a matter of regret that this other course has not been adopted; and the debate which has taken place has only strengthened the view I hold. to express my opinion, based on an anxious appreciation of the heavy responsibility which rests on every honourable member to avoid burdening the community with enormous expenditure. choice we make will be felt by succeeding generations; and, with reasonable delay, the spi.it of the compact with New South Wales might have been faithfull y carried out. In expressing those opinions, I feel that I am only doing my duty, not only to the electors I have the honour to represent, but to the State of Victoria, with a member of the Committee I am expected which I have been associated since my boyhood. For the reasons which I have given, I think our wisest selection would be the site the great natural, advantages of which I have placed before honourable members. May I say one other word on the question of delay. been made clear that many honourable members have altered the views which they previously held as to the comparative advantages of the various sites. The supporters of the Lyndhurst district, for example, are now concentrating the whole of their efforts on the one site at Lyndhurst, although, as a matter of fact, we know that when a vote was last taken on the question Lyndhurst occupied but a moderate place, even in the opinion of those who believed that it was in the best district. that we have been forced back from Tumut to Tooma. Further inquiry, and riper knowledge have led us to believe that on the Murray, and nearer to the great range to which I have referred, there is a site to be found possessing' greater advantages even than Tumut. Tooma largely on trust. again, honourable members who have said I am merely pointing out that there is no site which approaches that of Bombala are now as eagerly, as eloquently, and as .warmly advocating In view of It the changes of opinion which have taken place, can we now say that further consideration of the question and fuller information would not enable us to make a better selection than we are likely to make at this time? I say that from the New South Wales stand-point, if that be a. consideration of any great weight, honourable members representing that State are throwing away the best site it I only rose possesses, which is at Captain's Flat, Lake George. We should there, at Jervis Bay, have a harbour worth speaking about. i know the district well, and can speak from my knowledge of it. The The effects of the harbour at Eden is but an open roadstead, yet it has been urged as one of the makeweights in the claims of the Bombala district. It is a farce to ask honourable members who know the place to believe that a useful harbour could be provided at Twofold Bay, without an enormous expenditure of money. I feel that as to inform myself of the advantages of the various sites. I believe that Tooma possesses all the qualifications which would go to make a great city in the future. I invite honourable members to consider that there is still much to be adjusted, and much During the debate it has work to be overtaken .in connection with the establishment of the Commonwealth Government.

I think that any honourable member who has seen the district must be convinced that it possesses overwhelming advantages, as compared with the other sites which have been suggested. I have but the one complaint to make, and it is that the Government are too precipitate in expecting a vote to be taken on this question on Tuesday next. We have not the f u l l information in connection with Tooma, with which we have been supplied in connection with all the other sites. there are honourable members who will vote against that site, and I think that they should be given an .opportunity of personal investigation, when I am sure they would recognise that it possesses greater advantages than any other site which has been suggested. only to indicate my first preference, and the reasons for it. hope that when the ballot is taken, honourable members' votes will not be influenced by provincial considerations. site whose selection I advocate borders on the State of Victoria, I shall vote for it, not for that reason, but because, in my opinion, it is the site most worthy to be the future Capital of the Australian Commonwealth. a word or two upon this question, the settlement of which is to crown the Federal edifice, and to give this Parliament a permanent abiding place. I intend to put I forward one or twt» considerations to which reference has not been made by those who have preceded me. Each of the State capitals-Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth-ha s been excluded, it may be because of their mutual jealousy, from the possibility of being selected as the Capital of Australia. But the Attorney General of the late Government, speaking before Fedeiation was consummated, pointed out that the land comprising the site of the Commonwealth Capital would be held I have held that it was on an entirely different basis from the tenure of the land on which the capitals of the States are built, because its unearned increment would remain the property of the people of Australia for all time. It is thai consideration which I wish to put before the Committee, and, I think, it should influence us in deciding which site to vote for. In considering how the largest unearned increment can be obtained for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth, as against No . private speculators, the question of railway I am not aware that the communication must be taken into consideration. It is, undoubtedly, the fact that the presence of railway communication largely promotes the development of a district. The railways which run so close to the Lyndhurst site have obviously assisted to develop that district, and the honourable member for Canobolas pointed out that no less .than 5,000,000 bushels of wheat were last year grown there. But the fact that that district is so greatly developed, and has such a large production, is not necessarily a reason for In its absence selecting it. There may be other sites whose natural productiveness may make them capable of similar development, and if we select one of them for a site, and make a railway to it, we shall bring that development to pass, and largely increase the present value of its lands.

I asked him why he had built his house 'in such a place. He said; "" It is very cold here, and the wind sweeps very strongly over the higher land, and, therefore, we build our houses in the sheltered hollows.""

I should be sorry indeed to condemn the future members of this Parliament to eke out an existence in a country like that.

I rise to speak upon this important question from a perfectly impartial stand-point, inasmuch as I have no electors to' please or displease, and, therefore, have no political axe to grind. cates of the Lyndhurst site who affirm that in declaring ""that the Federal Capital should not be located within 100 miles of Sydney, the Conference of Premiers responsible for the limitation, intended that the Seat of Government should be established as near to that limit as possible. In my opinion, no such idea was present in their minds. They merely intended to provide that the Federal Capital should not be within 100 miles of Sydney. they desired that the determination of what was the most suitable territory in which to locate the Seat of Government should be left to this Parliament. sentatives of New South Wales desire to settle this question without any further delay they can easily do so by agreeing to the selection of the Bombala district, which is the territory that has been chosen by the Senate. cult to find better land than exists in the Bombala district. is that it is not connected by railway communication. There we find beautiful streams of water, and undulatingcountry, interspersed with occasional belts of trees. I have seen no finer stock than is to be found there, in any part of New South Wales. Although the weather is usually cold, the' climate of Bombala is quite equal to that which obtains in any other district. There is certainly a disadvantage in connection with the water scheme of Bombala. The water would have to be pumped to convey it to the Federal Capital. obtain an excellent water supply, we have only to go to Dalgety There the Snowy River flows through the site, which is sheltered by the mountains from the westerly winds. gety country against other districts.

If we took a large area probably His it would include some basalt country, but They there would be none within a limit of ten miles square. I do not, however, attach That is much importance to the quality of the land. It has been proved' that by means of scientific manuring poor land can be put to very good uses. There is land in Victoria that formerly returned only three bags to the acre, but which now, in consequence of scientific manuring, is yielding seven to the acre. Therefore, I do not attach much importance to the land at Dalgety being I disagree with those advoinferior, and there are other considerations which make the site very desirable. There is water in sufficient quantities to supply a city very much larger than we shall have for many years to come. There is also enough water to give us electric power. With respect to railway communication at Dalgety, there would be thirty miles of line to construct. That is not a very large' undertaking. In connection with the Lyndhurst site, we hear of the possibility of I believe connecting Werris Creek with Wellington, and running a railway on to Western Australia. As compared with schemes of that kind, the thirty miles of line If the reprethat would have to be built at' Dalgety, would be a trifling scheme: The honourable member for Moira spoke of the Dalgety country as being too cold for his horses. But any person who knows anything about stock will be aware that I claim that it would be diffihorses that have been fed in the Riverina country would necessarily suffer on being Its great drawback taken to a cold climate 2,000 feet above the sea-level.

Some of the Uppei Murray residents told me that they knew of land that was carrying seventeen sheep to too much for me. I flatly said that I did not believe it.

You see on your right the beautiful crystal streams of the Tooma and the Murray trickling away on their course to the sea. I admit that if we intend to have an area of 900 square miles, we cannot get that extent of good land at Tooma. We can get it at Dalgety or Bombala. Buti f we are content with ten miles square, there is not a finer site obtainable than that of Tooma. The only objection to it appears to be that it is too near to Victoria. That is the whole cry of the New South Wales people. But that consideration has nothing to do with us. We need not care whether 2 -it is near Victoria or not. We have to decide which is the most suitable site for the benefit of the people of Australia. We are not deciding for ourselves, but for posterity ; and if we choose the worse site, the acre. That statement was posterity will curse us for what we have done. As to its being inaccessible from the point of view of railway construction, I would remind honourable members that some years ago there were many situations which were inaccessible from a railwaypoint of view. The railway over the Blue Mountains from Penrith to Glenbrook, on had to go by means of the zig-zag. Bui that has been largely overcome, and to-day the engineers have the plans of a line t<\ go straight to Lithgow, without using the zig-zag at all. In these days of engineering advance, difficulties of that kind are more easily overcome than was the cast, in former years. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa, to whost, opinion some credit has been attached, because he is a practical surveyor, spoke of the difficulties of the country. But, as a. matter of fact, he took no levels,and his "". opinion is worth no more than mine. We must remember that in constructing railways, engineers do not go over mountains if they can help it. They follow the course of the creeks. That is always done of Australia. I happen to know something I have about Lyndhurst, because I lived in the neighbourhood for a considerable lime. I have also read a great deal about the sugYou see the snow-capped gested site there. A picture book has been circulated amongst honourable members, in order to show them the beauties of the site.

That has evidently been the object aimed at by the Victorian members in both sessions. The ioo-miles limit was 'arrived at as a compromise, because there was an unwillingness in both of the States to have the Capital at either Melbourne or Sydney. In agreeing to that compromise, I am sure that no member of the Premiers' Convention thought fora moment that it was of such a nature as to lead to the establishment of the Federal Capital on the Victorian border. The meaning of it was that the Federal Capital should be established within a reasonable distance of the 100miles limit from Sydney. member say that? satisfied that that was the intention, and it never could have been contemplated that the Capital would be established on the banks of the Murray, or the Snowy River, or on the Australian Alps. hurst. proper place for it.

I expect to be able to convince the honourable member for Capricornia presently, and on Tuesday next T shall certainly claim his vote for Lyndhurst. I voted for that site when the question was last before this Parliament. The speech delivered by the honourable member for Macquarie, in which that honourable member dwelt upon the many advantages which Lyndhurst possesses over all the other sites, and Mr Wade's report, have confirmed me in the conviction that Lyndr, hurst is the proper place for the Federal Capital. There are two qualifications which should be specially considered in coming to a decision with regard to the Federal Capital site-the climatic conditions, and the possession of an abundant 'supply of good and wholesome water. If there is one consideration of more importance than 6r another in the establishment of a city, great or small, it is that there shall be an abundance of pure water available at all times. In my opinion it has been proved beyond doubt that the district of Lyndhurst possesses such a supply. It has a further advantage in possessing good soil, . as was proved to-night by the honourable member for Canobolas from the figures he quoted, showing a production of wheat, maize, and oats greater than that nf Bombala, Dalgety, Tumut, or any of the other areas. member was not satisfied with generalities; he gave actual quantities. member gave quantities, details, and figures for every statement he made. He gave ° proof beyond the possibility of dispute. I am aware that many members of the Committee are not prepared to entertain the idea of any site north of Sydney; but I still say that it would be wise to establish the Federal Capital north of Sydney. Mr Sawers, then member for New England, placed before this Parliament some very the population of Australia forty years If honourable members draw an imaginary linefrom a few miles south of Sydney, due west, I venture to predict that in 100 years' timethe area of New South Wales north of that particular line and Queensland will contain at least three.fourths of the population of the Commonwealth. That opinion is based not merely upon my own knowledge of the magnificent area in northern New South Wales, and my profound belief in the great future before the State of Queensland, but is backed up by a report presented by a Committee of Statisticians to the Federal Convention on the question of the trend of population. The members of the Committee were unbiased, and their opinions may surely be regarded with some respect. I admit that what they predicted is not likely to happen q'uite as rapidly as they believed, because they did not take into account the possibility that such an overwhelming and disastrous drought as Australia has passed through recently would seriously retard settlement for a time. What was the opinion of those gentlemen? They reported that in a period of thirty-eight years from the date of their report the population of Australia would be as follows :-Ne w South Wales, S,ooo,ooo; Queensland, 7,500,000; Victoria, 4,000,000; and South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania combined, 2,500,000.",64,Papers
