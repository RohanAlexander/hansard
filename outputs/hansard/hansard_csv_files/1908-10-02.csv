But the method adopted on by honourable members. It is hardly necessary to explain the motion, as last night I made a brief statement of the procedure which the House is being asked to adopt. Honourable members will be asked to make nominations of sites immediately the motion is agreed to. Anv member may nominate a site, but to be valid the nomination must be supported by at least five honofable members, and the nomination is to be made without debate. The ballot is not to take place until next Wednesday, which should give ample opportunity for the investigation of the matter, and for honourable members to make up their minds. It is proposed to then take an exhaustive ballot without further debate, in accordance with the procedure adopted on the last occasion when we dealt with this matter. vote early and often. to prevent a member from voting for more than one site. vote in the ballot, one site will be eliminated, and, therefore, honourable members must be free to move their support from one site to another as the ballot progresses. [28] has on that ballot. and the House has already acted on that principle acted upon is' one ballot at a time the last occasion was by no means satisfactory. The Minister proposes now, as then, to proceed by the process of elimination j and that, in my judgment, is not by any means an exhaustive ballot. I should like to see some alteration in the method on this occasion. I would point out the distinction between obtaining a majority of votes by the process of elimination, and obtaining a majority by actual votes cast for any site on its merits. On the last occasion many honourable members voted for Dalgety when they had no other choice, except one which was regarded as worsein other words their vote for Dalgety was cast on the principle of choosing the less of two evils. I do not think that any vote thus cast can be said to represent the mature and deliberate opinion of the House. My idea is that before a vote can be regarded as decisive, the site which There is nothing by this process of elimination is found to have a majority ought again to be pitted against every other site, and beat it singly by a deliberate vote-onl y so can we obtain the opinion of the House. I had at first thought of the preferential vote as applied to a proposal of this k in d ; but further consideration has convinced me that 1",12,Selection Op Sites

32,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"the preferential vote can be readily manipulated so as to make it absolutely a plumping vote, and I take it that that is a method we desire to avoid. For instance, suppose we proceed by the preferential methoda member, who believes in Dalgety site, might vote for it as No. i , and for a number of other sites which may have no possible chance. In other words, the member could throw two, three, four, or five votes away, and thus give a plump vote for Dalgety. So that what is regarded as a preferential vote is very often a sham preferential vote, being, in reality, and in its essence and effect, a plump vote for fhe particular site favoured. I , therefore, think that if we desire to plump for a site, we had better finally have a single vote for or against a particular site. explain what will be the effect, when we come to the final vote in the way suggested ? casion Lyndhurst secured the' highest number of votes on the first ballot; and if we may judge of a vote as indicating the preference of honourable members, that most nearly represented their preference. But, after the first ballot on that occasion, we found honourable members voting, not on the merits of a site-no t because they believed it to be the best possible site, but because they hoped and believed it would beat some other site which they desired to see eliminated. I do not object to that method until we reach the stage we reached on the last occasion. To put a concrete case-if we proceed as before, and Dalgety is finally left in as receiving ostensibly a majority vote of the House, before Dalgety becomes the final choice, it ought to be pitted against Tumut, Lyndhurst, Canberra, and so on, in a single vote and beat each site in turn. finality. way of getting finality. the other sites in a straight out division. a blank. ficulty, and would like to suggest a way out of it.

I believe that finally the good sense of the House will extricate us from any difficulty; at any rate, it will be time to deal with the problem when we are face to face with it, but I think that the House will meet the position fairly and reasonably. That is the only criticism I ' have to make 'on the otherwise admirable proposals of the Government. have read the motion very carefully, and I. see no objection to the method proposed. I observe, however, that Wednesday next is fixed as the day on which the vote shall be taken: and I point out that a number of honourable members are already away and have made such arrangements that they cannot be in their places on that day.

It has been done before, and will be done again. My advice to the Government is to go on and get the business finished. The honourable member for Riverina said that many honourable members would not be present, but that will not be the fault of the Government or of the House. Any honourable member who accepts the responsibility of representing a constituency should be faithful to his trust; but that is the business of himself and his constituents.

I am sorry the Government did not propose a system of preferential or alternative voting. That seems to be the only method that would give anything like certainty as to the choice of honourable members. The Government propose to follow the method of voting adopted in 1903, but it is a rather curious reflection upon the perfection of that system that the site which got no votes at first eventually was determined on for the Federal Capital. Dalgety got absolutely no votes on the first ballot in October, 1903, and Tumut, which eventually got thirtysix, came out with only fourteen. That is an absolute condemnation of this system. It may happen-and the records prove itthat the site which is actually at the bottom of the list, and which is therefore under this resolution eliminated, may be the second choice of nearly all the members. One member may prefer a particular' site which is not the choice of one-fifth of the members of the House, and under this system he gives his only vote to it ; but if he had also to select another to indicate his general choice as against every other site except number one, he might select the very site which, being at the bottom of the list, would be cut out. That is not a proper system by which to test the feeling of the House. Not only is there that possibility as a matter of reasoning, but it has actually occurred in previous balloting. What objection can there be to allowing an honourable member to say, "" My first choice is Dalgety, my second Tumut? By that means we could at once see what the second choice of all the members really was. It may be at once shown, as I believe would have been the case in the previous instance, that Dalgety comes out as the second choice. manipulated ? speak with some knowledge of that subject, because I put forward a motion for six years in succession in the South Australian House of Assembly in favour of proportional representation. I looked carefully into them, but could not see much in the objections urged against it. It is said that the system has worked badly in the West, but any system may work badly if people do not vote. That is no reflection upon the perfection of the system itself. If , in the West, the electors do not exercise their second choice in some cases, it simply means that' they decline to make use of a good instrument. I believe they have not the best system of proportional representation in that State. WhatI advocate in this case is the preferential vote, giving an alternative choice. it. for Robertson will temporarily withdraw his amendment, I am prepared to move in that direction.

Every year the Australian Natives' Associations throughout Australia adopt the method after having tried all other systems; and they find that in the election of directors and officers generally, it gives the most satisfaction; it is, in my opinion, just such a system as we should adopt on the present occasion. expensive; and, therefore, I -There should be no difficulty in arriving at a decision; and the Government plan I agree with the honourable member is, I think, all right up to a certain point.

Why should not a reasonable opportunity be given of considering those sites which have already been before previous Houses, without endeavouring to make nominations more difficult by requiring a certain apparent support for each f The honourable member for Angas proposes a new method of preferential voting. Although its advocates claim that it will simplify the procedure, and that we shall arrive more closely at the real mind of the House, I believe that if it is adopted it will make confusion worse confounded. It is objectionable in that it is a departure from the method which honourable members have been accustomed to follow; but that drawback could be overcome if the plan had superior features. My experience of it, however, is that one of its results is the remarkable surprise that it sometimes produces. It often happens that the least eligible site or candicame to be pitted against one another, thedate is selected. win. conditions of preferential voting Lyndhurst could not possibly hope to win, because in every vote that took place previously it stood of two members who had previously supat the head of the primary voting. It often happens, in a preferential ballot, when a strong site like Lyndhurst is put forward, that all those who fear it, but who are at sixes aiid sevens amongst themselves, consolidate their votes to knock it out. The result often is that in the end the rhost objectionable site secures the number of secondary votes necessary to put it in the first place, and becomes the choice. The same result has been attained on many other occasions by the preferential system, and I do not want to see it repeated here. That system, if adopted, will make confusion worse confounded, and cause greater dissatisfaction than exists at present. The only dissatisfaction arising from the mode previously adopted was that it happened in the previous House that no one site had an absolute majority. If any site had commanded an absolute majority the matter would have been settled; but the House has been divided into three battalions, which are numerically fairly equal. That hascaused a certain amount of dissatisfaction, as I say; but it has also had the effect of insuring that the three sites that had the greatest number of primary votes, and tliat, therefore, commanded the largest measure of support, have come up for final consideration at the hands of the House. The system adopted by the Minister is that of the secondary ballot. He proposes, as was clone before-,, that those sites which command the least number of primary votes, and, therefore, are regarded as least likely to meet the requirements of the Capital, should be eliminated in the earlier ballots, and thenhonorable members come fresh to consider the other sites, not theoretically, but practically, and on their actual merits. Thefinal result is that the two sites left in arepitted against one another. That has. takenplace on two previous occasions. On the first occasion the three sites that remained' after a number of ballots were taken wereLyndhurst, Tumut, and Bombala, which is almost equivalent to Dalgety. The result of the secondary ballot was that Bombala was defeated. When Lyndhurst and Tumutr supporters of Bombala voted for Tumut as against Lyndhurst, and Tumut obtained a substantial majority. On the second occasion, a similar position was reached. On the final ballot Tumut was struck out, and the Treasurer informed the House that that came about by the unavoidable absence ported it. the honourable member suggest? secondary ballot. everv site until there is an absolute majority. No site should be eliminated until 1 an absolute majority is obtained. showing how a majority was brought about by the elimination of the site which waslast on the list. On the second occasion, when Tumut was struck out. Dalgety remained to be matched against Lyndhurst.

But those who supported Dalgety wanted to arrive at finality, and they, with others, decided to vote against creating a blank. In the division, the only Lyndhurst supporters who voted for creating a blank were the honourable member for Darling and myself. All the other supporters of Lyndhurst voted against creating a blank, and prior to that .the leader of the Opposition stated that he was prepared to abide by the result of the ballot, and consequently to accept Dalgety as being the preference of the House. That is how Dalgety was retained in the Bill that was passed for the purpose of opening up negotiations with the State Government. There is no need to go into the history of that part of the business now, but what I 'have stated shows the different movements that have taken place with respect to the selection of a site. There is no possibility .of avoiding a certain amount of dissatisfaction where the House is almost equally -divided on the merits of three sites. That happened previously, and seems likely to happen again. The only way in which -something like general satisfaction can be secured is by adopting the Minister's proposal for a secondary ballot. The amendment of the honourable member for Angas, 'if adopted, will alter the procedure that we 'have been used to, create an entirely new position, and probably cause greater dissatisfaction than obtains at present, by ""bringing about the selection, on secondary votes, of a site that commands the least primary votes.

We have been told that the selection of Dalgety was an accident. Such an If that had been carried, it accident may happen again, and if it does, what we are proposing to do now will have to be done all over again, because of the dissatisfaction which will be created throughout the community.

My suggestion is that no site which has not been reported on and recommended shall be nominated. would exclude sites which have not been seen? those sites which have been reported on and recommended be eligible for nomination.

AndI ask the honourable member whether he availed himself of any of these opportunities. sites reported on by capable expert men, because I attached greater importance to that than to a personal inspection. honourable member wishes for further opportunity for inspection. members who so desire. the honourable member himself prefers to rely on the reports of expert officers. There have been reports produced^ byCommissioners at much trouble and expense; and I point out to the honourable member, who says he attaches such importance to the opinions of experts, that those Commissioners placed Dalgety at the bottom ot the list. the top, and that i's the site I desire. Mr DUiGALD THOMSON -The honourable member supported Dalgety. that every opportunity has been given both for inspection by honourable members and reports by Commissioners, and to suggest any further delay, when advantage does not seem to have been taken of opportunities afforded in the past, is, I think, quite unreasonable. an opportunity. tunities have been presented this Parliament if those new members had cared to avail themselves of them, because I I am glad to hear it . am quite sure that the Government would have afforded every facility. We all desire to adopt an honest method of arriving at a conclusion. While some objections can be taken to either of the methods suggested, I think the one proposed by the Government has proved in the past one which will enable us to arrive at an honest and effective decision. There is the one difficulty, I admit, that, when there are only three or four sites left, a site ma^ be selected which does not represent the opinion of the larger number of voters. Let us suppose, for instance, that there, are four sites, and that Well!, there has been no site A obtains twelve votes, B obtains twenty-two votes, C obtains twenty votes, and D obtains twenty votes. According to the method proposed, A drops out, and the twelve votes are divided, four being given, say, to B, three to C, and five to D , leaving B with twenty-six votes, 1 preferred to have the C with twenty-three votes, and D with twenty-five votes; and, therefore, B wins. But it may be that those who gave the five votes allotted' to D might have desired, had they known D would not be selected, to give their votes to C ; and if that had been done C would have had twenty-eight against twenty-six votes for B. I dare say that, when the number of sites had been reduced to four, the proposal of the honourable member for Angas might operate beneficially; but there is the other method suggested by the honourable .member for Robertson of, with a knowledge of the facts, allowing the five votes, which, were given to D , to be distributed; that is to say, B and C could be pitted against each other, and then the votes would arrange themselves according to the But they placed Albury at desire of the voters. To my mind, it would be sufficient to apply the preferential vote to the last four sites left in ; and the honourable member for Robertson proposes nothing more than can be done at a later I think stage under the B ill . I do not object to any method, so long as it cannot be used dishonestly. The danger of the preferential vote is that at the start second votes may be deliberately thrown away on sites which have no chance. tive of taking a vote on every si^e-until an absolute majority is obtained for one. practically the proposal .of the Government, two sites being left at the last. for Robertson suggests that the whole of",24,Selection Op Sites

Where is the difference between the methods? The proposal of the honourable member for Robertson may assist to get over the difficulty. The trouble about preferential voting is that sites may be nominated which have no chance, and on which second votes may be thrown away. That cannot be done so easily in a big election throughout a State, although it is done to some extent; but it is easy where, as should be given for inspecting all the sites. in the present case, there is a limited numIt is worth noting that thosehonorable ber of sites, and a limited number of voters. members voted last night for the amendment to throw away his vote on his second choice, seeing that it could not operate until he had consideration of this question were deferred. lost his first? that when the number of sites is reduced to three or four it becomes dangerous to throw away one's second vote throw away one's second vote. ing so some honourable members could throw out the strongest competitor against the site ballot, to my mind, is fairer than the prewhich they favoured, they would secure the selection of their first choice. votes.

I want to point out to the Minister that the proposal made by the honourable member for Robertson would get fid of the objection to which I have referred. If the contention of the Minister is that it might lead to a deadlock, I would reply that a deadlock might occur in the Committee stage of the Bill itself. I see no objection to the honourable member for Robertson's amendment. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [12.44] Although the honourable member for Kooyong has declared that he desires a confirmative vote, I am inclined to think from his remarks that what he really wants is a ""put-ofEtive'' vote. We are beginning now to find out what is the milk in the cocoanut so far as some honourable members are concerned. The honourable member for Kooyong desires the settlement of this question to be deferred for two months, whilst the honourable member for Fremantle and the honourable member for Indi also plead for delay, the honourable member for Fremantle urging that further opportunityon the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I do not think that any of them would, visit the suggested sites, even if the furtherThey have had ample opportunity to do so, and I am confident that the honourable member for Kooyong would not avail himself of any further opportunity. As to the method of voting, it appears to me that whatever system is selected the ingenuity of honourable members will enable them to devise a wav to cast dishonest votes if they wish to do so. The exhaustive ferential system. Preferential voting would enable honourable members to play off one site against another-to vote for a weak site in order to advantage or improve the position of another which they favoured. If honourable members could be relied upon to honestly give their first votes for the site that they desired to be chosen, and their secondary votes for that which they next favoured, the preferential system would work fairly.

206,Mr Dugald Thomson,"I amgenuity of honourable members would enable them to devise a means of bringing about a result that was not intended. The Government proposal is about as fair a one as we could have, and, consequently, 1 propose to support it. It was adopted after considerable inquiry and debate when this question was last voted upon. sions. Mr J. H . CATTS -Afte r a lengthy debate as to the fairest method of arriving at a decision. I am forced to draw the conclusion from the fact that such a keen debate has again taken place on the method of voting to be adopted that there must be a desire on the part of some honourable members to find a method by which some site other than that which has a majority behind it will come out on top. The views expressed by the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for Fremantle, and some of the representatives of Victoria satisfy me that they have no real desire to have this question settled. Even if we postponed its further consideration for two or three months, what guarantee should we have that it would be finally dealt with within the next four years? We do not know what will happen within the next six months. The Government proposals have stood the test of debate in this House on two previous occasions, and I think they might fairly be accepted as the most reasonable system to adopt in order that the site which has a majority of honourable members behind it may come out as the choice of Parliament in the final sol ing to this debate I am reminded of the difficulty we have sometimes in settling a very simple matter. It is good that there should be some diversity of opinion on subjects coming before us, but sometimes' we have rather too great a variety, and business would be expedited if we could secure a greater measure of uniformity. On. a previous occasion we had a very long debate on the subject, and experts were busily engaged in attempting to evolve an almost perfect system of voting. We then had honourable members, some of whom I regret to say are not now with us, expending a great deal of time and energy on an effort to discover the very best method of voting on this question. The debate on that occasion was to me both interesting and instructive, and I followed it very carefully. Honourable members like myself who listened to it will agree that the decision we arrived at, after a very exhaustive discussion, to adopt a method similar to that now proposed by the Government, was in accordance with the evidence then before us. It was found that some of these fancy systems of voting would not operate so well in practice as in theorya .trouble that very frequently afflicts the affairs of humanity. The system now proposed by the Government, while opento objection, .seems to me to be the very best by which we can arrive at an honest decision. I admit that there are one or two difficulties, but the objection to the other suggested systems is that they lend themselves to methods that I should not like to designate as trickery, but which amount to a process of overreaching with the object of bringing about a selection contrary to the views of the majority. If honourable members would record their honest preferences, the preferential system would perhaps be the best; but I agree with other honourable members who have .pointed out that the system lends itself very peculiarly to an effort to put the most dangerous competitors altogether out of their due relation, as a matter of preference. Such a system is liable to misuse. In connection with a question of this kind, on which honourable members have the strongest opinions-anc l honest opinionsthey will use every legitimate means to achieve the object they .have in view. That being so, and whilst I am perfectly willing-to give honourable members an opportunity to record their preferences in a t J 01*1 fair and aboveboard manner, I think that it would be wise to put beyond them the temptation to record a vote on the second and following choices that would not exactly indicate their true preferences, but would materially assist the cause of the site they have really at heart. I want the vote to be as honest and straightforward as possible, and I see no reason to forsake the Government proposal for anything that, so far as my judgment goes, would be worse. The Government proposal may not be perfect, but I think it is one by which we shall be best able to obtain something like a representative decision. [ -55]--On e of the candidates in the i l I2 lustration given by the honourable member for North Sydney dropped out with' twelve primary votes, which were then divided amongst the others. It is, however, quite possible, that that individual",26,Selection Op Sites

Of course, iti any new electoral system, one must expect defects, but I have always objected to the elimination of the last candidate on the list, because cases have been known where, if secondary votes could have been taken into account, he would have been elected. I am rather inclined to support the preferagainst Tooma my ballot paper would also ential system moved by the honourable member for Angas but for the. fact that if six sites were submitted it would be necessary to take twenty-five divisions be the votes by Lyndhurst, I would have my fore tlie matter was decided. That, with perhaps discussions in between the divisions, would take a very long time. Tbe. honourable member for Parramatta put the case very forcibly and I am rather inclined voting paper every honourable member could to agree with him. Supposing Lyndhurst, Canberra, and Dalgety are submitted, while I support DalgetyI do not wish to see Lyndhurst selected in any circumstances. If it came to a vote between Lyndhurst and Dalgety, and Dalgety were beaten, I , failing Dalgety, would support Canberra, and if Canberra could be reintroduced into the ballot it might aftereasily be knocked out. It is alleged now wards beat Lyndhurst. I believe that a system of preferential voting could be deoccasion was an accident. We are also told vised whereby in one division each honourable member's preference for every site could be shown. At the least six sites' Lyndhurst, Dalgety, Armidale; Tumut, Canberra, and perhaps Tooma-wil l probablv be nominated. If , in the final ballot under the system proposed by the Attorney-'General, Lyndhurst beat Dalgety, then in fairness Lyndhurst ought to stand against Tooma, Armidale, Tumut, and Canberra in turn to see if it could beat them. If , when Lyndhuist was matched against Canberra, Canberra happened to win, then Canberra in its turn ought also to meet every other site. Sitting suspended from I to 2.15 f ward a suggestion under which, by one vote alone, we could settle the preference of every site proposed. I assume that the six sites I have already named are nominated. I would put them on the voting paper, numbering them one to six, from top to bottom. I would place the same names at the top so as to make six columns. member would indicate by his vote his preference for each site as against each of the others, and that preference could be seen at a glance. For instance, as between Armidale andLyndhurst, I should, when voting, express my preference for Armidale. Theni f Armidale knocked Lyndhurst out and the question'of Armidale against Dalgety were raised, following down the ballot. paper it would be seen that I preferred Dalgety to Armidale. Theni f Dalgety were pitted show that I preferred Dalgety, and similarly with Tumut and Canberra. If Dalgety were knocked out in the counting of chance again. Lyndhurst would be pitted against Canberra, and my voting paper would show that I preferred Canberra. Therefore, by marking this one preferential express his true opinion as regarded each site compared with each other. Consequently, if there were six candidates we should take only one vote instead of twenty-five. I do not care for the exhaustive ballot system, because under it a site that might be acceptable to honourable members could that the selection of Dalgety on a previous horrible tales about that site, but I think they are misstatements of facts. We are assured that Dalgety was only selected as the less of two evils, and that if , at the final stage, it could have been pitted against Tumut, Tumut might have won. If a preferential ballot paper on the lines ' of the diagram I have explained had been used, it could have been examined to show which site honourable members preferred as between Tumut and Dalgety. The more sites were submitted the greater would be the necessity for adopting the course which I now advocate. If , say, twelve sites were nominated, it would be necessary to take about 120 divim sions under any other system, whereas one vote would suffice under my system. I object to the method proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, because while "" D "" in his illustration, which received twenty primary votes, was eliminated, it is quite possible that it might have been the secondary choice of many honourable members in preference to another site. That is not a good system. It means Each honourable losing one site which meets with misfortune at the start. It is said that Dalgety did not command a vote at the beginning of the ballot on the last occasion, and yet it was eventually selected. Eveni f the method",27,Selection Op Sites
210,Mr Mathews,"I wish to put forproposed by the Minister is followed the site which wins ought to beat every other site proposed before it becomes the choice of the House. If it fails to do that, the one that beats it ought also to be called upon to beat all the others in turn. How many divisions would have to be taken to get finality by that method? My proposal is a simple way of arriving at the true preferential choice of honourable members by one vote, no matter how many sites are nominated. Attorney-General proposes that the House should receive nominations without debate. If that is agreed to, it is doubtful whether an amendment will be permissible. Whatever sites may be nominated, I wish to move as an addition thereto the provision contained in section 3 of the Seat of Government Act 1904,' that "" the territory to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth should contain an area of not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea."" I know that those conditions can be put in the B ill , but I would like to have them attached by the House to its choice, so that the Government would have no option in negotiating with the Government of New South Wales but to insist on their observance. not negotiate with the Government of New South Wales on the choice of the House until the House incorporated it in an Act. we proclaim the essential conditions to the acceptance of any site the better. ready in the Act.

If the motion is carried in anything like its present form, I shall have to invite nominations of sites without any qualifications, but only nominations supported by at least five members will be recorded. sir, for a clear statement of the position. It enables us to see our limitations now rather than later on, when the opportunity of action shall have passed. At the same time, I am not satisfied with the position. As to the difference between the procedure of the Government and that suggested by the honourable member for Angas, I have only to say that if the House thoroughly understood, as he does, the advantages of the preferential system, it would adopt it . That system has more good points than any other, is least liable to be affected by accident, and furnishes slight opportunity for the adoption of certain expedients by those who wish to secure particular results. The Government ask us to proceed forthwith to ballot for a site. Last night, however, the T r u e ; but the sooner plea put forward for a ballot was that there are a large number of new members who have not had an opportunity to express their views on this matter, and therefore it is necessary to review our former decision. But the decision of the If that argument has any validity, we should not proceed to a ballot until they have had an opportunity to inspect the various sites. At present they know of them only by reading, or from conversations with other members who have visited them. It seems to me that the ballot should be deferred for at least six months, to give new members an opportunity to visit, and make themselves acquainted with, the sites.

Such an amendment is unjust to the State of New South Wales, and will practically result in the loss of all the time previously expended on the question. port the amendment because I think that the House would be wise to postpone this question. In the course of the last sitting, we heard many reasons advanced why we should not proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, one being that the Commonwealth is not in a position to find the necessary money, and that before any further steps are taken, a financial statement should be laid before us. We are now asked by the same members who advance these arguments, to proceed at oncewith the establishment of a bush capital; but I think the time has arrived when the people should have something to say on the matter. There is, ""it appears,, dissatisfaction with the decision of a previous Parliament; and if the question were postponed for a further six months, we should, I think, be in a better position to deal with it.

It was for that reason I fell into the error of describing, in the words to which you, sir, object, the speech I regret having had to listen to. I hope that this House will not stultify itself, after declaring that it desired to proceed to the choice of a site, by now declaring that there should be a delay of six months. Therefore, in the interests of the reputation of the House, I urge honourable members to proceed at once, as we agreed last night, to select the best site for the Capital. quite ominous that the honourable member for Batman should, for the first time in his political career, venture to suggest a course which is seemingly in opposition to the course mapped out by the Government. It is the first time, since the honourable member entered the House, that he has reflected the slightest shade of discord on a Ministerial proposition. I say that that is ominous, because, if the honourable member really believed that the Government were sincere in their professed desire 'to have this matter brought to a conclusion, it is simply inconceivable that he should take up his present position. I feel sure that this honourable and loyal supporter of the political conglomeration on the other side would shrink at the last moment from venturing to make such a speech, if he had not received assurance, either direct or telepathic, from the Administration that postponement is really what they desire to bring about. *' coon '' has bolted up a tree !

Those who are in favour of delaying the matter ought to vote with the honourable member, who has given them a fair and open challenge; and those, on the other hand, who are opposed to delay, are given an opportunity of showing that they are honestly in favour of progress. Therefore, instead of endeavouring for one moment to criticise the course the honourable member has taken, I hail his proposition as one upon which there ought.to be a clear and straightforward division, representing the actual convictions of honourable members on this important question. honourable member for Parkes vote on this question ? honourable member for Parkes is here, and I decline to enter into any conjecture of that kind.
