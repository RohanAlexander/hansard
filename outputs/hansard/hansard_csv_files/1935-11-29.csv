The assertion that there is hectic activity in the industry is quite without foundation.

On principle, the Opposition objects to the use of the guillotine, but i i also objects to the allocation of time set out in the timetable, because honourable members who desired to contribute to the debate on this bill can have no reasonable expectation of being able to do so. A debate on the general principles of repatriation will be impossible in the short space of time allotted for the second reading. introducing the bill, the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) himself initiated such a general debate. He reviewed the history of the repatriation of Australian soldiers, a question which involves consideration of a wide field of important subjects. Indeed, he made debate on the general features of Australia's repatriation system a notable part of his speech, and quite apart from the discussion of the general provisions of the bill, hi3 action in so doing surely demands Lazzarini, H .

The Minister has no right to make such an interjection. My remarks are directed against the placing of a time limit on the consideration of bills generally ; but I say, in regard to this measure, which is to be guillotined, that, if it is of the importance which the Prime MinisIn ter claims for it, the time allowed for debating it is hopelessly inadequate. A fair and just approach to the question of the proposed limitation of time must lead to the conclusion that honourable members are entitled to more consideration than is to be extended to them by the motion proposed. All honourable members are anxious to assist the passage of a measure which provides benefits for men who are badly in need of them, but they",14,Declaration Or Urgency

48,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [11.9].,"should have adequate time for a complete consideration of the bill. In any case, this bill is largely one for discussion in committee, yet the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) embarked upon a general debate as to repatriation questions, touching upon many points upon which honourable members would appreciate an opportunity to express opinions. The three and a half hours to be allowed for the second reading will permit only four honourable members to deliver speeches if they occupy the full time to which they are entitled by the Standing Orders. No one would claim that it is a reasonable amount of time for the consideration of the momentous questions contained in the bill. To many honourable members, who have an intimate knowledge of the working of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, opportunity is rarely provided for the discussion of specific cases, save when amendments of the law are proposed. They would have had such an opportunity on this bill but for the application of the guillotine. The time limit of three and a half hours for the second reading will enable one speech to be made from the official. Opposition, one from this corner of the House, and one from each of the two Government parties. The Government has adopted a most unreasonable attitude in regard to the second-reading stage, but the allotment of time for the committee stage reflects an even worse attitude. Opposition ( Mr Ourtin) has already referred to the fact that clauses from 1 to 18 must be completed within an hour. Altogether only 3$ liours will be given to honourable members for the consideration of the clauses in committee. that just? Honourable members, I think, generally have given considerable time and thought to the bill; many of them have already discussed with interested organizations the various aspects of the proposed legislation, and if sufficient time were allowed for the consideration of the bill in committee, they could make many valuable suggestions for a further improvement of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. Government could not accept those suggestions at the moment, they would provide a basis for later consideration by officers of the Repatriation DepartMr lieaslcp. ment, and possibly for further amendments recommended by those officers to give effect to the ideas advanced by honourable members. I concede the anxiety of the Government to have the bill passed as quickly as possible, but I submit that before taking action to apply the guillotine, it should have consulted with the various parties in this House as to the amount of time that should be necessary for it to be passed. The Government apparently is anxious to complete its business next week but, if its attitude is that the guillotine is necessary to do it, a better schedule of times should have been introduced to enable the committee's consideration of this bill to be spread over a longer period. An emphatic protest against the course which is proposed to be pursued is warranted. The most remarkable aspect of the proposal for curtailment of the debate on this bill is that, in moving his motion, the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) failed to advance one reason in support of it. The Government has refrained from an endeavour to justify its attitude. I doubt whether the element of time enters the question. The bill will introduce a number of additional pensions and pensioners, and will bring about considerable alteration of the rates of pension at present operating. In the opening up of a new avenue through which additional pensioners will be created and through The Leader of the which considerable alteration will be made in the status of old pensioners, complete consideration of the project is essential. But when introducing this bill the Government did not say "" We want it to be passed to-day or by to-morrow."" Is Yet, now the Government declares that in something like seven hours, this measure with all its imperfections must be gagged through to give a measure of justice to returned soldiers who have been waiting for it for seventeen years. The allotment of time is the question. because of the delay that hitherto Even if the has taken place, I fail to see the reason for the haste which the Government now pretends. Rush legislation is a bad policy. Only this week we have had evidence of legislation",15,Allotment On Time

50,Mr Speaker (Hon. G. J. Bell),,16,Allotment On Time
51,Mr Rosevear,"That is so, butgoing through this House with the Minister defects been discovered by another place. Yet, this bill, we are to be told that we are delaying the House. Let me illustrate what I mean. When Sir Neville Howse was Minister for Repatriation, he gave a verbal assurance, in submitting a bill of this nature, that ex-soldiers suffering from tuberculosis would receive certain benefits under the measure; but the intention of the Government had not been properly expressed in the bill. year, when we were dealing with a similar measure, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) quoted extensively from the speech made by Sir Neville Howse on the previous bill, and said he hoped that on that occasion the measure made provision for the benefits which Sir Neville Howse had thought the other bill conferred. Those benefits are still not included. As the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) remarked, many honourable members have a close knowledge of the difficulties of returned soldiers, and of the weaknesses of the Repatriation Act, and they would like an opportunity to point out to the Government how causes of hardship could be removed. Of course, the argument will be advanced that this is an urgent measure, and that the guillotine should be applied. Shortly before last Christmas, when, the Unemployment Relief Bill was under consideration, the House was asked to pass the measure expeditiously, so that there would be no delay in granting relief to those who were out of work; but, three months after Christmas, half of the money voted had not been expended. member has exhausted his time. sure that every honourable member regrets the necessity for the limitation of the debate on this bill, but we all realize the proposal is justified. A number of honourable members consider it to be their duty to obstruct, even legislation designed to benefit certain sections of the community, and for this purpose they make speeches of a particular kind. which subsequently have object of this bill, honourable members generally should not unnecessarily proi f we attempt to examine long the discussion. A considerable amount of the time of the House has been spent through certain honourable members opposite calling for quorums. This indicates a peculiar attitude on the part of those members. the attitude of honourable members on other questions are not in order in discussing the matter before the Chair. necessity for limitation of the debate by indicating that during the last few weeks, certain forms of the House have been used to such an extent that business has been delayed. I realize, of course, that the Opposition frequently regards it as its legitimate function to prevent, as far as possible, certain legislation from being given effect. I have frequently refrained from speaking in order to allow measures to be passed without delay. Mr 'SPEAKER -The honourable member has exhausted his time. -Honorabl e members generally will recognize that, in a House whose members sit^ far from their homes, some limitation of debate is necessary. It is better to allot the time available for discussion of measures by means of the guillotine than by the fortuitous and unplanned method of the closure. But uo time-table should be proposed without consultation with the leaders and representatives of other parties. The great objection to the use of the guillotine is that an unfair plan of time-rationing may be forced upon the House by a government majority. That objection, which is a real one, would be disposed of if the leaders of other parties in the House were consulted by the Government before the plan was proposed. Obviously, a better scheme than that now suggested could be arranged. This is pre-eminently a measure for consideration in committee, and it would be much better if the major part of the time available were devoted to its discussion in committee. I understand that Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) was quite prepared to agree to such a proposal, which would have been",16,Allotment On Time

58,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [11.21].,"generally welcomed on this side of the House, but I believe that the suggestion has been rejected. Had there been a prior consultation, the Leader of the Opposition would probably have made that suggestion, and no doubt the Government would have entertained favourably; but, as the Government has now committed itself to a time-table, it is unwilling to alter its determination. One of the great needs of this House is more harmonious working of the Standing Orders by the general consent of members. The standing order providing for the application of the guillotine is absolutely necessary, for, without it, the work of this Parliament could not be done; but a time-table proposed by the Government without tion with the representatives of other parties, is regarded by honourable members on this side as an instrument of oppression. for Commerce) [11.25] I am gratified at the manner in which the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) has approached this question, for the Government has submitted its proposal, not as an instrument of oppression, but because it believes it to be the most satisbut if the speakers used the full time perfactory way of dealing with the business of the House.' In every parliament, no matter which party is in power, a great rush is experienced at the end of each session, and two methods of expediting the business to be transacted are open to the Government. One is that of producing physical and mental exhaustion by resorting to all-night sittings, and the other is that of providing for the allotment of the time available for debate. Personally, I am opposed to all-night sittings, because of the physical and mental exhaustion that inevitably accompanies them, and I believe that a wise use of the guillotine is the right plan to adopt. The Government would, I think, give careful consideration to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Bourke that a consultation should take place with the leaders of the other parties as to the allotment of time in regard to future measures. It seems to me that some modification of the Standing Orders should be made, so that, when a proposal is brought down for the application of the guillotine, the time allotted to individual members for discussion of the motion should be strictly limited, by which means a larger number would have an opportunity to talk. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) menit tioned this matter in his speech, and I think it might well be pursued during the coming recess, in order to ascertain whether the Standing Orders could be altered in this respect by general agreement. I believe that the proper way to apply the guillotine is to operate it at the very beginning of the session, and not merely at the end. This would be to the advantage of honourable members generally, and a better opportunity would be presented to ensure that the measures consultasubmitted expressed the will of the Parliament. I object to the proposed allotment of time on the ground that it does not allow siifficient opportunity for the discussion of this measure. The period of six and three-quarter hours is too short for the complete disposal of a bill consisting of 14 pages and 27 clauses. The Government has arbitrarily allotted three and s half hours for the second reading debate; mitted them, there could be only four speeches. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) dealt with repatriation activities from the conclusion of the war until the present time, and, as honourable members have pointed out, delivered an electioneering speech. cannot be substantiated. because of the application of the guillo-, tine, it will not be possible to reply to them. If governments are permitted to abuse parliamentary privileges in order to put out election placards, and to gag the opposition so that it cannot reply to their assertions, parliamentary government will become a farce, or something worse. One hour is proposed to be allotted for ' the consideration in committee of clauses 1 to 18, which occupy three pages of the bill; but to one clause, one and three-quarter hours is to be devoted. Although this may be the only important clause, from the Government's point of view, some honourable members",17,Allotment On Time

62,Mr Lazzarini,"That is true, and,may consider that other clauses need amendment, -and much more lengthy consideration than will be possible under the present proposal. For years past, honourable members have been asking that something be done for tubercular soldiers, and they have been put off with various promises, Now, right at the end of the session, the Government has brought down a bill ostensibly to confer certain pension benefits upon soldiers of this class, but in reality it gives practically nothing. The soldiers have been waiting for something much more than this. The real reason for the application of the guillotine is to prevent criticism, to stop honourable members from pointing out that the bill really confers no adequate benefits. ringah-Minister for Defence) [11.32]. -The Government is adopting a reasonable course of action in regard to this bill, and it would not be. practicable to do what has been suggested by the honorburn). It is the custom in all parliaments for the Opposition to oppose the guillotine whenever it is applied. A stranger listening to speeches of honourable members opposite, with their simulated indignation, would be astonished if he returned an hour later, and observed the general contentment on the faces of honourable members of the Opposition because the debate was proceeding on calm and organized lines.

66,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [11.40],"I desire to make some observation upon the significant narrative to which the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) treated the House regarding the working of the Repatriation Act. The Prime Minister's speech is a terrible revelation of the consequences of war. It proves conclusively how high is the cost, not only in money, but also in human wreckage, and how difficult it is for Parliament, which has the responsibility for making provision for victims of war, ever to come to a period when it can be said that that responsibility has ended. The Prime Minister stated that Austiaiia had already spent £130,000,000 on war pensions. To that I add that Australia has also spent £274,000,000 on interest on wai loans. Last year, said the Prime Minister, Australia spent £7,360,000 on war pensions, but I point out that the sinking fund charges on the war debt have aggregated a total of £40,000,000. That is the money side of it. As for the pain and suffering, the mental distress and the nervous consequences of waT, it is difficult for any one to paint a complete picture. It is a fact, however, that, at the present time, 1,600 soldiers are inpatients in hospitals seventeen years after the signing of the armistice. In addition, 17,000 former soldiers are out-patients at repatriation and other hospitals. However, the havoc wrought by war upon those who take part in it cannot be properly understood by a mere citation of statistics. This bill proposes to extend pension benefits to returned soldiers, and the additional benefits may be summarized under four headings. The extra expenditure involved will total £350,000. The first class of new claimants created by the bill are soldiers suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, who will be entitled to receive a pension aud treatment at repatriation hospitals. In the past, soldiers suffering from tuberculosis, who could not satisfy the medical authorities that their condition was due to war service, were denied a pension. Now, the fact that they suffer from the disease is to be regarded as sufficient grounds for a pension. It is estimated that this will cost an extra £126,000. It is also proposed to make eligible for pensions soldiers who are over 60 years of age and former Mr Ourtin. nurses who have reached the age. of 55 years, and who served in a theatre of war, provided it is held that the hardships they endured have caused premature old age. It is also proposed to grant pensions to ex-soldiers under the age of 60 if, as a result of their war service, they have become permanently unemployable. The cost of these concessions is estimated at £134,000. This bill embodies a most important principle, namely, that ex-soldiers, regardless of what specific diseases they may be suffering from, but because of chronic debility which renders them permanently unemployable, are to be regarded as eligible for pensions. I think that is a far-reaching provision. I entirely agree with it, but I do not think I overstep the mark when I intimate to the Parliament that similar provisions in respect of civilians will inevitably become an obligation upon this Parliament. HeTe we accept the principle that service to the nation in war which produces physical or mental consequences occasioning the inability of a man to work at all constitutes a claim upon the nation, and the provision now being made for soldiers will, I have no doubt, in the fullness of time, be also made a feature of our invalid pensions legislation. Mr ""WHITB -That is provided for in the invalid pensions legislation now. tinction between ""permanently unemployable "" and ""permanently incapacitated "" which should be obvious. I mention it not that I object to the provision included in this amending bill, but that it must be accepted with all its social implications. The third category of claimants includes those whose pensions were commuted by lump sum payments but who since the commutation was made, have developed maladies which at that time were not observable. The cost of this concession is estimated to be £60,000. Lastly, it is proposed to liberalize the basis of pensions paid to aged parents and other dependants; the cost of this concession being estimated at £30,000. A total annual cost of £350,000 is involved. I presume the Prime Minister is justified in accepting my suggestion that that cost would be found to increase",19,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Mittee The Honourable Gentleman How
67,. Mr Curtin,"There is a vast disas time goes on. The cost in the past, now, and in prospect has to be met. In fact, all the costs of human wreckage, and proper salvage in respect of soldiers may be said, so far, not to have been fully met. In this connection I think it is only just to direct attention to the very prolonged and able activities of two former members of this Parliament, one since deceased, and the other still, fortunately, in the land of the living, the man) and Adelaide( Mr Yates), each of whom played an influential part in connection with the claims of tubercular soldiers, and on many occasions attempted to induce this Parliament to come to their aid. I feel I am warranted in saying, too, that from the viewpoint of the budget, having regard to the number of opportunities 'which the Government has had during the last three years to find this sum of £350,000, it failed to do so, and not until the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) became a member of the Cabinet was definite action taken in this connection. I agree with the Prime Minister that it is regrettable and certainly inappropriate that the presentation of his bill should not have been in the hands of the right honourable member for North Sydney. pension, lodged by soldiers who sincerely believed they had a right to it, have been rejected. When we think of the cost of pensions and of the very great number of pensioners there are, it is well to bear in mind the fact that so many pension claims have been rejected. difficult to be fully satisfied that all those claims have been justifiably rejected. I believe that there have been mistakes in medical diagnoses, and I believe, too, that the burden of proof cast upon the soldier to show that his illness or invalidity is the result of war causes imposes upon him an obligation which it is impossible frequently to satisfy even if originally there could have been no doubt that, but for his association with the forces, he would probably be in better health. Put the other way, ought not the entitlement tribunal be placed in the position of having to prove that the invalidity of the soldier was not due to war service? If that were done, the difficulty cast upon the Repatriation Commission in examining the medical history of soldiers would be just as great as is now the case in connection with the individual's application for a pension; and all the present advantages, if there are any, of the individual, would go to the commission. I believe quite definitely that a large number of these 57,000 rejections have been made, not because the claims ought to be rejected on the facts, but simply because the application of the law to the facts associated with the soldier's service has made it impossible for him to furnish the requisite evidence to show that his present invalidity has arisen from war causes, or has been aggravated by war causes. As these 57,000 rejections have been made in respect of men admitted to the force on the presumption that at the time of enlistment they were physically fit, I find it hard to satisfy myself that they have received justice in the rejection of their claims. This bill could and should have been introduced three years ago, when the financial position of the Government warranted making provision for the necessary expenditure. In fact at any time during the last three years the financial position of this Government would have warOver 57,000 applications for the ranted this expenditure being provided for had there been the will to carry out such a proposal as is now submitted. After the first four months of the financial year 1932-33, when the Government had a surplus of £2,700,000, there were indications of a growing surplus as the year I find it progressed. But the Government did not hypothecate any portion of that money for the purposes set out in this amending bill, which only a few minutes ago it declared to be urgent. If it is urgent now, it is only because its provisions are belated. The Government, as n. matter of fact, in that year did not restore to the dependants of soldiers the reductions which they were called upon to make under the original financial emergency legislation, nor did it in any way attempt to make the lot of the soldier and his dependants easier. The fact is that, in that financial year, property owners were relieved of taxes amounting to £500,000, and land owners were similarly relieved of taxes amounting to>",20,Speaker Hon.

The fact is that any government with a majority in this House, and matter broadly. In a state of financial in another place, which actually desired emergency, all-round sacrifices had to to pass legislation had only to do what be demanded. The Government purthe Government is now doing. I repeat, sued a certain policy, which imposed a that relief from taxation of a direct tax upon some and reduced the pensions character was given, and, in inof others, including those who are covered direct taxation, reductions were made by this legislation. Since then, the burin tariff, primage, excise, &c, aggredens imposed upon the taxpayers have gating £4,000,000. the estimate submitted to us of the year, will approximate about £10,000,000, cost 'of the provisions contained in whereas the returned soldiers, who were the bill now before the House!

Compare this paltry restoration of £248,000 to soldiers' dependants with the it is. I am not saying that taxation ought remissions of taxes to classes able to pay not to have been reduced.

""WereI to do so, my speech would be entirely different. I remind the House that when the late Senator E. D. Millen introduced the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Bill in 1917, he stated that "" the conception of repatriation as a national obligation reveals a new conception of public duty."" I believe that that crystallizes the duty towards the returned soldiers, not only of the Government, but also of the nation. I feel confident that the citizens of Australia did, and do, desire that that duty be discharged adequately and competently while the necessity remains. The provision for repatriation-that is to say, the satisfaction of our public length. duty and our national obligationdefinitely involves the collection of taxes, arrived. which at times may be heavy. Those who are capable of paying taxes must not monwealth, as honourable members will, resent the obligation to pay them, because I think, agree, compares very favourably the duty has been cast upon Australia with that of any of the belligerent counto honour certain obligations to the tries.

The able standard of ordered life, owe to the Bcope of our repatriation scheme is wide, nation a special contribution for the but experience has shown that many advantages they have derived from the deserving cases are not covered by its common inheritance and the virtues of the provisions. The legislation that we are social order. I therefore make no apology now considering is designed to extend the for the imposition of high taxation upon benefits of repatriation to classes that the well-to-do, when the purpose is to are excluded from the operations of the the honourable divert it to the welfare and the betterment of returned soldiers, invalid and old-age pensioners, and any others who, because of their circumstances or their services to Australia, have a claim upon this National Parliament. But I decline to go to the country with the doctrine of the reduction of direct taxation upon the one handand an increase of social services on the other. Direct taxes ought not to have been reduced to the extent that they have been, because our obligations to the returned soldiers and the old-age and indigent have not been fully discharged. I do not say that indirect taxes should not have been reduced. I agree with those reductions. But I see no earthly reason why, in a period of acute national difficulty, with widespread suffering among thousands of our community owing to unemployment and other causes, the taxes imposed upon those who have the ability to pay them should be reduced. I conclude by saying that the Opposition supports the bill in its entirety, and hopes that it will have a speedy passage.

78,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [12.7].,"existing law, to effect certain amendments of the principal act, to restore commuted pensions, to liberalize the provisions for aged dependants and the widows of blinded and totally incapacitated soldiers, and to ensure the smoother working of the machinery of administration. Broadly, the bill does three things: It provides for the payment of what are termed service pensions to ex-soldiers (1) who have served in a theatre of war upon attaining the age of 60 years, and nurses upon attaining the age of 55 years; (2) who are deemed to be permanently unemployable; who are suffering from tuberculosis, whether they served in a theatre of war or not. It is to be noted that the principle running through the Repatriation Act is that pensions are paid only for disabilities found to be due to war service. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has referred to many of the difficulties that experience in establishing the fact that their disabilities do arise from war service, and has suggested that the onus should rest upon the Commission to prove that they do not. Strangely enough, I have advocated the adoption of that principle for very many years. The success which attended my efforts may have been somewhat indifferent, but nevertheless the principle is embodied in the act and applies in certain cases. Whether it should apply all round is not for me to say at this moment. The service pensions under this measure are to be paid for service in a theatre of war, whether the condition of the ex-soldier is due to war service or not. That is the fundamental between a service pension and a war pension. that the pensions payable to ex-soldiers upon attaining the age of 60 years, and those payable to ox-soldiers who are found to be permanently unemployable, will be conditional upon their having served in a theatre of war, as defined; but in the case of men who are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, the pension is to be paid whether they have served in a theatre of war or not. The distinction can be fully justified; but, as the Leader of the OpposiMr Hughes. tion has stated that his party proposes to accept the measure unconditionally, it is not necessary for me to deal with that point. The service pensions have been fixed at 18s. a week for single men, and 30s. a week for married men, with an allowance of 23. 6d. a week for each child up to sixteen years of age. This means that a married man with four children, who is permanently unemployable, or is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, will receive a pension of 40s. a week. As the average pension paid under the principal act to soldiers suffering from a war disability is 19s. 5.7d. a and (3) week, it may be considered that in all the pulmonary circumstances, the amount fixed for the service pension is fair and reasonable. Let me deal very shortly with these matters in detail. It will be quite obvious that the success of this measure must depend very largely on the administration. In. certain cases, very little difficulty will he encountered. An exex-soldiers soldier who . has reached the age of 60 years will have to prove, first that he has served in a theatre of war, and secondly, that he is 60 years of age. Those are questions of fact which can be easily established, and here the commission or the board will have no difficulty whatever. In regard also to a man suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, the commission will find its path smooth. Whether a man suffers from pulmonary tuberculosis or not will be determined by a medical practitioner, and on his certificate a pension will be payable. All the ex-soldier will have to prove is that he was a member of the Australian Imperial Forces, and suffers from pulmonary distinction tuberculosis. I have already pointed out I come now to the provisions dealing with permanently unemployable ex-service men. Here, we are sailing on an uncharted sea. I agree with the Leador of the Opposition that, in this we are taking a step that will have far-reaching consequences. Time precludes my following the provocative argument of the Leader of the Opposition-provocativ e in the sense that arouses a desire to pursue his line of thought-bu t it is obvious that, in dealing with men who claim to be permanently unemployable, we shall not be dealing with facts easily established, such as age or disease. The qualifying condition "" unemployable"" is difficult to define and certainly not easy to establish. of this Parliament, the member Cameron) drew my attention to the condition of certain ex-service men to whom he referred as heing "" prematurely aged"".. I made inquiry into the matter, and, having satisfied myself that action was called for, decided to make such amendments of the act as would cover this unfortunate class of men. The provisions of this bill which relate to permanently unemployable ex-service men, will, it is hoped, give relief to very many ex-soldiers excluded from the benefits of the existing law. In dealing with this subject, guidance from a Canadian measure, hut it cannot be denied that the problem presented by men of this class is extremely difficult. I direct the attention of honourable members to the report of a committee appointed by the Canadian Pensions Department, and in particular to a statement made before that committee by Colonel Amyot to the effect thatTliese men are what have been called burnt out men . . . men who are no longer employable. words to express my ideas, but I frankly If they went up for pension examination, the things from which they are suffering are of intangible character. They arc simply unable to work-the y are old .before their time. Colonel Amyot goes on to say: "" The men who served on our various war-fronts were called to bear a stress and strain greater than can be conceived by civilians. The mental stress was, in some cases, more intense than the physical stress"". The severity of this strain had never been brought home to me so clearly and so terribly as it was by Colonel Amyot's concluding wordsThose of us who were there know that even following along the trench line, when things were comparatively quiet, you might have a reddening on the side from which the bullets came. It seems to us incredible that the mere consciousness of the imminence of death should cause the skin of some men to redden as though it had been drenched in blood. Surely, nothing coidd illustrate more clearly the intensity of the mental stress to which they were subjected. It is not surprising that such men are "" burnt out"", and Shortly after the meeting their efficiency is permanently impaired. honourable They are broken in health and are no for Lilley( Sir Donald longer fit to stand in the front line of the industrial troops. They are, in fact, industrial camp followers. We need not at this moment express our opinionas to the justification of war or our attitude towards war. It is sufficient that the men who served us overseas are suffering to such a degree that they are permanently handicapped in the industrial race. The service pension which it is now proposed to pay these permanently unemployable men will be a great relief to them. It will, in fact, serve a double purpose. It will relieve the men concerned and also the labour market. As to the we obtained considerable men themselves, it will give them great satisfaction and be a stimulus to their self-esteem, to realize that at last the nation is recognizing what it owes to them. Single men of this class will be eligible for a pension as high as 18s. a week, and married men with four children will be entitled to a pension up to 40s. a week. I found it extremely difficult to frame a definition to cover these men. In fact, their circumstances baffle all definition. I suppose I have no less ingenuity than other men in finding confess that I can find no words to express clearly and unambiguously what exactly is meant by "" unemployable"". Each case must be handled sympathetically and with common sense. It is gratifying to mo to know that all the applicants for this pension will be interviewed personally. I was surprised to discover that perhaps the majority of pension cases dealt with by the tribunals of the Repatriation Department were determined on reports, official papers and certificates of one kind and another; but no applicant for this new class of pension will be denied it without a personal interview. be well, but really be very ill . least all applicants will be interviewed.

On the other hand other cases will he most difficult to decide. it has been relieved of the responsibility I was surprised to find that a bed-ridden and helpless ex-soldier in Tasmania, could not get a pension because he was unable to prove that his condition was due to war service. Such cases will now receive a service pension. They ""will present no difficulty, but there are others that will. Many men are suffering from no specific disease, but are just ""burnt out""-ol d before their time. These cases will call for sympathy and the exercise of common sense. Since everything will depend on administrative action, it gives me the greatest satisfaction to know that the administration will be in the hands of men in whom I have every confidence. Single men will be entitled to a service pension of up to 18s. a week, married men without children up to 30s. a week and married men with children to 5s. a fortnight for each child. But in addition to this, a single man in receipt of say, an invalid pension will be able to receive a total income of 30s. 6d. a week without being liable to a reduction of his service pension. An ex-service man and his wife will be entitled to a total income from all sources of 61s. a week before any limitation will be imposed on the service penson. vice man may have accumulated property up to the value of £400 if he is single and £S00 if he is married without exhausting his right to a pension. Taken broadly, this new pensions measure has much to recommend it. It is a definite step forward. tend that it is the final step. no finality in life. But this measure is undoubtedly a forward step. It does something more than extend pensions to classes of individuals at present excluded. muted pensions. many cases returned soldiers commuted their pensions in order to obtain a lump sum of money to establish themselves in business. Many of their ventures failed. It is a curious thing, and not without significance, that many of those who deserve best of the State fail in business. Some of these men have been for five this bill which I have already indicated, years without a pension; but after this it ensures the smoother working of the bill has been passed they will be eligible Repatriation Department. It reduces the Mr Hughes. for pensions. The Government will not lose anything in connection with them for to pay the pension for five years. Provision is also being made to extend the benefits now enjoyed by dependants of deceased, blinded and permanently incapacitated soldiers, irrespective of whether the cause of their death was attributable to the war disability for which they had received a pension. A further concession contained in the bill is the liberalization of the basis of calculation of pensions to aged parents and similarly placed dependants of returned soldiers. The sufferers from tuberculosis will receive not only service pensions but also treatment in repatriation hospitals. The lot of the sufferer from tuberculosis is most melancholy. The shadow of death hangs over him. Recently at Brisbane it was my experience to address some 300 sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis, and a more saddening experience I cannot recall. This bill is a message of hope to these men, and I , sincerely welcome it. It is an assurance that the Commonwealth Government has not forgotten them. The need foT this amending bill is urgent. The difficulty of proving that the condition of In addition an ex-sertuberculosis is due to war service is almost insuperable. Tuberculosis is a disease universal in its incidence. Not one of us has escaped it. We have been able to avoid its full force because our vitality has prevented it getting a grip, but once a person's vitality is allowed to ebb, the gate is open for the baccilus to enter the I do not presystem and the disease takes charge.

Indeed, the wonder is that any emerged sane and hale. In addition to the benefits extended by number of appeals which the Repatriation Commission may make against the payment of pensions, and, therefore, it gives a greater assurance of permanency to the assessment that is made. If a man is to be restored to health he must have peace of mind. while the threat hangs over him that the little which he has may be taken away. Under this bill, a man will be assured of a pension up to three years, and will not be liable to lose it after a few months. I had hoped to pilot this bill through the House, but circumstances have precluded my doing so. It gives very substantial benefits to many of the great men who fought for Australia, and I , therefore, commend it to the House, but at the same time. I do not admit that it is to be accepted as the final word on repatriation. I rejoice at the declaration of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr a premature grave is the result. When Curtin) that his party will support it unconditionally. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) in his statement that the bill is largely one which should he considered in committee, where we can ascertain the exact meaning of the various clauses and the intentions of the framers of the bill. Honourable members are particularly anxious to be informed as to how the administration in consequence of these amendments is going to work in the future. It appears to me that sympathetic interpretations of the legislation will largely be dependent upon the attitude of the administration, and it is the duty of all honourable members at this stage' to ascertain the interpretation which the Minister wishes to apply to the various clauses. I was particularly pleased to hear the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) state that the administration of the Repatriation Department from now on would be in the hands of officers who have the interests of the returned men at heart, and will deal with their problems fare on civilian populations far refrom the point of view of the rank and file; and, indeed, it to be hoped that the approach to all the problems which will arise in the future in connection with this legislation will be dealt with on a basis of genuine sympathy. The main provisions of this bill deal with those who are suffering from tuberculosis. I am not at this moment raising a question of blame or as to who is responsible, but we cannot escape the fact that, in the many years since the end He cannot have that of the war, because the benefits now proposed were not then available, a large body of returned men has been forced to an early grave by sufferings from this dreaded disease. Not only kindly thought, but also proper attention, is essential if tubercular patients are to be restored to health. If they are not able to provide the necessaries of life, not only for themselves but also for their dependants, anxiety is bred, eventually and inevitably leading to a complete 'breakdown of health. In such conditions this disease undoubtedly takes a more intense grip, and it is no exaggeration to say that men are assured of being able to provide for themselves and tlieir families, they have peace of miad. Many have suffered from not having peace of mind, and they have been sent to an early grave. Buti t is useless for us to live in the past; we have to deal with these things as they are and it is a notable advance in the treatment of returned men that those suffering from the awful disease of tuberculosis will have under this bill some means to live and much anxiety lifted from them. I understand that tuberculosis among returned soldiers was very largely brought about by the use of gas in the last war. This brings me to the question: What does the future hold in this particular respect? From many authoritative directions we are constantly being told that the next conflict will largely hinge upon even more extensive use of poison gases than was the case in the last war. Not only will the men in the front lines of the struggles of nations be affected, but also it is apparently intended to use that system of warmoved from the actual scene of conflict. That is an aspect that must be considered, particularly when we look around and see the sufferings from dreadful disease arising from the use of gas in the Great War.",25,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Mittee The Honourable Gentleman How
81,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [12.34].,"To return, however, to the actual intentions of this measure, I wish the Minister to realize how essential it is that we should be provided with the fullest information regarding it, so that we may be able correctly to guide the many persons, who, from time to time, will require from us information as to the meaning of particular sections of the act. It is evidently not the intention of the Government to restore fully to returned soldiers the benefits enjoyed by them and their dependants prior to the enactment of the financial emergency legislation. Por instance, as the result of that legislation, a child born to a returned soldier after the 1st October, 1931, receives no consideration under the repatriation law, and the same limitation is placed on a woman who marries a returned soldier immediately subsequent to that date. An important modification of that limitation, contained in the bill, is that widows and children of men who have died since October, 1931, from causes attributable to defective vision, will be entitled* to benefit under the Repatriation Act. At any rate, my reading of the memorandum supplied in explanation of the bill is that, if a returned soldier were killed while crossing the street, and he happened to have had defective eyesight, his death, for the purnature. Some returned soldiers may be poses of the Repatriation Act, would be regarded as being due to his poorness of vision, which in turn is to be regarded as due to war service. I hold that the same broad interpretation of what is the cause of death should be applied to other recipients of war pensions, but I take it that, if the death of a war pensioner who is blind or partially blind occurs, or has occurred, from causes which might be associated with his eyesight, his dependants borns since the 1st October, 1931, will be entitled to pension benefits. vernment is to broaden the amendment contained in the bill, and provide that dependants of all pensioners included in schedule 2„ as well as blinded or partially blinded, will receive the rate of pension payable. If the pensioner dies from any cause, it will be regarded as .death due to war service. extend to the widows who were married and children born subsequent to October 1931?. that phase pf the bill. dependants of other war pensioners should be accorded similar treatment, and the Financial Emergency Act limitation on children born or women married to returned, men after the date mentioned should be removed. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. that sub-section 1 of section 26 be amended by requiring each board to determine whether a member of the forces is "" permanently unemployable "". A good deal of difference of opinion will no doubt arise as to whether an applicant is permanently unemployable. We have had experience of this difficulty in connection with applications for the invalid pension. It is conceivable that an ex-soldier might be partially in such a condition. Medical certificates are sometimes tendered to the effect that the disabilities of invalid pensioners are such as to prevent them from doing work of any kind, and .it is often argued that the disability is only of a temporary so incapacitated through disabilities arising from war service that they are totally unable to follow the occupations to which they have been accustomed. I have in mind the case of a man suffering from a disability arising from rheumatism, and he is practically unemployable, because he cannot do the class of work to which he has been accustomed, such as relief work. He cannot Use a pick, a hammer or a shovel. When matters of this kind are argued before the commissioners, they say that it is not their duty to find suitable employment for these men. In the particular case to which I haA'e referred it was said that the applicant could sell newspapers or flowers, operate a l if t or engage in similar work; but we know that as the labour market is over-supplied it is not possible for these men to select jobs for which they are suited. Many of them cannot obtain clerical positions because they have not received suitable education to qualify them for that work. I realize",27,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Mittee The Honourable Gentleman How

In the circumstances it was almost impossible to advance such proof. The soldier, at the time of his death, was in a condition which, in the case of the average person, would be caused by the effect of the war. people who were acquainted with him before the war in order to give evidence, and therefore a case could not be established to the satisfaction of the Appeal Board. I submit that cases of that kind should not be arbitrarily dismissed, as is being done at the present time. It is provided in this bill that the board shall act according to substantial justice, and the merits of the case, and that the appeltion of providing the perfect Repatrialant shall have the benefit of any reasonable doubt. I have all along said that this principle should be applied in dealing with applications for war pensions.

The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), in the ex-soldiers. There is also provision for speech in which he introduced this bill, the granting of a pension to soldiers made it clear how extensive are the whose war experiences have worn them operations of the Repatriation Department and how efficiently its duties are being performed. I have studied the repatriation systems of other countries, and I know that in no other country is there a repatriation system as extensive, efficient, or well administered as ours But it was impossible to locate is. Every effort is made to ensure that the sufferings of ex-soldiers are made as light as possible. However, in spite of all that has been done, cases frequently come to light for which it is impossible to do anything under the act as it stands. The amendments proposed in this bill will, I submit, do much to meet the needs of such cases. I look upon this measure as a further step in the direction Act. The amount of money available is a factor which must always be taken into consideration, but I am convinced that the ex-Minister for RepatriaThe bill states that the Appeal tion ( Mr Hughes), and those associated with him, who drew up this measure, have done the best that was possible, having regard to the funds that would be at their disposal. By the provision of I do not think it is necessary a war pension efforts have been made to meet the case of every returned soldier who was wounded, injured, or overseas, or whose health has become undermined as the result of war service. Clause 22 In addition, a new principle has been introduced, namely, that in certain circumstances, a service pension may be paid to returned soldiers who have fallen sick, even though they cannot prove that their disabilities are due to war service. It is so long now since the war, that in a great many cases it is impossible to prove conclusively that the disability I believe that, once a from which the ex-soldier is obviously The bill provides that a service pension, which is somewhat similar to an old-age pension, may be paid to returned soldiers at the age of 60 instead Once a pension has been of 65, and to nurses, who served in the theatre of war, at the age of 55 instead of 60. This is an acknowledgment of the fact that the rigours of war and the privations emdured have prematurely aged a great many nurses and",29,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Mittee The Honourable Gentleman How
91,Mr Francis (Moreton) [2.40],"down to such an extent that they are unemployable. These man have been burnt out, so to speak, and it is only right that something should be done for them. Provision is also made for the restoration of commuted pensions. Up till 1931, when the practice was abolished, ex-soldier pensioners were permitted to commute their pensions for a fixed sum, and it is now proposed to restore those pensions as from the 1st January next. The bill also contains a special provision to meet the needs of aged parents, and the widows of blinded soldiers. It is also provided that service pensions shall be payable to tubercular soldiers who served in the theatre of war, but who are unable to prove that their disability is due to war service. addition to a service pension, such men are also to receive the comfort of hospital treatment. The estimated cost of these concessions is as follows:'Pensions and treatment tuberculosis soldiers Service pensions Commuted pensions Aged parents' pensions 30,000 350,000 If the act is administered as Parliament intends, I feel certain that that estimate will be considerably exceeded. bill introduces many variations which I endorse and which will go a long way towards making smoother the administration of the act. I feel sure that as the result of the passage of this bill, the administration of the Eepatriation Commission, good as it has been in the past, will he better in the future. When Acting Minister for Eepatriation, I was firmly convinced that the outstanding problem -which the commission had to overcome was the difficulty Avhich confronted the soldier or his dependants in proving that his disabilities were due to war service. I saw many of tlie soldiers, and talked to them, and was convinced beyond any shadow of 1 doubt that many of them who did not receive the pension were entitled to it. The commissioners could act only within the power conferred upon them by the act and that throws upon the soldier the onus of proof that his disability is due to war service. In many cases it is almost impossible to obtain such proof. I discussed this matter with the commissioners and I endeavoured to obtain information as to the experience of the allied nations in connection with war pensions, and what steps were taken by them to overcome this problem. I was examining the Canadian repatriation legislation when, owing to a ministerial change, 1 was unable to proceed further. I offer my congratulations to the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) for the very efficient way in which he framed this bill. I also pay tribute to the officers of the commission who were very helpful to me in preparing In the bill which was introduced last year by the then Minister( Sir Charles Marr). The task which confronted us was very great, because for a number of years ho major legislative attempt had been made to deal with the problem of soldiers' penof sions, other than by the introduction in 12(5,000 1928 of legislation providing for appoint134,000 ment of the tribunals. I am, therefore, 60,000 in a position to appreciate the task which confronted the right honourable member for North Sydney. I congratulate him on the result of his efforts. The success or failure of the act as amended by this bill will depend entirely The upon the manner in which the commissioners carry out the intention of Parliament, and upon the sympathy, ability, tact, foresight and judgment which they bring to bear in dealing with cases that come before them. No draftsman can frame and no parliament can pass a bill relating to soldiers and their many problems that will do justice to the soldiers unless those who administrate that legislation are possessed of the sympathy, judgment and experience necessary to put into effect the desires of Parliament. The commissioners, have in the past, undertaken a very difficult task, and a no less difficult task faces the new commissioners. I congratulate the Government on it3 choice of the new commissioners to carry on this important work.' The new commissioners are returned soldiers with experience of soldiers' problems; they are men who already have proved their sympathy and interest in their soldier comrades. For a long period they have been handling appeals of soldiers, and as the result of their own war experience and general knowledge are well fitted to carry out their task. I look forward to the exercise of sympathy and judgment in respect of future applications, and I feel certain that the act will be more smoothly administered in the future. I impress upon the new commissioners the importance of endeavouring, in all circumstances, to carry out what has obviously been the desire of this Parliament in the amending legislation introduced during the last two years, and ftirther, to give the ex-soldier the benefit of any reasonable doubt. It is the desire of Parliament that the best possible treatment should be meted out to the soldiers who, so long after the war, have suffered, are suffering, or to-day are beginning to suffer, from the effects of strenuous war service. Seeing that the Leader of the Opposition sentative ( Mr Curtin) and the honourable member prima facie case in support of his claim that for ""West Sydney( Mr Beasley) have the incapacity from which he is suffering or spoken favourably of the bill, it is not from which he has died was caused or aggranecessary at this juncture to debate the vated merits or otherwise of the principles inaggravated shall lie with the commission. volved in it ; but in view of the fact that the guillotine has been applied, and that If an ex-soldier appeals under section 45w great latitude has been deliberately exand his appeal is upheld, any medical tended by the Chair to previous speakers, evidence he may have been called upon to I propose to foreshadow at this stage cerproduce in order to make out a prima tain amendments which I propose to facie case, is not refunded to him by the move in committee, but which as the commission.

There appears to be something wrong in the method by which payments are made to successful appellants before the tribunals. Section 45K of the act deals with the question of appeals generally, and section 45w deals with the necessity for the applicant to make out a prima facie case. Section 45w (2) reads as follows:(2) Subject to this act, an appeal tribunal and an assessment appeal tribunal shall not, in the hearing of appeals be bound by any rules of evidence but shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case and shall give to an appellant the benefit of the doubt.

As you will recall the question hinged upon ought to be made. Under the proposals the propriety of paying the expenses incurred which the House is now considering, cerby a soldier for the medical evidence subtain disabilities are to be accepted as havmitted by him (which he had privately obtained) in connection, particularly, with an ing heen due to war service.

I appeal for an extension of this provision to cover the cases of those who lose the sight of a remaining eye by reason of circumstances beyond their control and definitely contributed to by the first loss. I also urge the desirability of preserving for as long as possible the sight of the good eye, by the granting of spectacles or something of the kind. Certainly those so affected should be able to obtain hospital treatment if anything should threaten what sight they have left. Tliese matters would ordinarily have been raised in committee, but as an opportunity to raise them at that stage may not present itself, I have dealt with them on the motion for the second reading of the bill. I urge that they be taken into account. [3.11] I most sincerely commend the Government for having introduced this far-reaching measure. I know that all honourable members are genuinely anxious to ensure that Australia shall be as generous as possible with those who suffer, in any way, by reason of service during the Great ""War. We all realize that the people of Australia have given a very definite mandate to the National Parliament in that connection. That mandate, I maintain, has been recognized and honoured throughout the years that have passed since the termination of the war. I have always felt that party politics should play no part in a debate with respect to repatriation. The introduction of anything of the sort appears to me to be quite improper. In 1930, the Dominion of Canada introduced a bill of this nature. In fact, its provisions arc very similar to those of this bill. It is entitled the War Veterans Allowance Act. Canada legislated for those who, having seen active service, were not wounded but were either mentally or physically incapable of earning a living. That legislation provided for the payment of an allowance to any veteran who had attained the age of 60 years or who, not having attained that age, was in the opinion of the administering board, by reason of physical or mental disability, permanently unemployable. T believe that the only difference between that legislation and ours is that ours is, if anything, a little more generous. The Dominion of New Zealand placed almost identical legislation on its statute-book last month. To prove that we are not less enlightened, and certainly not less sympathetic, the Government has gone far towards removing from want those whose sufferings may not be directly traceable to their service during the Great War. I support the expression of regret voiced by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) that the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) is not piloting this measure through the House. All must realize the strenuous nature of the work performed by that right honourable gentleman during the last twelve months in the preparation of the bill for Cabinet and the Parliament. I do not propose to speak at great length on this measure. In view of the limited time at our disposal, it would be unfair for any honourable member to occupy time unduly. But certain features of the bill are particularly pleasing to me because for many years past I have been urging the Government to give attention to the matters involved. Por example, I have urged for many years that the "" burnt-out"" soldier-the old-young man, as it wore-wh o has become a derelict and is sub-normal as the result of his experiences on active service, should be given special treatment. In the circumstances, I may be perhaps excused for citing two passages from speeches which I made on this subject in 1926 and 1928. During the budget debate on the 22nd July, 1926, I saidTlie only otlier matter that I wish to deal with at present has regard to sub-efficient ex-soldiers. I have been informed that there are about 1,000 ex-soldiers who have not beeu able to re-establish themselves in civil life owing to sub-efiiciency, which can be attributed to war service. If this is so, I would strongly urge that the Eepatriation Commission be directed to make a special effort to help these unfortunate men. In France, Belgium, Germany, the United States of America, and some other countries, various schemes have been devised to meet such cases, and I feel that something should be done in this direction by the Commonwealth. I appeal earnestly to the Government to make a special effort to cope with the matter, for in some senses tliese are the saddest cases of all, as the men, having lost their efficiency, get very little sympathy from the public.",32,Speaker Hon.

95,Sir Donald Cameron,"Whil ehimself unable to work, and is oppressed hy the nightmare that he is a menace and a burden to his own family. I know of no word so applicable to this disease as insidious. The disease may exist for many years, concealed and without marked symptoms. It may not so obviously intrude itself as to reach the diagnosable stage for periods up to ten or twelve years, and even longer. It is admitted hy those who have had experience in treating this particular condition that its variability presents one of the greatest difficulties in its diagnosis. Sometunate^ failure overtook them in many times the onset is rapid; sometimes it is life-long; sometimes it is suddenly active and dangerous; sometimes it is quiescent. There is developed chronicity, with periods of inactivity, alternating with activity, for half a life time. In determining how and when tuberculosis began, consideration must be given to periods of excessive physical exertion, exposure to the elements, unsuitable and bad environment, poor food, insufficient rest., exposure to acute infections, nervous tension, and war. These views are held by such noted authorities as the medical men in charge of the Manitoba Sanatorium, in Canada, which is probably the largest institution in the world dealing with this complaint. It seems to me that, in the light of these opinions, the Government is well justified in doing something additional-somethin g special-for sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis who cannot directly trace their trouble to war service. therefore, that the position will now be The royal commission which considered repatriation matters in 1925 recommended the payment of a permanent pension to the unfortunate sufferers from this dread complaint. I have never heard that any returned soldiers' organization has raised an objection to the extension of special treatment to these individuals, nor do I think that I ever shall hear of it. I am quite sure that honourable members of this House will be agreeable to the course which the Government is now proposing to take. I am particularly pleased that the Government is making provision to restore pensions in commuted cases. At the time the commutation was effected, medical reports indicated that the disease was stationary, but time has proved this opinion was, in numerous cases, incorrect, Sir Donald Cameron. for the disability has retrogressed, and the ex-soldier now finds himself considerably handicapped as the result of war service and without compensation in the form of a pension. Only small pensions were affected by the commutation, for a pension in excess of 30 per cent, could not be commuted. Many of the men who commuted their pensions hoped that they would be able, with the small lump sum that they received, to establish themselves in some walk of civilian life that would be congenial and successful; but, unforcases. In respect of those men whose complaint developed, there is every justification for the restoration of the commuted pensions. This feature of the bill is most gratifying to me. I am glad, also, that an cases in which ""material aggravation"" is claimed to have occurred, ex-service men have been given the right bo appeal to an independent body similar to an entitlements appeal tribunal, or an assessment appeal tribunal. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) referred, in the course of his speech, to the difficulty experienced in drafting legislation in language that exactly expresses what is intended. It is most difficult, for instance, to define ""material aggravation "" in exact terms. Long debates have occurred in this House on the meaning of this particular term. I am glad, clarified. The appeal system has worked with marked success in Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand, and I have no doubt is similarly working throughout Australia. During my speech on the budget debate, on the 22nd July, 1926, I drew attention to the fact that the Repatriation Act passed by the Italian Government placed the onus on the Government to prove that an ex-soldier had not suffered through his war service, whereas in our legislation the onus was on the soldier to prove that he had so suffered. As far as 1 have been able to gather, that is the only respect in which the Italian repatriation legislation is more favorable to returned soldiers than is that of Australia. In every other regard the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act is much more generous. The provision made in the bill, by a direction to the Eepatriation Commission, that in the determination of appeals the commission shall act according to substantial justice and to the merits of each case, and that the appellant shall be given the benefit of any reasonable doubt, is also mo3t commendable. I am particularly glad that the word ""relevant"" has been deleted. I feel that with the Eepatriation Commission, as now constituted, the act will be most sympathetically administered, and with this desirable widening of the powers of the commission, the returned soldiers will always be given the benefit of the doubt. There are several matters which I regret are not included in this bill. I think the time has arrived when more assessments should be placed on a permanent basis. It is inconvenient f OT both the soldier and his employer for frequent reviews to take place, and it is unnecessarily expensive to the country that he should be examined so often. If it is decided to make these assessments permanent, it should be impressed on the soldier concerned that, in the event of his complaint becoming worse, he should immediately report to the Eepatriation Department for examination. It would help us and would prove a boon and a blessing to those in receipt of war pensions. I commend the Government most sincerely for having brought down this measure, and I am sure that every honourable member has the same feeling. It will be recognized by former soldiers, their dependants and the war nurses as most generous and acceptable. am pleased that the Government at last has realized the responsibilities it owes to returned men, but I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) that the bill should have been introduced years ago. I know of men in my electorate who, because of inability to prove that their condition of ill-health is due to the ravages of war service, are denied pensions. Under this bill, these men will be given what they should have received years ago, and. what I believe the administrative officers of the Repatriation Commission would have granted to them had they been allowed by the Repatriation Act to do so. My experience of the officers of the commission is, as with every other Commonwealth department, that they give the fullest consideration and courteous treatment in the discharge of their duties. The member of the repatriation staff whom I know best has been appointed to work involving greater responsibilities. I wish him success in the new sphere to which he has been transferred. It is pleasing to observe that the Government has determined at last to make some better provision for returned soldiers than has been made in the past. Throughout the Commonwealth, in the homes of returned soldiers and their dependants, there will be real joy at the fact that at last they are to receive some small justice. Injustice has been done over and over again to the men who went to the war. They were promised practically the world if they would enlist for service, but on their return a great many of them were denied pension rights. Returned men will welcome the provision in the bill which removes from them the onus of proof that their disabilities are due to war service, nothing more pernicious than which can be imagined. How in the name of fortune can unfortunate men suffering from ill-health, undoubtedly due to their military service, be able to prove that it really is due to that service, when medical men disagree on the point, and the Commonwealth Medical Referee goes as far as to say that it is not so due? In the Cairns district, I know of at least seven or eight returned men whose health broke down so completely three or four years ago, that they are not able to work. They were perfect specimens of manhood when they left for the Front, and on their return they were discharged as medically fit. After the passage of time they began to feel the full effects of illness which could not definitely be diagnosed. These men had been gassed and knocked about in many ways. On their return from the Front, they resumed their occupations, and worked under the most favorable conditions, in the sunshine out of doors. Yet they developed illnesses which the medical fraternity, and particularly the medical referee, have claimed to be not the after-effects of war service. In 1929, when I first entered",35,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Mittee The Honourable Gentleman How
96,Mr Martens (Herbert) [3.32],"Ithis Parliament, I directed attention to the fact that injustice was being done to these men. This bill grants long overdue justice. Tax remissions should never have been given when men who went to the war physically fit and returned bodily and mentally affected had to shoulder the onus of proof that war service was the cause of their disability. If it had not heen for the fact that they went overseas to fight for their country the classes to whom taxes are being remitted would have no property or income on which to pay tax. It would have been taken from them by the Central Powers of Europe. They would, therefore, have no cause to squeal if remissions were withheld from them until every returned soldier in this country was given the right to live. I am pleased, however, that the Government has seen fit to introduce this amending bill, and I have no doubt that officers of the Repatriation Commission will do their share by administering the act in the interests of the returned soldiers. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [3.38] I realize that other honourable members, particularly returned soldiers, desire to address themselves to this bill, and, as the time of the committee is limited, I propose to be brief. I wish to congratulate the Government for having introduced it, and also the right honourable member for North .Sydney( Mr Hughes), who must have done a remarkable amount of work in preparation for its introduction. bill gives a further liberal interpretation soldier, and because reinforcements to the principle of repatriation, and I feel that this amendment is not the lastword on the subject. As the years go by, I have no doubt that we shall make the Repatriation Act still wider in its application and do further justice to the men who went overseas, many of whom returned physical wreck's to the land, they defended. The Government realizes its obligations to these men, and I feel sure tlie only reason why the present bill is not even more liberal is the limitation imposed by the state of the finances. In bringing down this bill, the Government has gone to the greatest limit that the finances will allow. Honourable members seem to realize that fact, therefore they are not making it a party measure. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) and the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) suggested to the Government that it might take into consideration certain proposals made by them. They realize, that, within the limits of the money available, the Government is doing its best, and that it would be embarrassing if amendments seeking a further widening of the clauses of the bill were moved. I , too, have, a suggestion to make to the Ministry, of which I feel it might well take early advantage. It has to do with the widows of deceased tubercular soldiers. I feel sure that the Government will see the advisability of following the suggestion I propose to make. The bill makes the sections of the act regarding tuberculosis very wide indeed, as the Government, realizing that it is a disease which in certain cases and under certain conditions cannot -be definitely attributed to war service, has waived the necessity for specifying the cause. From time to time, honourable members are notified of cases which they feel sure are directly attributable to war services, but neither they nor the patients themselves are able to prove that overseas service was the direct cause. One case I have in mind is that of a man who was subjected to a severe gassing. This man brought evidence from his former commanding officer in support o.f his claim for a pension, but there was nothing on record to prove that The he has been gassed. He was a good from overseas were arriving, he was appealed to to stay with the battery despite the fact that he was ill as the result of a gas attack. He yielded to the requests and remained on service, but he has since contracted tuberculosis which he cannot prove is directly due to Avar service. Owing to the fact that he failed to apply for treatment, his case Avas fought for some considerable time before he received a certain measure of relief. He was fortunate because he was able to induce his former commanding officer and a lieutenant, who was attached to the battery, to giA'e evidence in his support. Other returned soldiers are not so fortunately placed, and by removing the necessity for them to trace their condition to war service the Government has acted justly and has given necessary relief. The suggestion I would make to the Government is that widows of deceased tubercular returned soldiers who are suffering a disability because their husband's applications for pensions were refused should be given some consideration in further amending legislation. The act, as it is proposed to be amended by this bill, will come into operahonorable member for Lilley, and the tion on the 1st January, 1936. It is possible that, between now and then, certain sufferers from tuberculosis will die, and their widows will be denied the proposed benefits of this bill. That aspect should be considered by the Government, which should make the act retrospective in this respect. With regard to those who are "" burnt remarks of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) out "" or unemployablea term not generthat this bill does not represent the last ally understood outside Parliament or in word of the Government on repatriation the rising generations who know very matters. little of the ravages of wara strong case the necessity for further liberalization exists for their better treatment. cannot be stressed too greatly that these men have a definite claim of the country. adjourned. Honourable members who have been overseas have seen time and time again men who have been shellshocked. These men are apt to berequests. come for the moment creatures without control over their emotions; of times suffering physical as well as mental lesion. Although they may ultimately regain control of themselves their reserves have been impaired, and a weakness will remain with them.

I congratulate the Government upon having taken this point into further consideration. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron) eulogize the work of the commission officers. In the main, they are returned soldiers, and they are devoting their lives to the sympathetic administration of the act. Their work is of a high standard, and I join the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. P. Harrison) who addressed himself to the matter some time ago in asking the Government to recognize the rights of these officers and to grant them a permanency of employment and the consequent long-service leave which is extended to members of the Public Service.
