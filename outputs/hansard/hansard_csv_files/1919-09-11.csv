The matter, as he knows, was brought before us when we were in Western Australia recently by a deputation, introduced by the honourable member for Fremantle ( MrI t is not fair to expect questions of thisBurchell), which discussed it in all its aspects. It is at present receiving the earnest consideration of the Government, but until a further conference takes place Hughes) and those of his colleagues, who have gone into the question, it is impossible to arrive at a decision. We expect, however, to do so at an early date.

Mr ""GREENE -In answer to a similar question, I intimated some little time ago that already there were being erected in Australia works which should be capable of drawing all the wire necessary for the purpose, and that it would then be a comparatively simple matter to galvanize ..the wire and weave it into netting. Since lations, has been so long delayed? then, I understand, further negotiations have taken place, and it is proposed very shortly to erect, in addition to the works now carrying on the industry in Australia, a very large manufacturing establishment which, I think, will be able within a reasonably short time to provide all the wire netting that will be required in Auscision is likely to be delivered. tralia.

While in New South Wales recently, I was told that this Victorian Parliament was keeping back the payment of advances to New South Wales farmers. Will the Minister assure us that that is not so, and will he inform honourable members when the last payment of about 2 l/16d. per bushel is to be paid? has asked me to deal with this matter.

Would the Minister have an inquiry made as to the suitability of Broken Bay or Brisbane Water as a site for the College, or for any further establishments that may be projected ? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The Captain of the College has reported that the site at Jervis Bay has been proved by experience to be ill-adapted for a Naval College, chiefly on account of its isolation. 2. On the grounds of economy, the Government do not contemplate removing the College from Jervis Bay. The expenditure on land and buildings has been £373,000. It is not a light matter to remove the College from its present position, when vested interests such as these have been created. I may say, on this matter, that I have always held that the College wa3 misplaced. I did my best, when Minister for Defence, to prevent it.ever being established where it is. I think it has not been a good thing for the country that the College should be placed so far away from a centre of population.

Some time ago, it was announced that the 1914 decoration, known as the Gallipoli Star, was to be presented to members of the Forces who took part in the Gallipoli campaign. So far so good; not a. word other than by way of commendation of such a proposal could be said. But, after some effort and agitation, it was decided that representations should be made to the Imperial authorities to include in the 1914 decoration meu who were also engaged in the campaign of which Gallipoli was a particular incident, but only one incident. It was finally agreed by the Imperial authorities that the 1914 decoraof the Force which acted under the late tion should apply to a. large number of men who were engaged in various theatres of the war. According to the Melbourne Herald of 10th January, 1919, these various, theatres of war were to include the Western European, the Balkan, the Gallipoli, the Egyptian, the Asiatic, and the Australasian. It is in connection with the last mentioned that I wish to say a word or two. In 1914, there sailed from Australia what was known as the 3rd Battalion, Naval and Military Expeditionary Eorce, under General Pethebridge. These men were enlisted for service, and were sent to take charge of the Marshalls, the Carolines, the Ladrones, and other islands. As honourable members are aware, however, when this Porce reached the islands they found that the Japanese had preceded them by five days, and were in possession. The Australian Porce was then sent to Eabaul, and were invited to volunteer for service in Egypt. Every man volunteered, but that order was countermanded, and the Porce was sent to finish up the work in German New Guinea. Por quite a considerable period this Force was occupied in this effective and useful work, for which they received considerable encomiums-usefu l work in the way of solidifying our occupancy. But honourable members will be surprised to learn that, although every other Porce, and every other arm of the service engaged sideration. in the Pacific, received the 1914 decoration, this particular Force has been repeatedly denied any consideration. The officers in charge were mentioned for meritorious services, but so far as the men themselves, and the Force as a whole, are concerned, every effort to secure the same recognition as was paid to others, engaged in similar work elsewhere has been refused. The matter has gone so far that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has been asked to recommend to the Imperial authorities that this Force shall receive the recognition which is their due. But the Minister refuses even to submit the matter to the Imperial authorities. Honourable 'members are well aware that the granting of these decorations is not a matter for Australian decision. The decision lies in the hands of the Imperial authorities. It seems to me that the case which could be put forward on behalf ColonelPethebridge is at least worthy of being presented to those authorities, with a view to affording them an opportunity of deciding whether the men composing it should receive this particular decoration. The argument advanced against the recognition of the Porce is that it was not engaged in the theatre of war, because, after General Holmes had signed the armistice with the then Governor of German New Guinea, it is urged, the war there was over. Yet this Force was engaged for months in digging out nests of Germans, and of natives who had been armed by the Germans for the defence of this particular territory. I again express the hope that either the Minister for the Navy or the Minister for Defence-becaus e it was a combined Naval and Military Expeditionary Force whicK operated in German New Guinea-wil l submit this matter for the consideration of the Imperial authorities It is' not a' fair thing that these men should be excluded from participating in this decoration. I do not complain of those who have already received it, but why a discrimination should be made against the Force to which I refer is beyond my comprehension. I wish now to refer to a number of men who seem to be deserving of special conThe matter was brought under my notice by the Queensland Teachers Union, and it relates to the men who, before the war, were engaged in the particularly interesting and valuable work of training the youth of Australia. Large numbers of them enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and rendered very excellent service during the war. A number of these teachers, in common w it h the members of other professions, have come back to Australia suffering from wounds, from injuries to their eyes, and from shellshock. One has merely to mention these facts, and to recollect the work at which they have to earn their livelihood, in order to realize how heavily they are handicapped by these disabilities. The statement presented to me hy the Queensland Teachers Union is set out in ' a couple of paragraphs, the first of which Teads:Wc refer especially to members of our union who, through injury to their eyesight-no t involving blindness-to their nervous systems, or to otlier disabilities, sire forbidden by the medical authorities to devote themselves to -study. Tliese are chiefly young men who were at the commencement of promising careers as toachers, some of whom would, by passing the successive examinations required for promotion, eventually have risen to the top of their profession. They nobly risked this prospect in their country's cause. They have now returned, and «.ru able to resume their work of actual teaching, but only in that grade to which they would have attained had they remained in the service of the Queensland Department of Public Instruction during the period of their absence at the war. In another paragraph they say:We would respectfully suggest that, in cases in which tlie facts are medically established, your Government should supplement the departmental salaries of these young men by a pension sufficient to make up the difference between their actual salaries and the salaries attached to the successive grades to which they would probably have attained in the future, had they not received in the war those injuries to which we refer. The main trouble is that the doctors have forbidden a large number of these men to again take up their studies, on the ground that, owing to shell-shock and the injury to their are unable to continue the hard studies which are necessary to equip them to discharge the duties of their that is, if they are to become efficient and to secure that promotion which they naturally desire. So far, the Government refused any special recognition to these men. Yet the latter are not asking anything, unreasonable. is that for the time being the Government shall make up to them the difference between the salaries they are now receiving and the salaries which they would have been receiving had their studies not been interrupted. vice of immense value to the future of Mr Finlayson. Australia, and one cannot but sympathize with them 'because of the disabilities under which they labour, owing to their experiences at the war. They are comparatively few in number, and, consequently, the financial burden that would be imposed on the Commonwealth by acceding to their. claim' would be exceedingly small, whilst the moral effect of such action would be very great indeed. is not peculiar to teachers. Chanter) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. It is not often that I address honourable members from tile floor of this chamber, but a matter has been raised here this morning which seems to demand a reply from me. It has reference to the salaries which are being paid to the non-clerical members of the parliamentary staff. I am sorry that the subject has beeu brought forward in this, way, because, at the very inception of the Commonwealth Parliament, owing to a general recognition of the evils which had been associated with the exercise of political influence in the Public Services of the States, steps were takeu to prevent that evil' from creeping into our Public Service. A Commissioner was appointed in order that our Public Service should be placed entirely outside the sphere of political patronage or influence. The same rule should, of course, and does, apply to the officers of this Parliament. The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate stand in nervous systems, they the same relation to the employees of Parliament as the Public Service Commissioner stands in relation to the emprofessionployees in the Public Service generally. When I was a private member, I know that from time to time different employees have of the parliamentary establishment came to me w i th their grievances, and requested me to see Mr Speaker, w it h a view to All that they ask getting those grievances remedied. I always regarded the procedure as au objectionable one, because I held that the proper channel of communication between them and the President and Mr Speaker was through the heads of their DepartThese men are doing a serments.

82,Mr Elliot Johnson (Lang) [12.7].,"cn this matter to-day, and it has, I understand, always been the procedure here since it was inaugurated by Sir Frederick Holder and Sir Richard Baker as Presiding Officers respectively of each House in the first Parliament. I have in sisted upon the application of that regulation to parliamentary employees' because, in my opinion, it would not be r i g h t to allow them to go over the heads cf their own Departments, and to endeavour to see the Presiding Officer without first intimating their intention to the heads of those Departments, and without even informing them of the nature of the grievances of which they complained. This would be subversive of discipline and authority, and, moreover, the temporary Presiding Officers of Parliament could not in the nature of things be expected to have personal knowledge of the work and circumstances associated, therewith: of every individual employee of the establishment. Something was said, I think, about threats having been made of punitive action against -the men who had * signed the letter. There is no justification in fact for that statement. Por the special benef i ' of the HouseI shall read a communiu cation written in reply to a letter presented to me by two honourable members of this House, which simply points out the method of procedure. It is as follows : A letter addressed to the President and Speaker, signed by the non-clerical employees of both Houses of the Parliament, requesting increases of pay, was presented to me by two members of the House of Representatives. . The President and myself concur in the opinion that such a method of procedure, besides being a breach of regulations already laid down,, is highly improper, and we'insist on observance <5>f the rule that any communications from employees of the establishment shall be made through the permanent head of the Department. The use of political influence in' any -form is strongly deprecated, and will"" not advance the cause of th6se having recourse to St. The Presiding Officers of the Parliament will give due consideration to representations when made through the proper channel, and these will be considered on their merits. I will be glad if you will inform the members 13f your staff of the views of the President and myself on the subject. I think honourable members will admit t h a t that was a strictly correct attitude to adopt, and it is the attitude which Parliament adopted in regard to the whole of the Public Service. moreover, the attitude which prompted the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner, in order to avoid this very kind of thing. Sof a r as the employees of the establishment are concerned, personally, in view of the high cost of living, and long before anything was said by any one else to me on the subject, I felt that, perhaps, some increase might be made, or some recognition shown of the disabilities under which they are labouring. I had a conference, with the President of the Senate on the subject. I think it was in February or A p r i l b u t it was before the Estimates were submitted. I discovered during my occupancy of the chair on a previous occasion that when I raised the salaries of a number of the lower-paid members of the establishment, in 1913, I invited a protest from another quarter. I found that whatever was done in this' branch of the Legislature touching matters of salary had a reflex action on the Senate staff. Whyi t should be so I do not know, because the work done on this side is, in my opinion, generally speaking, more arduous and strenuous than that performed on the Senate side. There are 1 a great many more holidays in the Senate, the members of the staff there have asmaller number of members to look after, and, generally speaking, the conditions on the whole are easier, while, on the whole, .they are not very badly done by in either House. But so soon as the salaries of the staff employed in this Chamber were raised there was an immediate request for the salaries of those employed in the Senate to be raised similarly. I was not at the time aware that in the first Parliament the arrangement was arrived at between the officers of both Houses that no increase or alteration in salaries of employees of either House should be made without a consultation between the Presiding Officers, and a joint agreement being arrived at. In this case, I find there is not likely to be agreement in regard to a general increase, and I am hampered in carrying out what would be my own decision in this regard had I been free to act without reference to the effect of my decision upon the position of officers in another branch of the Legislature The difficulty is emphasized by the demand of the Treasurer that the Estimates must be reduced It was, to the lowest possible limit . We have had our Estimates returned once or twice w it h a request that further reductions should he made, and it is rather unfortunate at a time when the country is overburdened with taxation, and the Treasurer is hard-pushed finance, and requests are made to cut down expenses, that this time should be selected for making an application for increased salaries. A t the same time, we have to realize that the cost of living has greatly increased of late, and I have naturally a very great feeling of sympathy, particularly with the lowerpaid members of the staff. It is something to be thankful for that so far we have escaped the. necessity for reductions all round. With a view to arrive at a fair estimate of the position, I thought it desirable to see what was being paid for similar services in the State Parliament. Through tihe courtesy of the Clerks of the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of VictoriaI have been supplied with a statement of the salaries paid to the whole of their employees on the nonclerical staff. By comparison, I am bound to say that, although the amounts we pay are not by any means excessive, and perhaps inadequate, as I think some of them are in the present abnormal condition of prices, they are in nearly all, if not all, cases in excess of those paid in other Departments of the Public Service and those paid in the Parliament of Victoria for similar services. Moreover, there is a good deal more work expected from some of the employees in the State Parliament. Por instance, the work done by cleaners in this Parliament is done by doorkeepers in the State Parliament. They have neither cleaners nor charwomen om the State staff, and their remuneration is almost in all cases below the maximum and minimum rates paid in the Federal parliamentary service. I have -not the time to quote all the rates from the comparative lists, although I have the information and reports before me. Mr President and myself still have the matter under consideration. We have had several consultations concerning the matter, and it has not yet been finally determined. It is rather late, perhaps, to alter the Estimates; this request should not have been made several weeks after the preparation of the There must be some general approximation of the rates of remuneration Mr TP. ElUot Johnson. paid for similar services throughout the whole Commonwealth service, otherwise we would have in our Parliament officers who were receiving a higher rate than in the matter of men who were performing similar service, say, in the Prime Minister's Department. Our rates, whatever they may be, more than favourably compare with those paid in other Departments. I do not say our rates are high enough, but they are higher than those paid in other Departments, even taking into consideration the increases recently given in the State Public Service. It has been said, by interjection, that wages must be low in other Departments They are, in my judgment, in many cases too low. A general review of the whole position should, I think, be made, and I am not sure that it would not be good policy to place our parliamentary employeesunder the Public Service Commissioner. approach the Arbitration Court. Have they that privilege now? right now. Mr W. . ELLIOTJOHNSON I think not. Other public servants have; but not the parliamentary officers. that deny them the; rights which other public servants possess. think the honourable member is mistaken. It is a matter, however, into which I shall inquire. think Parliament can deal with its own servants ? Parliament is going to do so, then, I say, let Parliament do so. Buti f Mr Speaker and the President of the Senate aTe to do so, they must do so, and they must be guided by the Pubhc Service conditions generally, for they are in the same position, under the Public Service Act, as the Public Service Commissioner. Personally, I would like to get r i d of the responsibility.

Indeed, as I said earlier, I considered the matter in consultation with the President of the Senate weeks before the meeting of the House.

If I do not believe a certain course of action to be proper I will not be persuaded to adopt that procedure. I view the position of the messengers sympathetically, and, so f a r as I can do so, I shall endeavour to meet their case.

Mr Speaker has pointed out that it is scarcely possible now, in view of the fact that the Estimates were returned to the Treasury some months ago, to revise those Estimates; but he has indicated that a recommendation w ill be forwarded to the Treasurer that a lump sum be granted by way of a To some bonus. That is not very satisfactory, but, of course, it is f a r better than nothing at all.

Honourable members are asked to agree to a SupplyB ill covering a period of three months. I have raised my voice in Committee before, and shall do so again, in protest against the delay, year . after year, in bringing the Budget before Parliament, and dealing with the Estimates. Honourable members were told, when the last SupplyB ill was in troduced, that it was the intention of the Government at a very early date in this financial year to place the position of the finances before Parliament. We are now well into the third month of the current financial period, and that promise has not been redeemed. We are asked to grant three months' Supply, although we have not the slightest idea of the intentions of the Government w it h regard to the financial position, which, in my judgment, is appalling. It is admitted on a ll sides that the amount of taxation i m posed upon the people has almost reached the limit , and yet our obligations are in creasing, from week to week. Though the war is over,. certain obligations, such as the repatriation of our soldiers, war pensions, and housing schemes, arising out of I have the war, and involving the expenditure of millions of pounds, have to be provided for. It is possible, if rumour be true, that we may have an election before the financial position is disclosed to the people; but I cannot bring myself to think that any Government would be so foolish as to commit suicide by appealing to the people before the finances of the country are properly adjusted. It is probable that the present may be considered a suitable time for this appeal; it is quite possible that the Government and their supporters believe they are on the rising tide of public favour, and that it would be just as well to go .to the people in the hope of being returned with power to carry on the government of the country for another three years; because if this appeal were delayed and the real position revealed to the people, the result, might",35,Elections The Prime To Any Representations Made Through Thu

99,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [12.28],"be different. How are we going to discharge our obligations? How is the load of taxation to be apportioned in the future? It is the clear duty of the Government to make all these things plain to the people, because it will be found that, if an appeal be made in the near future, there w ill be very searching inquiries into the true financial position of the Commonwealth. The people w ill want to know exactly how much money we owe, and how much we are likely to owe w it h in the next two or three years to discharge the heavy obligations, arising out of the war, to which I have already referred. Isi t the intention of the Government to remove a great deal of the direct taxation which during the war was imposed upon the richer people of this country, and place heavier burdens on the masses of the people? W h a t are the indications? The people who during the war did not raise much objection to direct taxation being imposed upon them are to-day holding meetings in different parts of the Commonwealth and agitating for relief. They are declaring that the direct taxation is too heavy to bear. We want to know exactly what the Government intend to do. So far as direct taxation is concerned, I believe we shall have to go further, and that we have not yet reached the l i m it of our possibilities. But we cannot place any additional burdens on the poorer people of the country. Those with the most wealth w ill have to bear the major portion of the war costs. It is very evident, from the statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that Australia w ill get very little, if anything, in the way of war indemnity or reparation, so apparently we shall have to bear the entire cost of the war ourselves. It is appalling that the Government should carry on the administration of the country month after month without taking Parliament and the people into their confidence. Neveri n the history of the Commonwealth was our financial position so unfortunate. It is just as well that I should place on record in Hansard the Prime Minister's own words. In the course of his remarks yesterday he saidThe problems before Australia are difficult and complex. We have a huge debt. We have a debt as great, I think, as that of Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Newfoundland put together, or very nearly so. What are we going to do to meet that debt? The Prime Minister has been talking, about increased production, and I say at once that the people of everv country must produce more if they are to be in a nourishing position in the future. But while we are talking about production in Australia, it is unfortunately true that thousands, of men, who ought to be producing, are unemployed. What avenues of work are being opened up for them ? I have heard it said that Australia is afflicted w i th the "" Go-slow"" policy, but I assert that in regard to production the Australian worker compares more than favourably with the worker in any other part of the world. Protection ? to see successful' factories established throughout the Commonwealth to absorb those thousands of unemployed to whom I have referred. This duty lies before the Government. The war has taught us that, in order to be secure, Australia must be a self-contained nation, and I am surprised to know that there are one or two honourable members who, apparently, have not learned that lesson. We must provide for our own requirements, and we must encourage our industries by a protective Tariff. What are the Government doing in regard to this matter? Tho Tariff has been spoken of frequently, biit I believe that after this three mouths' Supply has been granted, we shall get thc Estimates a little later, as well as the Bills for the amendment of the Constitution, and the Government w ill go to the country without doing anything in the way of Tariff reform. The Government, as I have said, believe that they are on the rising tide of public favour; but mistakes have been made in the past, and they may be made again. It is folly on the part of the Government to rush to the country before they place their own house in order. There is plenty of work for this Parliament to do before we go bofore the people. Personally, I am not much concerned at the prospect of an appeal, but I feel that w-e have a duty to discharge before we go again before the electors. We have a right to protect our people. U p to the present this has not been done. Three weeks ago I asked questions of the then Acting Prime Minister",36,Elections The Prime To Any Representations Made Through Thu

101,Mr Charlton,"Becaus e we want( Mr Watt) in regard to the continuous increase in the price of hoots, and I was informed that an inquiry would be made. Last week, again, I asked if the inquiry had been commenced, and the honourable gentleman said he had brought the matter under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene). To-day I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs what stage the inquiry had reached, because this matter of the ever increasing price of boots is of vital importance to the people, and the Minister informed me that he had sent it on to the Inter-State Commission. that body some time to make an inquiry and bring in a report, and the futility of the whole business lies in the fact that the Government can, or will, do nothing. We have reports already in regard to quite a number of other matters, and nothing has been done, because, so we have been informed, the Government have not power under the Constitution to take any action. I believe the Government have power to-day, as during the war. On the outbreak of hostilities a proclamation was issued declaring this country to be in a state of war, and the Government proceeded immediately to exercise certain powers of control. I contend that whatever powers the Government and the Parliament had during the actual period of the war must continue until the Peace Treaty is ratified. In these circumstances there can be no excuse for the failure of the Government to deal with the high cost -of living. The facts in relation to these matters should carry weight. During the war period the price of boots, amongst -other things, was regulated, and reasonable rates were maintained. But in May last, owing probably, to influence brought to bear by those directly interested, the -Government abolished the whole of their price-fixing machinery. Boot manufacturers and others were given a free hand, .and the price of boots immediately went up. Ever since then prices have been increasing. Why did the Government relax this power, and thus give profiteers a free reign to-day is 7s. 6d. 4ess than it was in hand? Why did they not take measures to prevent profiteering? If they have lost the power which they were able to exercise during the war-and I claim that they have not-it is still open to them to control the export of hides,, and pressure should be brought to bear in that Mr Charlton. direction to bring down the price of boots. The Government could say to dealers in hides, "" Until the people of Australia are able to obtain boots at the prices which ruled prior to May last we shall not permit the export of hides."" where should we find the money to pay the war debt to which the honourable member referred a few moments ago? be better able to assist in liquidating the National debt if the cost of living were brought down to what it was in 1914. hibit the export of hides and everything else, let us start by prohibiting the export of coal. like so long as the principle is applied all round. If the cost of living were reduced « to what, is was prior to the war, the working people of Australia would cheerfully contribute to the liquidation of the war debt. They are unable to do so to-day owing to the action of certain individuals who, by reason of their power and influence, have been able to secure to themselves practically the whole of the wealth of the community. The poorer classes are not even able to-day to pay their family bills. The honourable member for Franklin gested that we should apply to all exports the principle of control. If we have not the power to fix prices we must either control the export of all commodities until our own people are able to satisfy their wants in respect of them at reasonable rates, or we must raise the wages of our working people. reasonable proposal. member admits that something must be done.

108,Mr Charlton,"The honorablesions that the Labour party, when in power, submitted amendments of the Constitution to the people, they met with the opposition of honourable members opposite, who say to-day that the Federal Parliament needs to be clothed with additional powers. the Labour party asked for too much. have the same objection raised once more. It is quite possible that if the Government do bring forward Bills providing foT the amendment of the Constitution, those measures will have to -be modified to meet the views of many of their supporters. I maintain that this Parliament could not have too much power. It is stated in this morning's newspapers that a witness, after giving evidence before . the Victorian State Commission yesterday . in regard to the price of boots, said that it would be impossible to fix, with any degree of satisfaction, the price of boots in any one State. It was, he declared, a Commonwealth matter; and I certainly agree with him that we must have uniformity throughout the Commonwealth. In dealing with, the increase in the cost only because of the ineptitude and inacof living, we are guided largely by the statistics laid before us by Mr Knibbs. I would remind honourable members, however, that his figures in regard to the increase in the cost of living cover only food and rents. In respect to those items, he shows that there has been an increase of between 50 per cent, and 60 per cent, since 1914; but increases in the cost of clothinga very important matter to heads of families-amoun t in some cases, to 100 per cent. fighting for 5s. per day, on coming back, have to pay these increased prices. few of oar boys on returning to Australia have suitable civilian clothing Many of them find that they have grown out of the clothes they left behind, while others discover that their civilian clothing during their absence has become moth eaten. Two or three returned men told me recently that, being anxious to get into "" civvies"" as soon as possible, they thought of buying a suit or two in England, but prices there were so high that they determined not to make any purchases until they reached Australia. They were surprised to discover that clothing here was as dear as it was in England, and in some cases dearer. wool here. duce the wool and everything else required for the manufacture of clothing. Manufacturers of clothing on the other side of the world have to depend upon us for their supplies of raw material, and yet they can sell, in many cases, at prices below those ruling here. Our soldiers, to whom-as the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) said, yesterday-w e owe a debt that we can never discharge, find that the whole of their deferred pay,, amounting to £20 or £30 each, is absorbed in the purchase of new clothing outfits. In my district, they have to pay nine guineas or ten guineas for a tailored suit, and the prices of underclothing, boots, and everything else they require are also exceedingly high. This is not a fair position in which to place our returned men. They did not expect to find these prices ruling iu Australia; and they prevail to-day tion of the Government. Had the Parliament desired, it could have prevented these increases from the very outset of the war. Asi t was, we had regard to only one section of the community. We endeavoured, by the creation of Pools and the appointment of Boards, to protect and regulate various industries; but, unfortunately, interested persons weTe appointed to those Boards, and throughout this war they have carefully studied their own interests. They have made the most of the war period. I say, without the slightest hesitation, that many of those interested persons who during, the war prated of their loyalty, were at the same time taking every shilling they could out of the pockets of the people and the soldiers who were fighting for us abroad. The contributions which some of the wealthiest men in this country have made to patriotic efforts, and the amounts they have put into our war loans, are practically infinitesimaL Yet during the whole course of the war they have been reaping great benefits; every day they are amassing wealth; their bank accounts are growing.

114,Mr Charlton,"Although we propoorer, and are unable to provide necessaries for their families. These are questions which require immediate attention, but they get none. It is quite probable that at a very early date an effort will bo madeto send honourable members to tbe people, but when the electors realize what little use we are making of the power we have to protect them, they will do the only thing it is possible for them to do in. the circumstances, and that is to bring about a change of Government. The newspapers are endeavouring to create a certain atmosphere for the purpose of securing an election which will return to power the party now in office, the proposal being to postpone the adjustment of the finances until after the elections. If the present party are returned to power, we sliall find that the greatest load of taxation is placed on those who can ill-afford to bear it-on the poor, and even on those brave men who have returned to our shores, many of them maimed and many suffering from shell-shock. In my opinion, men who have served their country in the war have done their part, and should be relieved of all taxation, at any rate of income taxation. The income tax -was imposed for the purpose of liquidating the debt incurred in defending the country, and if our returned soldiers sure called upon to pay it, they will be levied upon to pay back the very money which we borrowed in order to pay them for their services. The ineonie tax should be ear-marked for the purpose of paying the debt on the war, and the men who went abroad to fight while we remained behind in perfect security should be exempted from paying it, and people who made an exceedingly great amount of wealth during the war should be called upon to contribute more than they are paying. The time has arrived when a return of the wealth held by the people of Australia should be prepared, and all persons in the community should be called upon to pay according to their wealth. It is not fair to go on year after year accumulating a war debt without making some effort to reduce it. Our boys have played their part away from Australia. Our part has now to be played, and steps should be taken at once to meet the obligations incurred by the Commonwealth as the outcome of the war. In the six months or Mr Charlton. nine months before this Parliament expires, we ought to be able to accomplish a lot of good work, particularly in the direction of reducing the cost of living. We have established a scheme whereby soldiers can borrow up to £700 for the purpose of building homes, but, ,as a matter of fact, a house which costs £700 to-day could have been built for £460 before the boys went to the war. We are asking these men to repay £250more than they are entitled to do, because profiteers have increased the prices of material during the progress of the war. These are the questions which are staring us in the face, and yet we burke them. Some honourable, member may say, "" What about the cost of labour ?"" According to the evidence given by builders before the Inter-State Commission, the sum of £14 17s. represents the increase in the cost of a cottage due to the increased wages given to .the labour employed. The whole of the extra cost of a cottage beyond that £14 17s. is due to the higher prices of materials, and the Inter-State Commission shows that there are combines and monopolies throughout Australia which fix the prices of articles to suit their own interests. We have no longer the freedom of trade about which people used to talk. It is no longer a question of supply and demand. These individuals form associations 'to look after their own interests and filch as much as they possibly can from the general public. Some honourable members may say that we have no power under the Constitution to deal with soldiers' homes, but without an amendment of the Constitution the Government can cut timber in their own forests in Papua, and they can establish brick yards in various States, and in this way they can reduce the cost of timber or brick cottages for the ""soldiers. However, no effort is made in this direction to protect men who have done so much for the country. We claim that we are looking after their interests; but, if an election is held, the position will be made very clear to them. When they know exactly what has been done, they will be thoroughly ashamed of the Parliament which is in charge of the affairs of the country, for which they have fought. The cost of living is a vital question. I do not speak about it week after week just for the sake of talking. My object is to draw tbe attention all unusual, for an offer to be pigeonof tbe public to it . I claim that the holed. Commonwealth Government have the articles would be written on what is aspower to deal with it , and that within the sumed to have been a serious offer, withnext few weeks we ought to see a change out that offer having beau submitted to brought about; but I know that I cannot some member of the National Governhope to see it done, because here we are ment. up against so many vested interests.

Griffiths? stand for this country. I always have done so, and always will. This is not only not a Norton-Griffiths offer, but it is something that is conceivably better even than the construction of the railway by the Government themselves. The offer has been made broadly on the principle that a price is to be agreed to between the parties. The Government might want competition and open tender. Probably that would be the best course, because it would settle any vexatious strife that might arise afterwards when other railway builders, as they always do, come along the day after the fair, saying that if the work had only been open to tender they would have been in it, and would have given the Government better terms. However, that is a matter of detail, which must be considered. My point is that if a tangible offer has been made, it should not be treated like a previous offer by Mr Joseph Timms to complete the construction of the East-West railway. That was a genuine offer, backed up by a very substantial sum of money. been done. ' the Department had £2,000,000 worth of work, and the offer was to complete the for tial backing was forthcoming, but the offer was turned down, because, according to the Minister of the day, the then Engineer-in-Chief said that he could do it as cheaply by day labour. That is true, and is in Hansard, in the speech of the Minister who was responsible for accepting that assurance and turning down the offer. . To-day we have a railway completed at. a cost, not of £4,000,000, but of more than £7,000,000. I know that war conditions arose, but I know approximately how much they meant in the matter of cost, because most of the material was already secured at pre-war prices. I shall not go into details, because I promised only to indicate rather than to elaborate these matters. I do not want, nor do I think the Committee wants, a repetition of what occurred then. I therefore repeat that any offer made in regard to the NorthSouth railway, not only ought to have the serious consideration of the Government, but is such a big national question that -the Government should not turn it down on its own initiative without giving the House some say in it. This is a big matter, and big national matters should be considered by the House. We, as a Parliament, have been very considerate since the war began. It has been largely necessary that the Government should be practically all powerful, and able in many respects to act on their own initiative. profiteer a fair chance. time to deal with that I would tell my honourable friend both sides of the profiteering question. He would get some gospel, good for his political soul. The time has gone by now when any Government has a right to conduct the affairs of this nation without the authority of Parliament, as provided by the Constitution. I hope we are going to get back to constitutional lines, and trust that before any such offer is turned down by the Government the House will have an opportunity to say something about it.

Government were that if she did not travel with her husband she should be allowed to join him, and I thought that had been done. lady, who claims to have received a letter from the woman. made. What-the honourable member has stated is news to me. which I wish to refer is the treatment meted out to young Australians who were sent to Great Britain to learn submarine construction and shipbuilding. From about . 700 applicants in all parts of Australia,, the Navy Department, after a thorough examination of the qualifications and credentials, selected nine young Australians of brilliant attainments to be sent to Great Britain in order to gain further experience in the great shipbuildshe an Australian ing yards of that country. The idea was that they would return with enhanced knowledge, and enable Australia to build up a competent technical staff that would be capable of carrying out the construction of submarines and war-ships of all descriptions in our own dockyards. Having undergone their course of training, the young men returned to Australia, and I propose to tell the Committee what has happened to them. One of them, C. Hutton, is a Diesel engine expert. Honourable members know that a Diesel engine expert is a most important technical workman in connection with submarine construction. Hutton had not been back in Australia more than two or three weeks before he received an intimation from the Navy Department that his services were not required, because the Government did not intend to proceed with submarine construction. He has now been snapped up by the Fore RiverShipbuilding Company, of Quincey, Massachusetts, United States of America, at a salary equal to £1,000 per annum. The Navy Department was to have paid him £250 per annum. If Hutton was not an expert worthy of a responsible and well-paid position he would not have been engaged by such an up-to-date firm as that I have mentioned. The country has lost his services, because the Government said they did not intend to proceed with submarine construction. Why did they spend thousands of pounds to send this man to Britain in order to gain experience and knowledge ? Another member, of the party was H Kidd, an engineering draughtsman. On his return he was left in an ordinary position at Cockatoo IslandI shall have inquiries Dock at a salary of £250 per annum. This man has been snatched up by Dalgety and Company of Sydney, at a salary three times greater than that paid to hi in by the Commonwealth, which has now lost his services. We spent thousands of pounds in sending these young Australians abroad to be technically trained, and when they return the Commonwealth, apparently, has no use for them, and allows them to go into private employment. Then there is the case of Mr J. Duggan,",43,Elections The Prime To Any Representations Made Through Thu

171,Mr Mahony,"Anothe r 'matter toelectrical expert, who, out of 700 applicants, was selected for technical training. When he returned, he was taken into the employment of Siemens Brothers, also at a greater salary than that paid to hi m previously by the Commonwealth. This firm stands so high in the electrical world that they do not require any but experts in their employ; and to those experts they pay large salaries. They evidently knew the value of this brilliant young Australian, and employed him at the first opportunity. The latest of all the cases is that of Mr W. Hoskins, boiler-making expert, and the one boiler-maker out of the nine men who were sent Homef o r training. When he came back to Australia he was given an ordinary job at Cockatoo Island at £250 a year, b u t to-day he is under engagement to Messrs. Poole and Steel to take charge of the practical work of ship construction at their shipbuilding yard in South Australia. I have mentioned four men out of the nine who, within a few months of their return to Australia, after being technically trained at the expense of the Commonwealth, were ""taken into private employment. And while this is going on, what does the Commonwealth do? ported from Great Britain Mr David Pickering, Shipyard Manager at W i l liamstown, ait £600 a year. We first imported Mr Curchin at £2,000 per annum, and then Mr Pickering at £600. gether. the Commonwealth brought these men out each under a three-years' engagement? ing your statement that we first imported one and then fche other. agree to the importation of these men? long before I came into office. porting these men we had those brilliant young Australians at our disposal here. Another case is that of MrH . Hewison, who was brought out as Chief Draughtsman at £520 per annum, although there was !he young Australian expert of whom I have spoken as going into the employment of a private firm. Mr Thomas Wallace was brought out as Foreman Ironman at £400 per annum under a three-years' engagement, altliough at the same time we were paying Australian exports of the same class £250 per annum. Mr A. Grant was brought out under a three-years' .engagement as Foreman Shipwright at £400 per annum, although men whom we had sent Home to be trained in this branch of the business were knocking about Cockatoo Island yard doing ordinary shipwright work. Mr Kenneth Watson was brought out as Chief Marine' Engineer under a three years' engagement at a salary of £.1,000 a year. It is just. about time that the publie of Australia knew the treatment that has been meted out to the clever young men of this country. Tlie moment a young Australian shows any ability or brilliancy he is shoved on one side, and some one is imported to take his place. Young Australians are not regarded as of any value simply because they are Australians, but, as our soldiers have shown themselves to be the best in the world, so w ill our technical experts; all they need is the opportunity to prove their value. I shall not deal with' this matter As a matter of fact, we have i m further., but. simply wait for the M in ister's reply. The tax-gatherer having just finished his work for the year, this seems to me out torather an opportune time to bring under the notice of the Committee some of the difficulties under which the taxpayers are I s it not a fact that labouring. For many years it has been evident to any one interested in primary production that the taxing of the man on I was merely correctthe land is of a more grievous nature than that of any other section of the com-' munity.

It has been stated here, and quite rightly, within the last few weeks, that wo could do much to relieve the situation of the man . who has to pay all those taxes if the Federal and State taxation were unified.

178,Mr Fleming (Robertson) [2.54],"whicli to-day is interfering with his efforts in the way of .primary production. But, as I have said, it is the form of the taxation that is the chief trouble; and I should like to lay before the Committee the form which is issued to graziers, large and small, as that on which they must furnish their returns. As far back as 1905 I dealt with this matter in the State Parliament of New South Wales, and I drew the attention of the Commissioner of Taxation to the fact that the primary producer was being most unfairly taxed in that he had to pay on his natural increase, which very frequently he could not realize on. The man on the land is taxed in such a burdensome way that it takes up a great deal of his time, causes him much annoyance, and interferes with production to a dangerous extent; and yet this is a matter which could be very easily amended. I desire to lay before the Committee Difference in sheep, 3,650 at some of the troubles which the man on the On IS t h October, 1905, I received from the the Sir, Referring to your rceent interview with Mr. .First Commissioner Spiller, when the question of the departmental method of treating as income the natural increase of flocks and herds born during the year was under discussion, I have to inform you that thc Commissioners, having considered the vews set forth by youinter alia "" that a taxpayer in being assessed on the natural increase, as above, would pay tax on an assumed income which might never be realized, as some, or perhaps all, of the increase might die before any sale could be made,"" w ill be prepared to concede an allowance in respect of the deaths which have subsequently occurred in the natural increase if the value of the said natural increase has previously been taken into account in arriving at the net income. The claim in connection with the death of any of the lambs to be made a charge against the year in which the value of the said lambs had been taken into account as income. That was, as I say, in 1905, but the Government have gone on all these years collecting the taxation in the same old way. A man who has >a natural increase has to pay on that increase whether he realizes on it or not, and under no conditions can he deduct the loss from the income tax. In the form issued to landowners and graziers forincome-tax purposes, the Commissioners give a sample Mr Fleming. case on which they are to work; and the> formula this last year reads as follows:Dr. Sheep on hand, 1st July, 1918-14,000 , at average value as last return, say, 12s.

So that, even on the Commissioner's own figures, the grazier is taxed on £1,867 which he never received. MT. MATHEWS -Are those valuesdrought or normal values ? the Commissioners fix upon 10s. per headin respect of the natural increase of lambsin New South Wales and 9s. per head in Queensland. The total thus arrived at inrespect of* the value of the natural in' crease is added to the price paid for sheeppurchased during the year, and, on theaverage price thus obtained, the taxpayer has to pay. Every practical man will recognise that this system is unfair, since the amount on which a taxpayer has to pay depends entirely upon whether hispurchases exceeded the natural increasein his flocks. Another important factorto be borne in mind is that the whole of tlie natural increase might possibly diebefore the owner could realize on it. The only fair method of taxing the man on the land, who is producing, to a greaterextent than is any one else, thewealth of Australia would be to call upon him to pay on the natural",45,Elections The Prime To Any Representations Made Through Thu
179,Mr Fleming,"In assessing incomeincrease of his flocks or herds only when he realizes. Sooner or later the money must come into the exchequer. The Commissioner will say that if that system were allowed, the man on the land might he adding to his capital hy adding to his stock every year. In the end, however, the result to the Department must be the same. When a man realizes on his stock, he must pay taxation on his income. I do not think honourable members on either side would for one moment support the system'adopted by the Commissioner of Taxation under which a man may be, and is, called upon to pay a tax on income that he has never actually enjoyed. only fair that a man should not be called upon to pay income tax in respect .of the natural increase in his flocks or herds until he has realized on that increase. While a grazier, is carrying sheep, he has to pay income tax in respect of the income which he derives from the sale of their wool, and he has also to pay the stock tax. Another objection to the present system is that the man on the land, is not allowed, any deduction in respect of deterioration of his cattle or horses on account of age. iHe is the only class of taxpayer who is not permitted to write down the depreciation of his stock. stand-point, the man on the land, who, in the aggregate', is producing the greatest amount of the wealth of Australia, is being taxed most unjustly, and he is getting tired of .the job. The position is becoming serious. men are beginning to find the burden of taxation too heavy. I know quite a numberwho are thinking of giving up primary production because of the appalling burdens which are being thrown on them by this unfair system of taxation. keepers also say that they want to give up business. Opposition ( Mr Tudor) does not think that many men contemplate giving up primary production. word of honour that quite a number, known to me personally, are thinking of giving up primary production because of this burden of taxation. They will put their money into Government stocks or city investments. The graziers are quite willing to pay income tax on what they make; but the point is that they are being called upon to pay income tax in respect of natural increases in stock on which in many cases they never realized. that the honourable member, as well as honourable members generally, will support my view when they fully appreciate the incidence of this taxation. I have here an actual return sent in in respect of the financial year just closed. It is The details are as follow:-Stock on hand 1st July, 6,594 sheep, at l is . lid -whic h is the average value, according to tbe Commissioner's method of assessment£3,929; 46 cattle at £ 6 , £276; 58 horses at £8, £464. Purchases for the year2,061 sheep, £2,480. Sales for the year1,963 sheep, £2,961; 9 head of cattle, £121; seven horses, £36. Killed for rations, 186 sheep at 13s. 10.8d., £129. Thus the gross income of this taxpayer according to the Income Tax Commissioner's formula amounted to £8,961, and the deductions in respect of stock on. hand killed and used amounted to £7,149,leaving a. net income of £1,822. Viewed from every The actual result in practice, however, was as follows:-Sales for the year, 1.963 sheep, £2,961; killed .for rations, 186 sheep, £129; sales for year, 9 cattle, £""121; seven horses, £ 3 6 ; total, £3,247. Deducting purchases amounting to A number of these £2,480, the net income from the year's transactions thus amounted to £767. The income from increase at the average value allowed for stock on hand was as follows:-52 3 sheep at 13e. 10.8d., £363. I should point out in passing that these sheep should have been put down at 10s. per head, so tliat the actual income in respect to them amounted to only £261 10s. Value of six cattle at £6 per head, £36. This gives a total of £399 to be added, in respect of increase, to sales. As against that total, there-was deducted' £8 in respect of one horse, bringing down the total to £391. The actual income from the year's transactions amounted to £767, and tlie accrued income from increase in stock totalled I give him my £391, so that the net income thus amounted to £1,158. From that total a sum of £100 should rightly be deducted since theincrease of lambs was allowed,",46,Income Tax Schedule

185,Mr Fleming,"It is; and I thinkfor at the average value of the whole of the stock for the year, whereas it should have been included at a value of 10s. per head. It will thus be seen fro m these figures tliat the net income of this grazier, according to the return which had to be furnished upon the Commissioner's formula, was £1,822 , whereas the actual net income, including natural increase, was only £ 1 , 1 5 8. Thus, observing the Commissioner's formula, the taxpayer had to pay income tax on the sum of £664 in excess of the income actually earned by him, even allowing for taxation upon the natural increase.' I am sure that no honourable member would support such a system of taxation. It is grossly unfair. It is damaging the prospects of the community; is unjust to the graziers, and has a detrimental effect upon the general wage f u n d of the people. If the men on the land have to pay more taxation than they should be rightly called upon to bear,. they have less money to distribute in the shape of wages. Every man is naturally anxious to improve his property, if it is worthwhile doing so. The average man on the land is interested, not only in making money, but in improving his property, and in increasing production. he holds freehold or leasehold country, he takes a pride in increasing its productivity. It is a sort of professional pride to be found throughout the length and breadth of Australia. If the taxation of the men on' the land is placed on a fair basis, they 'will continue to do their utmost to increase production, not merely from a sense of duty to the country, but because of' the personal interest and pride that every man takes in his own property. I hope the Government will see tnat better methods of assessing tlie man on the land are adopted in the future. I am aware that the Graziers Association of New South Wales is urging that income shall be taken, not as for one year, but on an average of three years. They think that the adoption of. their proposal would enable them to a certain, extent to equalize their losses. I wish, however, to make the point, and to emphasize it , bhat no system of taxation will be f a i r under which a man is taxed on the natural increase upon which, in many cases, he never realizes. The honorahle member for ( Mr Richard Foster) Mr Fleming. the prohibition of the export of horse flesh. No man in Australia is a greater lover of a good horse than I am, but I think it monstrous to prohibit the export of horse flesh having regard to what that prohibition means. Those who go into the back country in many cases will see f a t horses running about, and practically wasted. In the inner districts of New South Wales horses are just being kept alive in these days of drought at the expense of sheep and cattle. If the exr port of horse flesh were allowed these animals would be kept in good condition, and would not be. as they are to-daymere skin and bone, being just kept alive until the rain comes. Another point is that a horse requires the very best feed. He picks out the very best grass, and is the most delicate and dainty feeder of any animal on four legs. He is also the hardest of all animals on country. The rural districts of Australia are suffering to-day. Graziersi n the dry country are trying to keep their horses alive u n t i l the rain comes, and, consequently, their sheep and cattle are on short commons. Had. they been allowed to export horse flesh when their stock was in good conditionwhen, the graziers saw that a drought was approachinga great many of these Whether animals would 'have been turned into meat and sent abroad. of horse flesh, would it not lead to an increase in the price of horses locally ? ber need have no fear in that regard. The l if t in g of the prohibition would merely enable a man to dispose of his surplus horses. It would also encourage many who are giving up horse breeding to go on with the work. Unless a man can work a horse it is a most expensiveluxury. Horses are the most unprofitable form of live stock in Australia today. them ? ber reoresents a country constituency, and he knows that it is the aim of every bushman to ride or drive a .good horse. In the effort ""to secure one good horse, a man often breeds forty or fifty culls, and these culls, which are being wasted today, could be turned to profitable account Wakefield if the export of horse flesh were perhas referred to mitted.",47,Income Tax Schedule

187,Mr Fleming,The honourable mem,48,Income Tax Schedule
188,Mr Bamford,Then why do we breed,48,Income Tax Schedule
189,Mr Fleming,"The honourable memThere is another aspect of this question which appeals to me as a lover of horses. In ' a l l our capital cities we see the other States put together, to say poor old horses, many of which have done big things in their day, being practically worked to death between the shafts of vans and cabs. We can see these good old faithful slaves being gradually worked to death in this way by heartless men until' they are finally sent to the Zoo. If the export of horse flesh were allowed these horses would be kept in good condition instead of being gradually starved and at the end of their working days would be mercifully destroyed. It grieves me to walk about the streets and see these poor old horses working. Game as pebbles, but gone in the knees and bung in the fetlocks, they are heing knocked about by men who know no more as to the treatment they require than do the animals in the Zoo, where ultimately these poor old beasts go. Instead of permitting them to be worked until they drop dead in the streets, I want to see opportunities provided for the owners to treat them well and fatten them up so that when they are in good -condition they can be killed and sent abroad as horse-flesh. An old horse well fattened would be just as good eating as an old bullock in good condition. I hope that this stupid prejudice against the exportation of horse-flesh will be wiped away. Australia will be the gainer by thousands of pounds in the place of a few score pounds we are making out of the years of misery to which our old horses have now to submit. The extraordinary speech of the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr and I hope tliat no Government will conFleming) is only in keepingwith that made just previously by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster). The honourable member for Robertson was quite illogical. He says that these horses are extraordinarily expensive to keep, but when asked why they are bred, he says that it is for a purpose unknown, and which he could not explain. As it may be thought that the whole of the Chamber is in favour of the exportation of horse-flesh if the arguments put forward by the two honourable members who' have preceded me are allowed to go without protest, I take this opportunity, as representing a portion of a State which grows beef, and exports perhaps more beef than all that once the exportation of horseflesh from Australia is permitted under any conditions whatever, a death-blow will be dealt at the exportation of beef. I can readily imagine why the honourable member for Wakefield is in favour of the exportation of horse-flesh. It is because in his State horses are bred, and very few cattle. One can also imagine the capital that would be made by the American Beef Trust out of the exportation of horse-flesh from Australia. export it as beef, but as horse-flesh. that the consumer could not tell the difference between the horse-flesh and beef. Horse flesh can easily be made to pass for beef, and once the knowledge that Australia is exporting horse-flesh goes abroad, our beef trade will be irredeemably ruined. In any case, it would take years to live down the prejudices created, especially in Great Britain. The honourable member for New England (Lt -Colonel Abbott) . says that he has partaken of horse-flesh at the Front, but he did not do it voluntarily. is quite good. men in the trenches have done if they had beeu fed on horse-flesh? ing them to eat horse-flesh. test against the exportation of horse-flesh, sent to it in any shape or form.

The other day I asked the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Glynn) the following question:Will the Minister for Home and Territories state if it is a fact that a Commission has been appointed to inquire into the future government oi tlie Pacific Islands? If so, have its members been given any instructions to inquire into 'the suitability or otherwise of those islands for soldier settlement? The reply I received wasThere is a German lady, No Commission has been appointed that I know of to inquire into the future government of tlie Pacific Islands. The Commission recently appointed is dealing with New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, on outlines that She was unable to have already been-prepared. There is not much information in that Some of her sons fought in reply. In the first place, the Minister She reared a very tried to dodge the question by suggesting I had made a mistake in referring to the Pacific Islands instead of to New Guinea;. but if New Guinea is not a Pacific Island,. I do not know what it is. As a matter of fact, I think the Administrator of the Territory holds his commission as Administrator of the Pacific Islands. I do the honourable not wish to argue that point, but merely to show one phase of the question at this particular juncture. It was our soldier boys who wrested these islands from the enemy-wh o fought for them and cap-, tured them, and has enabled us to retain, them, ever since. If there is anything in. those islands, of which our returned soldiers would like to take advantage in the Government way of settlement, the way ought to be made smooth for them. I would not ask. soldiers to go there if they have no desire to do so, but I am given to understand that there is room for a very large soldier settlement, and that, without asking the men tospend the whole of their time there, a very decent living could be provided for at least 1,000. I have no complaint to make in regard to the personnel of the Commission, but there is the danger that these islands may pass into the hands of big companies or combines, whose only interest would be to develop them so as to provide openings for large speculations and exploitation.

Mr adventurous spirits prepared to take adLeach saysIn further explanation of the proposal contained in a recent issue of the Queenslander, that a carefully selected class of returned soldiers should be given preferential treatment in the matter of taking over the established German plantations in German New Guinea, some additional information is here given. Many people fail to realize the extent of our new. territory, or its productive capabilities, and these may be better impressed on the mind by a comparison'. German New Guinea has an area of 74,200 square miles, while Java has only 50,000 square miles. Yet the population of Java is given at .36,000,000, including 76,000 white people and 563,000 Asiatics, while German New Guinea has about 500,000 natives, 500 Asiatics, and 1,000 whites. The exports from Java are valued at £72,346,378, while from German New Guinea they are £604,340. Both countries are in the same latitude, have similar soils, climate, and natural conditions. Why, then, /should not German New Guinea be developed into a prosperous condition equal to Java*? It is only a matter of generalship (in another word, intelligence) that is called for. The following table will explain' the statistical relationship of the two countries at the present time:German New Guinea. Area (sq. miles) White population Asiatic Native Revenue .. £170,500 . . Expenditure.. . . £170,500 . . Imports Exports Java is perhaps the most flourishing producing country in the world at the present day, and that has been brought about during less than a century's administration. I quote these figures to show how splendid is the heritage we have in New Guinea, and I take the opportunity to put in a word for our boys who assisted in the capture of the islands from our enemy. freehold in Queensland the returned soldiers would prefer going there. by Mr Leach, and confirmed by others, that there is an immediate possibility of settling 1,000 returned soldiers there. There are 250,000 men returned, or returning, from the Front, and amongst those I am quite sure we could get 1,000 vantage of such an opportunity. This morning I asked the Postmaster General( Mr Webster), what was the reason for reducing the commission on the sale of postage stamps from 2-J per cent."" to 1 per cent., and the reply was one which I do not think proved satisfactory to the House. The honourable gentleman told us that he desired to get Australia into line with the rest of the world. My own opinion is that, if we can ""go one better"" than, the rest of the world, we ought to do so, and set an example. Goodness knows, 2^ per cent, on the sale of anything is not a big profit-it certainly cannot be called profiteering. This decision to reduce the commission will affect country places very severely, for it is a difficult matter to persuade people to undertake the sale of postage stamps. It means that a shopkeeper may have to make anything from 20 to 300 trips per day to his counter in order to sell postage stamps; and, from the departmental point of view, the proposal of the Postmaster-General is not sound business.

Speaking from memory, there' are in the city about eight such vendors of stamps, and some remain open until 8 p.m. I venture to say that they will refuse to sell stamps on a commission of ' only 1 per cent. If they do, the Postmaster-General's Department will have to employ another counter-hand at the local post-officfe, and the salary payable to such an officer would far exceed what the Department would have to pay the vendors on a basis of a 2^ per cent, commission. If a man takes to the post office a sheet of stamps which he has received in some business transaction, he does nofc get their f u l l face value. Department deducts 10 per cent. considers that 1 per cent, is sufficient to allow vendors of stamps, but those who wish to sell stamps at the post-office have to submit to a deduction of 10 per cent. I want the .Postmaster-General to review this matter with the object of ascertaining whether he is doing justice to. the people who purchase stamps, or to his own Department, by reducing the commission to the niggardly amount of 1 per cent. There is one other matter to which I desire torefer. Honourable members today have received a cartoon, which, no doubt, is very instructive. It bears no imprint, and I am thinking of reproducing it , and sending it out with some comments of my own. WhetherI do so or not, I shall make a few comments upon boughtother it in this House. The cartoon is in Goods with' tended to represent the old Dairy Produce Pool, and the object of .73 :. 19 those responsible for its issue is to .91 18 adversely criticise the proposed new 90 .. 25 scheme.

Another point is that when the Pool was first created, the proclaimed price of butter locally was 149s. 8d. per cwt., while the Imperial contract price was 1516. per cwt., plus one-half the profits made in London. Under that agreement, we received back from the Imperial Government £ 1 9 per ton, or over £575,399, and that amount was distributed amongst the producers, thus bringing up the price of butter exported to 170s. per cwt. I would ask the people The of Australia to say whether, if the agents It had bought this butter at 151s. per cwt., and on sending it to London had made a profit of 19s. per cwt., they would have returned that profit to the producers ? In addition to the saving of commission, to which I have referred, the Pool, or "" the g r a b "" depicted in this cartoon, were able to return to the producers a sum of over £575,399, representing one-half the profi t made in London under the Imperial contract. [4.22] I desire to refer to the speech made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) in regard to the costof the parliamentary refreshment rooms. I am convinced that his remarks",56,Maloney The Honourable Cent On The Child S 3d Ticket Although
262,Mr Richard Poster (Wakefield),"will convey to the public quite a wrong impression as to the actual position. Having been a member of the House Committee for a good many years. I'challenged his statements; but, not having seen a balance-sheet recently, I was not prepared at tlie moment to give the exact figures as to the loss, if any, involved in conducting the refreshment and billiard rooms. I had a very fair idea, however, of the actual position, and felt assured tliat the statements made by the honourable member -were calculated to convey a wrong impression. freshed my knowledge by a perusal of the balance-sheets. The balance-sheet <relatiog to the last financial year has not yet been audited, and, therefore, I shall not quote it. I shall refer only to the figures for the preceding year ; but I may say that the result in. respect of the last twelve months will be found to be very similar. The position is that no loss is -involved in connection with the refreshment and billiard rooms and the afternoon tea-rooms, which are available to members and their constituents. Every one knows that this is essentially a teadrinking Parliament. that we get. say that. I desire simply to give the facts, and I repeat that last year, instead of the refreshment, tea, and billiard rooms showing a loss, they showed an actual profit of £173. In arriving at that tical unanimity in accepting the position. result, I do not allow for wages. be absurd to bring in wages costs, and to say that the parliamentary refreshment rooms should be regarded in the light of an ordinary city refreshment-room, where three meals a day are served for six days in the week. We have to keep up a big staff of. waiters, and any loss sustained is not in respect of refreshments that are bought and paid for by members, but in relation to wages. There are no salaries involved. It is merely a matter of the wages of workmen engaged in connection with the rooms. We have to maintain a staff to provide luncheon and dinner for a full House; but, as honourable members are aware, the rooms are not fully used, on the average, for more than two days a week, and even then they are used for approximately, only six months in the year! The full staff is not maintained during the recess, but a considerable proportion of it has to be retained during the whole, of the year. If we had to show a profit, afteT providing for wages, we should have to dismiss all the men engaged in connection with the supply of meals, and close down, and honourable members would have to pick up a meal wherever they could obtain it in the city. Since theu, I have reso; and, even if the refreshment'rooms were closed to-morrow, one-half their number, perhaps, would have to be retained. I wish particularly to direct public attention to the fact that members of the Parliament pay for all the provisions obtained by them here. We pay the full cost. About five or six years ago it was found that the cost of providing meals was such that, unless increased charges were made, we were likely to get nearly, if not entirely, on the wrong side of the ledger. That was before the cost of living had increased; and the House Committee then insisted that the dining-rooms should be made to pay their way. We, therefore, increased the tariff. When we increased our prices in certain directions, only one or two took exception to our action. no desire to be personal. There was pracWith the soaring of prices, the House Committee determined that honourable members who made use of the rooms upstairs should pay everything their refreshments cost. Honourable members have done so, and I understand that this year the profit will be very similar to that which was made last year. In the matter of the balance-sheet, and as regards the conduct of the rooms, we compare more than favourably with any other Parliament in the Commonwealth. Nobody has been keener than our House Committee in exercising economy. The only alternative to our present system would be to copy what is done in South Australia by allowing a caterer to take over the whole of the refreshment rooms. But in that case we should have to find the crockeryware, furniture, and services, and the caterer would merely find the provisions, mak-",57,Maloney The Honourable Cent On The Child S 3d Ticket Although

I * am sure that the other members of the House Committee wil l join with me in saying that there is no waste, and that no item of expenditure could be eliminated. --To-da y the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) drew attemtion to the profiteering that is rampant in this country. It is the most vital matter affecting the people of Australia to-day.. Every housewife knows that day and night the profiteers are robbing her. The evidence taken before the Inter-State Commission when they inquired into the cost of groceries has been in the hands of the Government for twelve months, but no effort has been made by Ministers .to protect the public. The honourable member for New England (Lt -Colonel Abbott) and other honourable members representing country constituencies will agree that the increased charge for kerosene and benzine is purely profiteering. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -Hear, hear! But that is the result of tlie operations of the Standard Oil Trust. How would the honourable members propose to get at them ? answer that question directly, but w ill later; but I take the opportunity of pointing out that there is no duty on this article. The remedy that Free Traders suggest for defeating the operations of profiteers is to open our ports and deprive the local manufacturers of their local trade. in this way the public would get 'a cheaper commodity. B ut here is a case in which there is absolute Free Trade, and yet in no other commodity is the rura l community being pillaged as it is being robbed by the Standard Oil Company and other oil firms in the matter of the price of illuminants and motor power. kerosene reduce the price? pointing out that, although there is absolute Free Tradei n regard to kerosene, the people have to suffer in regard to that one item alone. I quote the following from the InterState Commission's report on groceries: The trade in kerosene and petroleum spirits for the Commonwealth is in very few hands.

Togetlier they control 98 per cent, of the. oil trade of Australia. The Vacuum Oil Company have a fair trade in merchandise contingent to their oil business, such as stoves, &c, but, in the opinion of the Commission, this would not materially affect the result.

275,Mr Penton,"The CommonwealthThey are selling it to the French Government, unless the French Government have oil wells elsewhere. Instead of loosening their grip on the community these people are going to tighten it by bringing the oil supplies of the world into still fewer hands, and, God knows, they are in few enough hands now. Here is the proposition as recently published in the press: Some American bankers have purchased 750,000 shares of common stock of the Shell Transport and Trading Company, the _ largest petroleum concern which is interested in most of the oil-producing centres of the world. It occupies much the same position in England as docs the Standard Oil Company in America. The price paid is said to be about 25,000,000 dollars, and the shares involved are of British denomination, having a par value of £1, and .are worth in London to-day £8 per share, which is equivalent to about 33 dollars in American currency. The Shell Transport and Trading Company's common stock outstanding amounts to £12,000,000, and its joint operations resulted in a strong combination of interests in oil lands in the Far East, Russia, Roumania, Mexico, Venezuela, and other countries. According to a recent official statement, the Shell Company's £24,000)000; its annual disbursements to shareholders, from 1913-1918, wore 35 per cent., and last year a 00 per cent, stock dividend was paid.

I hope a little later that we shall produce oil ourselves. Some time ago the Public Accounts Committee presented to the House a report pointing out the absolute necessity of the energetic development of I sliould think so. our oil resources, particularly in Papua. A month ago the Department of Home and Territories presented a memorandum to this Parliament regarding negotiations on' the subject between the British and Commonwealth Governments', and containing the following passage: A scheme was then drawn up in England, the outlines of which were cabled at the end of February. The main points of this scheme were:(1) A sum not. exceeding £100,000 was to be provided by the two Governments in equal shares. (2) The Australian Government was to submit the proposed sites for boring, with all information as to geological surveys. (3) The undertaking to be directed by a General Manager of British nationality, to be nominated by His Majesty's Government, and appointed by the Commonwealth Government. (4) Mineral oil and other products, if dis. covered in commercial quantities, to be worked in such manner as might -be mutually agreed for the joint benefit of both Governments. cash resources amount to (5j If the results aro negative, plant and other material to be sold and proceeds divided.

Some of those medicines may cost a little more now than the prices I have quoted. A lot of profiteering is going on in that matter, and the users of these cures are paying many hundred per cent, over and above the real values. The Government would do well to take in hand that question, and the oil question, which is most serious, both to those who use oil as an illuminant and those who use it for motive power. very important part, not only now, but in the near future. Our vessels, both naval and mercantile, will be mostly propelled by oil power, and so will our industrial machinery. This is a great opportunity for the Government, if they and their supporters profess in the smallest degree to be friends of the rural producers, to benefit the farmers by pouncing upon what has been declared by the InterState Commission to be a monopoly, and rescuing the public of this country from the claws of the monopolists. While agreeing with a.great deal of what the honourable member forMaribyrnong ( Mr Penton) has said, I still think it is time that honourable members opposite gave us a few suggestions as to how to cope with profiteering. Every member of the Committee desires to see the profiteer laid by the heels and treated as he should be, but we are a long time in getting at anything like a remedy. I do not think the Government are doing all they might do in the matter. It is time they got into closer touch with the State Governments. If a convention representing all phases' of political thought in the community, and not necessarily comprised wholly of politicians, were called together, they could decide what changes were feasible and necessary in the Constitution. If that were done, I believe the States would be only too glad to cede to the Commonwealth the powers recommended. Selling That is on the lines of the platform of the Price. National Pederation, and offers the quickest way' of arriving at definite results «. d. It would be far preferable to.the Government bringing down proposals for a whole 3 6 lot of referendums, or a very drastic referendum for constitutional changes.

A convention such as I suggest would probably devise the right. amendments to make in the Constitution in order to give this Parliament the power to deal with profiteering as it should be dealt with. liament should be supreme? I do. State House. That is your place. Oil is going to play a working under a Constitution, and I think the best friend of the Commonwealth, and. _ the States, too, is the man who will work according to his contract, and not attempt to grab from another agent,, who is also working for the public, that which is not rightly within his grasp. If the Government proceed in the way I have suggested, they will get the powers they need, and very, much more quickly than by means of a referendum. Suppose a referendum were taken without any arrangement with the State Parliaments, and 'the vote went against the Commonwealth? The whole question would then be put back for goodness knows how long; but if a convention were convened, and the State Parliaments ceded.the powers we asked for,'the position would be entirely satisfactory. If we launch out without consulting those who ought to be consulted, and withouthaving regard to the benefit of the people, we shall have only ourselves to blame if our proposal is not accepted.

We cannot afford to allow our latent minerals and oil resources to lie dormant for all time. If we do not display enterprise in this direction, I do not know where the Government will get the money required to meet all the claims that are pressing upon us. I am not satisfied with the action of the Government respecting the development of Australian oil-fields. Some years ago they entered into a contract with the Tasmanian Government to take 8,000 tons of oil per annum for naval purposes, but the Bill intended to enable the Government to do this failed to pass the Tasmanian Parliament, and when war came the Australian warships went to the other side of the world, where they did so much to uphold the honour of Australia. Subsequently, when the Commonwealth Government were approached to renew the contract, they declined to do so. Australian waters, and the Commonwealth Government are paying, I understand, more than £6 per ton for oil fuel. The people interested in the proposition to which I refer are anxious to renew the contract, and are hopeful of being able to float a company if the Commonwealth Government will give them a contract for 8,000 tons of oil per annum at a reasonable price, £4 10s. per ton being about the sum mentioned. This, of course, is considerably under the present price. understand, also, that the oil now being used is no better, if , indeed, it is as good, for naval purposes as the Tasmanian product. this company will lead to the employment of a large number of returned soldiers and other people in need of employment. We are only beginning to feel the pinch of our financial obligations. The worse, I believe, has yet to come. Our taxation burdens are not likely to be lessened, and, moreover, our resources are likely to be curtailed, because money which, in normal times, is used for the development of industries, is now required of the people for other purposes. I cannot understand why the Commonwealth Government do not give this company a little more encouragement. They appear to adopt a "" standoffish "" attitude towards this Australian industry; but I hope that I am mistaken, and that in a short time the Government will show that they are really interested in its development. I believe the Government will have to spend a tremendous amount of money in Papua before they get much of a return, though, if they strike good oil, they will soon' get all their money back, and very much more, too. But, so far as I can learn, no oil suitable for naval purposes has ever been found in Papua. It is far too valuable for that. duct shale oil? fuel oil. I believe the user can get more out of the gallon for motive purposes than out of the oil which is ordinarily used, and if Dr. Wade's estimate is correct, there is a big future for the Tasmanian shale proposition.

He has conscientiously performed his duties in the way which appeared to -him. to be best, as a true and ioyal Australian who has always placed Australia first. I commend the Prime Minister for having kept a stiff upper-lip wheni t came to talking about and defending that Australian ideal, which is so near and dear to the hearts of all of us> and which means so much to our national development, namely, the maintenance of a White Australia. ( Mr Webster) were present, I would offer a suggestion which has a bearing upon our White Australia ideal. W it h out any disrespect to our Sovereign, K in g GeorgeV . , I suggest, in view of the fact that the maintenance of a White Australia is so vital to Australians, that we revert to that good Australian symbol which formerly appeared upon bur postage stamps, namely, the figure of a kangaroo on a white Australia. I merely make that suggestion by the way, and I hope it will be remembered by the Postmaster-General, to whose poetical mind it Personmust appeal with all its patriotic significance. I desire to compliment the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) on his speech to-day, which is one of the best that has been delivered in this House. It dealt with a question which the Government have to face, and to answer. The Adelaide Register denies that there has We been any profiteering,and asks where it can be found ; but we all know the enhanced prices we have to pay to-day, and it is useless to requote figures on the subject. The honourable member for M a r iW e have given lots of byrnong ( Mr Fenton) gave us figures which are the result of investigations made by the Inter-State Commission; and if no action is to be taken on the report, It is not correct, as a why was the Commission ever appointed?

We have had commissions of inquiry into what were sometimes really silly matters; for instance, the Com-' I am glad the Prime mission appointed by the Senate to in quire into the effect of drink on our troops represented an absolute waste of He holds money. As I have said, we all know from practical, personal experiencethat there is profiteering in groceries, clothes, house rents, and so for t h , and the fact is made clear, not only by such statements as those of the honourable member for Hunter, but in the bi-monthly reports issued by Mr : Knibbs. From these we learn that the cost of living has gone up by 50 or 60 per cent. lower here than on the other side. appeal to me, and I do not think our standard of living should be gauged by the English standard.

We were led to believe that the war period would mean a time of travail to Australia and its inhabitants generally, and that production during that period would seriously decline. The w it h lirawal from industry of 400,000 men for the fighting line, alone, not to mention, those who formed contributory arteries to it , naturally involved some measure of sacrifice. Let me ask why the people of Australia should be bled in the way that they have been ? Many persons have submitted to it under the impression that the war was responsible for it . Only a few nights ago I happened to pick up a back number of Hansard, which was published during the early days of the war, and in it I read an interjection by the honourable member for Henty( Mr. Boyd) to the effect that there were contractors making huge fortunes out of the war. Yet the Commonwealth is going to pay 5J per cent, upon borrowed money, which is to be expended in helping the ""digger,"" and the Government hav.e the audacity to prin t a poster depicting a "" d i g g e r "" w i th the brass badge upon, his coat and. with his hand . in his pocket to finish the job.

In reply to the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) I say that if I owned those deposits they certainly would mean that I would be safe from want for all time. For all practical purposes in regard to the financing of the Commonwealth they can be used. If not, there is a Compulsory LoanB ill before Parliament which contains the mfeans for enforcing contributions to the Peace Loan if that course should be deemed necessary The honourable member for Robertson knows perfectly well that, in the words of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), the question of finance is one of financial legerdemain. The South Australian Register, in backing up its statement that the loan will be subscribed, quotes the increase of £102,000,000 in the trading banks deposits. If those deposits do not represent funds which can be Used t'hey do not represent cash. read tlie South Australian Register with interest, as well as the Labour daily which is published in Adelaide. There is a gentleman engaged in writin g for the former journal who was at one time chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

The suggestion that the inflated currency is responsible for tlie increase in prices means that profiteers have been fastening on to the -general body of the people, including our soldiers and their dependants.
