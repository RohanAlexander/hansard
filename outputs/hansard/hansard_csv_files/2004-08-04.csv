The funding formula is already based on I want to make four points about this need. The wealthier, less needy noncampaign and its dishonesty. The first point government schools receive 13.7 per centis that non-government schools do not get an less than 14 per cent-of the average govunfairly high share of public funding. The ernment school recurrent cost. It is a very nonsense that we heard from the member for small amount. The needier schools-those Jagajaga before tries to pretend that somepoorer Catholic schools and schools in how this government is favouring nongreater need-can receive up to 70 per cent government schools, particularly elite nonof the average government school recurrent government schools. The facts are simple: cost. So the level of public funding, first of public schools in Australia received last year all, is always less than 100 per cent of the $19.9 billion of combined state and federal level of public school funding. Secondly, the public funding; non-government schools, on proportion that is received depends on the the other hand, received $6.2 billion of publevel of need.

The fact is that public schools are contrary to the claims of the teachers unions, constitutionally the responsibility of state non-government schools actually save taxgovernments.

163,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r.,"Wednesday, 4 August 2004 ----Education: Funding to go to the polls. Many issues are very important to them, but one of the issues which I believe will be uppermost in the minds of many when they cast their vote, especially the people in the electorate of Oxley, is the future of Australia’s education system. All Australians quite rightly expect an education system that is second to none. That is why we in the Australian Labor Party have always been, and always will be, committed to building and maintaining an education system that is world class. Labor believes in providing quality education for all children, regardless of the school they attend, because a first-rate education is essential to ensure that Australia fosters a nation of achievers who will lead us throughout the 21st century. That is great news for the schools in my local area, which will benefit greatly under the policies of the Australian Labor Party. I recently received a series of letters from some of my constituents who are concerned about education funding. They indicated to me that a quality education system is extremely important to them. I agree with them. Let me assure these people, and indeed all the people of my electorate, that everyone in the Australian Labor Party considers a quality education system to be of paramount importance. A Latham Labor government would ensure that all schools in the Oxley electorate, and in fact in Australia, receive the funding they need to deliver the best outcomes for educating our children. That is why Labor will introduce a needs based funding system whereby all schools-government and non-government-strive to reach a strong national standard for resources and results. Our funding system will be good for all schools, regardless of where they are from. We will not be setting sector against sector. We will not be setting school against school. We will not be setting public against private. We will guarantee to maintain the overall level of funding for non-government schools. Labor also supports parents who choose non-government schooling for their children. It will provide public funding to all schools. Labor introduced major federal funding for non-government schools in the 1970s, and it extended this commitment through further increases under the Hawke and Keating governments. A Latham Labor government will continue that tradition. In the not too distant future Australians will be asked to choose between a tired, out-of-puff and out-of-ideas government, led by John Howard and Peter Costello, and a new, fresh approach to government that will provide opportunities for all Australians under the leadership of Mark Latham. When it comes to education, the differences between the two choices are stark. Labor will deliver a first-class education system-and it is widely acknowledged that Labor is the party for education. In contrast, under John Howard’s education policy many kids will miss out on a good education because their parents simply cannot afford it. For John Howard, the chequebook is more important than the textbook. For us in the Labor Party, all kids are equal, all schools are equal and everyone should have the same opportunitiesopportunities based on merit and hard work and not based on the size of their chequebooks or the limit on their credit card.

165,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (9.40 A.m.),"In a very short period of time Australians will be askedCasey Electorate: Warrien Reserve of environmental significance in Croydon North in the Casey electorate. Warrien Reserve was recognised by state and federal governments decades ago as a vital area of urban environmental concern, containing many native plants, birds, insects and animal species. Its committee of management and hard-working volunteers have protected, preserved and worked to enhance the area for more than 50 years. It has received numerous state and federal grants over that time. Recently, work has focused on preserving the habitat to protect a rare and endangered frog that has been discovered in the reserve. The preservation of the habitat of this area is now being threatened by inappropriate development, which is planned to occur on adjacent land next to the reserve. The history of this sorry story and the planning process involved at Bonnie View Road in Croydon North reads like a nightmare. In 1999 a subcontractor for Remington Homes, also known as Pivotel, illegally clear-felled and totally moonscaped more than 6,000 square metres of land that had been purchased. They did so without any permits whatsoever. In 2001 the subcontractor was convicted and fined $8,500 for that act. Video and photographic evidence taken by residents on the day shows urban environmental butchery on a massive scale. The council officer seeking to prevent the illegal act, who was just trying to do his job, was physically assaulted and removed from the site. The story gets worse. Just a few weeks ago the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal approved a 17-unit development on the site, overriding the Maroondah council and the views of the residents. It did so in spite of the illegal clear-felling and took the view that, because the land was now clear as a result of the illegal act, the development could go ahead. This muddle-headed logic does not just ignore illegal acts but actually rewards them. I believe the VCAT decision at Bonnie View Road was absurd. I believe it should be looked at again and overturned. Clearly, if the law in the case is defective, the state government and the planning minister at the state level, Mary Delahunty, should step in and rectify the deficient law so that planning processes do not reward environmental butchers of the type that we have seen. I would like to place on record my support for and admiration for many of the residents from the Warrien Reserve committee who have worked so hard over many years and will continue to work hard to preserve that environmental area-people like Paul and Marie Ward, David Pockett, Helen Moss and Keith Roper.

Unless the Howard government grants Concord hospital one of the remaining 20 MRI licences it announced almost two months ago on 9 June 2004, outpatients from my electorate will continue to be denied reasonable access to this fundamental health service.

167,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.46 A.m.),"TodayI again stand up for Concord Repatriation Gennouncement that a Latham Labor government will immediately grant Concord hospital an MRI licence. Those in the chamber will no doubt recall I have consistently raised this issue for more than two years. On 15 May 2002 I asked the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, to grant Concord hospital an MRI licence after visiting the hospital at the request of the then chief executive officer, Mr Matthew Daly, and the head of radiology, Dr Lloyd Ridley. Dr Ridley, in particular, explained the benefits of this equipment to me and asked me to investigate the possibility of Concord hospital receiving a licence to provide this important MRI service. Sadly, for two years the Howard government has refused this request. Again and again I have asked the government to grant Concord Repatriation General Hospital an MRI licence and allow it to provide Medicare-eligible MRI services. In answers to my questions on behalf of Concord hospital on 19 August 2002, 22 October 2002, 14 May 2003, 8 September 2003, 6 November 2003, 11 February 2004, 11 March 2004 and 11 May 2004, the government has over and over again failed to give any indication that it will grant the MRI licence. TodayI report that last week the government cynically tried to deceive the people of the inner west by circulating a leaflet titled ‘MRI machine for our local hospital’ that claims the Howard Liberal government will issue an MRI licence for our local hospital. Even if you can assume the Liberal Party is referring to Concord hospital, this is nothing more than a dishonourable attempt to salvage the government’s credibility on this issue by deliberately misleading my constituents. The Liberal Party bosses, who have no doubt forced my Liberal opponent to put his name to this piece of nonsense, should hang their heads in shame. TodayI have asked the minister to explain whether or not a decision on the MRI licence has been made, who has been informed of this decision and when it will be announced. Why will Concord hospital and the 9,972 constituents who have signed my petition be the last to know? I conclude by thanking everyone who has supported my campaign on this issue for the past two years. I particularly thank Mary Venchiarutti, John Pasqua and Diana Brough from Concord’s radiology department, Nigel and Caroline Freeman from Strathfield’s Foot Fix Clinic, the Inner West Courier and the tireless Milka Valdivia for their support throughout this campaign. On their behalf, I again ask the government to stop playing politics and immediately grant Concord hospital an MRI licence. Environment: Indian Myna Bird and Resources) (9.49 a.m.)-I raise a matter that is critical to our environmental future. Far North Queensland is currently under attack from a plague of common or Indian myna birds, a bird listed in the top 100 chart of the most invasive species in the world. This introduced exotic species is spreading at an alarming rate. Not only are the Indian mynas capable of wiping out most of our native bird species but they are a major threat, through parasites and disease, to many of our native mammal species which nest in tree hollows. Can you imagine a country without parrots, without sugar gliders and feather-tailed gliders? Unless something is done, this is the future that we face. Ideally, our state and territory governments could declare the Indian myna a pest, but they are reluctant to do so and it is not hard to see why: the costs would be quite substantial. UnMAIN COMMITTEE",159,Statements By Members
168,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourismfortunately, I am also getting the message that there are some in the Queensland state government who believe there is no known or proven method of efficient eradication-but really this is not an excuse to sit back and do nothing. There has to be a way of controlling and eradicating these birds, but it will take time and consolidated effort. Judging by the overwhelming response of the people of Leichhardt, they not only want to do something now but they are very keen to get involved and they certainly want to help. Last week in CairnsI launched an Indian myna minimisation program, using a trap designed by Dr Chris Tidemann of the Australian National University. ‘Overwhelming’ is the only word to describe the response received from the Cairns community-from local wildlife and environmental groups, the Cairns City Council and local businesspeople. These are people like Andy Anderson and Dick Bolton from the Bird Observers Club of Australia, and Ian Clayton, the environmental coordinator for the Cairns water and sewage treatment plant. Ian and his site manager, Vern Atkinson, are monitoring a trap that I set at Cairns sewage treatment plant, which is home to literally thousands of Indian myna birds. Bob Boneham, the owner of a commercial enterprise, Amalgamated Pest Control, in Cairns was actually one of the first to call me as soon as he knew that we had a trap that was designed to catch Indian mynas. I have spoken to the minister for the environment and will be seeking funding to continue the research of Dr Tidemann into the development of a trap capable of catching an entire roost of up to 1,000 birds at one time; and I will be calling on my fellow members of parliament to recognise the very serious environmental problem that needs to be taken up to fight to control the Indian myna bird, not just in Cairns but also right throughout Australia. I will be calling also on state governments to assist. They must assist by declaring the common Indian myna bird a noxious pest and start to put their hands in their pockets, not sit back and say, ‘No, there’s nothing we can do, because it’s too hard.’ We have to do it and we have to do it now. (Time expired) Medicare: Safety Net Threshold Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.52 a.m.)-I, like many members of this parliament, have had numerous complaints made to me since the introduction of the government’s so-called Medicare safety net. My office has been inundated with complaints, and when I am in shopping centres people are constantly approaching me and telling me how the system does not work for them. The complaints that I receive from people are that they will never become eligible for the safety net because the number of times they visit the doctor will not bring them to the $300 or $700 safety net limit. I have also received complaints that doctors are restructuring their fees to take advantage of the safety net. I also receive complaints from people who do not understand the system and feel that they are being misled by the government. But no complaint I have received is worse than the one I am going to share with the House today. A pregnant woman, Marie, who lives within the Shortland electorate, has emailed me her concerns about the new Medicare safety net. She starts by pointing out to me that this was designed to ease the medical burdens on families. She is a young woman who is on maternity leave after having her third child, and they are really struggling for dollars. As a family with young children they visit the doctor and pharmacies quite regularly and their medical expenses are high. She registered with the Medicare safety net as soon as the legislation passed through this parliament and was most disappointed when she found out that she would not MAIN COMMITTEE qualify for it immediately, simply because she has deferred her family payment costs from Centrelink until tax time. She did this because she was constantly being sent debts. Due to the unworkable nature of the system, she thought that it was much better to deal with it that way. So, because she is getting her family tax payments in that manner, the system does not recognise that she is receiving family tax payments and she will not be eligible to receive the safety net until 2005. She has already incurred over $300 in medical costs and she feels that this is very unfair. In 2005, she will be in exactly the same position because, once again, she will not be eligible until she puts in her tax return. She feels this is very unfair on families. It is another example of the government disregarding families and also an example of the unworkable nature of the Medicare safety net. It is proof why the government needs to embrace Medicare and increase bulk-billing-not undermine the system. (Time expired) Medicare: Safety Net Casey Electorate: Environment remarks in recognising some important environmental volunteers in the electorate. But, before I do that, I will respond to the previous speaker. I trust that the previous speaker will not in any way mislead her constituent and that she will email her constituent back with Labor’s policy on the safety net, which is to abolish the safety net from day one of a Latham Labor government. It is all very well for the previous speaker to come in here and talk about the safety net and the ability to access it in time, but the bottom line is that the Labor Party will abolish that safety net. They will remove it from hundreds of thousands of families who have signed up and are accessing it at the moment. They will take away a financial benefit in the health system from families and people right across the board. I will now follow on from my earlier remarks in recognising some environmental volunteers. I mentioned Warrien Reserve in my earlier contribution. I would also like to mention some important work that is going on at the nearby Hochkins Ridge Flora Reserve, where a similar group of volunteers are working very hard to enhance that urban bushland. They have worked hard over a number of years but have recently put together, with the aid of some federal government funding through the Envirofund, a detailed pamphlet outlining many of the native plants and wildflowers and listing some of the dangerous introduced weeds. This pamphlet includes many photographs taken by Helen Moss, who is a dedicated environmentalist in the area. The pamphlet is designed as an educational tool and has been distributed to all of the nearby schools. This is an example of some very practical environmentalism, where some of the hard working volunteers have sought, with the assistance of a partnership with the federal government, to spread the understanding and knowledge of the local environment so that people in Croydon North and in the Casey electorate can be environmentally aware and know of the very strong environmental areas that are there that can be witnessed. For the schoolkids to have such a pamphlet is fantastic. It is a tribute to all of those who worked to put it together. It is a first-class publication, and I hope that it can be a model for many other environmental groups not only throughout the Casey electorate but also throughout the Dandenong Ranges and the rest of Victoria.

Dr Henry Alfred, AM Debate resumed from 3 August, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the paper. presence of my friend the member for Scullin. I was fortunate to attend the funeral of his father, the former Speaker and former member for Scullin, in South Morang. As the member for Melbourne Ports, I have been to many funeral services of a great many notable people, but I do not think I have been to a funeral service where there was such a comprehensive account of the person’s life, particularly his family life. His life was outlined in the most moving way by his daughter and by his grand-daughter, who spoke on behalf of Wendy, Mrs Jenkins senior. The speech by the national or state-I am not sure-president of Lions also showed an aspect of former Speaker Dr Jenkins’s life that was incredibly interesting. It is very difficult to combine public life and parliamentary responsibilities with an interest and a continuing involvement in an organisation like Lions International, but here was an example of a person who managed to combine both community service and parliamentary service. I thought it was very interesting that in a former Labor government we had five doctors, and there was a very interesting account of the move from general practice into politics. It was also very interesting that Mrs Jenkins had not wanted to marry a doctor or a politician but ended up doing just that. As I said, it was one of the most moving memorial services I have been to and-I am about to cede to the member for Batman on this condolence motion-an account of someone’s life the like of which I have not heard at many other funeral services, with the integration of his political, community and family life. It was one of the most moving services I have been to. tion for the late Dr Harry Jenkins, I would like to speak on behalf of not only myself and my family but also a large section of the electorate that I currently represent which was previously represented by the late Dr Harry Jenkins. In historical terms, in 1969 there was a redistribution which saw the proposal to abolish the seat of Darebin and move the seat of Scullin further into the northern suburbs of Melbourne. As a result of a local campaign, the seat called Darebin disappeared and the seat of Scullin was effectively re-created in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. It is interesting to note that a large section of that new seat of Scullin was actually what is now represented by the seat of Batman, which existed at the time but covered, to a large extent, an entirely different geographical area. Part of that also included the seat of Reservoir, which was represented by Dr Jenkins in the Victorian Legislative Assembly for eight years, from 1961 until he resigned in 1969, when he contested and won the federal seat of Scullin. I also note in passing that in the same year, 1969, the new seat of Prospect was established in the western suburbs of Sydney, which is where I grew up and which was not that different to the area I now represent in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. By strange coincidence, it was then expected that my father, who was a friend of Dr Jenkins, would be elected as the MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Statements By Members

172,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.01 A.m.),"In speaking to the condolence monew federal member for Prospect, but as a result of a discussion with his wife, Mary, it was decided that, as he had five children of school age, he would remain in the state parliament, whereas Dr Harry Jenkins left the state parliament and chose to represent in the federal parliament the area he had always lived and worked in. As the current member for Batman, I know that what Dr Jenkins said in his maiden speech really is a statement of how he cared about the region. He referred to the fact that he resided for most of his life in the electorate he represented and noted that the area was ‘very much a cross-section of urban Australia, with people from all walks of life pursuing their day-to-day activity with the hopes and aspirations that we have come to expect from Australians’. From my work as the current member for BatmanI know that he was a good and loyal representative in the state and federal parliaments. More importantly, he was also exceptionally well regarded for his community work and his work as a medical practitioner. I acknowledge that Dr Jenkins worked as a medical practitioner in that area with the father of the late Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon, who unfortunately passed away at an early age. Around the community of Reservoir a lot of the more elderly citizens fondly remember the medical work of both Dr Harry Jenkins, whose practice was in Thornbury, and the father of the late Jim Bacon. They were distinguished and well-respected medical practitioners. In his maiden speech Dr Jenkins talked about issues that were very much part of the nature of the debate we confront today: the importance of health care, Medibank and Medicare, and the issue of the environment and conservation. These are issues that I am pleased to say his successor, Harry Jenkins junior, has pursued with rigour not only in the Main Committee of the House and the House of Representatives but, importantly, in the work of the committees of the House. His father, as a long standing member of the House of Representatives, did what he could to promote and develop the committees to ensure that they received the recognition and respect they deserve as part of the day-to-day workings of the House. I understand from his parliamentary career that he not only served the Labor Party well but also served the committee structure well through the positions he held as a representative of the Labor Party and the various offices and positions he held in the House of Representatives. He did not just contribute to major debates on issues that we still deal with today such as health care and the environment. As part of its work the Procedure Committee, of which I am a member, has produced a report about how we might relax the rules governing the televising and broadcasting of parliament. This is an issue that is always fraught with danger because there are some people in the House of Representatives who believe they should not be exposed to as much public scrutiny as others believe. Dr Jenkins was credited with relaxing the rules governing the televising and broadcasting of parliament to allow their use by news services, and he proposed the unit which continually televised both houses, with media outlets able to use the footage when they wanted. I am pleased to say that in the recent parliamentary break a report of the Procedure Committee was released out of session which suggested that we build on the breakthrough achieved by Dr Jenkins when he was the Speaker, which was really aimed at trying to further make the House the people’s house and subject to greater scrutiny and accountability of the people who have the privilege to actually serve in the House of Representatives. Like the current Speaker, Dr Jenkins was required from time to time to discipline people. It pleases me no end to note that in 1984 he had the pleasure and the privilege of disciplining the MAIN COMMITTEE current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, associated with backbenchers Wilson Tuckey and Alan Cadman. I would like the Treasurer to nominate which of those three who were removed from the House on that day deserved it and which two he believed behaved out of character. It is not for me to suggest which of those people would be nominated by the Treasurer. More seriously, can I say that Dr Jenkins made a very important contribution to this House. I am pleased to note that not only was he a long standing, proud member of the Australian Labor Party but he also was a member of my own union, the Miscellaneous Workers Union. He brought to this House not only an understanding of his work as a medical practitioner and a commitment to the people he represented but also something that we regard as exceptionally important; that is, membership of the Labor Party and also our affiliates, in this instance my own union-which I had the privilege to serve as national secretary-the Miscellaneous Workers Union. Let me now talk about Harry Jenkins’s service in the Labor Party. Some years ago when the Left first decided that it had to establish a national organisation, people such as the then Senator Gietzelt suggested that we had to be very careful about forming such an organisation. When some of the interstate national meetings were held, people would travel on different planes so as not to create the impression that there was any real organisation. I understood from discussions around the breakfast table and reports about some of these meetings when I was much younger that when my father travelled interstate to attend some of these meetings it was Dr Harry Jenkins who was given the responsibility of picking him up from Melbourne Airport and returning him to Melbourne Airport at the end of those meetings, which probably explains the first contact between our two families in different cities. On behalf of myself, my family and my electorate, I express to the Jenkins family our sincere gratitude for the sacrifices they made in allowing Dr Harry Jenkins to serve the northern suburbs of Melbourne. He served with distinction. His capacity to make a contribution to this House was assisted by the sacrifices that his family made because of the nature of the job that we do as members of the Commonwealth parliament. I would also like to express my sympathy to his wife and family. I, like the member for Melbourne Ports, was fortunate to attend the memorial service on Monday to see what a wonderful extended family he had and also to see the wide attendance by a broad range of community representatives, which was a very public statement about the respect they had for Dr Harry Jenkins. As a member of our great party, the Australian Labor Party, I want to say that Dr Harry Jenkins served us with distinction. We are all the better for having had him as a member of our party. He has left a mark not only on the parliament but also on the Australian Labor Party and all the community organisations that he served, both within Australia and internationally. I extend my condolences to the Jenkins family and thank the House for the opportunity to make these remarks to acknowledge the passing of a great Labor representative. not the best SpeakerI have served under, there were none better. It is always perilous, I am sure members will agree, to compare modern-day champions with those of the past, because of all the differing circumstances and contexts. We often like to think that Lonhro is the great race champion of the turf today and to compare him to Kingston Town and others of a different generation, but such comparisons are next to impossible to make because you cannot line them up. And so it is with a Speaker of 20 years ago compared with a Speaker of today. MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Condolences
173,Mr Mcgauran (Gippsland,"Minister for Science) (10.12 a.m.)-If Harry Jenkins wasI think that Harry Jenkins had a number of factors in his favour that have made him one of the great Speakers since Federation. For example, he was coming on the back of Speaker Snedden, who, as much by personal estrangement from the Prime Minister of the day as anything else, had established a strong reputation as an independent Speaker, so there was more of an assumption within the parliament that a Speaker was considerably detached from his or her party of allegiance. Also, the parliamentary tradition of the time was much stronger than it is today. The Speaker’s authority was largely unquestioned-frequently tested, to be sure, during the course of a parliamentary day but never outrightly challenged with the same degree of frequency as it is today. Even taking that into account, Dr Harry Jenkins was a brilliant Speaker, because he also had a number of factors working against him which current-day Speakers do not have to cope with. For instance, the parliamentary chamber in Old Parliament House was very small. It is something that those of us who served in it miss enormously. You could see the whites of the eyes of your opponents. Parliamentary debate was up close and personal in those days. You could almost reach out and touch your opponent. opponent on the opposite side, as in a notorious incident. Consequently, it was more of a hothouse, and I mourn its passing. It was a true debating chamber in which little quarter was given and none asked for. The temperature was a lot higher in those days and that added to an atmosphere of cut and thrust, so I think emotions ran a lot hotter in those days than they do now in our very big chamber with its degrees of separation and almost emotionless form of debate. In those days, people were passionate and were fierce, and Dr Jenkins had to cope with the hothouse. Also, Dr Jenkins had a cabal of very difficult members to deal with who had come in in the 1983 election: Gerry Hand, John Saunderson, Pete Steedman, Pete Staples-all of whom gathered in the one area up towards the back of the Old Parliament House across a narrow aisle from me and the National Party. They were unrestrained in their exuberance and their challenge of the traditions and authority of the House. That was not just in dress, although it is now legendary-and I am sure other members have spoken of it-how Pete Steedman would come in in his leather jacket and no tie, and there was the incident cited yesterday in the House about Peter Staples wearing a colourful cardigan; I have a faint recollection of that. But also Steedman would challenge Dr Jenkins with extravagant or, to put it more accurately, foul language and Dr Jenkins would not turf him out. I am afraid that some of the worse words in kins. He would not hear them, deliberately so. He had to control them and he did it extremely well, with patience and with a great deal of shrewdness. Then there were people like Alan Griffiths and John Brumby, who, seated in a different section of the parliament, would also vigorously contribute to debate. Dr Jenkins was founded in the great traditions of the Westminster debating style and context, but he had a large number of members who came in determined to bring down that edifice and remove any remnants of the suggestion it was a club where members treated each other more as friends than foes. He did it, as has already been touched on by every speaker, by dint of personality. He was a kindly person, to be sure, and he had great humour. I still reMAIN COMMITTEE",165,Condolences

176,"The Swear Book Were Used By Pete Steedman, And Occasionally By Others, To Provoke Dr Jen","member an almost conspiratorial laugh. He loved almost to giggle with you as an aside, and you felt a degree of intimacy with and confidence in him that some people can engender by sheer force of personality and humour. He was a truly fine person. He was boyish in some ways, but he was not a weak man. He had a pronounced limp, and I always felt he was in pain, so he would snap, either in the chair or outside, if you were unreasonable. BecauseI was so young and new, I saw him as a person of more advanced years and I, for one, would back off. When Dr Jenkins needed to assert the authority of his office, he would not hesitate a nanosecond to do so. Nobody ever thought they could use Dr Jenkins’s natural humour and gentleness to push him to breaking point. He was an authoritative Speaker. My other great recollection is of his wife, Wendy, who was so often with him. In fact, I struggle to think of Dr Jenkins without thinking of Mrs Jenkins. She came to Canberra a great deal, to the extent that her family commitments and obligations allowed, and I would often see them as a couple. They were very close, as is evident from their close family unit, and I extend to Mrs Jenkins my heartfelt sympathy for her terrible loss. In the end, if you had to point to one factor in Dr Jenkins’s career that brought together these different strands-personality, high office and local member-it would be that his appointment as Ambassador to Spain met not a skerrick of criticism. There was not even a whisper of ‘jobs for the boys’, either privately or publicly. It was welcomed by the opposition. I do not know of many other appointments of that kind that would have been endorsed so unanimously. On our side we thought it was a great appointment and that he would do Australia proud. He certainly did that for the relatively short time that he was able to fulfil his duties as Ambassador to Spain. In conclusion, Dr Jenkins’s memory will never leave me or those who served under him or, in the case of his Labor Party colleagues, with him. He was an outstanding Speaker who takes his place among the very great Speakers. The true explanation for his success as a Speaker and as a local member was his personality, values and deep convictions. Personally and on behalf of The Nationals, I wish to extend an expression of sympathy to his son, Harry-the incumbent member for Scullin-and his family. As a postscript, I note that Dr Jenkins was never to be underestimated. He was obviously a shrewd and professional politician. On our side, at least, we never expected that his successor would be his son, Harry. Maybe it was the talk of the Labor Party, but it was certainly not canvassed publicly. I can remember that the newspapers of the time spoke of some of the high-profile possibilities to succeed Dr Jenkins. It was confirmation, if you like, of our admiration for Dr Jenkins as a true pro that he was able to work with his son to get the best candidate into the seat, notwithstanding anybody coming in from the outside. Dr Jenkins, as Speaker and as a Labor Party operative, was never to be underestimated either as a man or as a professional. generosity of spirit that is sometimes seen in this House on these occasions but which is sometimes strained. Often when this House loses somebody who has given significant service, there is respect for the achievement of the person who has died, but that is also tinged with the fact that the person has been bloodied and has bloodied others in the political process. In remarks that have been made on all sides of the House, no reserve has been expressed about the admiration and affection that was felt for Dr Jenkins. WhilstI did not serve in this MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Condolences
177,Mr Kerr (Denison) (10.23 A.m.),"This condolence debate has been conducted with aHouse with him, on a number of occasions I had the pleasure of meeting him, usually in the company of his son, the present member for the seat, and felt a little of why people would have such high regard for him. Dr Jenkins’s intuitive reaction to meeting somebody with whom he had previously had little contact was to reach out to find common ground with them, do everything he could to make that person comfortable, assist them on issues they were concerned about and give them friendly advice. That was certainly my experience of Dr Jenkins, and I have quite a lasting memory of him. I can picture his face and how he related to me and those around him, even though those occasions were less frequent than they would be, for example, for other people who have spoken. I chose to speak today because I was unable to attend the funeral in Melbourne and I thought that it would be inappropriate not to express a regard for Dr Jenkins on a very personal basis. I know that he had a very large record of achievement as a Speaker in this House. When I first entered this parliament it was shortly after he had left. His successor was elected at a by-election immediately before I entered, and so Harry Jenkins junior and I were amongst a group of members who had a lot to do with each other in those early years. But the reputation of his father, Dr Jenkins, was very large in the place. It was a very well-regarded reputation then and it remains so. I heard some things I did not know in the remarks from the member for Batman about Dr Jenkins’s part in the genesis of the Left. Sadly, despite the enormous efforts of his successor and his skilful administration of the affairs of the Left, it is no longer the case that it is necessary to travel in separate aircraft to demonstrate sometimes the disorganisation of our faction. But, that aside, I really have learned nothing that I did not know already about Dr Jenkins, because everybody has in the past spoken of him with such high regard. When I met him, he was struggling with giving up smoking, something that I too struggle with. I gave up for a period of 11 years and then foolishly thought one night, at a time when I was less sober than I normally am-and I am a very rare and occasional drinker-‘I’ll have a cigarette. It won’t do me any harm. I can put it down again. In 11 years I’ve not had one.’ I have been struggling with the habit since then-for the last seven years. Dr Jenkins was a lifelong smoker. He was struggling with the habit because of his health. He knew that it was bad for him, and I saw him go through a succession of different devices to try to deal with his craving. I think he ended up with a cigarette holder which contained no cigarettes and no nicotine substitutes but which at least assuaged the sense that he had to go through the motions of smoking. It was quite a strange sight to see Dr Jenkins with his empty cigarette holder, puffing away occasionally but to no effect, as a result of his continual battle with tobacco. We in this parliament are still working through some of the related issues about putting in place policies which do the utmost to discourage people from taking up cigarette smoking because sadly, once a person does take it up-as the experience of Dr Jenkins and my own experience testify to-it is very difficult to abandon it entirely, even when one has persuaded oneself that one has. I too want to say something about the affection and love that was given to Dr Jenkins by his wife, which has been reflected on and remarked on. I think it was a great sadness for the family when Dr Jenkins had to go into a nursing home. If it had not been necessary, it would not have happened. I think it distressed his wife as much as it distressed Dr Jenkins. It was very touching to hear the present member for Scullin indicate the pleasure that his father got MAIN COMMITTEE from representing him on an odd occasion or two. Even when he was in a nursing home and quite frail, he was still able to do some kind of public service by representing the current member for Scullin in proceedings-for example, with the RSL. In conclusion, all I would say is that few people will ever leave this place with the affection and goodwill that Dr Jenkins left it with. Few people generate the kind of instantaneous affection and respect that he did, and few people will go with so little insincerity in the high tribute that is being paid to them by members on all sides of this parliament after their passing from it. with this motion today and with my colleagues’ generous remarks about the late Dr Harry Jenkins. As one who had the opportunity of serving with him from 1973 until he left the parliament, I was with him when we were in government, when he was Speaker, and I regarded him very much as a friend. It is something that is not often spoken of, but people that you travel with from time to time often become better known to you than others with whom you do not have that opportunity. I can remember back in 1982-it is perhaps a new story-travelling as part of a delegation with some other members to Pakistan and India. We were there at the time of Ramadan. I do not think I was taking enough water and was significantly dehydrated during that timesomething that I was not very aware of. I went later to join another delegation in the Cook Islands-it was only a matter of the passing of several weeks; Harry Jenkins and I were both there representing the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. We had our opening ceremony and I had to excuse myself; I suddenly found that I was experiencing excruciating pain-I am told it is the male equivalent of childbirth. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjectingbirth, and I can see that. I went to my room and was lying on the bed in absolute agony, sweating profusely. Somebody had grabbed Harry to come around and offer a diagnosis. He walked into the room, looked at me and said ‘renal colic,’ and walked out. I had been given a perfectly good diagnosis, I can tell you. A local doctor then came around and was getting ready to cut me open to relieve the pain and suddenly it just finished: the stone passed. I managed to retrieve it and it was subjected later to some analysis and I have not had renal colic since, so we clearly know it was related to my period of dehydration. I do not know how many of us experienced Harry as a very competent medical practitioner, but he was certainly able to diagnose that matter very quickly and very professionally-but I suspect he had a fairly detached bedside manner. The only other comment I would make is that those who know my family know that I do not suffer the debilitative, degenerative disease that my late father suffered, and so I relate very much to the fact that Dr Harry Jenkins suffered a debilitative condition that made service much more difficult. For that reason I admired him even more, because I have seen what demands such a disease places on the human body and what is required. He demonstrated not alone by his service in this parliament, his service to his electorate and his service to the nation but by his willingness to be engaged-particularly in the Lions movement, which involvement he kept on after he left this place-that public service for which we can greatly admire him.

But I do want to be associated with this condolence motion and the remarks of my colleagues and to say that I regarded Dr Harry Jenkins as a friend. I admired him greatly and I admired what he was able to do and achieve. To Wendy, I send my personal regards and those of my wife, Heather. To young Harry-I know we can refer to him that way now; I heard the Speaker do so yesterday and I almost chastised him-we feel for you; we greatly admired your dad. ated with this motion. I am standing alongside Harry’s son. He graces this chamber and has many of the attributes of his father; he may not know that. His father was a tremendously fair person and a man who revered this institution of ours, a man who understood its workings inside out. It was a privilege to serve with him. I listened to ‘young Harry’, as the speaker before me described him, yesterday in the chamber and thought that it was with enormous dignity that he carried that off. As somebody who faces the possibility of having to do something similar myself if I stay much longer in this chamber, electorate willing, I guess that I could learn a very great deal from the way in which the current member for Scullin handled the sad demise of the former member for Scullin. I served five years with Dr Harry Jenkins in our parliament. I came in 1980 and, from recollection, he left in 1985. I can remember his presence in the caucus. He had a reputation when he came into the federal parliament. Life was tough in the Victorian state parliament. It was an era in which, if you were a state member, you did not have staff, and library resources were limited. To be a person who made an impact in a state legislature was very difficult indeed, and most of our people did not. It was a hopeless state, from the Labor Party’s point of view, in which Victorian state politics found itself for the best part of 30 years. It was a vale of tears for somebody who was an opposition member in the Victorian parliament. Harry made a reputation as a man who knew how to fight in parliament. He was a tough-minded operator, a person who looked to his constituents but also looked to his constituents’ needs and understood how they might be filled by a better performance overall by the state government. I understand-I was not in Victorian politics-that Harry’s tough reputation was one of the reasons why he was so readily endorsed for entry into the federal parliament, and he graced us with his presence. When he was here, another side of Harry Jenkins was seen: the man of standing orders, the man of parliamentary procedure, the man who had such a profound belief in the good that the chamber of the House of Representatives could do in itself, for the ordinary citizen of Australia, by being the sort of chamber that teased out the essence of every issue that it considered, teasing it out because ordinary members of parliament were well treated. That was Harry Jenkins’s view. When he was Speaker, Harry Jenkins attempted to implement that view. A quorum having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.39 a.m. to 10.44 a.m. was at that point in my remarks when I was remembering the fair and erudite way in which Dr Harry Jenkins chaired the proceedings of our chamber, the House of Representatives. An abiding memory I have of him is of the frustrated look that he could get on his face, occasionally patting the side of the chair, when saying to honourable members, ‘You’re not helping the MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Condolences

Ichair.’ If there was an expression that became most associated with his Speakership it was, ‘You’re not helping the chair’-and indeed no-one was. No-one was helping the chair, and that was very unfair because, if ever a chair deserved help from the assembled ranks of the House of Representatives, it was him. Subsequent to his service in the House, he became an ambassador of this nation and served the nation well. We have great reason as a party to remember his service with gratitude and we have reason as a parliament to remember his service with admiration. We can see an example in the view he held of the significance of the House of Representatives chamber and occasionally in our cynicism let that float through our veins. It is that sort of view that is a restorative, not simply for good temper but also for a good sense of what it is that we are about and how important the things we do are. I extend my deepest sympathies to all of Harry’s family, but particularly to my colleague the member for Scullin, who himself is building up an admirable reputation for exactly the same attributes that his father possessed and exhibited so abundantly in this place. make some remarks. Debates such as this have been very helpful not only to me but also-as I found in conversation last night-to my family. I thank the honourable members for Melbourne Ports, Batman, Denison and Brand and the Minister for Science and the Attorney General for their remarks today. It has been very helpful to have the observations of others. The member for Melbourne Ports made some very interesting third-party observations of the thanksgiving service. His observations were very helpful: that, in an attempt to convey the nature of dad, we did that with some success; and that the people who gathered together were a cross-section of the people whom my father had touched along the way-from representatives of many ethnic communities that are in the areas that we represent through to long-term family friends and distant family relations. The member for Batman gave a very generous and gracious outline of the respect that dad has in the areas that he represents-but of course dad had represented for a long time at both state and federal level. The sincerity of his expression of wishes on behalf of the Ferguson family was very much appreciated. As Martin said, that is a generational thing-it is a fact; we do not turn our back on it; that is the way it is-and it has been very important to us. The Minister for Science was really overwhelmingly gracious, and I know that he talked with great sincerity about my father and my father’s time as the Speaker when the Minister for Science was a younger version of the ‘Ginger’ that I know now. We both have that hair colouring, and he has allowed me from time to time to refer to him by that nickname. He made some interesting reflections about the great battles down in the old chamber. He did not refer it to it this way but it was the Moscow corner and cockies corner-and it was very willing. As Peter said today, it was close and it was very willing. It was the furthermost point in the chamber from the chair, so sometimes dad honestly did not know what was going on there. He knew because jaws were flapping that there was some serious combat on, but it was just a bit difficult in the hurly-burly. The then National Party member for Fisher, who is now the Liberal Party member for Fisher, used to get into trouble. I have told him that the Speaker’s Gallery was behind cockies corner. My mum used to sit in the Speaker’s Gallery and, because my dad really did not know what was going on, my mum, bless her soul, would point at who she thought were the transMAIN COMMITTEE",170,Condolences
182,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (10.46 A.m.),"I thank the chamber for this further opportunity togressors. On one occasion, this meant Peter Slipper got outed because my mum had dobbed him in. But I did appreciate that, on behalf of the National Party-among whose members Dad developed many friends in his time here-the Minister for Science came to the Main Committee to make the comments he did. It was interesting to hear the member for Denison because, whilst he was not here while Dad was here, he talked about the times that he had actually met him and the generosity of spirit that Dad gave with his time in listening and communicating with people, which is a reflection that many have made. Dunc also mentioned Dad’s struggle with giving up smoking. He finally did it in his 70s and, as Duncan describes, it was not just the nicotine aspect of the habit, it was having something to do with his hands; it helped once he got that under control. The little holder went with him-it was placed in the casket-because that was very much something that was the nature of the Dr Harry that we knew in the end. But it was a struggle. I had patients that came to me and said, ‘Your dad gave great advice. He said, “Stop smoking and you will feel a lot better.” I have given it away and, gee, life is much better. There is one thing that puzzles me: he’s still smoking. What is the problem?’ Really, it was in Dad’s makeup. It was just such a hard struggle and, as I said, he did not really do it until his 70s. Of us all, the Attorney-General has had the longest association, in a parliamentary sense. I have had opportunity to talk to him about his association with Dad in the past. I appreciated his remarks. I knew that he would have been thinking of us on Monday and I appreciate that he came here. I will not enter into a debate on the side of the Attorney-General with the member for Mackellar about the pain of a kidney stone but, having suffered one, if it is compared to childbirth-and it is not quite-it does make an interesting discussion. Certainly, that was a talk that, unfairly, perhaps breaching patient confidence, I had with my dad about the incident in the Cook Islands. Phil talks about Dad’s ability to diagnose and his bedside manner. He actually displayed all that up until the end. I was in emergency at the hospital when he came in and he was being dealt with and everything. He was suffering from pneumonia and he said, ‘I have got a pain here in my left side. I think it will be the lower lobe of my lung that is congested.’ Off he went to have the X-ray. Up goes the X-ray. Which lobe of the lung has got the cloudy stuff?-I am not into the techo things. He was absolutely right, and he had been able to do that. The young doctor who attended him right to the end had only really known him a matter of hours, but in talking to the family he said, ‘I think he was giving me cheek. Actually, I think he ticked me off’-and he probably did. With the professionals dealing with him, he would always be offering his advice about what he thought they should be doing. The member for Brand referred to Dad’s state service and the lack of resources. I can remember when either the front porch or the front den was the electorate office and constituents would knock at the front door. There was no assistance; we dealt with them at home. Mum, who had keyboard skills, was the only secretarial support that Dad had in those days-and it was a very difficult period. It was that 25 years of darkness in Victoria and it was such a difficult struggle for the Victorian Labor Party post the split. It was not until recent times that I realised how hard it would have been. My father went into the state parliament in 1961 and it was only a matter of six years. NowI know what six years is in parliamentary life. It has given me a different comprehension of what a struggle it would have been when he first entered the state parliament. Kim has talked about the way in which he dealt with things: the MAIN COMMITTEE standing orders, the fact that he tried to be fair, and his expression about the House not helping him. But, really, he always emphasised that the loneliest chair in the chamber is the Speaker’s chair, because nobody is there to help you. To everybody who has contributed to this debate, I thank you very much. There was just one thing that I did not speak about yesterday. Dad was a sufferer of Kennedy’s disease. It is one of the variations of motor neurone disease. Some will remember him here with his ungainly gait, and that was as a result of the muscle wastage that comes with the degenerative loss of the motor neurones. He battled on with it, having had it diagnosed some 30 years ago. He had a very slow version. Some people only survive two or three months after having it diagnosed. So yesterday I wore this blue cornflower, which is the symbol of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, of which Dad was a patron and which was a great support to Dad, Mum and the rest of the family. In conclusion, I once again thank the House for the honour they have bestowed upon Dad, my predecessor as the member for Scullin, by not only the condolence motion yesterday but this take note debate in the Main Committee today.

(2) Does he intend to place these three sites on the Convention’s Montreux Record of sites where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring or are likely to occur; if not why not. (3) In respect of the Gwydir Ramsar site, can he explain why the Commonwealth Government has not fulfilled the commitments it gave as a signatory to the Memoranda of Understanding signed on World Wetlands Day in 1999 in relation to the future management of this site, in particular, what actions has he taken to (a) fulfil the undertakings made by both the NSW and Commonwealth governments to remain committed to maintaining appropriate hydrological regimes in the Gingham and Lower Gwydir Watercourses, particularly the provision of adequate, ecologically appropriate environmental flows to the wetlands; (b) make operational the Management Group for the Ramsar site which has met only twice since 1999; and (c) activate the Dispute Resolution mechanism to address the concerns communicated to his Department over 12 months ago by Mr Howard Blackburn, one of the private landholders involved. (4) Will he provide details of the activities that have been funded or are proposed for funding through the Border Rivers-Gwydir 2003-2004 Investment Strategy that will benefit the Gwydir Ramsar site and address the threats to its ecological character; if no funding decisions have been made, will he give a commitment that the Commonwealth will ensure that some of these funds will go to addressing the threats to the ecological character of this Ramsar site. (1) Yes. This advice reports a change in the ecological character of the Gwydir Wetlands Ramsar site, under Article 3.2 of the Convention. A copy of the advice has been provided to the honourable member. Further copies are available from the House of Representatives Table Office.

(2) No. The Australian Government is pursuing a more cooperative and consultative approach that will achieve earlier actions and better outcomes.",186,Questions On Notice
208,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) The Australian Government is working closely with the other parties to implement the Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) for the Gwydir Wetlands. (a) I am concerned that the water sharing planning process recently undertaken by the NSW Government may not result in adequate and ecologically appropriate environmental flows for the Gwydir Wetlands. I have written to Minister Craig Knowles, NSW Minister for Natural Resources, about the adequacy of environmental flows for the Gwydir wetlands. (b) The landholder signatories to the MoU have formed a Management Group to oversee the implementation and co-ordination of the MoU. (c) Neither Mr Blackburn nor any other party has sought this course of action. (4) Two projects have been approved through the Border Rivers/Gwydir 2003-04 Investment Strategy that will assist the sound management of wetlands in the region: Riverine monitoring including groundwater, water quality and wetlands monitoring National Action Plan: $246,878 Targeted investment to manage wetlands and riverine ecosystems for water quality, salinity and conservation outcomes in the Border Rivers/Gwydir National Action Plan: $149,310 In addition, the Australian Government has recently approved $203,213 in State-wide Natural Heritage Trust funding for the Promotion of the Ramsar Convention and assessment of ecological character on private Ramsar sites in NSW – a pilot for application by other States and Territories.

209,Mr Howard,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,188,Questions On Notice
210,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In general, US civilian contract personnel (Titan Corporation, CACI, etc …), third country nationals, and local contractors do not appear to be properly supervised within the detention facility at Abu Ghraib. During our on-site inspection, they wandered about with too much unsupervised access in the detainee area. I am advised that this is the only reference to ‘third country nationals’ in the body of the report of General Taguba. (2) I am advised that the report of General Taguba refers to a Mr Steven Stephanowicz as a ‘Contract US Civilian Interrogator, CACI, 205th Military Intelligence Brigade’. I am also advised that he is not an Australian citizen. (3) The investigation and prosecution of offences under Commonwealth law are matters for appropriate investigative authorities, including the Australian Federal Police, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. (4) The International Criminal Court’s jurisdiction is limited by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court which created it. The Statute recognises that States Parties have primary jurisdiction to try genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity under their domestic legal systems. Under the Statute, a case is inadmissible in the International Criminal Court (ICC) where a State Party is investigating or prosecuting that case, or where the State Party has investigated and decided not to prosecute, unless the State Party is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution. In addition, the ICC may not try a person who has been properly tried in another court for conduct which would constitute genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. Within these limits, the ICC has jurisdiction where the person accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity is a national of a State Party to the Statute. Australia is a State Party, having ratified the Statute on 1 July 2002. The ICC Statute entered into force for Australia on 1 September 2002. The crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity set out in the ICC Statute have been included in Australian domestic law under Division 268 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. This allows Australia to domestically investigate or prosecute a person for conduct overseas which is alleged to constitute a crime under the Statute. Any such case would be inadmissible in the ICC during that investigation or prosecution and the person could not be tried in the ICC if they had already been tried in an Australian court. The Declaration by Australia made upon ratification of the Statute states that Australia will not surrender a person to the ICC until Australia has had the full opportunity to investigate or prosecute any alleged crimes. (5) All States Parties to the ICC Statute have obligations to cooperate in relation to the prosecution of crimes within the ICC’s jurisdiction. The International Criminal Court Act 2002 establishes procedures in Australia’s domestic law to allow Australia to comply with these obligations, including requests for the arrest and surrender of persons and other requests for cooperation. States Parties, like Australia, do not have additional obligations under the ICC Statute which specifically apply when their citizens (for example, Australian citizens) are the subject of prosecution in the ICC.
