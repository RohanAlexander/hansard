External Affairs)","I ask the indulgence' of the House to be permitted to move a motion with reference to what appears to be a grave crisis, affecting the' whole British Empire. I have consulted with the leader of the Opposition, who is in full sympathy with me in the course which I am taking. _ With the concurrence bf honourable members, I move1. That this House feels bound, in the present grave crisis, to express its profound indignation at the cruel and wanton attack recently made by a Russian fleet upon British fishermen whilst they were engaged in their peaceful calling. 2. That this Housef u l l y .sympathizes with the British Government and people in the demand that those who directed this outrage be punished. 3. At the same time, this House most earnestly hopes that the peace existing between the British Empire and the Empire of Russia will be preserved by a frank and honourable observance OD the part of Russia of her obligations. I think that any lengthy address upon a motion of this kind' would only weaken the effect of it. The object of the Government in moving it, as it will be moved in both. Houses of Parliament, is in nosense to add to the difficulties of either the British or the Russian Government. Our chief motive is a most earnest desire that the inestimable blessing of peace shall be preserved between the peoples of these mighty Empires. Friday, 28 October, 1004.",12,Setup

2,Mr Reid (East Sydney,"Minister ofstatement to the House in reference to the new mail contract of the Orient Company? The matter is of so much importance that there should be no delay. that the Cabinet would be able to consider the question at its meeting, on Thursday last, but the importance of the scheme of defence which was then before us made that impossible. However, we may have an opportunity to deal with the subject at the next Cabinet meeting. When it has been dealt with, I shall be only too glad to give what information is desired by honourable members in the public interest. POST AND TELEGRAPH master-General, upon noticeWhat was the revenue and expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department in the State of Queensland for the several years, ending 30th June in each case, from 1897 to 1904 inclusive? inquiries to be made, and I hope to be able to lay a return upon the table of the House in a few days. There is some difficulty about getting the information for the years prior to 1900, but I am making an effort to procure it, because I realize the importance of it from the honourable member's point of view.

I am perfectly willing to amend the motion to provide that we shall adjourn until half-past 10 on Wednesday morning. Question amended accordingly. to the motion being submitted. the honourable member that it is not necessary to ask the permission of the House to move a motion of this kind. Under the Standing Orders Ministers may at any time move such a motion, and, therefore, I did not ask honourable members to grant leave.. prevent other honourable members from attending the races if they so desire-in fact, I have no power to prevent them! On the other hand, I think that we should meet here and transact business in the usual way, on the understanding, of course, that we should not do anything that would place honourable members who are absent at a disadvantage. I object to our meeting on Tuesday evening, because I do not think that business would be facilitated by adopting that course. I move That the motion be amended by the omission of the words "" half-past 10 a.m.,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" the usual hour."" the amendment.

Picanon, the Governor of New Caledonia, has just returned to Noumea from another tour of inspection in the New Hebrides Group. This is the fourth visit paid to the Group by His Excellency within twelve months, and is another indication of the very great interest which is being taken by the French authorities in the progress of the New Hebrides. Hitherto, however, Mons. Picanon has confined his inspections to the central and northern islands of the Group, where the French population « concentrated, but on the last occasion a cruise was made for the first time round the southern portion of the New Hebrides, which is entirely British. ""Mons. Picanon has been viewing the coveted land,"" writes a British settler in the Group to one of the Sydney shipping houses. The cruise was made in the French warship Meurthe, which was at the island of Aneityum on September 20. From there the Meurthe proceeded to Tanna, Erromanga, and Port Vila, and was due back at Noumea on September 29. the honourable member that the Estimates do not refer to the acquisition of land in the island.

Chairman will allow me a little latitude. Standing Orders. in order in showing the desire evinced by, British settlers in the islands for Australian intervention by reading an extract from a petition for the remission of import duties on produce sent into the Commonwealth by Australian settlers, which they presented to the Prime Minister. I shall read only that portion of the petition which bears on the question immediatly before us. The petition readsTo the Honourable The Prime Minister, Australian Commonwealth, Melbourne. Australia. Honored Sir,We, the undersigned, resident planters and settlers of the New Hebrides, hereby respectfully beg to call your attention to certain matters relating to the welfare of British and Australian interests in these islands. At the present time a silent struggle is being carried on between two nations for local supremacy, and it must be obvious to all thinking men that a grave doubt exists as to which of the two will gain that supremacy. Present indications appear to point to ultimate French control. We give the following reasons for so thinking :1. The fact that the French settlers outnumber the British by 41, the numbers being-French, 255; B r it is h , 214. 2. That by subsidies and superior transport facilities, the French subjects are given far more encouragement than their British rivals. 3. The French Government gives inestimable assistance to her colonists by allowing their produce into Noumea practically free of duty.

I have not closely examined the affairs of the company, because I am connected with it only through a trust, which I do not personally supervise. If honourable members would hereafter open the markets of Australia to the products of the New Hebrides, I should be the first to support a reduction of this additional subsidy ; that is, if the House now votes it. nately, I am not in the same position as the honourable member for Wentworth, in so far as his connection with Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company is concerned. I cannot agree with the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Maranoa. When everything is taken into account, the amount of the proposed subsidy is inconsiderable. I have been much impressed by the arguments of the honourable member for Lang, who has pointed out that when the Panama Canal is completed the New Hebrides will occupy a position of great strategic importance. I think that we sliould do everything we can within reason to strengthen our hold upon these islands. There are more important considerations even than those of fostering our trade relatlers of that nationality now residing in the tions with the islands-consideration s of even transcendental importance, to which we should pay the very closest attention. Burns, Philp, and Company are no friends of mine. On the contrary, they have been my bitter political opponents throughout my public career; but as I view this matter in the broad light in which it has been presented to the Committee by the honourable member for Lang, I intend to vote in favour of the proposed subsidy. thoroughly in accord with the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Maranoa. We are being asked to take upon ourselves a responsibility that we have no right to assume. The honourable member for Lang, has certainly furnished us with a great deal, of interesting information. But if the islands are of such great importance as has been represented, from a strategic point of view, I think the British Government should take action, and not leave us to spend our money in conserving what are really their interests. We are being asked to grant, under the guise of a payment for a mail service, a subsidy with the object of increasing trade relations with the New Hebrides. If it is right for the Government to grant a subsidy with the object of promoting, the development of the New Hebrides, they should be prepared to assist in a still greater degree in the settlement of the northern parts of Queensland, where there are not merely 245, but over 100,000 Britishers. The whole of the influence that has been brought to bear in connection with the increase of the subsidy for a mail service to the New Hebrides has been based upon the ex parte statements of missionaries. Of the British residents in those islands, thirty-four are missionaries, and there is no doubt that they have been the principal sources of the information derived by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and others who have spoken in favour of the subsidy. I think that, under the circumstances, we should have had more complete information placed before us. The honourable member for Lang told us that the British Government had been exercising control over the New Hebridies for forty years, and that the total re : suit of all their efforts had been the settlement of 245 Britishers in the group. The French have exercised a share in the joint protectorate over the islands for the last twenty years, and the total number of setislands is 255 In addition to copra, the New Hebrides settlers produce a considerable quantity of maize. the cocoanut trees are growing. serious drought, most of the maize produced in the New Hebrides was imported into Australia, and brought into direct competition with that produced by our farmers in Victoria, Tasmania, and Northern Queensland. The maize produced by means of white labour within the Commonwealth was brought into competition with that produced by means of Iblack labour in the New Hebridies. The settlers there employ the islanders at a rate of remuneration which is very little more than equal to providing them with food. I shall be no party to subsidizing a service which is intended to bring into competition with our products maize grown by means of 'black labour.

I regard these islands as the outposts of the Commonwealth, and therefore it is highly desirable that they should not pass tt) the control of a foreign power. tunately, foreign nations far removed from these islands-nations whose interests are not nearly so directly centred in them as are those of the British-have already established themselves there. that our relations with those powers have been of a friendly character, but I understand that there has been considerable friction locally between the British residents, who have borne the heat and burden of developing these islands, and their foreign neighbours. That friction is likely to increase and to extend until it is just possible the Government propose to grant a that international jealousy may be engendered. I consider that the British people have a special claim to recognition in connection with the occupancy and the development of the trade and commerce of these islands. They have pioneered them, and the other powers have planted settlers only after the conditions of life have been rendered very much easier. The influence of the latter is growing, and is practically menacing British occupation. All that we are asked to do by this vote is to follow in the footsteps of other Powers by granting to our own people increased facilities in the matter of communication. I quite agree with the honourable member for Darwin that there are other places which deserve attention, and doubtless the instance which he quoted in connection with King Island is one of them. But I think that I can instance a still more glaring case than that which was cited by the honourable member. I refer fo the absence of adequate postal facilities in connection with the important town of Orange, in my own electorate, which possesses a population of between 8,000 and 10,000. The curtailment of its ' postal faculties by the Government has been severely felt, and certainly it is an evil which ought to Ibe remedied. But simply because a portion of my own electorate does not possess all the advantages to which it is entitled, why should I decline to consider the desirableness of extending mail communication to these islands, particularly when we are asked to do so in the interests, Mr Brown. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Supply. not of a section of the community, but of of consideration interests the Commonwealth ? It is because I view the matter from that stand-point that I intend to support the proposed vote. this debate suggests that the Commonwealth ought to do something more than arrange for subsidies for mail communication. The trouble is that the Imperial GovernUnforment apparently does not fully realize its responsibility to the outlying portions of the Empire, and I think that the Commonwealth Government should endeavour to bring about some propter understanding. It is true I am not in favour of granting the increased subsidy, for it appears to me that the running of additional vessels in the trade will do no more than serve the interests of a few settlers in the islands. We experience great difficulty in securing a vote of £500 or £1,000 to improve mail services within .the Commonwealth, and yet further sum of £6,000 to a private company to develop, as it is said, the trade of the islands. This company, according to the honourable member for Lang, is losing ,£16,000 a year by carrying on its island service. I am inclined to doubt that any company would! incur such a loss, unless it hoped by continuing the service to develop a profitable trade. As a matter of fact, settlement in< .the islands has not proceeded so rapidly as to suggest that the returns of the company from this source will be improved at an early date. Burns, Philp, and Co. are not likely to do anything at a loss, and I think it is time that we put a stop to this: ""boosting"" up of private companies. It would be better for us to devote this money to a service to be carried on b\ vessels owned by the Commonwealth. I am informed that the Merrie England is not being utilized as fully as we might reasonably expect, and it seems to me that shemight well be employed in this direction. The Government have not, so far, indicated that they are disposed to favourably view the granting of bounties, and I should liketo know the grounds on which they justify this proposal to give a bounty for the benefit of a mere handful of people-a few missionaries and others. The plea is that the service should be maintained by us in the interests of the Empire; but when we look into the matter we find that the rest of the Empire is apparently unwilling to join with us in this direction. In these-",23,Thomson Tha T Stategovernment Proposal
123,Mr Spence (Darling),"The tone ofcircumstances, it seems to me that no good purpose would be served from the point of view of the Empire by granting this increased subsidy. It would tend only to assist French settlement in the .New Hebrides, and to help the French to secure possession of them. The Commonwealth has not yet had time to develop an external policy, but it seems to me that, so far, we have been guilty of that very policy of laissez faire for which we condemn the Imperial authorities. The whole of these islands ought to be secured to Great Britain. Many years ago public meetings were held in Melbourne in favour of the annexation of the New Hebrides, and a proposal was made that' the Government of the day should send a representative ' to London to place before the Home Government the opinions of the people. These meetings, however, did not result in anything tangible, and so far the Commonwealth has been unable to take action. A mass of valuable information relating to the New Hebrides, and the position of the French in the islands of the Pacific, was collected by the late Julian Thomas"" The Vagabond ''-wh o took an enthusiastic interest in this question. No man was more intimately acquainted with the history of colonization in the South Pacific, and from his publications, as well as other sources, I have compiled a great deal of interesting information. Unfortunately, I have not got it with me to-day. I feel that it is time that some definite policy islands cannot be so great as has been reprewas adopted by the Commonwealth Government in relation to the islands of the Pacific. Australia is now able to speak with a united voice, and I think that the Imperial authorities would be prepared to take more notice of representations made on behalf of the whole Commonwealth than they were disposed to take of the views of the individual Colonies. if some step were taken to make these islands a part of the British Empire, or at all events, to bring them more directly under British control; but I do not think that the proposal to increase this mail subsidy is calculated to assist us in that direction. amendment on the ground that the circumstances of the case do not justify the Government . proposal; but I would strongly urge that some-steps should be taken before it is too late to secure these islands to to assist the products of those islands to Great Britain. I believe that the .interests of the British people would be best served by our assuming control of them. If we succeed in establishing some reasonable system of governing British Papua we may feel disposed to accept some responsibility in regard to the New Hebrides. I should not be particularly opposed to our doing so if it were conceived to be in the interests of the nation, but I hold that it would be better for us to devote the money now proposed to be paid to this company to the maintenance of Commonwealth vessels employed in carrying on the service. I have only to repeat that, while I am sure it is our desire to be at peace with the nations of the world, I think that we ought to secure these islands for the British people. to support the amendment on the ground that this is a matter which concerns the I m perial Parliament far more than the Government or Parliament of the Commonwealth. I have no desire to discount the strategical value of these islands to the E m pire, but Australia has already contributed very largely to the naval subsidy, and should not be called upon further to provide naval stations in the Pacific for the British Fleet., However important these islands may be as outposts to the Commonwealth, they must be still more important to the Imperial policy of having naval and coaling stations scattered broadcast along the trade routes. But when the Imperial authorities appear to take so little interest in this matter, one is necessarily led to the conclusion that the strategical value of these sented toy the honourable member for Lang and others. Apart from that consideration, however, I think that we have_ enough to do within our own Continent in working out our own destiny, without devoting public funds to the development of the resources of outside territories. Mention has been made It would be well of several directions in which money might well be spent in providing increased facilities for settlement within the Commonwealth, and there is scarcely an honourable member who could not multiply the complaints which have been made that those who are doing pioneering work for the Commonwealth are I shall vote for the not receiving that assistance at the hands of the Government which they are entitled to expect. Nevertheless, we are asked to lavish an additional £ 6 , 0 0 0 on this company to develop islands thousands of miles away, and come into competition with those of our own producers. The honourable, member for KenT nedy has already referred to the position in",24,Thomson Tha T Stategovernment Proposal
124,Mr Wilkinson (Moreton),"I intendregard to the maize, bananas, and other products of these islands. I am a protectionist right through the piece. We have imposed protective duties on these commodities to protect our own producers, and are also paying a considerable sum' by way of sugar bounties, to preserve Australia for the white races. In these circumstances, I , for one, am strongly opposed to subsidizing either mail steamers or cargo carriers to bring the products of the cheap labour of the Pacific Islands into competition with the whitegrown products of the farmers and fruit growers of Australia. By the aid of Kanaka labour maize can be produced more cheaply in those islands than in Australia, the differwill enormously increase the value of the ence in the cost of labour being so great as, perhaps, would enable the settlers, notwithstanding the duty, to compete successfully with Australian growers. In addition to this subsidy, which we are asked to pay, in order to extend increased facilities to the 214 British subjects who have settled in the New Hebrides mail service, not merely of the New Hebrides, but of many other islands. that,"" but I think that we are already paying more than sufficient in this direction. In addition to the native-grown maize, which might be introduced from these islands by means of the subsidized steamship service, we should have bananas landed here to compete with the products of the fruit-growers of Australia, although complaints are already being made that the latter have to compete with fruit' grown by Chinese and other Asiatics on the northern coast of Queensland. The complaint is a serious one, and I do not think that we should be justified in 'spending the money of the white taxpayers of the Commonwealth in subsidizing any service whereby the produce of a cheaper class of labour than can be employed in Australia may be brought into competition with the produce of the white races in the Commonwealth. It is said that this company is a very patriotic 'one, and is continuing a trade in which it incurs an annual loss of £16,000. Queensland, and know something about the company, feel that that statement must be accepted with a very considerable quantity of salt. Our experience of Burns, 'Philp, and Co., is that they do not give much away, and that if they spend / "" 1 it is with a view of reaping a profit °f £ > £z> 2 0 1 .£5 from that expenditure. The Committee has not yet been informed what area of land in the New Hebrides group is owned by the company. it. gard to both points would certainly be of interest. Have they a large stake in those islands, and are they asking us to subsidize their steam-ship service in order to enhance the value of properties there which they have acquired ?

I see no justification for the expenditulre of a large sum of money, ostensibly for the development of a trade with certain islands which the facts and figures before us show to be unworthy of consideration. Although the English have been trading with the New Hebrides for upwards of twenty years, there are now only 245 British residents there, thirty-four of whom are missionaries. I suppose it is through the missionaries that the reports have filtered which have led the British Government to become indifferent about the islands. At any rate, we know that men who possess such a dominating influence as the missionaries have in these regions are not a reliable source of information for statesmen and others who have to deal with great national problems. read was not signed by the missionaries. litical matters what appears to be the hand of Esau is often the hand of Jacob, and the actor hides his identity to facilitate the achievement of his ends.

We have certainly had a very eloquent and lucid exposition by the honourable member for Lang, but I am not aware that he has been briefed by the Government, or that they are justified in endeavouring to get the Estimates passed upon the strength of information supplied by irresponsible members. They should present official data which would justify us in voting £ 8 , 4 0 0 for the benefit of 214 individuals who are located beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. Honourable members have repeatedly brought under notice the necessity of providing better mail facilities for the convenience of settlers in the remoter country districts..

From ancient times every nation which has attempted unduly to expand itself has either suffered reverses or come to grief. We need only dip into history to obtain an object-lesson which should stand us in good stead in this regard. Taking the policy which has been outlined in support of this subsidy, I say that it is simply folly for a small community like ours to endeavour to grab all the islands of the Pacific-anc l that is what is at the bottom' of this proposal. That is the proposal which the honourable member for Lang has practically avowed. which, twenty years ago, stimulated the agitation wh'ich took place in this country upon the same subject. In my opinion, it is absurd for a small community, comprising 4,000,000 of people, to attempt to absorb islands which are situated at such a great distance from the coast line of Australia. For 125 years America has managed to progress under a republican form of Governmentwithout undertaking anything in the shape of annexation outside her own borders. she is doing it now.

If it be folly That is the object for a country possessing 80,000,000 of inhabitants to indulge in a policy of expansion -of grabbing up all the waste places of the earth-it must be little short of supreme folly for Australia, situated as she is, to follow upon the same lines, seeing that it",28,Thomson Tha T Stategovernment Proposal

That, however, ds not the case. Our Northern Territory is practically unpeopled and undeveloped. Thatterritory embraces an enormous area, which is equal to a principality. from' it by an imaginary boundary line, are other enormous tracts of country, which are known as the north-west portion of Western Australia. All that territory is practically undeveloped, and the same remark is applicable in a minor degree to the northern portions of Queensland. Moreover, we have a very large expanse of country in New Guinea.

Still, they would have been of immense value to Great Britain at the present juncture, had she only exercised the foresight necessary to acquire control of them, which she could easily have done at that time. I would remind the honourable member that all the wisdom of statesmanship does not Separated reside in him. There are at the head of affairs in the British Empire minds quite as alert as is his own,' quite as anxious to preserve British supremacy as he is, and they are not likely to neglect any opportunity to protect the interests of Great Britain. I regard this proposal as merely the thin end of the wedge to embroil the Commonwealth in a scheme for private aggrandizement. When we reflect that there are only 214 British residents, exclusive of missionaries, in these islands, after forty years of occupation, I think it will be recognised that their resources cannot be of a very attractive character. I am sorry that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is not present, because he has made some statements in reference to these islands, and has given reasons to justify this vote, which I should like to test by some information in my possession. I do not think that he was quite frank in some of his remarks The honourable member last evening upon this subject, and I hope that before I have concluded my remarks, he will return to the Chamber, so that I fully to this aspect of the matter.

I presume that I shall be in order in referring to it, in so f a r as the occupancy of land in the islands justifies the Commonwealth paying this subsidy. I find that in the New Hebrides and the Banks Islands, which embrace an area of nearly 6,000 square milesThe French exceed the British on five islands, the British exceed the French on five, and on two the numbers are equal. In the Banks and Torres groups-whic h consist of a series of small islands connecting the New Hebrides with the Solomons, the British preponderate. . . .

The honourable mem&er mission were appointed to settle these disputes. The recent agreement of April last provided for the establishment of such a Commission. There are many questions arising out of the settlement of the difficulties in regard to these land titles. I have no desire to labour the question, but I think it necessary to point out that until these titles are placed upon a satisfactory basis, we shall have no large increase in settlement in the islands, and certainly no such increase as would justify the Commonwealth in expending over £ 8 , 0 0 0 per annum in maintaining communication with them. I therefore say that we have to guard ourselves against taking a first step that would lead us on to such untold expenditure and untold trouble, as the United States have experienced in Cuba and the Philippines, and, indeed, in every place I have no wish to do with which, since their abandonment of the Monroe doctrine, they have sought to interfere. entirelv different. Mr ""MAHON -They are so entirely different as to make it all the more unjustifiable for us to go beyond our own boundaries in order practically to invite trouble. When the honourable member for Lang speaks of the necessity of preserving these islands to Great Britain, he ignores the fact that New Caledonia-whic h is actually in the possession of a foreign power-is some 500 miles nearer the Australian coast than is the New Hebrides group.

That also is a generous proposition. If the company is losing £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 a particulars before honourable members, a'ld year in carrying on this trade, the further proposition to hand over this land to us free of charge is a consistent act of benevolence on its part. I should like to know, however, what liability would attach ""to the gift . We have no precise information of this company's intentions. That is what we ought to have before granting this subsidy. If an independent inquiry were held on the spot-by , say, a small Parliamentary CommissionI think that the House would cheerfully and with confidence vote any sum required to maintain the existing connection between Australia and the islands, provided of course that the investigations of the Commission showed that it was in the interests of Australia. is the honourable member that the fullest information should be secured. orable member is, and I therefore claim his vote against the Government proposal, unless the required details are furnished. I take it that a refusal on the part of the Committee to grant this subsidy would be a direct intimation to the Government that we should expect them in future to present a better case before asking us to vote so large a sum. If I appear to refer rather frequently to the remarks of the honourable member for Lang, it is due to the fact that he is about the only honourable member who has championed this item. The Government have not a word to say about it. Even the Treasurer, who usually investigates financial matters very closely, and sees that the community obtains good value for its outlay, does not seem to have mastered all the details of this proposal. istry of which the honourable member was a member is enough for him. the right honourable gentleman does not usuI have never had a ally take any one's word for granted.

I believe that there is a large volume of correspondence, as well as a mass of State papers, hi ihe possession of the Government, which, if brought forward, would throw much light upon this subject, and enable the Committee to form a more enlightened opinion on the subject than we are able to do from the meagre details submitted to us by the honourable member for Lang. The honourable member to-day repeated the statement made by him on a previous occasion that the trade between these islands and Australia is very considerable. I find, from a return laid on the table of the House on the motion of the honourable member for Bourke, that the value of the cargo carried by the shipping company in question from the islands to Australia last year was £ 3 1 , 4 5 6, but from that amount we have to deduct £24,312 in respect of copra, and maize, £ 4 , 1 1 2 . Under ordinary circumstances, maize is not grown in the New Hebrides for export, though I admit that I am sure that the honin 1900. when there were no Federal duties, about £ 4 , 0 0 0 worth of maize was exported from those islands'to Australia.

Mr 'MAHON -The honourable member can scarcely say so correctly. My own experience of new countries is in direct conflict with his opinion. people will go after it. Take Western Australia as an example. The pioneers pushed out into the unknown interior, hundreds of miles from permanent water, in their desire to ascertain its resources. ever a country is capable of development, you will find people possessed of pluck, endurance, and money ready to engage in developing it.

I had in mind certain representations through the Colonies to the Imperial authorities, which are obviously biased.

That was a very serious I think it is quite fair charge to make. honourable member quoting ? have already referred.

I believe that in every country titles could be attacked on those grounds. more territory than is embraced in the If wealth exists islands. if what is asked for were conceded every title might be attacked.

He told us only what suits his own argument, but had he been arguing from another point of view, I think he might have used a different presentation of the same circumstances to support it. States been led into an expansion of territory through their unfortunate war with Spain ber will not be in order in debating the queshis hands. Some time ago, fears were extion of the expansion of Australia by the acquisition of the New Hebrides, and he cannot discuss the incidental reference of the honourable member for Coolgardie to the action of America. for Coolgardie dealt with the positron into which America had got by reason of the part she took in the Spanish war. I do not wish to discuss that matter. point is this, that America has annexed the Sandwich Islands, has strengthened her hold on Samoa, and is extending her influence across the Pacific in pursuance of an, acknowledged policy in that direction. The extension of mail facilities and the development of trade are weighty considerations; but it is still more important that we should continue to strengthen our influence in the Pacific. I believe that all the trade routes between Australia and Europe will, in the near future, cross the Pacific Ocean in the direction of the Panama Canal, and that it is perfectly legitimate that we should by means of this kind endeavour to safeguard our interests in that connection. This is not a matter of either expansion or occupancy of new territory, but a means of increasing our influence through trade relations. Eventually we may enter into some friendly arrangement with the powers having possessions in the Pacific, and possibly join hands with the United States. But there is no reason why we should give up, even to so friendly If we cannot secure inquiry by an which lie much nearer to our shores than to theirs. Victorian point of view, I desire to express my dissent from the Government proposal; I understand that there are only 214 British residents in the New Hebrides, and I have calculated that the proposed vote of £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 would represent a grant of £ 5 6 per unit of that population. I do not wish to appear factious in m y opposition, but if this vote be passed I hope that the Commonwealth will prove equally generous in its dealings with old-age pensioners.. The proposed grant is to be' made to a certain shipping company to which the democrats of Australia owe no thanks. One Not only have the United of the directors of the company, whilst he held the reins of Government in Queensland, behaved' in a most scandalous and disgracef u l manner, and we should not become parties to any vote that would place money in pressed that France would take the New Hebrides out of our hands, and a number of misstatements were made, which were intended to prejudice that noble nation in our eyes. Judging from the history of France, I do not think that there would. be much difficulty in our buying up the rights of that nation in the New Hebrides, or even in New Caledonia. Louisiana was sold by France to the United States, and in the My case of Newfoundland a satisfactory arrangement was entered into with regard to the fishery rights of Great Britain and France. It would be preferable, instead of increasing the proposed subsidy, to enter into some arrangement with the residents in the Islands for a limited service. adjournment for lunch I have had an opportunity to look into this question a little more closely. After having consulted the Consti, tution, I am more convinced than ever that the Government have no justification for the course they now propose. I am sure that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo will pardon me for referring-to him as' an authority on the Constitution for an interpretation of its provisions for the guidance of the Committee.

According to my reading of the Constitution, we have no power to grant bounties for any purpose beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, or other than for the development of production and export. My belief is that the Government have placed the vote under the Department of External Affairs, because the proposed arrangement cannot be regarded as a mail contract, pure and simple. If it came properly within that category, it should be provided for under the Estimates relating to the Post and Telegraph Department. I should prefer ,to see this large amount of money expended in other directions. I suggested at a former stage that it might be possible to convert the steamer Merrie England into a vessel suitable for the purposes of performing these mail services, but I have since ascertained that the craft is entirely unsuitable for such a purpose. sure yacht, which formerly belonged to the Duke of Westminster.

The question now arises whether the vessed belongs to the Duke of Westminster, or to ithe Commonwealth. ber is beginning to discuss the circumstances under which a certain vessel became the property of the Commonwealth, and that has nothing to do with the debate. be perfectly in order in discussing whether it would be desirable to use the steamer Merrie England for the purpose of carrying on the mail services, instead of paying an additional subsidy to Messrs. Burns, Pliilp, and Co. could perform the work; a number of vessels are now engaged in it. the statement of the honourable member for Lang, Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. are incurring a loss of £16,000 annually, and we have no right to allow them to victimize themselves for the benefit of the Commonwealth. Then, again, what guarantee have we that if we spend this money year after year, we shall not find ourselves in a position somewhat similar to that occupied by New Zealand in regard to Samoa? For many years New Zealand made strong efforts to develop trade with Samoa, but immediately Great Britain got into trouble in the Transvaal, and. considered it desirable to placate Germany, she handed over Samoa to that power, and sacrificed all the interests which New Zealand had been at such great trouble to build up. If we expend money year after year in developing these islands, what guaiantee have we, if England becomes embroiled in war, that in order to placate some other nation-possibl y France-sh e will not hand over these islands to its control, just as she handed Samoa over to Germany? We are asked to make this sacrifice to promote trade relations between these islands and the mainland. I claim that we should be very careful as to the manner in which we expend the taxpayers' money upon territory which is not covered by our Constitution. Some honourable members appear to think that we are adopting a very patriotic She was merely a pleacourse by undertaking the control of these islands. I would point out that there are two sides to that picture. To my mind it is questionable whether by agreeing to this vote we shall not be burdening ourselves with prospective responsibilities, the weight of which we cannot conceive. The expenditure of this money may within a few years involve the Commonwealth in a large outlay in providing these islands with the means of defence. intend to continue until 4 o'clock? expend this money in promoting trade with these islands, it is quite possible that sooner or later we may find ourselves in the position that New Zealand occupied after her vigorous efforts to develop trade relations with Samoa.

A system of preferential trade would do more to develop their resources than would all the bounties or subsidies that we might give to shipping companies engaged in the island trade. It is claimed that we should give a preference to the manufactures of Great Britain, as against those of other countries, and the Prime Minister might be asked to give a preference to the products of these islands -products common to Australia. There would be more logic in a proposal of thatkind than there is in the proposition that we should grant this increased mail subsidy. the Treasurer to agree to the postponement of the item.

They tell us, very naturally, that it is better that these islands should be controlled by Australia than by a foreign power, and I can quite understand their saying that we We should be justified in agreeing to this expenditure. The Prime Minister, in reading a report bearing on this subject, laid great division deals with stress upon the wisdom of our adopting the course which was recommended, with a view to our ultimately securing f u l l control over -these islands, that the interests of the Empire might be safeguarded. I do not wholly agree with that view. I do not think that we are called upon to consider with that arrived at in everything purely from the point of view of Imperial patriotism.

That Government left office, and the late Prime Minister also fully investigated the matter, and satisfied himself that the proposed expenditure was justifiable. It then came to the turn of the present Government to deal with the subject. When the Estimates came before me, I was naturally anxious to cut down every possible vote, and to leave out new votes wherever I could do so. When I noticed this proposal to spend £6,000, I sent it back for reconsideration, and the Prime Minister went very fully into the matter, and came to the conclusion that the amount ought to be provided for. I then went through the file of papers-n o small one-and spent many hours in acquainting myself with the facts, many of which had been previously brought under my notice, but which I had in the meantime forgotten, and I came to the conelusion that no matter how anxious I might be to cut down expenditure, the proposed vote would be well spent. receive ? at the return we shall receive in the way of increased commerce. When I was Premier of Victoria, we passed through a very hard time, and I had to save every penny I could; but when the Premier of New South Wales brought under my notice the position of the mail services to the islands, I took a broad view of the question.

All' we have to do is to answer for the Commonwealth. The question is not whether Great Britain should do this, but whether we are justified in spending money for the purpose. Those honourable members who can carry their minds back for a few years, will recollect the strong feeling that was exhibited in all the States when there was a suggestion that some of the Pacific Islands might fall into the hands of other nations. I venture to say that if to-day our people felt that, He satisfied himself in consequence of our refusing to spend a reasonable amount of money, any' of the islands would fall into the hands of other nations, there would be an outcry from one end of Australia to the other. We look at this matter, without considering whether New South Wales or Queensland will derive the benefit of any trade that may be opened up. We view it in its higher aspects, and consider whether the expenditure will be justified as a means of preventing these islands from being placed beyond our control. As the years roll on, I have no doubt that it will become absolutely necessary, in the interests of Australia, that we should take possession .of all the islands we can. We cannot secure New Caledonia, although we ought to have had it. I venture to say that the public regret that we have no control over that possession. If we cannot secure that, we ought to do everything we can to obtain control over the other islands. the whole of New Guinea. portion of it, and we should have had the whole of it. I .am sure that no one regrets more than does the honourable member that we have not the sole control of that island. The time may come when bargains may be made between the different nations, and we may be able to retrieve some of the mistakes made in the past.

I do not see how we are to derive any advantage from any trade that may grow up between the Islands and the Commonwealth. One of the principal products of the New Hebrides is maize, upon which we impose a duty, and it seems ridiculous on our part to offer encouragement to the settlers on 10 K 2 that island to grow produce which would compete with that which is raised by our own farmers. The chances are that the greater number of the settlers in the New Hebrides have little or nothing in common with the citizens of Australia,, and I certainly should not look with an approving eye upon any project that was intended to Offer inducements for Australians to leave the Commonwealth and settle in the islands. We are endeavouring to attract people to our shores, and to induce them to settle upon our own lands.
