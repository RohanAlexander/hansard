11,,"I ask the Prime Mr LISTER (Corio) [2-35] I wish to them. I have brought the matter before the notice of the House in this form because for some years past, since the Mont Park institution has been used for housing a number men who> as a result of ' war service, have lost thei* reason, I bave been taking more than a passing interest in their welfare, and have on a number of occasions brought up matters concerning thein in this House. I should at the outset say that I appreciate the action of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) in making it possible for me to peruse a. eopy of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States authorizing thechange proposed in connection' with the care of these unfortunate men. members geneially have not had aa opportunity of perusing the agreement, becausei f the* had they wonld at once recognise that there was jusrlifieatiioa for the question' which I asfedl i a this House last week. papei-s pB'bldsh statements which are not correct, but they recordedwhat turned out to be a fact when they stated' that it was the intention of the Government uo transferpatients^ at Mont Park from the direct control of the Federal authorities to thc control of a State Department. partment. by no means new. Some three yearsago, without the relativesof the men. having any knowledge that the Government proposed to do anything of the kind, a movement was made to transfer a number of them to civil lunatic asylums-. We have no quarrel whatever with the desire of the Government or the Commission for the segregation of these men. We recognise that in the interests of the men themposed? selves that is absolutely necessary. We appreciate the fact that it is proposed, under the agreement, to transfer some fifty of these men to the Bundoora Park establishment, where they may be given curative treatment. That will, be in the best interests of the men concerned. In view of the fact that it has been recognised as necessary that these men should be segregated, I want to know how it is that the authorities have only just awakened'to the fact. There have been for some three years or more over 100 men placed in one or two wards in what was So. 16"" Australian General Hospital, Mont Park, which has now been taken over by the State as an asylum-. The n has been only one recreation reserve for the whole of these men. I took a of unfortunate former Minister forRepatriation ( Mr. Rodgers) out to. Mont Park to see foe'himself the actual position. Mi"". Rodgersi n spected not only the military institution, as it is termed, but was also driven across to another building in the same grounds, and under theeantns? of the State. He was thus able to compare the conditionsi n the two institutions,, and uponhis return he issued the instruction that the men were not to be placed under the careof the State; the proposal then heing tosend ten of them to the Kew and ten to' I regret that honourable the Sunbury Lunatic Asylum. I want to emphasize that tliese unfortunate men are in their present state because of services rendered to fhi.s eotiutry inits hour of need, and that the Commonwealth responsibility mregard to them should Somuetimesi the nswsnot be transferred to any State authority. I shall he t'eid, perhaps, that Ithere is no desire on the part of the Government to relieve themselves of this definite responsibility ;hut I am satisfied that if honourable members bar! an opportunity to peruse this agreement, they would realize that though it is not the intention of the Government to transfer responsibility, nevertheless responsibility is heing transferred^ did it in Western Australia.

I trust the House will discuss this matter calmly ancl dispassionately, and that the Government will hesitate before they sign this agreement; otherwise they will be unable to .maintain the control they should exercise over these men. surer) [3.7] I am glad that the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) has raised this question in the way he has, because it gives me the opportunity of relieving the minds of the friends and relatives of those unfortunate mentally afflicted soldiers who are at present under treatment in the various mental hospitals throughout Australia, as to the conditions now prevailing. TJiis motion gives me the opportunity to refer to the injury clone to these unfortunates by the uninformed agitation which has been continuous during the last four or five years. These, men have not been segregated earlier because on every occasion <m which an attempt at segregation was By this made the agitation in Melbourne wa3 sufficient to block it . What is their position to-day as compared with three days ago? The transfer which was Under made yesterday has for its object the classification into five divisions of the mentally afflicted men in the Melbourne institutions; previously two classifications only were possible. 2sTow, those who have a good chance of getting better will be separated from the impulsive, the noisy, and the dirty, and their recovery will thus be hastened. Every alienist in. the world, every one who has made a special study of this particular class of disease, the Governbelieves that the Commission is acting in the best interests of these men, and any delay in bringing the new system of control into force would mean additional suffering for those we desire to We have no quarrel with the assist.

Why is it that throughout Australia the average capacity of such institutions is from 1,000 to 1,500 patients? expense. tion of expense. It has been found that an institution of that size gives the most satisfactory results, because in it the patients can be best classified ancl given the most specialized treatment. Specially qualified medical officers are available for a hospital of that size, but would not be available for small institutions. In addition, such institutions are able to secure and retain a highly qualified nursing staff. Unless the Government make an arrangement such as the one before us, this Parliament must face the question whether the Commonwealth shall take control of the mental cases throughout Australia or the States shall continue to deal with them. It is impossible in existing circumstances for the Commonwealth to establish a large institution, because the total number of cases of mentally-afflicted soldiers being treated in all the States is only 345. If we were to bring all these men together to a central institution, it would inflict considerable hardship upon thc men themselves, their relatives, and their friends, particularly in cases where they were removed from distant States.",16,Formal Motion Op Adjournment

That desire actuated the Government in making this agi'eement. I have tried to do the right thing for these men ever since I have had control of repatriation work. I -have laboured unceasingly to secure this change, which was first suggested during the war, and has since been sought continually, not merely by departmental experts, but by non-departmental experts as well. The most expert opinion on this matter in Australia is favorable to the change. Sir John McPherson, Professor of Psychiatry at the Sydney University, and Inspector-General of Lunacy in Scotland for many years, favours this arrangement. He is a man whose reputation is world-wide, and Australia is fortunate to have him here to give advice. Dr. Ramsay Mailer, the Collins-street specialist, as well as the medical advisory committee, consisting of Dr. Stawell, Dr. Syme, Dr. Ramsay Webb, and Sir Henry Maudsley, also agree that for the satisfactory treatment of these mental cases it is advisable to have them, in ,a'large institution, which will provide the opportunity for proper classification and segregation. be done under Federal control? only '345 cases. much. thing to do with it. As a matter of fact, the cost will be greater under the new arrangement than under the old one. The agreement provides that the Commission shall control these men in the fullest possible way, and shall be responsible for their welfare and well-being. Provision is made also for specialized treatment in particular cases. Federal authority take control? why the Federal authorities cannot properly deal with these mentally of cost, after all? afflicted soldiers is that there are only 345 of them in all. New South Wales has something like 135, Victoria has about 125, and the remainder -Why .not! are scattered throughout the other States. Eveni f we brought them all together we could not give them the specialized treatment which they need. Another reason why the Commonwealth Government cannot undertake this responsibility is that even if it did establish an institution it would be a small one, with a comparatively limited -variation in mental diseases, and as such would not attract the men who make a special study of mental disorders. paid the men enough it would get them. member always thinks in terms of money, but this matter is not governed by money.

Dr.' EARLE PAGE -The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), and, I think, other honourable members realize that the medical practitioners who devote their time and talents to the treatment of mental disorders do not do so because of the money they may make out of ifc. Generally speaking, they could earn more in other branches of their profession. I can speak with authority on this matter, because I have known men to give up big practices to take up this work. A large percentage of those who specialize in mental diseases give their ""time and talents tp the work because of love for it, and because they realize the need for ifc. The limited number of patients available and the 'difficulty of obtaining the most expert medical advice are not the only barriers to the Commonwealth establishing its own institution to deal with these cases. Ifc would be almost impossible to secure a properly qualified attendant staff for a Commonwealth mental institution, because, on account of the limited experience to be gained in the such an institution, the -most desirable and qualified men would not accept positions in it.",17,Formal Motion Op Adjournment

SinceI have taken control of the Repatriation Department I have visited every Stale, and I have found that they are all, with the exception of Victoria, working satisfactorily under similar arrangements. soldiers at Callan Park are being treated in a way that is absolutely satisfactory to the patients, their relatives, and their friends, and no trouble whatever has arisen there. I represent a New South Wales constituency, and am frequently in Sydney, but I have never heard a single complaint. We have a special building for these men at Callan Park, and we shall require one at Monfc Park. amount to be paid to the States is what they regard as necessary to cover the cost of proper treatment. The agreement provides that the soldier patients shall receive even better food than that served to the ordinary civilian patients, and the Commission will pay for it. just from the point of view of the patients who are being looked after by the State, but the fact is that the soldiers are being treated in a far better way than is any other mentally afflicted patient in Australia. In Adelaide and Perth provision has been made for the erection of separate buildings, to insure the more complete segregation of the soldier mental patients. When I was in Western Australia, an agi'eement was come to between the Commonwealth and State Governments regarding the site on which the building there shall be erected. I regret that I have not been able to visit the Goodna Asylum, in Queensland. started out one day to visit it , but, unfortunately, a bush fire had destroyed, two bridges over which it was necessary to pass, and I was unable to arrive at the institution. in Australia that I have not been able to visit. I know that in every other [11] institution the treatment of the mentally afflicted soldiers is as good as modern science and institutional practice can possibly make it. There is no justification for the scare statements that are continually being made to the effect that the soldiers are being given a very bad spin in this matter. -Orde r ! The Treasurer's time has expired. very sorry that the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) did not cover much wider ground in the motion submitted by The mentally afflicted him. It is a well-known fact that, among all parties in this Blouse, a great deal of dissatisfaction is felt with regard to the administration of the Repatriation Department. In spite of the denials of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), I cannot divorce from my mind the belief that the desire to practise economy played a very considerable part in inducing the Government to transfer to a State instiThe tution its responsibilities respecting mentally afflicted soldiers. With all due respect to the Treasurer, who is an eminent medical man, I submit that the present condition .of many soldiers, who became mentally afflicted following on war service, is the result of shell shock; they are not congenital cases, such as are found in the various mental hospitals throughout Australia. Their condition being the result of nervous strain, they are entitled to receive every possible sympathy and consideration that the Commonwealth can give them. They are an obligation of the Commonwealth, which should not under any pretext attempt to transfer its responsibilities elsewhere. brought into contact with other cases that are not of a like nature. contention. I spent nine months in a military hospital on my return from war service, and I saw many pitiable cases of men who were suffering from shell shock.

I wish to give some details of a particular case, so that fathers and relatives generally of afflicted returned soldiers ment mentally"" afflicted soldiers this State. may realize that whilst it may be useful and necessary for the Government to mnke arrangements with State authorities to secure better medical treatment for these men, it is beyond everything else essential that the CommonAvealth shall not surrender its responsibility to them in the slightest degree. The Federal authority must retain f u l l control of these matters. Satisfactory arrangements may be made with State Governments, but throughout the piece the Commonwealth Government alone must accept f u l l responsibility for the proper care of mentally afflicted returned soldiers. the agreement which has been entered into provision is made for official visitors. One is to be nominated by the Repatriation Department ancl another by the State Department, but the Returned Soldiers Association arc apparently not to be permitted to appoint visitors to the institutions, and we shall be unable in the future to learn how the soldiers are beingtreated. This may destroy all possibility of enabling criticism of departmental methods. It is a disgrace to Australia that such a case as was brought under my notice in Western Australia should have been allowed to arise. It was the case of a young man who was well brought up. and who joined the Air Force. crashed when employed against the enemy, and although when he returned to Australia he was able to follow his former avocation for some time, he later became a wreck. He was on the broad of his back in a comatose state for three or four months, and then began to recover. While regaining his bodily health he became mentally afflicted and was committed to the Stromnes Hospital. became somewhat violent and was then sent to the lunatic asylum at Claremont. I visited the asylum one afternoon and found this young man interned in No. 5 ward of the asylum. He is only a boy, and any one who saw liim would feel that given a chance in proper environment he would very probably recover his mental faculties. He was put into the worse ward of the asylum, amongst criminals, Asiatics, Japanese, Chinese, ancl half-castes. As a result of my visit I sent the following wire at once to the Treasurer : Desire draw vour earnest attention to treatYesterday visited Claremont Lunatic Asylum. Saw mentally afflicted officer-airman, herded with most awful specimen, of a, humanity including Asiatics, under wretched conditions. Airman's case is not hopeless, but environment and awful association must make his case hopeless. Believe public would be astounded if revelations were made public. Would recommend that patient be transferred some institution in East, where best medical attention and good environment might easily produce sound mentality. When the Treasurer went over to Perth he looked into this case at once. The Department in dealing with the matter In one clause of rated me, because of my communication to the Treasurer, and treated my letter as if it was impertinent. The statement was made that my remarks were unjustified. But from what I saw the responsible authority might very well inscribe over the door of the ward in which this boy was incarcerated the words which Dante tells us are written over fhe entrance to Hell, "" Abandon hope all ye who enter here."" I asked whether I could go into the ward in which this young man was kept, and I was informed I could not do so, because it would be dangerous. The boy was brought to me, and he was very quiet at the time. He becomes violent only occasionally. No matter under what circumstances a returned soldier who fought for us may have lost He his mental faculties, lie should not be herded with criminals or incarcerated under the awful conditions in which I found this boy. him? Treasurer visited Perth he got to work and conditions were altered; but the necessity for this shows, how callously the ComHe missioner treated the matter. I wish it to be understood that in any negotiations which may be entered into with State authorities in /these matters these unfortunate men are not to be farmed out to a State department.",20,Formal Motion Op Adjournment

These associations should have the right to nominate a visitor who could report upon the conditions in which the patients are placed. We must not evade for a single moment the responsibility of bhis House to see that those who have suffered so much for our sake are properly cared for. It may interest honourable members to be in a> position to compare the generous offer made by the Commonwealth Government with the cost per head paid by the Victorian Government for inmates of asylums for the insane. For the year ending 1921 the.figures,which are the latest I can obtain, show that the total weekly cost per patient in hospitals for the insane was f l '7s. 5Jd., deducting contributions from relatives of the patients. I feel that it would not be. the desire of honourable members to differentiate between the treatment of mentally-afflicted returned soldiers, and private individuals who have become insane. It appears to me to be an awful thing that in one institution there will he some kept at a weekly cost of Â£1 7s. ojd., and others at Â£2 5s. oil. I believe that if the parsimonious ex-Treasurer of Vietoria( Sir William McPherson) could have had hie way the cost per head would have been reduced. I will say for the medical officersin charge of the institutions that they do all that, men can do. Some of them, as the Treasurer has already stated, accept their positions from love of the work. These are very few, and the ma jority take up such positions in order to secure an appointment until they can obtain a practice. Some of these b^ave stayed for a very long time in the Lunacy Department. I may inform honourable members that at one time the unfortunates in these asylums were cleansed by being compelled to go under cold shower baths. In some instances it required two or three attendants to force a patient under the shower. As the result of a recommendation of a visiting committee, of which I believe Dr. Springthorpe was a member, the xise of warm shower baths was introduced, and to show how even those bereft of reason appreciated the difference, it was found that whereas they could be induced to take a cold shower bath only with the greatest difficulty, when the warm shower bath was introduced the difficulty was to induce them to give it up. The parsimony used in the care of the insane in the past in every State of Australia was a disgrace to our civilization. I understand that the Commonwealth Government is offering Â£2 5s. 6d. per week per head, with a small douceur, to the medical man, of Â£5 5s. a week, which, I suppose, is in addition to his salary. given to 130 patients.. If I had intended to blame the Government in tliis matter I should have done so openly. I do not blame them, but I do blame the Repatriation Commission, the members of which are parties to the agreement which has been made. The Chairman of the Commission (Colonel Semmens), I understand, is an individual who occupies two billets* and receives two salaries. for two billets.. because one of .the billets should be filled by some other person.

The authorities in Great Britain are viewing these cases in a somewhat different light; and as a result of improved treatment there-, ifc is hoped that a greater percentage of cases will eventually recover. In a matter like this pertaining to the welfare of afflicted soldiers any proposed change should be brought before the House and thoroughly discussed, in order that there may be no misunderstanding, and no blame improperly imputed either to the Minister or to the Commission..

I ha,ve some warrant for joining in this debate, because I have some knowledge of the reasons why the present -treatment of our afflicted soldiers was adopted. -members' minds back to 1914, and to the practice adopted, first in Egypt, for the treatment of this unfortunate class of cases. sulted first the heads of the departments in Egypt, aud found that the opinion of alienists generally was that the cases should not be segregated in any particular asylum. They believed that the chance of recovery for these men would be very much enhanced if they were allowed to associate with other men, not men suffering from a different, but from the same type of mental trouble as themselves. I was not satisfied, however, with these opinions, because I had received instructions to take a certain course of action with regard to these cases. I, therefore, consulted personal friends of my own, fellow students who had taken up this special work, and were well-known alienists, and they confirmed the opinions 1"" had already received. therefore, that I was warranted in acting independently of the advice I had received from this Government. appointed an alienist from my own State, a well-known man who had devoted years of his life to the study of this problem and had retired from the public service with an honoured name,, to supervise and direct the treatment of this kind of case. He, supported by another alienist in South Australia, strongly urged me not to separate these men from the ordinary inmates of an asylum, pointing out that it would be essential, if we were going to draft them into one hospital, to gather a staff together. that the most important thing in the treatment of this class of case was the Bpccial qualifications, not of the medical officer, but of the nursing staff, which, he added, should be properly trained and specially fitted for this field of nursing. 'All honourable members would obiect most strenuously to receiving nursing attention from unqualified nurses in an ordinary hospital, yet, apparently, they are content that a body of unqualified and untrained nurses should be appointed to attend these mental cases. The Sir fteville Howse. system I introduced in 1914 was continued, I think, with success up to 1918. Then we found a different system growing up in this country. When I came back in 1919 I was asked by the Government to inspect the mental and civil I want to carry honourable hospitals in all the States; and after spending four or five weeks in the discharge of that duty, I strongly urged the Government to discontinue the segreIn my official capacity, I congation of the Australian Imperial Force mental case9, giving as my authority thc opinions I had received from alienists m England and. in Egypt. However, I was unable to persuade the Government to make that change; and from that day to this, a period of six years, I have been attempting to get done what the Government now contemplate doing. Those who know me will accept my assurance that what is proposed to be done is in the best interests of our comrades who are unfortunately afflicted with mental disorders as a. result of the war. Personally, I am extremely glad that this discussion has taken place. I hope it will have the effect of silencing once and for all criticism due to a misunderstanding, and lead I considered, to a cessation of questions regarding the treatment of mental cases, It must be most painful for relatives of these former I then Australian Imperial Force men to read, week after week, that discussions are taking place about their allegedly brutal treatment, or that questions are being asked whether, if the Government are feeding and clothing these patients properly. Let us to-day agree to cease these discussions, because, while they might benefitus in our constituencies, it is most unpleasant for the relatives of these unfortunate sufferers to be so repeatedly reminded of their trouble. It is impossible for us to think of fhe He also assured me condition of these men without a feeling of sadness. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), with his medical knowledge, has clearly placed before us the difference between mental cases the result of war and the mental patients in our civil institutions. The opinion of well-known alienists is that out of every hundred cases of late Australian Imperial Force men now under control on account of mental disability, 50 per cent, are absolutely hopeless so far as concerns the possibility of recovery. These men, I may add, have no cognisance of their environment. Of the remainder, 40 per cent, may he regarded as hopeless and incurable, but with some knowledge of their environment. and these, I submit, are extremely important. Alienists tell me that if these cases are given the very best of treatment there will be a chance of the patients recovering aiid returning to their homes. How nice it would be to be able to say. that of all. For the best treatment of 'this 10 j>er cent, of cases I ask honourable members to accept the opinion of men who have devoted their lives to the study of these problems. I know that many of my friends outside this House believe that .they are quite qualified to express sound opinions, not only upon mental disorders, but upon the treatment of cancer and other appalling afflictions. They almost persuade themselves that they are in a better position to know what is best for a patient' than medical men who have devoted their lives to the study of special diseases. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) will'agree with me tliat the knowledge of ordinary medical practitioners, gained from the few mental cases that come, to them during their career, is not to bo. put against the experience and knowledge of men who the study of mental treatment. It has been clearly pointed out that these specialists are not interested in retaining the patients under their control; they are interested solely in effecting cures. I have looked into the agreement that the Government contemplate making with the State of Victoria, and if it did not retain to the people's representatives in this Parliament complete responsibility and control of every case, I would not support it for a moment, nor would any other reasonable man. Every Government since the commencement of the war has undertaken the sacred responsibility of caring for the soldiers, and it is our duty to see runt this obligation is fulfilled. ""We may yet have to point out to the Government that we are not satisfied in regard to certain powers that have been delegated to the State, but I personally am satisfied with the transfer of the treatment of mental cases. Honourable members seem to have overlooked the fact that throughout Australia the treatment' of mental cases has been left to State institutions, without the assistance of whicli it would have been impossible to provide ordinary There remain 10 per cent., skilled treatment to the mental cases that have arisen since the soldiers first entered the training camps. The unfortunate and pernicious system which has been adopted in Victoria of separating the soldier mental cases, and trying to retain to the Repatriation Department control over their treatment, arose in the early stages of the big camps. A great number of men broke down mentally in the strange environment of a military camp, and, as there was no room for them in the civil institutions, the Oommonwealth was compelled to establish separate hospitals. I accept the assurance of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) that he raised this matter bona fide in the in* terests of his former comrades, but I think that he. would havo acted mora wisely had be brought about a general discussion upou the whole question of repatriation. Apparently, a number of honourable members are dissatisfied witli the conduct of the Repatriation Department. If that is so, it is their duty,however unpleasant it may be, to protest against the objectionable features of the administration. I am inclined to think, however, that a good deal have devoted their lives to of tlie antagonism to the Repatriation Department is caused by returned sailors' and soldiers' associations, which do not represent the views of the majority of the soldiers. Their complaints are certainly not endorsed by the big country association to which I have the honour to belong. When we place cases before the Repatriation Department we have no trouble in getting them dealt with in a sympathetic and reasonable way. But honourable members are aware of the difficulty of dealing with men who have been at the war. The mental state of any of us who went through those dreadful years of active service is not nxactly normal. WhilstI may not observe abnormality in myself, I notice it in others who were at the war; they are not quite as they were before undergoing that experience. No member of this House wishes to shirk his responsibility to the soldiers, ancl I am certain that my colleague (Dr. Earle Page), who did so much brilliant operative work during the, war, would be tbe last to suggest that the Government should neglect its duty in this regard. I ask the Souse to accept my assurance that the mental patients are getting the best possible treatment, except that I would like the eight special cases to be distributed throughout Australia and placed in whichever environment the alienists consider would benefit them most. reflection upon the Government, that this discussion should have been brought about by way of a .formal motion for the adjournment of the House. I agree with the mover that it was the duty of the Government, before entering into such an agreement, to consult this Parliament, or, if the agreement had to be made while Parliament was not sitting, to acquaint us without delay with all the reasons for making it. spirit has been shown in this discussion, because this is a matter beyond party polisegregation of mental cases and the failure tical considerations. I had occasion to visit Mont Park Hospital with the members of the Richmond branch of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Association, and that day was the saddest iu my life. Prior to the visit I had an interview with -the then Minister for Repatriation (the late Senator E. D. Millen), and I pay .this tribute to the deceased gentleman, 'that I believe he was anxious to do whatever was best for the inmates of the institution. He asked me to report to him any criticism I cared to make, and he would do anything in his power to rectify whatever was wrong. I made only two suggestions to him. One was that there should be segregation, which the Government is now bringing about, and secondly, that the patients should be allowed to bake walks abroad. Until that time some of those men had not, since entering the institution, been allowed beyond the confines of. a small yard. In every other mental hospital that I have visited, patients who are not dangerous are allowed to go for short walks, and subsequent to my representations to Senator Millen that practice was adopted at Mont Park. I agree with the Government that the segregation of these cases is long overare not congenital cases. due, but whilst I will not dogmatize in opposition to the opinion of medical men, I do not think that it is necessary to hand these unfortunates over to the-control of the State. I admit that with such a small number of patients segregation and classification into five divisions is not possible, without considerably increasing the cost, but I agree with the mover and others who have said that cost should not. enter into consideration when dealing with mental cases that have arisen out of the war. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) stated that expert treatment of these cases cannot be had unless they are dealt with in conjunction with a large number of other cases. Possibly the treatment cannot be obtained as cheaply, but I have yet to learn that it is not possible to obtain' it other than by including these men in large State institutions. All hospitals have visiting specialists, and I believe that the environment of a military mental hospital is particularly suitable to these soldier cases. The doctor who was in charge at Mont Park was a very estimable and earnest man, and enjoyed the conI am glad that no party fidence of everybody who visited the hospital. With the exception of the nonto give the patients walking exercise the institution was very well conducted. I am prepared to accept many of the assurances of the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse) regarding the treatment of these cases, but that is not the only consideration. A number of these men-sad , pitiable creatures-ar e beyond the stage of knowing what treatment they are getting. But I do protest on behalf of their relatives and friends against their transfer to the State Lunacy Department. Unfortunate as it is, and inexplicable, too, the fact remains that there is not a family with a relative in a mental hospital but is ashamed of the fact. There is no logical reason why the disease of the brain should be any more a stigma than is the disease of any other part of the body, but we know that it is so regarded. If one knows that a inember of a family is in a hospital, with some physical ailment, he makes inquiries regarding the patient, but if the sufferer is in a mental hospital the subject is avoided, in order not to hurt the feelings aud susceptibilities of the relatives. ordinary mental cases, but soldier cases are on a different footing.

I am satisfied that while separate treatment by the Commonwealth might cost a little more, it could be as good as can be obtained by handing the patients over to the State institution; indeed, it should be better, because the smallness of the number treated, which the Treasurer emphasized, is an advantage rather than a handicap. One entering a hospital which has a large number of patients cannot receive as good treatment and attention as in a small private hospital where theinmates are few. I say not one word against the doctors and nurses in the large public hospitals. Having-regard to the number they handle they do wonderful work, but the fewer patients in a private hospital receive special and individual attention'. ber's opinion is quite contrary to that expressed by Dr. Mayo last week, and to the opinion of experts all over tbe world. respect' to the expert opinion of medical men, but the layman can take a common sense view, and boguided by his own experience.

If we accept this agreement we ask their parents and friends to suffer humiliation-no t that they have anything of which to be ashamed, but because of the feeling' that we know exists throughout the country with respect to lunatic asylums. This change was not made years ago, because at that time public opinion against it was too strong. While I wish the war spirit to die, I admit that we are not s>o generous to-day to the returned soldier who suffered for his country as we were during the war. The Federal Government is responsible for the condition of these men, and should not shirk its responsibility. I listened with great interest to the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse), because; he has special knowledge and means of knowledge regarding this matter. I appreciate fully the fact that a discussion of this nature is very painful to those patients who are capable of appreciating it , and to their friends and relatives, but it would be infinitely more deplorable if , by reason of that fact, we shirked our duty as a Parliament and failed to ventilate this serious question. I therefore applaud the action of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) in moving the adjournment of the House in order to discuss it . I do so the more Relatives readily because a subject of such a nature should not be approached with any vestige of party feeling whatever'. These men were the representatives of the Commonwealth in arms in the Great War, and their control is a Commonwealth responsibility. The question of psychology arises in connection with this subject. There is a. feeling on. the part of the friends and relatives of these afflicted men that we, the representatives of the people in the Commonwealth Parliament, are, by this proposed transfer, shirking a duty Visiting which belongs to the national Parliament, and are passing ib on to a subordinate body.

If they were-and it is not for me to deny it they are heroes still. Their claim upon the Commonwealth is as strong to-day as it was in the beginning and during the course of the war. We must not forget the promise made in the enthusiasm of the old recruiting days: that we would look after them and regard them as a class apart, with respect to their place of residence and the treatment they would receive. We promised them! that they would be recognised and treated as essentially soldier cases. If this transfer takes place, the time is rapidly approaching when the general public w ill lose sight altogether of the special character of these cases. A friend of mine recently visited the Mont Park Asylum, and the message he brought back was exactly in the same terms as those used by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Soullin) this afternoon. It was the most painful experience that visitor had ever had. The view of those best able to judge is that these cases should be segregated. The honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse) has stated that under the proposed agreement they w ill remain so. The honourable'member is entitled to the utmost respect when he deals with professional matters; but as one who has had some practical experience of these As things, I tell him that any control the Commonwealth will have under the agreement will be more theoretical than real. So far as Victoria is concerned, the whole administration will pass to the State, and w ill be in the hands of the Inspector-General for the Insane^ and these I do not know what lunatic patients, and nothing else. Strong representations have been made to me by the Fairfield and Alphington branches of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and the thoughtful memorandum on the subject prepared by Mr Ratcliffe I have endeavoured to place before the House. Altliough I have not always been in complete accord with the aims of these To some extent organizations, if they are not qualified to speak for the soldiers, I do not know who be additions to is. I would not take the responsibility of saying that associations of this kind do not represent the views of the soldiers generally. In any case, if suoh views are not held by the soldiers, it is their own fault, as they should be able to express themselves through their organizations in the same way as any other body of men. I do not desire to introduce into this discussion the case of any particular individual, but to-day. I had a visit from one of the employees at Mont Park. This man, who served with distinction in the late war, informed me that after about two years' service at Mont Park he recently presented himself for duty in the ordinary way, but was told that his job was finished. He did not receive even ten minutes' notice. I shall not give the"" particulars of the case to the House, but shall placethem before the Minister, who, I know, will give them attention; I mention it because neither the Minister nor any other member of this House desires that any Government employee should be treated with less consideration than the law insists shall be given to the",27,Maloney The Minister S Will Be Extended To Me The Important

The difficulties of assessing thia tax are proving as great as was' anticipated in my speech last year, and, though the Commissioner's officers have been concentrating on the work of collecting additional information for the purpose of checking the accuracy of former valuations, that work is still incomplete except in comparatively few cases, and in these the result of pending appeals to the High Court and possible litigation may require further revision of thc basis of valuation. upon notice1.

The actual amount outstanding will not bo available until the revised valuations which are now proceeding are complete. 2.

In most cases tax remitted includes the' relief granted both in respect of Crown leaseholds I am confident that this special and other holdings in land. No remissions have been made by the Government. The only authority constituted by Parliament to grant remissions of land tax is the Belief Board constituted by section 06 of the Act. interrupted understanding 3.

It was not possible to delay payment of the bounty u n t i l the House met, because the canning season commenced last December and is now more than half over.

When the Government took office the f r u it industiy was being helped by so-called Pools, which were set up by the late Government for the years 1920-21, 192122, and 1922-23. These, in reality, were not Pools, because the Government took all the risk by buying the f r u it , processing it , and selling it , bearing the whole of the loss, which was considerable. The Pools were formed because the canning factories contended that they were not in a position financially to purchase and dispose of the soft fruits available.

173,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"au average loss over the three years of Â£206,000 per annum. These, losses were mainly due, firstly, to the high cost of processing f r u it , and secondly, to the slump which occurred in the British market during the 1921-22 season and the very poor demand for canned fruits in Australia unti l the middle of last year. Under the Pools the loss was greater than the actual amount paid to the grower. The 1922 fruits were sold in London for less than the actual cost of processing them. A price of 7s. 6d. per dozen was paid to the processer, and the bulk of the f r u it was sold in London at 7s. per dozen. When the Government took office there was a total quantity of 1,950,000 dozen 30-oz. tins of f r u it on hand unsold. It was necessary to sell the lot, so that the factories could have a clear market for the new season's f r u it . The trade, and every one concerned, stated that it was impossible to clear the stocks before the 1923-1924 season commenced in December, 1923. The Government, therefore, reduced the price and set out on a publicity and advertising campaign. The result has been that all stocks have been sold witli the exception of 64,000 dozen of specially packed f r u it which is now in London"", to be sold during the jn-ogress of the British Empire Exhibition. The Australian consumption of canned fruits has been increased from one to three tins per person per annum. This is a great advantage to the industry. The handling of this f r u it was really a State matter, but the Commonwealth realized that, unless it dealt with the question last year, the orchardists and the canning industry would have a very bad time. It was found that, under the so-called Pools, the position was getting worse from day to day from the stand-point of both the taxpayer and the fruit-grower. Tlie Government, therefore, faced the position boldly, and decided to give a bounty to the canner on production, with an additional bounty on all high quality fruits exported. The canners strongly opposed the bounty system: some even said that they would close their factories rather thau work under it . bounty to which they objected ? jected to the proposal all round. Theyf r u it , when canned, is of good and merwanted us to give them another Pool. chantable quality. Under the old system the canners were ore stationed in each factory w it h instrucreceiving a pretty good price for canning tions to reject all unsuitable fresh f r u it the f r u it , whilst running no risks. Naturally, they did not want to deal w i th the matter in a way which would involve risk with practically no prospect of obtaininga greater profit. When canning, finishes, in about two months' time, excluding, pineapples, about 20,000 tons of fruitwill have been dealt with. That is an increase of 3,000 tons on the quantity dealt w i th last year. There w ill be about 3,500 tons of pineapples this year which were uot handled last year. The total cost to the taxpayer w ill be about Â£130,000, compared with an average loss of Â£206,000 per annum during the last three years. Under the bounty system the Government take no part in the trading side of the business. That is in accordance with our policy. We merely pay the bounty to the canner, but protect the grower by compelling the canner to pay him a f a i r price for his f r u it , namely, Â£10 per ton for apricots and pears, Â£9 per Ionf o r clingstone peaches, Â£7 per ton for freestone peaches, and Â£6 per ton for pineapples. B a i l freight is paid by the canner; the grower delivers his f r u it to the factory or to the nearest railhead. The rates of bounty paid to the canner on production areApricots, 9d. per dozen 30-oz. tins. Peaches (freestone), lOd. per dozen 30-oz. tins. Pears, 9d. per' dozen 30-oz. tins. Peaches (clingstone), Is. per dozen 30-oz. tins. Pineapples, Od. per dozen 30-oz. tins. Then there is the additional bounty on exported f r u it at the following rates per dozen 30-oz. tins: Apricots, Is. 8d. Peaches (freestone),, nil. Pears, Is. 6d. Peaches (clingstone), Is. 9d. Pineapples, Is. Provision is made whereby, if the weights differ from 30 ozs., payment is to Be on a -pro ratd basis. The growers, canners, and traders admit that the canned-fruit industry is to-day, under the bounty system, on a more stable footing than ever before, and its future is practically assured. The bounty is to be paid to the canner provided he pays to the growers not less than Customs inspectors",36,Canned Fru It Bounty Bill Second Reading

Export is not allowed unless the f r u it s are graded and packed in accordance with the commerce regulations. Last season, the Customs Department organized an inspection staff to supervise the canning of f r u it s for export, w i th the result that the pack sent to London during 1923 was pronounced by the trade to be equal, if not superior, to the best California^ f r u it .

Some people condemn the Governanent for having sold fruit at a low price abroad, bub their action had the effect of extending the market for our fruit. canners offered to the scheme was that in handling this season's fruit they would be faced with a surplus of canned fruit in the mavket and would have to reduce ' their prices. That objection has been removed because the mauket was cleared of canned fruit very promptly, and the publicity provided by the action of the Government has had the effect of creating a larger market in the Old Country for our -fruit. It can be very readily disposed^ -"".'of, 'and -so the prospects of the oann'eiis have been improved. The figures which were taken out, in considering thc matter; show that if we consumed a3 much fruit per head in this country as is consumed in the United States of America and England, we would not require to export any, as it could all be consumed here, and after all the bestmarket is the home market. Owing to the management of those responsible for the selling of last season's fruit twice as much fruit was consumed in the Commonwealth last season as in previous seasons. T. think that we have done the best thing that could be done iu the circumstances. The Government have every reason to believe that a wider market and an enhanced price will enable the orchardists and canners of Australia to carry on their industries without assistance. That is why it is proposed that the bounty shall be payable only for one year. The fruit season is over to a great extent now, and the introduction of this measure seems somewhat like asking Parliament to validate what has already been done. We were forced into that position, because if we had waited for Parliament to meet before taking action, the orchardists, the canners, and those employed in canning factories would have been at their wits' end to know what to do. Bill provides for the payment of bounties pointed out on the 9th October last by on the production aud export of fruit. Sir Lloyd Graeme, that the then British No d'oubt can exist as to the necessity They refused to take any further for encouraging our orchardists, but I deubfc very -much whether this measure will prove' to be of any permanent value. We The Minister has definitely stated that those concerned must understand that the payment of the bounty will cease at the expiration of this year. If that is so, it seems to me that those engaged in the production and export of fruit will at the expiration of this year find themselves in The main objection which the a more difficult position than they occupy al the present time. I say this for a reason which was advanced by the Minister himself. He reminded us that there are hundreds of returned soldiers who have established orchards in the different States, to say nothing of the other settlers who are producing fruit in this country. The production of fruithas increased very rapidly in Australia in the last two years. It will increase more rapidly during the next year or two. In support of that statement. I quote the admission of the Minister that the orchards established by the returned soldier settlers are just coming into bearing. That is quite correct, and their production of fruit will be very much larger next year and the following year than it has been this season. In view of the probable considerable increase in the production of fruit, I ask where are we to find a market.for it? The Minister has said that ait-hough we lost money by selling fruit cheaply in the Old Country, we created a larger demand for our fruit. It will be admitted by every one that if you sell an article at half its' value you will increase the demand for it, but we cannot continue along those lines. When the payment of the bounty ceases at the end of this year, and higher prices must be charged for our fruit, those engaged in the industry will not be able .to retain the increased market to which the Minister has referred. The Government is bringing out inumagrante and placing them on the land, and we must find a market for their products. Some honourable members may be under the impression that the growers of fresh fruit will receivesome benefit as a result of the adoption of the resolutions of the Imperial Economic Conference, but I point out that they will not come under the resolutions to which the last Imperial Government agreed, and to which I hope effect will be given",38,Chapman Th E Bounty Scheme Has Been Proposed As Pro
190,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [5.5],"Tliis by the Imperial Parliament. It wasGovernment was prepared to give a preference ou dried fruits. We cannot anticipate that the production of fresh fruit will be benefited by the adoption of the resolutions of the Conference, since they refer only to dried fruits. We are putting thousands of men on the land in the different States as orchardists withoutbeing able to insure to them a market for their produce. One of the first things that should be done by not only the Federal Government, but the State Governments also, is to provide as much work as possible for the secondary industries. By the employment of thousands of persons in the secondary industries an improved market will be provided for those engaged in growing fruit and other products of the land. We must look largely to our own consumption, and at the same time do the best we can to open up markets for our fruit abroad, not only in Great Britain, but in other countries too. I am fully aware that the canners have raised strong objections to the Government proposal. Personally, I think that they are on a very good wicket, and that they will derivei more benefit from the operation of this measure than will be derived by the growers of fruit. I do not know whether in the circumstances it is wise for us to legislate on these lines. It would probably be more advisable, in the interests of the country, and especially of the growers of fruit, to develop some im]Droved system for the marketing of our fruit. Honourable members will find from the schedules to the Bill that for certain classes of fruit the grower is to receive something like Id. per lb., and yet to purchase the same fruit in Melbourne we have to pay from 7d. to 8d. per lb. There is something radically wrong, which should be grappled with! There* would appear to be certain persons between the man who grows fruit and the man who consumes it who are deriving the greatestbenefit from the industry. I was in Western Australia recently, and while there visited the Old Men's Home. While I was at the home twenty-four cases of beautiful grapes, probably better than could be produced in any of the other States, were sent there from the market because they were unsaleable. Those who grew that frui t liad to bear all the costs of production, pay freight to market, and then got no return. pocket. Mr Charlton. whole business was a distinct loss to them. Tliis measure is only a temporary expedient for the purpose of giving immediate a'elief. It does not touch the kernel of the trouble. That can only be done by legislative action, either in this or in the State Parliaments. We cannot go on for ever paying away public money as this Bill contemplates, because it is not a permanent cure of the trouble, and therefore it is not really beneficial to any one. If some means could be devised to market our fruit so that the producer would get double what he receives under existing arrangements, and the consumer would get fruit for 25 per cent, less, our difficulties would be solved, because greater consumption in the home market would absorb the present surplus production. The Bill does not go to the root of the trouble at all. '< v a present difficulty. '"" appears to me. It is a measure to escape a temporary difficulty. There is nothing permanent about it. The Minister admits that the scheme will expire in November, and that then the growers will be thrown upon their own resources again. Does any honourable member believe that they will then be in a better position to overcome their difficulty ?. On the contrary, they will be in a much worse position, because of expansion in production. The situation is clearly set out in the following table showing our exportation of fresh fruits:Quantity. Value. 1917-18 ... 4,648,900 lbs. Â£46,481 19.1.8-19 ... 20,809,100 â 188,381 191920 ... 42,722,200 â 466,910 192021 ... 51,686,200 â 535,525 192122 ... 97,343,800 â 973,726 The fact that in the year 1921-22 our exports of fresh fruit increased by nearly 50,000,000 lbs. indicates an enormous advance in production, which I venture tp say will be very much greater during the next few years. This must be so, because in every State greater areas are being placed under orchards. What are the prospects? We may as well face the position squarely. We know that at present there is no prospect at all of disposing of this increased output.

Such a scheme as that should not fail. believe that the Government could devise means for the disposal of considerably more fruit than is sold in Australia today, and that the grower would receive better prices. Unless something of this kind is done, I can see no hope for the future of those who have gone into the fruit growing industry. Many of tliese people have put all they possessed into the business. In some of the States, and particularly in New South Wales, thousands of our returned soldiers are now in the fruit-growing industry. they can get over a number of years is put into their properties, and they have to wait for a return until the orchards are in full bearing. If when fihat stage is reached there is no market for their products, they mush fail. I kuow of ono man who a few years ago engaged in fruit-growing ou an irrigation area with a capital of Â£1,000. Unfortunately, his crops were not successful, and he was stranded. The same tiling will happen to many other orchardists if there is no market for their products. It should be part of our policy of land settlement to provide a market for the primary producer. I am not opposed to this Bill; I wish to help both the producer and the consumer. But I have grave doubts that this expedient will relieve the position to any extent. many months distant; there is no prospect of finding in the meantime markets abroad, and local consumption will nob be equal to the production. I hope that before it is too late the Government will either confer with the State Governments or adopt some other means of handlingthis very difficult problem. do not provide a solution; we must get down to bed-rock. The Commonwealth Government has already lost upwards of Â£500,000 on the Fruit Pools, and is now about to pay under this measureÂ£130,000 or Â£140,000 by way of bonuses, without the prospect of any permanent improvement in the position of the fruit industry. The time has arrived when the problem must be grappled in a proper way, and I hope that before this Parliamentcloses some tangible scheme will be evolved whereby we can marketour goods abroad, and increase the local' consumption, so that the producer will will get a necessary commodity at lessI cost. in hearty agreement with the peroration of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). I am not in favour of the granting of bonuses under all sorts of conditions, but we are confronted with n problem resulting from good intentions which has caused tlie Commonwealth Government an immense loss. I understand that, inclusive of the proposed bonus, about Â£750,000 of Commonwealth money has been lost during the last few years All the money in trying to bolster up the fruit industry. Towards the end of last session there was a good deal of controversy on this point. The growers did not know what to do-: the Commonwealth was faced with a big carry-over of canned fruits, and some of us thought that by wise administration these carry-over stocks would be cleared and a bigmarket opened in England. That, I understand, has been done, thanksto the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) and tlie Minister for Trade and Customs. Now we are asked to confirm what has been done. I do not say tliat the canners will not be getting a very good deal, particularly if the British Parliament should give us a further preference by lifting entirely the duty onSeptember is not canned fruits, hut I do not consider that the whole of the Â£'750,000 will have been lost if ultimately we capture the large canned fruit market that is open to us in England. we get it? larly if weget some assistance.

213,Mr Pratten,"I think so. particurepresent more than 1,000,000 cases. Although fruit-growing is perhaps in a more parlous condition than any other primary industry in thc Commonwealth, and, although there has been much talk of an apparent over-production of soft and berry fruits, if , as aresult of this bounty to help export a large market is opened up overseas, the outlook will be by no means discouraging. The export will absorb most of the money that the CommonAvealth will pay, because the bounty on local sales will average about lOd. per dozen tins, whilst that on export will average about Is. Sd. per dozen. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to the apparently large difference between the return to the grower and the price paid by the consumer. The difference is clearly accounted for by the cost of distribution and the waste that inevitably occurs with such a perishable product between the grower and the consumer. But fov what it is worth I hazard the opinion that the distribution of frui t will not be all that it should be until that article of diet is delivered to the housewife's door every day in the same way as is meat, bread, and butter. If that were done, the distribution cost would be very much cheaper and the consumption greater. With increased consumption of fresh fruit and the capturing of the bulk of the English market for canned, fruits, the troubles of tlie fruit-growers would be soh cd, and for a fcAV years, at all events, r Ave should not hear so much about overproduction. It is clear that, if the canners have bought this year 20,000 tons of fruit for AA'hich they have paid Â£9 per ton, and they will get by way of bounty for canning, production, and export nearly Â£140,000, they are on "" a good Avicket."" But I take a broad vieAv of the .industry. Something had to be done to prevent ifc nearly going out of existence and the products of the grower being wasted, and in my opinion this alternative suggestion, which we are now asked to confirm, and which places the Avhole responsibility of finance and distribution upon private enterprise, is the best foundation upon AA'hich we could work. The previous Emit Pools have given' us an example of what the socialization of industry can do. The estimated loss on those pools is about Â£600,000, and I believe the Government 1iaAe acted Avisely r in cutting the loss ancl clearing the market. I record my satisfaction that the problem has been temporarily solved in this Avay. The futuremay be alloAved to take care of itself, particularly if. we can recognise the basic fact that fruit is as necessary an article of diet as is butter, meat, bread, and vegetables, and should be delivered at the house door every day. I have pleasure in supporting the Bill. The canners have made a good deal, and, if the British Parliament should afford us that minor preference for which we hope in respect of dried and canned fruits, if the Conimouwealth Government are fair and equitable in regard to sugar drawbacks, and if we get a further advantage in connection with British sugar duties, all will be AAell with the fruit trade, and we shall r have an export of an additional Â£1,000,000 worth of primary and secondary products that will help to pay our debts abroad. [5.43] I shall not oppose the Bill, because of the assistance it proposes to give to the fruit-groAvers, but it proposes very little of AvhatI should like to see done. My objection to it has been Avell voiced by the Leader of . the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), namely, that this scheme gives greater advantage to the canners than to the more deserving people who grow the fruit. The canner will receive Â£d. per lb. more than will the grower. Under present circumstances there may be some justification for helping both parties, but I cannot approve of the disparity between the assistance to be granted to the canner and that to be given to the man who has all the toil and risk of producing the fruit. I am not co enamoured of the scheme as is the honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten), Avho, I suppose, has his own reasons for being enthusiastic regarding the benefits that the private city canner will get. I prefer to take the point of vieAv of the primary producer, and of those tens of thousands of people who may never know the taste of fruit. A great deal has been said about the marketing of our products overseas, but if more attention were given to the wasting distribution in this country, and to building up the local market, there would not be so great a",42,Chapman Th E Bounty Scheme Has Been Proposed As Pro

Since the Queensland Government has been doing this the producer in that State has received a fair return for his labour, and the consumer has been able to purchase f r u it at a moderate price.

The Pederal Treasurer (Dr. Earle that Page) indicated to them that he desired An to establish the industry on a firm founthe dation, and that he wanted them to take any bhe whole responsibility for marketing the fruit. That will be the effect of this Let scheme. I believe that the canners and growers are in a stronger position than formerly, because thisI shall give figures to scheme has been accepted. The Goveniment adopted the right attitude honourable when it agreed to cut its' loss. A consequence of that has been that both the I am makingthis speech. local and oversea fruit markets are now quite clear of old stock. The Goveniment had to do something, because millions of I said no such thing. I money were involved. The people in my electorate were vitally concerned, for they produce 50 per cent, of the soft fruits grown in Australia. In addition to the soldier settlers, new settlers, and I have the men who are well establislied in the industry, hundreds of employees had to be considered. I do not agree with the suggestion of the Minister for Trade and Customs that this is a State matter. I respectfully submit that it is a Eederal responsibility, because this Parliament permitted an embargo to be Subsequently nuplaced upon the importation of sugar. That affected the fruit-grower probably more from the point of view of jam-making, than from that of canning. The two branches of the industry cannot be separated, however. It was proper that the Government should consider tlie interests of the large number of workmen employed in the fruit-growing areas. One of my constituents employs no fewer than twelve married men all the year round. In the busy seasons thousands of men are employed fruit-picking, tilling, cultivating, and spraying in the Murray and Goulburn Valleys. Tliese men would have lost their means of livelihood had the Government not taken some effective action. The canners were undoubtedly hampered by the sugar embargo. One of them, who attended a deputation, said that if the Government would removethe Ruin practically embargo the growers would pay the duty on the sugar, and would not ask fbr a Eventually a scheme was subsidy or a bounty.

256,Mr Forde,"A t the adjournment Ithoy think of the attitude taken up by honourable members of the Country party in this House on big national questions affecting the maintenance of our White Australia policy. If the honourable member had only made a study of the position he would have found that the sugar and fruit industries are closely allied, and that the sugar industry has done a great deal to bring about the successful developfor export, and Â£2 a ton on the sugar conment of fruit-growing. During eight years .exporters of canned fruits have saved over Â£1,000,000 by having Australian sugar supplied instead of having to import at world's parity. not been for the sugar industry, the jam manufacturers of Australia during tlie war would have been paying the world's parity for their sugar. They would have been paying as much as Â£118 a ton. Today they are being supplied with Australian-grown sugar at a price which, including duty, is Â£12 10s. a ton less than the price of sugar grown by black labour. The Minister for Trade and Customs will bear me out in that statement. rect. ally, the honourable member for Echuca misled the House when he spoke about sugar. He knows nothing about the subject. He and the members of his party aro absolute Free Traders, who would wipe out the Tariff, and there is anxiety amongst those in Queensland who support a Protective Tariff, particularly for the sugar industry, because the Composite Government is kept in power by these honourable members, prominent among whom is the lionorable member for Echuca. Earlier in the evening the honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten) asked whether the jam manufacturers were still getting a rebate of Â£9 a ton on sugar used for the manufacture of jams for export. As Java sugar is Â£29 per ton fto.b and freight, refining charges, &c, bring it to Â£35, while the Australian price is Â£35 13s., a rebate of 13s. per ton is given to jam manufacturers. The latest agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government provides that jam manufacturers are to be supplied with sugar at the world's parity. That is to say, if sugar can be bought outside Australia at Â£6 a ton cheaper than it can be bought in Australia, thc jam manufacturer is to get his sugar at a reduction of Â£6. A t the present time the manufacturers who wished to purchase Java sugar would be obliged to pay for it Â£12 10s. a ton more than they aro now paying for Queensland sugar. At present there is a.rebate of 13s. a ton on the sugar contents of jams manufactured tents of confectionery manufactured for export, which concession is in addition to the fact that for the manufacture of jams for export the jam manufacturer has a If it had right to be supplied with sugar at the world's parity. able member for Echuca to say to that? to it. He has let the cat out of the bag, just as Sir Henry Barwell did when he said that he believed in a Black Australia. I want the farmers of Queensland, who are growing sugar, and the farmers of Echuca, whom thc honourable member is urging to back up thc composite Ministry, to know what sentiments are uttered by the farmers' alleged representatives in this House-member s of the Country party-wh o are keeping the Government in ofiice. The honourable member for Echuca said, "" Give us the price of sugar six or nine months ago."" I have quoted the price in Java and Cuba about the time the Prime Minister went north to fix up the agreement with the Queensland Government. I notice that this Bill applies to canned apricots, peaches, pears, ancl pineapples, and that there is no reference to sugar. I have allowed the honourable member every reasonable latitude, but I must ask him now to confine his attention to the Bill. in the canning of fruit, and as the sugar industry had been attacked by the honourable member for Echuca, I was anxious to reply to some of the statements he made, and to tell him that, during the period it was under Government control, that industry had saved the people of Australia Â£17,000,000. Over a period of ten years the average Australian price has been 4^d. per lb. I ask the honourable member for Echuca to get down to facts.

The sugar contents of a tin cost f d . , so that when the honourable member for Echuca declares that the price of sugar is ruining We are told that Henry Jones and Comthe canning industry in Australia, he only shows that he. knows absolutely nothing about thc subject. I take strong exception to the action of the Ganners in increasing the price of canned fruits as soon as they were given this subsidy. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman) will admit that, immediately thc subsidy was granted, the wholesale price of the most popular line, clingstone peaches, was raised from Is. to Is. 6d.

It means that the bounty on local sales goes absolutely to the canner. doing to prevent that? price fixers. purpose of giving a bounty was to enable the canners to sell to the public at the same retail price as last year-a t least so we were told-bu t the fact remains that as soon as the bounty was secured, up went the price to the consumer. The canners are making phenomenal profits out of thisbounty. Who got the Â£618,000 which represented the loss on the Fruit Pool? I know that the fruit-growers received approximately Â£120,000, and I presume that the canners got the balance. The Leader of the Opposition declares that the canners get | d . more than the Government gives to the growers for the fruit. At the same time that they increased the price of canned peaches the canners reduced the price of canned apricots. cots sold, fifty tins of peaches are sold, because peaches are the more popular fruit. honorablo member cannot substantiate that statement. adopted by these canners of fruit who support the present Federal Government. The Government are aware that by giving this subsidy they will be helping their friends, the wealthy canners, more than the fruit-growers. The growers of f r u it in Australia are not sufficiently protected. The Government has no solution to offer. I believe they are having a difficult time. pany and other canners are also having a bad time. Let us see what truth there is in that statement. We have only to refer to the Australasian Investment Digest. and we shall find that Henry Jones and Company, in the years 1919 to 1923, made the following profits:Year ended 15th November, 1919, Â£100,866. Year ended 15th November, 1920, Â£123,365. Year .ended 31st October, 1921, Â£92,109. Year ended 31st October, 1922, Â£103,948. Year ended 31st October, 1923, Â£135,395. In addition to making these profits, the company put into reserve no less than Â£111,000 during the same period. We What is the Minister were told that the canners were having a bad time, and they threatened they would only so much bluff. They knew that the Government that is financed by the wealthy corporations, which to-day are bleeding the farmers of Australia, could not say "" no "" to them. The Government is controlled by wealthy rings outside, and there is a ring to-day amongst* the canners of fruit in Australia. In Queensland something is being done which is likely to be very beneficial to the fruit growers of that State. I believe that the only solution of their difficulty lies in some improvement in the marketing of their fruit. Something must be done to control the operation of the numerous agents who are handling the marketing of fruit, and making 400 and 500 per cent, profit, whilst the grower of the fruit is receiving less than a living wage for his labour. The Queensland Government has passed a Fruit Marketing Organization Act, which aims at putting an end to the exploitation of the fruit growers. It aims at the elimination of the rapacious middleman, who stands entrenched behind the Federal Government am afraid the to-day. The object of the Fruit Marketing Organization Act is to provide for the better organization of the marketing of Qiieensland fruit.

The bodies to be constituted under the Queensland measure will act in conjunction with farmers' rural associations, and if the Federal Government co-operated with the State Governments to secure the establishment throughout Australia of a non-party rural organization they would do more for the farmers of this country than they can do by assisting organizations to put men like tbe honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) and Stewart) into the House, and trying to divide the farmers politically. Queensland the rural scheme is meeting with the greatest success amongst the farmers. Six hundred local producers' associations have been formed. Each of these associations has the right to send a delegate to a district council, which in turn has the right to send a delegate to a central council sitting in Brisbane with the power to speak authoritatively to the State Government on behalf of the organizations of farmers throughout Queensland, and to make suggestions as to the legislation which should be passed to secure bettor marketing facilities for farmers' produce.

It was my privilege in the Queensland Parliament to advocate the establishment of a State Cannery. It was established for the purpose of buying up thousands of cases of pineapples which otherwise would have rotted on the fields of the soldier settlements in Queensland, where they were grown. From its inception in 1923 the State Cannery absorbed 160,000 cases of pineapples, of which 150,000 eases were obtained from the soldier settlements. As the State Cannery couldgive higher prices than were being paid by private Under the Fruit Marketing canneries in Queensland, the result of its operations was an increase in prices all round to the growers of pineapples. That is something that State enterprise was able to do in Queensland. In addition to the payments made for the fruit, the Queensland Government made grants by way of subsidy to returned soldier growers amounting .to Â£7,111 in two years: I mention these f acts to suggest ways in which the Commonwealth Government by co-operation with State Governments may be able to organize the marketing of fruit instead of establishing pools, from which the canners of Australia have derived Â£500,000 as against Â£120,000 paid to the fruit-growers.

They are satisfied that the price that they are to-day getting in Australia is a fair reward for their labour, and they want both to build up their own industry and the dependent industries as well. The action of the Sugar Pool proves that. It is just as well to putthat fact on record now. Certain references have been made to the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill), but I wish to say that no one has worked harder than he did during the last ten or twelve months to put on a sound footing the fruit industry, which is represented by thousands of returned soldiers, and tens of thousands of small farmers. In addition, during the last seven or eightyears, he has exercised, to their full extent, the whole of his energies and ability to stabilize the wheat industry, and I cannot understand the accusations and criticisms levelled at him, aud the suggestion that he is not a true Australian. thanking the honourable member for Echuca for the assistance he gave the Government in this connection, and for bhe pertinacity and capacity with which he has urged the growers' claims during the last six or eight months. I say frankly that the fruit-growers are fortunate in having as a representative a .man who so ably and persistently urges their claims. We have heard a great deal about the Bill being a palliative and not a permanent solution of the trouble, assuring the future prosperity of the industry. industry when the Government took steps to assist it, some thirteen or fourteen months,ago. Up to that time there were three Fruit Pools, the third drawing almost to a close. There were, stored in London and Australia, almost the whole of two fruit packs. overshadowed the market, and the outlook for the next fruit pack was almost impossible to contemplate. decided first of all to ascertain exactly what had been the root cause of the failure of previous Fruit Pools, and, having discovered that, to endeavour to put the fruit industry on a sound footing. The Government has grappled with the problem, and has met with a great measure of success, since it has enabled the ever-expanding production of fruit to be gradually absorbed -. The position previouslv was that in the first year of the Fruit Pool there was a total loss of about Â£30,000. In the second year, as we found when the whole of the pool had been straightened out, there was a loss of Â£370,000. A great deal of that was due to interest charges on the continually accumulating stocks which could uot be disposed of by the methods then in force. Thus when the last pack was on our hands we faced a most"" difficult position. Since a loss was inevitable, the Government determined to make it as tolerable as possible by adopting a scheme to popularize the Australian fruit on the Australian market. labour ? tion of a scheme for the expansion of the home market and the consumption in Australia of great quantities of locallygrown fruit, we endeavoured to insure that, the industry could be profitably carried on by white labour. Honourable I take this opportunity of members opposite, by their tacit acquiescence in previous methods, are content, apparently, that a large proportion of our fruit shall be eaten outside by black labour. We on this side of the Mouse have all along been endeavouring to insure that, as far as possible, it shall be eaten by our own people. Our efforts in this direction have been rewarded with a substantial measure of success. Last year we had on the market 2,000,000 dozen tins of fruit, either here or in England. Faced, as we were then, with another fruit pack on the top of an Let us visualize the position of the already glutted market, we realized that-, unless we could shift the product, we should have to accept the lowest prices on record and be confronted with losses appalling to; contemplate. The Government decided, therefore, to take steps immediately to increase the consumption They completely of Australian fruit by the best possible means, namely, to sell the best quality fruit at the lowest possible price in AusThe Government tralia. Fruit which previously had cost the consumer 15d. per tin was made available to the people of Australia at lOid. per tin. We decided that, as a loss was inevitable, our best course was to confer some benefit on the taxpayer by making this fruit available to consumers-wh o are also the taxpayers-in Australia at 4Â£d. per tin below the price hitherto ruling. As a result, we were able to sell 1,200,000 dozen tins of fruit in Australia in eight",52,Chapman W E Are Not Have To Close Their Factories That Was

283,,"Dr. EARLE PAGE -B y the adopmonths, whereas in the whole of the previous twelve months the Australian market had absorbed only 400;,000 dozen tins. But we were not satisfied with that. ""We recognised that the time had come for action in the direction of making the Australian consumption of canned fruit approximate that in America, where, before OUT campaign, it was almost seven 1 times greater. We have halved that difference, for our consumption now isthree times greater than it was a year ago. If , however, Australians ate as much canned fruit per head of population as the people of the United States, our exportable surplus, on the present basis of production, would be only 100,000 dozen tins, which would not be enough to fill the requirements of the New Zealand market. We should have no exportable surplus for the overseas market at all. consumer have to pay now for the lOAd. tins 1 pertinent interjection. He will still pay, approximately, the same prices. As the outcome of the Government's efforts, the Australian consumption has been enormously increased. The Government have decided to continue this policy for another year to enable the fruit to be sold .at the reduced price. It is proposed in this measure to give, on all fruit canned for consumption . in Australia, such a bounty as to permit of that price being retained. But there have been certain alterations in the prices. As the crop of apricots was greater than thc crop of peaches, the price for apricots per dozen tins has been reduced, and the price for peaches correspondingly increased, but the total amount to, be received by the canners will-be practically the same as that which the Government received last year, for the fruit that it sold. The Government proposal for the absorption of the surplus Australian fruit pack was a reasonable and constructive scheme. It enabled Australian canned fruit to be eaten in places like Winton, Rockhampton, Longreach, and Bourke, where previously it was rarely seen; and, moreover, it enabled fruit to be placed on Australian tables in much greater quantities, than ever before. A t the same time, an extensive advertising campaign was launched to impress upon the people of Australia the fact that they could get this canned fruit from their storekeepers; at a very reasonable price. The Government recognised, further, that the problem before the industry was the disposal of this yearly surplus. We felt that if we could increase the consumption per head in Australia up to the level of the American, we would have a very small exportable surplus. Unfortunately the facilities for transport, as well as defects in our distribution system, must prove a barrier to the complete achievement of that object. We then considered the possibilities of the British market, and decided that, in addition to the bonus to be paid on canned fruits for Australian consumption, we would give: an additional export bonus to place our canners. on a footing of equality with exporters of Californian fruit, which was being dumped on the English market. Because of what we have done, Australia now has a permanent place on the Britishf r u it market. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), when in Great Britain, and Senator Wilson, as the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) pointed out last night, . concluded very favorable arrangements with large distributing agencies in England to handle our fruit , insuring that it should be distributed throughout the United Kingdom as an Australian product. In thisi way the indtistry is being judiciously advertised in tlie Mother Country. As a result of our action, the present f r u it pack came on a market that was practically clear of Australian fruit, and it is being disposed of to very great advantage indeed. It has been said to-night that the Government proposal enables the canners to get more for their work than is paid to the growers. That is not so. Thef r u it is being sold at 9s. 3d. per dozen tins. bounty is necessary in order to secure, the British market, will it not be necessary to .continue the bounty to preserve that market? that point before I resume my seat. I want now to deal with the relative amounts which the growers and the canners will receive under this measure.

After the canner has deducted his bounty he still has to pay Â£6 per ton for apricots. That disposes completely out this calculation very carefully. The Leader of the Opposition will have his opportunity of speaking later. I am giving the House figures which have been prepared for me by the Customs Department. ing with one schedule of the Bill only, and not with the export business. with home consumption. and see where they lead you. the Opposition would listen to what I am saying, he would discover that my statement is correct. He or some other member of his party can state his case afterwards. I want to state my views now. I am explaining the position regarding apricots. The Leader of the Opposition takes the case of a bounty on exports and attempts to mislead the House by stating that that is the whole story. I am stating the correct position in plain,, matterconcession, and goes, a long way towards of-fact terms. I distinctly said that I was. referring to fruit sold in Australia. only one in which we can get any reliable data. We know how much each tin sells for in Australia, but we do not know how much it realizes abroad. To-day it is one price, and to-morrow it is another. Any figures the honourable member may cite regarding export are fallacious, unless they postulate a definite rate of sale all the time. schedules to the Bill. quoted by the Leader of the Opposition were only estimates. I am stating the price at which tins of fruit are sold in Australia. The bounty that is being paid at the present time amounts roughly to Â£4 per ton on fruit. Only 10 per cent, of the fruit produced in America is sent to Great Britain, the. other 90 per cent, being consumed in America. When such put is consumed in the local, highly protected market, it is obvious that the other 10 per cent, can be sold abroad at dumped prices, while still securing a fair average price for the total product. It may be necessary in the future to do something to assist our export market, though I doubt whether it will be, because we are putting up at the present time a better article than that produced by any other country. The Australian article, for flavour, colour, and packing, is without equal in the British market. We have been able this year, by the export bounty, to establish ourselves thoroughly in the British market. This has been done, not by means of Government agencies, but through ordinary commercial channels, the canners being responsible for the sale and distribution of the pack. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) when he was in England put up a very gallant fight for increased preference for this industry. Alreadyi n the British market we have some preference over Californian fruit, by reason of the fact that in our Australian fruit industry we use Australian grown sugar. We are allowed a preference of one-sixth of the British duty on sugar. Thus we receive a rebate of Â£4 5s. per ton on the sugar-content of our fruit. That works out at about Id. per tin, which is a fairly substantial paying the difference in freight between Great Britain and the United States of The Australian market is the America and Great Britain and Australia. In addition to that, the Prime -Minister was able, at the Economic Conference, by the cogent arguments he advanced, to secure further resolutions giving us an additional preference of 5s. per cwt. on Dominion-canned fruit, which corresponds approximately to another I d . per tin. It has been a matter of very great surprise to me during the last fortnight, when honourable members opposite had an opportunity of saying that they stood solidly behind the claim made for this concession on the production of Australian fruit, that not one of them supported the Prime Ministeri n his proposal. Every One who looks at the position fairly must recognise that the Government have brought forward a constructive proposal which has placed the frui t industry in a better position than",54,Chapman W E Are Not Have To Close Their Factories That Was

At the same time we have been working to secure the co-operation of the State Governments in our efforts to distribute the fruit in Australia The people of Australia are eating per head only one-half the quantity of canned fruit that the Americans eat. We hope that by continuous propaganda, and especially by giving new heart to the fruit industry, to increase that rate of consumption. I was in Shepparton recently with the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , and he told me that thoso engaged in the fruit industry, who were in despair three years ago, because they did not know from year to year whether they would get a pool, were' now ful l of hope. There is a different outlook by reason of the fact that the huge mountain of previous packs has been dissipated. I urge the House to adopt this proposal for the payment of a bounty to which the Government agreed, because the House was not in session, and a decision was urgent. With the Government proposal to pay a bounty on certain products of orchardists and to incidentally help the fruit-growing industry we are all in accord, so far as that help relates to the primary producer and co-operative canneries. But we object to the payment of the people's money to certain boodling concerns which have subsidized the National and Countiy parties. The honourable member has suggested that the Country party has been subsidized by some boodling concern. I ask that that statement be withdrawn.

The honourable member for Darling was guilty of a misstatement of fact. years this Government has known that the present condition of the fruit industry has been approaching. is no different from the last Government, .except that it has a leaven of Conservatives, Free Traders, black-labour advocates, and Tariff abolitionists. The ineptitude and incompetence of the Government are responsible ' for the position which has been created. On both sides of the Murray River during the last four years many thousands of pounds' worth of fruit has rotted on the ground, and the Country party, notwithstanding that it professes to be so anxious to protect and develop the industry, has idly stood by and watched it go to ruin. While fruit is rotting on the ground thousands of people in Australia are fruit hungry. The only people who have been doing well out of fruit are the private middlemen, who subsidize and support the existing Government. The co-operative companies have not made money, because the balance-sheets of most of them show that they are losing money, and they are I rise to a point of order. subsidized by the shareholders; but the balance-sheets of the middlemen, even though they have been watered and faked, show very fair profits. Those are the interests which are responsible for that portion of this measure which relates to canneries. The Government has conceived the happy idea of accepting some of the' Socialism which honourable members opposite profess to despise so much. They will use it for their own gains, but not for the indiscriminate benefit of the community. There may be Socialism for one section of primary producers, but it is denied to another section.

The Government put the sugar industry on its feet. Leader of the. Country party ( MrH ill ) , wages of the workers in the fruit industry who carries a great deal of weight in the councils of that body, made this afternoon a solemn declaration which on all previous occasions he and his colleagues have been careful to avoid. Of course, we have always known that the Country party believes in Free Trade, except in respect, of onions aud potatoes. "" Give us,"" they say, ""such protection that not one spud or onion shall be imported into Australia, but let the niggers of India and other sweated black labour countries send their sugar here free of duty in order that' our plums, apricots, and peaches may be made into jams and canned fruits."" What patriotic sentiments these people express. The Labour party has always advocated pools and the payment of bounties to assist the development ancl maintenance of not only primary, but secondary industries, and we have at all times been consistent in that respect. dustry requires assistance the Labour party is always willing'"" to help. We do not discriminate as to what particular primary industries shall receive assistance, but advocate the protection ancl development of such industries in order to provide, by means of the New Protection, a self-supporting Australia. We are prepared to assist in imposing duties upon those commodities produced abroad which are also made in Australia, so that those used by us will be manufactured in Australia under our own conditions, and not by sweated labour. protect the growers of apricots and peaches, but will not protect the growers of sugar cane. They, are willing to help those who. produce lexias, but would import locomotives. The Country party wanted the fourteen locomotives for the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway to be obtained from Great Britain, beYet they talk about cause there was a difference of only a few thousand pounds in the price. It was only in consequence of .the action taken by the Leader of the Opposition when in Western Australia and South Australia that an Australian tender was accepted, probably because the thingabout the political effect such an importation would have upon the people of Australia. The Leader of the Country party sneers, and says, in effect, that the of Australia are too high, ancl that the only solution of the problem.with which we are confronted is a reduction in wages. We have also another low-wage advocate a man who during his term of service in the Victorian Eailways was prepared to knock off work to agitate fbr higher rates of pay and better conditions for himself and liis fellow workmen. I refer to tha honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) who was then held in high esteem by his colleagues, and it was thought that he would some day grace the legislative halla of Australia as a member of the Labour party. He was the finest agitator for higher wages and better conditions ever employed in the Victorian Eailways service, but now he favours low wages and sweated conditions. That is the aim and idea of one member of the Country party, who believes that a reduction in wages and less favorable conditions will help When a languishing in the industry-out of its difficulty.

The Governments of the Trade and the abolition of our secondary past have been generous to the fruit industries allow the honourable member for Darling nexion with the different pools. to embark upon a discussion of fiscal remarks of the honourable member for questions. I am anxious to hear him Echuca( Mr Hill) would lead one to berefer to apricots, pears, peaches, and lieve that the f r u it industry exists only pineapples, which are covered by the Bill. in Victoria, but I would point out that it most of the questions which have been mentionsd from time to time, and when you interrupted me, Mr Speaker, I was about to state that Free Trade, the abolition of the Arbitration Court, or the importationof sugar grown by black The labour, will not solve the problems of the fruit-growers on the irrigation settlements at Curlawa, Bunguayah, Pomona, Goodnight, and other places on that side of the River Murray. The position of the primary producers in that -locality is particularly unsatisfactory, and those who have visited them realize that everything possible should be done to render assistance. Everything possible should be done to help them, but I shall do nothing to assist the great "" boodling "" concerns of Australia. The Government should re-draft that portion of the B ill dealing with the price to the canners, and should insert a clause to adequately protect, not only the primary producers, but the people of Austraha as a whole. We do not want a recurrence of what I saw last year in Melbourne, where 50 tons of best quality lexias, graded and packed in good boxes, were bought from the Australian Dried Fruits Association at hd. per lb. Although the people outside wanted that fruit, they could not obtain it unless they paid the price fixed by the Australian Dried Fruits Association. Things of that nature require investigation by the Government when they are proposing such a bounty as that before us. I shall vote for the Bill, but would again ask the Minister in charge to withdraw it until after the Easter adjournment. No harm could arise from such a postponement. In addition to re-drafting the portion dealing with canneries, some guarantee should be obtained from the private canners that the people and primary producers of Ausindustry, as already there has been The",57,Chapman W E Are Not Have To Close Their Factories That Was

The increase in acres during the last ten years has been 60 per cent., and in production about 300 per cent. In Queensland we also have the sugar industry, which last season produced about Â£7,000,000 worth of raw sugar, its value, when refined, being about Â£10,000,000. The industry is conducted by 5,000 farmers, 90 per cent, of whom arc Australians or of British descent. That proves that it is a white man's industry, and I regret the misleading statements made in Victoria from time to time concerning it. In the Brisbane Courier of 10th January last there appeared the following telegram from Sydney : The general manager of the Stanmore 'Canning and Preserving Company Limited( Mr Tate), in a. statement to-day,, said that the fruit-growers of Australia were heing taxed to the amount of Â£500,000 a year ""to benefit Queensland."" "" The burden,"" he said, "" is too great for them to carry. Freedom to import sugar, paying the Customs duty, would restore the industry."" This is a misleading, selfish statement. It is a common mistake to think that the value of the sugar in canned fruits has any effect whatever on their sale. . A return I obtained recently from the Customs Department shows that the value of the sugar-content in canned fruit is less than Id. per lb. No one would suggest that a difference of Id. per lb. would have any appreciable effect on the sale of canned fruits or jam. I agree largely with the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) concerning the fruit and sugar industries, but he was not altogether fair in his reference to the assistance rendered by the Queensland State cannery. is not altogether the financial success he would have this House believe. While it is a fact that it has taken a large proportion of the pineapples grown on the Queensland plantations, it is true also that there has been a serious annual loss on its operations. That loss, which has been met by the taxpayers, has really meant a subsidy to the fruit-growers. The statement of the honourable member would have carried more weight if he had referred to that fact. nery is to assist the growers, and not to make profits. assisting the grower; but if the honourable member had mentioned that there was a serious annual loss on its operations,, the House would have better appreciated his statement. The honourable member was also correct in the main in his reference to the assistance rendered to the fruit industry in Queensland by tha Queensland Fruit Marketing Act. Of course, there is a difference of opinion as to its efficiency, but the new system of organization, is worthy of a trial. For many years before statutory authority was given to the Committee of Direction, an organization known as the Southern Queensland Fruit-growers' Association did very valuable work for the growers. Thousands of tons of fruit were sent to the southern markets weekly, and the growers soon saw the benefits of organization. The other States might copy the Queensland legislation, as it is undoubtedly of great advantage to the fruit growers. The Queensland Act provides for a committee representing the five main sections of the fruit industry-the banana, pineapple, citrus, deciduous, and berry fruits' sections. Each section deals with its own particular problems, and is represented by two of its members on a Committee of Direction of Frnit Marketing. The Government have assisted by giving statutory authority to this committee, but it is not under Government control. The members are elected by the growers, and represent various shades of political thought. In Queensland, many of the growers think that if they supply the Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide markets they are supplying Australia, but within 100 miles of the place where the fruit is grown it is frequently impossible That cannery to obtain supplies. There is room in each of the States for a more thorough organization of the industry. That would, to a great extent, prevent the glut which now exists from time to time, and make unnecessary the Government assistance repeatedly asked for, and the consumer would be able to buy fruit in places where now there is a great scarcity. support the Bill, but I am sorry that such a measure is necessary.

Mr Peowse (Forrest) [9.20],"Iargument when he said to the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), in a room adjoining this Chamber,"" The Governments in the past have placed three babies on our door step, and we are not the father of them. You are the father, and what are you going to do about them?"" The Ministry have arrived at the best solution of the difficulty in which they find themselves. The arrangement embodied in the Bill is infinitely preferable to that contained in measures brought down in the past two or three years. The Bill has features that promise to place the fruit industry on a more stable basis than heretofore, but the three babies have yet to be dealt with. The fruit-grower, to. whom I have referred, went on to say, "" You put the Tariff on our door step and you also placed the Federal Arbitration Court and the Sugar Agreement there."" Â£1,000,000. orable member for Capricornia ( Mr many other industries that. are natural Forde) that when I was visiting the Atherton Tableland recently, I noticed some excellent dairying land. I inquired of a local land and estate agent what progress was being made with the dairying industry in that district, and he replied, "" It is all right, but any man who goes in for dairying ought to have his head read."" When I asked him the reason for his statement, he said, "" Because fortunes are to be made out of sugar-growing "" I remarked "" You should not have suggested that, for I am beginning to think that the people engaged in dairying, and those who grow f r u it in the. southern States find ithard to get a living are making it possible for people in the north to acquire fortunes out of sugar-growing."" This man boasted of the large profit he was making out of the sale of land suitable for the production of sugar. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr by the seamen of any other country. Watson) noticed similar conditions when he recently visited Queensland. one finds that a large number of aliens are making fortunes in Australia at the expense of thousands of primary producers, there must be something radically wrong. A producer was once able to buy a shovel for 3s. or 4s., but to-day he has to pay 12s. or 14s. for it , and he has no way of passing on the increased cost to the consumers of his products. I , too, have had the opportunity of travelling through the Shepparton district, and I have never inspected finer orchards than are to be seen there. I noticed hundreds of tons of splendid peaches rotting on the ground. When I asked the owner of some trees that were partially infected with the Rutherglen bug why he did not pick the sound peaches, he declared that it would not pay him to do so, and that the fruit would have to fall and rot. While deputations were waiting upon the Government asking that some solution of the financial difficulties of the fruitgrower be found, Mr Justice Powers in the Federal Arbitration Court awarded an extra 7s. to.9s. per week to the employees in the orchards. It is very fine to protect one section of thÂ© community, hxit the interests of other sections should also be considered. If it were not for the three babies that have been placed on the door step of this and to Australia, it would be unnecessary for producers to go cap-in-haud to the Government for assistance. The growers would be able to succeed if they could depend on their strong right arm, but under present conditions they are forced by legislation into a position of helplessness. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) has made a clumsy attempt to suggest a solution. He referred to the middleman, who certainly constitutes an evil which to a large extent could be eliminated. The only suggestion the honourable inember has offered is that freights should be lowered. How can he expect free trade England to provide -us with cheap shipping facilities ? Does he suppose that the highly protected Australian shipping lines will reduce their freights ? This is hopeless, seeing that the Legislature has granted the employees in the shipping industry working conditions superior to those enjoyed This, forsooth, is the accepted policy of When Australia, and the proposal of the honourable member leads us nowhere. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) has referred to the "" boodling capitalist,"" but I contend that the greatest supporters of "" boodlers "" are to be found on the other side of the House.

The policy that has been adopted in this country for some decades has made Australia top heavy, and we have practically reached our limit in the employment of labour. In talking the other day with a relative of mine, who has been engaged in the ' boot trade for thirty years, I asked how the industry was progressing. plied, "" Very slowly. We get no outside orders now. We used to sell goods to New Zealand, but now our trade is limited to Australia."" It may not be that the workers' wages are too high, but either wages must be decreased, or output must be increased. We must have value for the money expended. entered this House, about four years ago, I frequently heard the word "" profiteering."" ' I have hardly heard it used in the last few years The profiteering bubble has burst. Profiteering is fostered more by honourable members of the Opposition, and capitalists and combines are supported more by themthan by any other party in this House. speaking offensively. The time has come when Australia must look straightforwardly at her position. We must make a better attempt to compete in the world's markets. The fruit-growers of Australia have had a heavy burden placed upon their shoulders, because of the policy this Parliament has adopted. Bonuses and doles are a disadvantage to our people, but that is not the fault of the frui t industry, but of the policy which has laid unbearable burdens upon it. Scarcely one industry in Australia is standing on its own feet. We talk about the Queensland sugar industry. I suppose that the Italians who live at Innisfail, Queensland, are legitimate immigrants. They Came here and lived almost on the smell of an oil-rag, and the people of Australia have bought Cadillac motor cars for them. I honour those settlers for the way they worked. If they have rendered good service to the country they deserve their success, and we could do with more like them. But do not let us burden ourselves as we have done in order that they may get rich quick. The protection given seems to be unnecessarily high. Is the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) in order in referring to the Italian settlers in Queensland as men who lived on the smell of an oil-rag? -From the parliamentary point of view, the remark is quite an acceptable argument, but I ask the honourable member for Forrest to pay exclusive attention to the provisions of the Bill before the House. observe your command, sir. The sooner this country is made more self-reliant the better it will be. Our fruit-growing and other industries should be placed on a basis which will enable them successfully .to compete in the markets of the world, freed from the burdens now strangling When I first them, and mailing unnecessary such pampering as they are receiving. I totally disagree with the policy Australia has adopted. So long as that policy is permitted to continue it will place heavy burdens upon the producers' shoulders, and we must give them some relief. The wheat-growers of Australia have always fed the people of this country I am not more cheaply than the people of other countries have been fed, yet that industry has always brought money into the country. It has, with wool, created our wonderful credit in the markets of the world. If , however, the cost of producing wheat is increased by 4d. a bushel, or the market falls by that amount, it will force many of the producers out of business. With things as they are, I have no qualms of conscience about voting for this Bill. It is consequential upon the bad administration of previous days. Burdens have been placed upon the shoulders of the fruit-growers, and we must give them some relief. planation to make.

I am sorry that the honourable member is not here to hear my remarks. I was never a member of any Labour organization, and I was never an agitator as stated by the honourable member. When my salary was reduced by 28 per cent.., after the land boom, I did what many other self-respecting men did. I resigned from the Department,. and obtained an honourable discharge. having heard the remarks of some members of the Opposition to-night, I am glad and proud to say that I have never been associated with any Labour organization. The honourable member for Echuca( Mr Committee:;Hill) might have explained why he jomed the party that was responsible for reducing his wages when he was a railway employee, for he now belongs to that party. It was not a Labour Government which took that action in the land boom. -'Order! That matter is not now before the Chair. Dr. astonished that the Minister did not explain why Australian f r u it was sent to an American company in London which represented the great Californian frui t industry. I am also astonished that he did not enlighten us as to whether the gentleman who made a large sum of money was an American. Another firm I believe had wide experience in the selling of meat, but I do not know what their qualifications of fruits. Lyons and Company, who supply something like 12,000,000 meals every week in London, were prevented from assisting in the selling of Australian fruits. The Comonwealth Government declined to accept a price that was cabled to Australia, but, later, a much smaller amount was accepted, and seemingly a larger quantity of fruit was' sold. The Bill has one feature which commends itself greatly to me: it is one of the few Bills that provide for a list price for the benefit of the producer-the . difficulty, and admit that it is a very grower of the fruit. The canners must pay certain rates per ton for the fruit purchased. The Government would have been deserving of much greater commendation if they had provided for a list price in the selling of the fruit to the Australian people. I do not think any oif them will deny that fruit sold in the shops, and even on the streets, is very dear compared with the price which the grower 'receives. I am sure the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) will agree that the wheat-grower does not get a fair proportion of the price paid by the consumer for a loaf of bread. I should like to see the Government provide for a list price, not only for the After benefit/ of the grower, but also for the benefit of the fathers and mothers of families. I hope I shall have the sympathy, not only of the Minister, but of every medical man, and of the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse), in moving the following new clause in Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any Act, it shall be mandatory that all fruit canners who claim the bounty shall impress on top of the can the month and year of the canning. I have two reasons for making that proposal. One is that I want to have sent from Australia a product that the people overseas will welcome, because it contains is fresh. I also desire that no tin of fruit which has been on the shelf of a shopkeeper so long that it has become stale may be pushed on to a customer, but that the customer will find embossed on the top of the t in the date on which the food was placed in that tin.

329,Mr Pbatten,There are difficulties,62,Maloney I Am Rather It Will Bear The Certificate That What
330,Dr. Maloney,"I recognise that the English customer the opportunity to ' ascertain whether tha tinned food which he purchases is fresh by the impressing of the date of tinning? orable inember, but I cannot see the practicability of it this season. . Dr. member will agree that it would be desirable for the consumer to be able to ascertain the date of the packing of all tinned foods entering the United Kingdom. I realize that the Government can put forward serious arguments against my proposal, but I maintain that the law should make provision in that direction. Last week I received a communication from Professor Luff, a man well-known in London, who has also attained the rank of a military colonel. He has been appointed, with others, by the British Government, to make an inquiry into foods. I purpose sending him this amendment, as a suggestion that the Government erf Great Britain might very well adopt. It may bÂ© said that, in its desire to have cheap food for its people, the Government of Great Britain would not care to compel such action by the various countries which send their food into England. Something of the sort, however, is necessary in Australia, in view of the action taken by certain scoundrels, Australians though they were, in sending to South Africa wheat which was unfit for human consumption, rendering it necessary for the Commonwealth Government to pay a large sum of money by way of compensation. contend that the names of those scoundrels should be given to this House, so that the people of Australia might kuow who they are. No one in tliis House would defend the export of wheat unfit for human consumption, yet we allowed the scoundrels who did this to escape, as a . lot of others escaped Avho took advantage of the awful times which prevailed during, and immediately after, the war. When we want' to get a big overseas market, we cannot follow a better example than that which was set by that splendid little kingdom, Denmark. When Prussia deprived Denmark of Schleswig-Holstein, one Danish colonel was ous enough to say to his fellowcitizens, "" If we have had two provinces taken from us, it is time we made another with the spade."" History shows how nobly the jieople of Denmark, by means of co-operation rarely equalled and never surpassed, have carried out that task, until to-day their produce secures the highest prices on the London market. No inferior foods are permitted to be exported. The Danes would not be guilty in that South African incident to which I have just referred. Despite all the difficulties that may be raised, I shall submit my amendment to honourable members for the honour of Australia, so that the foodstuffs we export shall be of the very best, and so that the health of the consumers may be protected. If the Commonwealth Parliament has not the power to control the sale of foodstuffs within the Commonwealth and see that they are of the very best quality, it is time it sought the power to do so. No honourable member would have the audacity to support the prices the consumers of Australia arc called upon to pay. The local market is the best thc Australian producer can have, but we are not paying that regard to the interests of the consumers that we should. Twenty-five years ago, when 1here was a proposal on foot to provide cold storage in Melbourne, doubt was raised as to the capability of the producers to fill the stores, whereupon I urged the Government of the day to buy beef and mutton when it was cheap, and fill the stores with meat, so that they would always be in a position when meat was dear to sell it to the citizens of VicI toria at whatever price was being paid for Australian meat in London. It is time we applied the same policy to fruit. We know that canned fruits are sold in London at a price which is below that which is charged in Australia. However, I am pleased to note the fact that the present Government decline to follow the advice, tinged with Conservatism, of the Country party. If they were foolish enough to adopt that advice, we sliould have the biggest unemployment that Australia has ever known. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin courageChapman) is a true-blue Protectionist. I advise Ministers to take to heart the lesson that Western Australia provided a fortnight ago, and that which Soufh Australia will provide next Saturday.",62,Maloney I Am Rather It Will Bear The Certificate That What
331,Mr Pkatten,"I agree with the honister for Works and Railways( Mr without fear of contradiction, that the Stewart) would not like me to prophesy what might happen if the Government dared to go to the country. In my opinion, it would not come back in its present strength. If the Labour votes in Wimmera had been given to Mr Sampson, it is doubtful whether the Minister would be in this House to-day. I advise him to pay some attention to the words of Abraham LincolnYou can fool some of the people all the time; you can fool all of tlie people some of the time; but you can't fool all of the people all the time. I commend the Government for the good that is in the Bill, but I regret what is not in it. I want the Minister, before the measure goes through, to say whether the representative who did sell part of the Australian canned f r u it for the sake of the commission was an American or an Australian. payment of a bounty on fruit is of transcendent importance to a very large section of the producers of Australia. I know a great deal about the fruit-growers of the Riverina, where, within the last two or three years, a large number of men have commenced growing f r u it on irrigation areas. Many of them are returned soldiers'. They are a very fine type of man, but if it had not been for the botmty on canned f r u it a number of them would have been down and out. Many of them are in debt to the extent of Â£3,000 or Â£4,000. ""They have been obliged to borrow in order to bring their holdings into bearing. The money they have raised has been spent in clearing and planting, and generally in putting the land under cultivation. They could not possibly have kept going without the bounty. I do not claim that it is necessary to keep paying this subsidy, and I hope that it will not be found necessary to do so, but I do not think that the Governmeut should say at this stage that under no circumstances will they continue it. The honourable members for Darling( Mr Blakeley) and Capricornia ( Mr Forde) have twitted the Country party with being against all forms of Protection, and with being anxious to abolish all the protective duties. I know something of the views of honourable members of the Country party, and I can say, pai ty is in favour of assisting secondary : industries, as well as primary industries, in every reasonable way. For instance, we all recognise that the sugar industry must be kept going. In the first place, it is intimately bound up with the White' Australia policy, in which we all believe. In the next place, the producers of sugar are cultivating land which cannot be profitably occupied in any other way. Lastly, the fact that sugar is grown in Australia provides it at a cheaper price than would have to be paid if there were no local production, and if we were dependent on the outside world for our supplies. I have always been a Protectionist, and I believe that most honourable members of the Country party are Protectionists, 'though naturally we differ in regard to details. But, while I want to see the secondary industries and the primary industries protected in every reasonable way, I want particularly to see that the producers are protected, as they certainly are not by the system of Protection now in vogue. I regard this bounty as a small measure of protection to them, and I repeat that but for its assistance a number of ouv fruit-growers would now be down and out. Why then should we say definitely at this stage that the bounty is not to be continued beyond a certain date? I hope that the price of fruit will improve, that our fruit growers will have a profitable market, and that the bounty will be found to be unnecessary. But rather than let the industry be ruined the Government should continue the bounty. After all, it represents but a tax of Â£140,000 upon the people of the Commonwealth. I remind honourable members that Â£7,000,000 has already been spent on the Yanco irrigation area, which has been taken up chiefly by fruit growers. Before the improvement of the area is completed the expenditure upon it will amount to something like Â£10,000,000. A similar scheme of land improvement is to be commenced on the Murray, and will probably be found to be just as expensive. Unless something can be done to provide a profitable market for our fruit, the immense sums expended upon the improvement of land in this way",63,Maloney Th E Honourable Of A Crime Such As Australians Committed

There is at present too great a wastage between the producer and the consumer. This is more evident in the case of fresh fruit than of tinned fruit. within the mark when I say that on an average the consumer of fresh frui t has to pay four or five times what the producer receives for it, owing to the lack of proper marketing facilities. I do not approve of the scheme suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, and supported by honourable members on his side, because ir, would involve the creation of another Government Department to run the business of marketing fruit. Several Government industrial enterprises have been tried, not only in the Federal sphere, but also under the authority of State Governments, with the result that there has always been a heavy loss incurred by the Government concerned. have never succeeded in successfully running industries, and the taxpayer has on every occasion been called on to foot the bill. I do not support the starting of another Government enterprise to handle, the marketing of fruit. In my opinion, the State Governments might do much to bring about improvement in the marketing, not only of fruit, but of meat, butter, and milk, all of which products arc much. dearer to the consumer than they should be, whilst the producers do not get a fair return from them. With a proper system of distribution the consumer should obtain frui t at half what he pays for ifc now, whilst the producer should receive double what he receives for it . One honourable member opposite said that the Country party has done nothing to help the fruit-growers to tide them over their difficulty in being unable to find a satisfactory market for their fruit. Country' party has assisted the Government to do everything that has been done in this direction so far. The Fruit Pool was a great help to the growers, though the Government lost a considerable amount of money in connection with it. The Country party helped that scheme, and they are now assisting the Government in connection with the bounty provided for under this BiU. I know of nothing to assist the industiy which has been suggested from the other side, but Honourable members opposite members of the Country party have assisted the Government to do all that has been done, and the charge made against them in this connection is, therefore, a very unfair one. I am glad to learn that honourable members opposite I believe I am are in favour of the preference proposals made by the Prime Minister when in the Old Country. Until to-night we were all in doubt as to whether they were in .favour of them. Notwithstanding the fact that those proposals have been temsay Macdonald's Government must soon realize the great importance, not only to the Old Country, but to British overseas Dominions, of giving effect to them; I . trust that they will be carried before long, and if they are they will be of great help to the fruit-growers of Australia, who at present so much need assistance. Gover.nmenta' I intend to support the Bill, but I cannot help on this occasion, as I have done when similar measures have been introduced, contrasting the attitude of the Government and honourable members who sit behind them in supporting measures of the kind under which the functions of government and the national finances are utilized to assist a particular industry, with the stand they take when an industrial organization asks that the national finances should be used in that way. The organization is told that trade must go through its natural channels, that nothing can be done iu the matter, and that the request is based on false economics. I sliall continue when such measures are brought forward to emphasize the inconsistency of the attitude adopted by honourable members on the other side.' It is about time that the Government The tackled these problems in an earnest and comprehensive way. This measure is only one of the stop-gap pieces of legislation introduced to assist an industry in a time of crisis. Until something concrete is proposed, and the foundation is laid upon which permanent progress may be made in meeting these industrial difficulties, we shall have these stop-gap measures, which get us nowhere.",64,Maloney Th E Honourable Of A Crime Such As Australians Committed

Underlying the very fine speecli of the honourable jection,, that although the price of peaches member the other day is this' continual mess. The honourable member fbr Echuca( Mr Hill) stated that the largest proportion of the proceeds of primary industries went into the pockets of the workers, and when challenged to give some instances to support his statement he was silent. It was afterwards ascertained that his argument was purely an assumption, and a foolish assumption at that. When asked for a solution of the trouble he returned to the "" stone age "" of economicsblack labour, Free Trade, and low wages. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) made a passionate speech in defence of the honourable member for Echuca, but I remember distinctly, when dealing with another industry for which a bounty was asked and supported by the Labour party, the Treasurer said that the consumption of its product was gradually decreasing on account of low wages ruling. The honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) claims to desire the development of thc natural resources of tliis country, and yet . at a cost of about Â£d. each article, but he says that they can be developed only by.the payment of low wages. If wages are to be reduced, the purchasing power of the general consumer will be less, for, after all, the great bulk of the consumers are wage-earners, industrial and otherwise, and if their wages are reduced automatically their consumption is reduced. That solution is unworkable, as it will lead to over-production, with no* means of disposing of surplus products. I take particular exception to the fact that the.canhonorable member realizes that the fruit ners are actually receiving from the Pool under review cannot be placed in cold one-eighth of a penny per lb. more storage in the way he suggests. than is the fruit producer. It seems to me that the members of the late that. At present a lot of these fruits rot lamented Country party have become on the ground, owing to the markets being part and parcel of the Composite Goglutted at the time of ripening, and to the vernment, and are allowing, almost as lack of system. The grdwers simply proa subterfuge, the introduction of this duce the fruit and take pot luck. They Bill ostensibly to assist the man on are at the mercy of the middleman, who the land and the fruit-grower, but in controls shipping and cold storage. We reality to give one-eighth of a penny to thc must discover a permanent solution which middleman, who is continually bleeding will tend to develop our natural resources. the fruit producer. I should welcome any Surely we are not so bankruptthat we sound proposition that would eliminate have to admit that no solutioncan be this parasite, but it is practically impossible', as. the funds of the Government in power are subscribed by the middlemen and those controlling secondary industries. Hence we have two diametrically opposed interests functioning as one Government. The Treasurer said, by interhad increased, that of apricots had decreased. They would lose on the merrygo-round and pick up on the razzle-dazzle. Honourable members must remember that there is one octopus-the middlemanliving not only on this industry, but on all other primary industries, and bleeding both the primary producer and the consumer. A proposal that is to give Â£d. or -|d. inore to the middleman is not one that, in the final analysis, will give a great deal of assistance to the producer of fruit. It is the Labour party's policy to bend its energies and efforts towards the creation of an organization to assist the fruit industry, even if the cost is more than Â£300,000. First of all, we should assist the primary producer by the formation of a co-operative concern; and secondly, we must not only find markets for fruit, but also assist in the provision of cold storage. The growers of such fruits as apples and oranges at the beginning of the season place their fruit in cold storage when they endeavour to repurchase in the winter time they have to pay 3d. or 4d. to the person in control of' cold storage. The Government should arrange for cool stores to be established in the different fruit areas, and allow the fruit-growers to operate them at a nominal rental, thus permitting them to take advantage of the high prices prevailing in the winter time when f r u it is not so plentiful.",65,Maloney Th E Honourable Of A Crime Such As Australians Committed

I am not opposed to spending money, providing it will enable the Government to assist primary industries, and also industrial organizations when they are in a bad way. As a National Parliament, it is out bounden duty to relieve industrial distress. I am simply astounded at the measure which has been introduced in this House by the present Government. We are told that the Government that governs least is the best; that it is impossible to divert trade from its natural channels. When the Government is asked to assist some industrial organization, the members of which are on or below the bread line, nothing is done, but when it is a question of placating political friends, the whole functions of this Government are readily made available. We cannot have lop-sided economics of this nature. If Government facilities are to be available for the assistance of one class in the community they should be available to all classes.
