27,Mr Bruce,"On the 14th January,the l if t in g of the embargo on the import of Italian broom millet. I now desire to inform the honourable member that representations were recently made by the employers and employees engaged in the broom-making industry that the prohibition of the import of this millet deprived the broom industry of certain varieties of millet essential to the making of brooms, and that a sufficient supply of these varieties could not be obtained from Australian-grown millet. It was urged that the prohibition should be modified to permit of its importation under adequate, safeguards, so as to prevent the possibility of the introduction of the European cornborer pest to Australia. The only method regarded by the Health Department as being entirely safe and practicable is the disinfection in a vacuum steam process of all imported millet. A preliminary inquiry has, therefore, been made through the Consul-General for Italy to ascertain whether the Italian Government would undertake to carry out this disinfection before shipment, and give reliable certificates that this has been done. When a reply to this inquiry is received, the question as to whether importation of Italian millet under these safeguards may be permitted will agaiu be considered. The following papers were presented: Canberra-Memorandu m (dated 21st Decemwharf's of Sydney because the importers ber, 1925) by the Chairman, Pederal Capiwere not prepared to sell them at a tal Commission, on the subject of the reasonable price to the people of New transfer to Canberra.

35,Mr Mahony,"I must know theproceed with their mission to better the conditions of the workers. under the guise of an attempt to combat communism, a sinister scheme is afoot to undermine trade unionism. I shall oppose the bill tooth and nail. If the Government proposes by cunning' and crafty methods to undermine trades unionism, and to allow those interests which it represents to work their own sweet will on the workers of this country, I shall strenuously oppose the bill. On the other hand, if its object is to deal with persons who stand for unconstitutional methods, I shall not oppose it . I make these few preliminary remarks as an indication of what the Minister may expect if he, attempts to proceed with the bill, whose object is to attack trade unionism in this country. leave to introduce the bill, the House should compel him to give some explanation of it , and some indication of the proposed amendments of the Grimes Act. agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony). It is a very simple thing to place on the notice paper a motion for leave to introduce a bill to amend the CrimesA c t , but every one knows that the Government is endeavouring to cover up the mess made last Parliament by some members of the legal fraternity on that side of the House. Those honourable members then made a holy mess of their endeavour to preserve the Empire, and now the Government is asking for leave to introduce a bill to amend the CrimesA c t . As instanced a day or two ago, the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) has been put in his present position in place of another gentleman who had not done, his job properly. We, therefore, expected that the Attorney General would at least inform the House of the objects of the bill, and whom it was to include, and to give an assurance to honourable members that there was no intention whatever to interfere w i th what would be termed by that side of the House wise and sane trade unionism. ance that this bill w ill not go any farther than tbe last Parliament intended to go. In spite of our protests the b ill w ill no doubt be passed w i th the. aid of the Government's brutal majority, and, perhaps, of the "" gag."" It was admitted in this House last week that a public servant of the Commonwealth, holding a f a i r l y responsible position, was an advoTo-day, cate and organizer of the Pascisti Society. We know nothing of the aims of this K l u K l u x K l a n of Australia, and before introducing the bill we should ascertain whether this society w ill beamongst those which are to be dealt with under it . It is most immoral for this Government to foster this society, or ho allow one of its public servants to belong to a secret organization. I wish now to refer to the "" guffaw,"" or satirical laughter, that occurred when the honourable member for Dalley said that he was prepared to protect the Empire, in the event of any attempt being made to destroy it . That is what the great majority of the Labour people in Australia desire. I believe in the Empire, and in keeping it Before the Minister obtains intact. I have never said one word calculated to affect the stability of the B r i tish Empire. I said, a day or two ago, that there was no flag like the Union Jack, and that, as f a r as I was concerned, I it was above all others. This party refuses to be dragged at the heels of GreatB r i tain in its foreign and imperial policy, and because of this we are told by honourable members opposite that we are not loyal to GreatB r it a in . As a matter of fact, of the soldiers who fought in the Great War, the great majority would be relatives of those represented by honourable members on this side of the House. Indeed, 98 per cent, of the people in Australia are of British extraction, and love the land of their forbears. Tbese people cherish the sentiment which inspires the linesBreathes there a man with soul so dead, Who never to himself hath said, This is my own, my native land! Honourable members on this side of tbe House stand for the Empire as much as any on that side of the House, but we do not stand for the brand of imperialism that honourable members opposite wish to force upon us. I hope the object of the bill is not to destroy the trade unions of Australia, which bas been built up by We should have the assurour workers at great cost and sacrifice to themselves. The principle of trade unionism is accepted and supported by the great majorit y of the people, and therefore no attempt should be made to interfere w i th it in any way to the detriment of the workers.

To-day, no newspaper in Australia dares to employ on its reporting staff a man who is not a member of the Australian Journalists' Association. What is tbe reason for this special legislation? Special legislation to punisb any particular class in the'community in order to benefit another has always been attended with failure; it has not made for .progress.

B ill presented and read a first time. surer) [ 4 . 0 ] That the Bill be now read a second time. In moving the second reading oi this B ill to grant a sum of £450,000 to assist the finances of Western Australia this year I may say that the difficulty of the problem facing the Government is evidenced by the fact that the Royal Commission which was appointed to go into the whole question of the disabilities under which Western Australia suffers as a result of entering the Federation failed to arrive at a unanimous decision on the matter or to indicate one single remedy for the troubles from which Western Australia is suffering. All the commissioners agreed that Western Australia does suffer from disabilities, but they disagreed as to the degree of those disabilities, and the methods which should be applied to remedy them. beginning under which Western Australia has laboured as a result of her entrance into the federation have been frankly recognized. In the convention discussions before federation was consummated the position of Western Australia was debated at great length. Finally a special section was inserted in the Constitution, Section 95, which provided that for the first five years after federation the Western Australian Parliament should have the right to impose a Customs tariff of its own in addition to the uniform tariff of the Commonwealth, and so collect revenue to enable the State to properly adjust its finances.' That was done by Western Australia for five years, and sums varying from a maximum of £233,000 down to £77,000 at the termination of the period fixed for the special arrangement were collected by the Western Australian Government from the people of that State to assist it in balancing its finances. Againi n 1910 when the present per capita arrangement was arrived at it was agreed by the Commonwealth and also by the States that the speeiaJl position of Western Australia should be recognized and provision was made that not only should Western Australia receive the per capita grant in accordance with the general arrangement applying to all the States, but that she should also receive a special payment over a period of 25 years commencing with £250,000 in the first year with gradual reductions of £10,000 each year u n t i l the grant was extinguished. It I m o v e was provided that that payment should be contributed to, not only by the Commonwealth Government, but by tbe Governments of the other States as well. That arrangement-has been given effect to, and at the present time Western Australia is receiving under it something like £100,000 a year, of which £50,000 is contributed by the other States and. £50,000 by the Commonwealth. A t the time.when the capitation agreement was made providing for an annual payment by the Commonwealth of 25s. per head of the inhabitants of each Statei t was anticipated that there would be a continuous and steady increase in the population of Western Australia, and that because of its huge size and great resources which were less developed than those of the other Statesi t would, in From the the course of time, be in a very good the financial disabilities position indeed. Unfortunately the position of Western Australia has not im proved as was anticipated. Whereasi n 1911-12, the first complete year of the operation of the per capita payment agreement, Western Australia received something like 10.3 per cent, of the total moneys paid by the Commonwealth to the States under the agreement, in 1925-26 it is estimated she will receive only 7.47 per cent, of the total payment under the agreement because her population has not increased at tbe same rate as that of some of the Eastern States, and because of the reduced amount payable to Western Australia under the 25 years' arrangement to which I have already referred. The financial difficulties of Western Australia must be quite obvious to any one who bas studied the annual financial statements furnished by the various Governments of that State.

40,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Treaeffects upon the finances of Western Australia, and also the indirect effects on the finances through the effect on entrance into the Federation, have received recognition at the hands of independent bodies and independent inquiries. For instance, when the Tariff Board, in 1924, was sent to Western Australia to examine the position there, it reported : Whatever additional cost tlie policy of protection may add to the price of goods and material imported by tlie Australian consumers, the citizens of the eastern States gain, as a compensating advantage, the presence of a large production and manufacture. Such is not the case with Western Australia, which is so placed that at present it has to bear whatever burden may arise under the protectionist 1 tarilf without reaping any of the accompanying advantages. It went on to sayI t has been claimed by the critics, and it will be conceded by the Tariff Board, that the position into which the secondary industries of Western Australia have drifted is most unfortunate. The Tariff Board is further satisfied that the situation has been growing steadily worse since the Colonial Treasurer (the Hon. H. P. Colebatch) made his statement in 1918. The Tariff Board is satisfied that it is wrong to blame the tariff for this position alone. Western Australia's remoteness from the other States, and the continually increasing cost of transport, coupled with the impracticability of manufacturing on a large scale from lack of capacity to compete on competitive terms in eastern State markets, is in a great part responsible for this backward state of secondary industries. We have from this independent board a definite recognition only not of a direct influence on the finances of Western Australia, but an indirect influence also, due to the fact that her industries did not expand and prosper in the same way as those of the eastern States. It can be taken for granted that the disabilities of Western Australia are admitted by the' governments of all the States. Western Australian Disabilities Commission recognized the disabilities under which the State laboured, but each commissioner suggested different methods of overcoming the difficulties that have arisen and wistle, for instance, frankly says that, in his opinion, secession from the Commonwealth is the only cure. Mr Higgs, as his method of helping Western Australia, suggests that we should give the State control of her own tariff for 25 years, and that at the same time the huge area in the north-west, which she has to develop, should be handed over to the Commonwealth for creation into industry generally due to its a new State, thereby securing additional Western Australian representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. Mr Mills, the third commissioner, said that neither of these two remedies w ill meet the case, and he suggests a money grant for the next 25 years. Mr Entwistle admits the impracticabilit y of secession as a remedy of Western Australia's great difficulty, because he does not believe that it is possible to bring it about, and he, therefore, allies himself with Mr Higgsi n the presentation of a majority report, which statesThat the State of Western Australia shall, during a period of 25 years, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, have the absolute right(a) to impose its own Customs tariff as in pre-federation days, provided the State of Western Australia shall not impose liigher duties upon the importation into the State of Western Australia of any goods produced or manufactured in or imported from other States of Australia than are imposed on the importation into the . State of Western Australia of the like goods produced or manufactured in or imported from other countries; (&) to impose its own Excise tariff. The amount of money to be contributed by the State of Western Australia to the Federal expenditure of the Commonwealth in excess of Federal income tax, land tax, and probate duties, &c, to be determined by negotiation between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the State of Western Australia; or, in case of disagreement, by an arbitrator, who shall be a citizen of the British Empire. That is the recommendation of the majority of the commission. The third commissioner, Mr Mills, definitely disagreed with this recommendation on several grounds, and it is worthwhile, for a moment or two, to examine the commisThe sion's report and findings. called the "" Disagreement Commission."" raised are very far-reaching indeed. Mr. Mills points out that to carry out a policy of this nature would practically nullify the Federation; that one of the main reasons why Federation was consummated was to secure interstate free trade and make Australia. a nation, in essence as well as in name. Without interstate free trade tbere is no question that the Federation would be very much weaker",22,Second Reading

He looks upon this proposal as a half-way house. On the other hand, Mr Mills, another member of tbe commission, points out the disadvantages associated with the proposal, . and I think the information I have given disposes of it f a i r l y completely. I believe that there is a general feeling throughout Australia that Western Australia -should be assisted financially to enable 'her to develop her huge resources without -eventually penalizing her people. For that -reason the Government has decided upon the payment this year of a financial grant. tliat if secession and a higher tariff were impracticable, a money grant should be made available. Two of the commis-sioners suggested the payment of an 'aranual grant of £45<!>,000 for ten years, including the present additional grant made by the States and the Commonwealth -over and above the per capita payment. The recommendation of Mr Mills was the payment of £300^000, which would also be inclusive of tbe present payments.

Unless new rich fields are discovered, or more economical methods of production can be devised, *-he return i o normal of the price of gold will have a very depressing effect on the industry. The allocation of £15,000 to the Northern Territory provided for in this bill will, it is hoped, result in a revival of interest in its mineral resources. Sincei he Commonwealth took control of the Territory the development of the mining industry has been encouraged by the payment of subsidies to prospectors and others engaged in the industry, the erection of Government batteries, tion. The Gonvnioivwealth Year-Booh statesThe value of production from the mineral industries is now considerably less than that returned by the agricultural or the pastoral industry; nevertheless, it was the discovery of gold in payable quantities that first attracted population to Australia, and thus laid the foundation of its nationhood. The extent of the mineral resources of Australia cannot yet be regarded as completely ascertained, because large areas of country still await systematic prospecting. It is well known that in recent years there has been a serious decline in the mining industry. The reasons whicb have been advanced for this decline are(1) high cost of production; (2) deterioration of ore values in existing mines; (3) inadequate machinery; (4) high freights; (5) high treatment charges; (6) imperfect labour conditions in mines; (7) lack of new payable discoveries; and (8) lack of efficiently supported prospecting. Chief of the precious metals is gold. This The following table, showing the value of production, will give some idea of the decline in gold production: Total for N.S.W. Vic. Q'land. S.A. WA. Tas. NT.

At present mining throughout Australia income taxation to those engaged in the is suffering severely. Our output has dwindled to a surprising degree, and unless we can do something to counteract the high cost of production it will continue to dwindle. In 1901 the numcompanies boring for oil, it collects in ber of miners employed in Australia was 113,400, and in 1923 it was only 54,700. In other words, Austi'alia in 1923 had boring almost as much as it pays in less than half the number of men employed in mining that she had 22 years other mining requirements. Owing to the ago. I am not sure whether my figures include coal miners. If they do the position is all the more serious. my earlier days at Kalgoorlie I estimated that one miner supported four or drops very much they will be in diffifive other people. Western Australia's position in the mining industry is lamentable. In 1901 she employed 20,800 miners, but in 1923 the number had decreased to 6,500. in my opinion, principally to the high cost of production, although, of course, it is contributed to by the fact that the profitable working of low-grade ores. a lower grade of ore is now beingworked. creased steadily for many years. The position of the mining industry in Queensland is also serious. The Mount Morgan mine, whicb has ceased operations, formerly produced three-quarters duty on machinery or timber, or even of Queensland's output of gold and, speaking from memory, about half of her output of copper. By providing employment for due to increases all round. 1,400 people it used to maintain a thriving town.

The high cost of production has compelled the closing down of reasonable conditions, could profitably course, that the Commonwealth Government, by allowing certain exemptions in gold-mining industry, has relieved the position a little; but the general paralysis of the industry remains. It is strange that although the Government subsidizes duty on machinery imported for oil subsidies.

69,Mr Gregory,"We have had tooat a low price for several years, for tunately, lead is now bringing a good price, and lead mining is profitable. Eveni f miners, by reason of the encouragement given them by the passing of this measure, are induced to go prospecting, they w ill still be in an unsatisfactory position, for the various taxation departments w ill doubtless continue to claim more from them than ought f a i r l y to be asked. I have known prospectors to become insolvent because of the claims of taxation departments. Both Eederal and State authorities levied taxation on tbe f u l l value of the shares which a taxpayer may have in mining propositions, notwithstanding that tbey may be yielding no income whatever. I am glad that the Commonwealth Government, has relieved tbe position to some extent. As things are, even if a prospector should ultimately discover an ordinary deposit of low-grade ore, it w ill be useless to b i m , for be w ill not be able to get capital to develop it . Unfortunately, we cannot induce the investment of capital in mining propositions, and this is essential to the prosperity of tbe industry. I shall not.oppose the passage of this bill, but in my opinion the Government would do a great deal more for the industry if it provided £10,000 or £15,000 to be apc-nt in tbe compilation of a reliable general work on the mineral resources of Australia, and the issuing of periodical bulletins to keep the work up to date. I do not suggest that a Commonwealth Geological Department should be created, for all the States have Geological Departments; but the Government would be well advised to obtain the services of a thoroughly qualified and widely experienced geologist to coordinate the work of all the State Departments and edit a general publication on our mineral resources. The mineral exchanges throughout the world would welcome such a work, and it would be in valuable to universities and technical colleges. I am sure also that the various mining journals would make good use of it . I well remember reading a brochure in which the history of the Mexican mining industry was traced over a period of 150 or 160 years. The Mexican Government, it was stated, endeavoured to encourage mining by establishing schools of mines and providing bursaries. The industry was in an 'unsatisfactory con[10] dition, however, unti l about 1880. At that time, a Ministeri n charge of the Mines Department, after expressing his surprise that this, the most speculative of all industries, should be the most restricted, set to work to remedy matters. Conditions were made much more liberal, and the wonderful mineral resources of Mexico were exploited with great advantage to the country. In my opinion, we could do nothing better than to advertise our resources and encourage capital to come here to develop them. Par too little is known abroad of our great mineral wealth. If our potentialities were advertised in the mining exchanges of the world, capital would soon be available for developmental operations. A comprehensive Australian geological work properly circulated abroad would undoubtedly lead to great mining developments here, and would do a thousandfold more good to the Commonwealth and the States than the expenditure in prospecting of ten times the amount covered by this bill . ""We ought to remove without delay many of the harassing restrictions that are at present imposed upon mining operations. In some of the States a company which had spent as much as £100,000 in a mining venture would be liable to the loss of the whole of its property if it failed, for a single day, to carry on operations. While I was in charge of the Mines Department in Western Australia. I introduced legislation to give mine-owners the right to cease operations after a certain expenditure for six months. The measurewas strongly opposed, but it was passed. Now nobody would think of suggesting its repeal. Everybody realizes its advantage to the country. A great deal was done, during my term as Minister, to encourage mining operations. Prospectors were helped, mining companies were encouraged to carry out additional developmental work, and State batteries were established which crushed millions of tons of ore. I question now, whether those batteries did not do more harm than good to the industry, for when rich patches of ore had been worked out by the prospectors, they abandoned their mine. Australia requires capital for mining purposes. If our resources were advertised in the proper quarters, I have not the. slightest doubt that sh6 would get it . Investors' in the mining industry would welcome properly prepared general scientific information on our mineral resources. companies, operations, and so, once more, taring prosperity to mining in Australia. quite unnecessary to repeat or enlarge the arguments of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). His special qualifications and long experience of the mining industry entitle him to speak with authority on the subject. My object in rising is to accentuate one point that he made. can Jead to The gist of the measure is in clause 5, sub-clause 3, which reads-^Any advance under this act should be made upon sueh conditions and subject to such terms as are prescribed. This bill is similar to many measures which have come before us during recent years, in that its f u l l effect can only be known when the regulations made under it are published. The conditions under which this grant will really be made will depend upon the regulations which are to be issued by the Minister. All that we know now is that a sum of money is to be allocated to assist in prospecting for gold. ""We do not know the terms under which it w ill be made availahle. W ill it be made available by way of a subsidy on the capital already invested, or w ill a free grant be made to otherwise penniless men who may be prospecting in the wilds of Australia? things. measure w ill depend largely upon the regulations which as yet are not drafted. It years so much legislation in which the working out of the details has been left to departments has been introduced.

I have protested against legislation of this kind in the past, and I now make a further protest. whioh makes it possible is wrong. honourable member suggest? carefully prepared; some of the ways in which it is proposed to make the grant should be stated so that this House could have an opportunity to discuss them. In stead of that being clone, the whole of the details are to be left to departmental control. The honourable members for Swam They would form ( Mr Gregory) and Maribyrnong ( Mr. comnnemce developmental Penton) bave pointed out directions in which assistance should be given to the gold-mining industry. The honourable member for Maribyrnong spoke of the necessity for research, and for expending some of the £40,000 to encourage the development of resources wbicb so f a r have been found unpayable. I contend that in the mining industry there is already a sufficient inducement for the investment, of capital provided that the margin of The passing of this B ill profit is sufficient. Gold-mining is a purely very little progress. business proposition. The speculative element involved in it must be rewarded by the prospect of an adequate margin of profit. Gold-mining is a languishing industry in Australia to-day, because tbe margin of profit whicb prospectors may reasonably expect is too small for the risk undertaken. That margin of profit has been diminished by the actions of .he Legislature of this country. Frequently there has been no recognition of the fact that whereas some mines yield handsome profits, others represent considerable losses to those who have invested their money in them. Thati t is necessary for the Government to introduce legislation providing for the making of grants of this nature in order to encourage prospecting is a grave reflection upon past legislation. It is a tragedy that an industry which, if unhampered, would attract speculation, is, by reason of legislation, no longer attractive. We should know these This artificial stimulation of tbe industry The success or failure of this will not result in one penny being added to the profits derived from the mines or in any new mines being worked. Tbe is a pity that during recent granting of this money may stimulate prospecting and result in the discovery of metalliferous-ores, but it w ill not encourage tbe development of the mines after their discovery. The only way in which to make this expenditure of any real or permanent value to the country is to remove those burdens w i th which the The system industry is now handicapped,' and make possible a reasonable margin of profit on tbe working of gold-bearing ore when discovered.

73,Mr Mackay (Lilley) [5.20],"Whil ewhicli it is proposed to expend to encourage gold-mining in Australia. I consider that some responsible person should be appointed to advise the Government regarding the distribution of the grant. As pointed out by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), the really effective part of this legislation will be the regulations. I should like the Minister to inform us whether the money is to be paid by way of a grant ""or a3 a subsidy. Por many years, subsidies have been paid by the Mining Departments of the various States to encourage tbe mining industry. Victoria bas paid over £1,000,000 as subsidies to prospectors; the sum expended by New South Wales exceeds £500,000; and vary-, ing sums have been paid by the Governments of the other States for the same purpose. So far as Queensland is concerned, I do not know of one instance in which the money so advanced has been refunded. That is a matter of considerable importance, and T hope ttav when the bill reaches the committee stage the Minister will give us some information along the lines I have indicated. He has given good reasons for the decline of the gold-mining industry throughout Australia. In the Gympie district of Queensland, a mine, which before the war was paying dividends on a yield of 7 dwt. to the ton, is now idle because, ovqing to the great increase in the working costs, a return of 1 oz. to the ton is now neeessary to make it a paying concern. The Government should act cautiously in this matter. Although the Treasurer has been able to announce handsome surpluses for seme years, that money should not be given away unnecessarily. I should prefer that it be expended in other directions than that indicated in the measure before ns. That tbere will be many applicants for a share of this £40,000, I have no doubt, and for that reason I urge the Government to appoint some fully 'lualilied person to advise it before ai:y grants are made. money is to be given to the different Statr. Governments, which will then disburse it. tbe Minister did not say so in his speech. I do not think that much good would be accomplished by that means. Already the Mines Departments of. the various States are making advances to encourage mining. The distribution of £40,000 among them would merely relieve them of some of their financial responsibility. In my opinion, the Government could find some better way of expending this large sum of money than that which has been indicated in the bill now before the House. wish to emphasize the necessity for coordination between tbe geological departments of tbe various States. Tbis lack of co-ordination has robbed Australia of valuable advice which otherwise would have been available for our guidance in the matter now before us. Some time ago a parliamentary committee, of which I was a member, investigated a matter which is very closely associated with gold mining, and its members came to the conclusion that it was essential tnat the geologists of the various States should be brought together in conference with a view of devising some common plan for a geological survey of the Commonwealth. That conference was held, but, in the absence of a satisfactory scheme of finance, very little of a practical nature was accomplished. I agree with the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) that a little more consideration of che manner in whicli this money is to be disbursed would reveal a better way than to indiscriminately parcel out the £40,000 among those persons who may in the future be prospecting for gold. I agree that the men who are engaged in prospecting for gold are worthy of every encouragement; but, as members of this House, it is our duty to see that the public funds are expended to the best advantage. I believe that, if the recommendations of the committee to whicb I have referred were considered in connection with this measure, they would assist materially in determining the lines on which it should be framed. I strongly urge that a sum of money be set aside for a complete geological understand tha.; ;he survey of the Commonwealth, and that there be closer co-ordination between tbe mining departments of the various States. Such co-ordination can be obtained if the Commonwealth will grant sympathetic and practical assistance.",32,Second Reading

76,Mr Makln,"(Hindmarsh) [5.26] I-Every one who desires the advance of Australia must welcome the introduction of such a bill as this. It s purpose is to revive the languishing mining industry of the Commonwealth; but there are difficulties in the way, and it is questionable whether the measure really goes to the root of the matter. The Minister who introduced it referred to eight reasons given by a select committee in New South Wales for the decline in the mining industry, and tbese included inadequate machinery and high cost of production These reasons are really one and the same, because high cost of production always accompanies the use of inadequate machinery. circumstances not referred to by the New South Wales select committee which have a tremendous bearing on tbe matter dealt with . supplies and materials has gone up tremendously the value of gold has not in creased in like proportion. For this reason, if new gold be profitable they must be so rich as to cover the vastly increased cost-of production to-day. It is questionable whether such mines exist, or have ever existed. For one mine that has paid dividends the operations in twenty at least have involved the loss of the capital put into % them. Apart from the fact that mining has not been profitable, there are two very potent factors which have been the cause of many low-grade mines being closed down. of cannot there has been a very great reduction in mining costs. Wages are, of course, a large part of mining costs, but I should like to say that I do not believe that miners bave ever been adequately paid for the work they have done and the risks they have undertaken. One thing which is detrimentally affecting mining in Queensland-and I speak particularly for Charters Towers, Cloncurry, the Etheridge, Croydon, and the Chillagoe field until it became a Government concern-is the high cost of workers' compensation insurance. A few years ago it was possible to insure with private companies against claims for compensation for an annual premium of something like""£3 10s. per head. The Queensland Government established a monopoly, and made it compulsory to insure with the Government office; and, whilst in the case of private companies it was possible to insure for a month, a quarter, or half a year, and pay a premium accordingly, a f u l l year's premium has to be paid in each case to the Government institution, amounting to not less than £12 per workman per year. That is a new tax added to the mining industry in Queensland, and, as a result of it , those in charge of many mines are ceasing operations. surance Office assume increased liabilities? There are, however, other sumes practically no increased liability. Another most important factor to be considered is the lack of industrial stability. There are few inducements to Whilst the cost of mining put machinery into a mine if there is but a small prospect of its development having an uninterrupted r u n. There has been a very great falling off in gold promines are to duction in Queensland. In 1915, the value of the gold produced was upwards of £1,060,000. In 1916 it dropped to £913,000, owing, largely, to the number of miners, truckers, mullockers, and m i l lhands who went .to the war. The production continued to show a steady decline in value u n t i l 1920, when it amounted to £648,000. In 1921 there was industrial trouble at Mount Morgan, with the result that, whereas in the previous year Mount Morgan There are thousands produced 90,716 fine ounces, it protons ' of ore available which duced in 1921 only 17,494 fine ounces. be profitably treated until As something like 47 per cent.. of the total gold product-ion of Queensland is derived from Mount Morgan, the total production for the year dropped from £648,000 to £214,000. The value of the production went up again' to £378,000 during a year of comparative industrial peace, and it dropped again, in 1925, to £188,000, largely owing to further trouble at Mount Morgan. The history of mining ii: Queensland, for the last 25 years at least, has been a history of reefing, and there have been a good many cases of the existence of refractory ores. These have been sufficiently rich in gold contents to make their treatment under normal conditions a reasonably profitable proposition. But as refractory ores require special treatment and special machinery of heavy tonnage, many mines have been unable to carry on. We",33,Second Reading

79,Mr G. Francis,"No ; it ashave to consider that this is not a bill relating to precious metals alone. many of the mines of North Queensland, and of Queensland generally, copper is associated with gold, as it is at Mount Morgan. They are situated, however, at a considerable distance from a railway, and the high transport and high-living costs necessarily involved are prohibitive. I would say that in No r t h Queensland alone there is a quantity of gold, silver, and industrial metals of incalculable value which has not yet been touched or even scratched. There are thousands of square miles of metalliferous country almost unpopulated, and not likely to be populated u n t i l we can be perfectly sure of industrial peace. It is not the miners, mullockers, and other men working in the mines who are responsible for industrial unrest, but the people who are misguided enough to call themselves leaders, and are referred to as union bosses. These, perhaps for purposes of tbeir own, create disturbances in mines, and unfortunately the men follow them blindly. Men who would work and could produce a high output have not been allowed to do so. It is usually in connection with a mine that is a little ""sick,"" and where a company is struggling and battling to pay its way, that these industrial disturbances are promoted. Sof a r as ' I know; no prospecting for gold has ever been unaccompanied by the discovery of f a i r l y valuable deposits of baser metals. It would be an excellent thing for Australia if prospecting were encouraged, notwithstanding the disabilities to which I have referred; but I suggest that, even if we do discover fresh mines, that w ill not restore the mining industry to its former prosperity because of the conditions to which I have referred. ' In the circumstances, although I shall support the bill, I hope that some more comprehensive measure may be introduced later, and before that is done the whole matter should be f u l l y and carefully investigated. Permit me, Mr Speaker, on this the first opportunity I have had of addressing the House, in this new Parliament, to congratulate you on the high position which you hold. Prom what we know of you, I am sure that you wil l give every member of this House a fair deal. Government has brought in a b ill which has for its object the encouragement of In prospecting for metals, but I say at once that the amount set aside by the measure for the mining industry is altogether in adequate, and mining will benefit very little, if at all, from its passing. I do not wish to be a captious critic, because, to a certain extent, the Government is on the right track; but the amount proposed to be placed at the disposal of the mining industry of Australia is only £40,000, and of this amount £15,000 is ear-marked for the Northern Territory. Such a. sum is not likely to greatly stimulate thefurthe r production of gold. TheM in ister in charge of the bill has mentioned various sums that have been paid in the shape of State subsidies. Those sums were for prospecting alone, and the figures are altogether misleading when we consider what the different States have actually paid to assist the gold mining industry in other directions as well as in prospecting. In Western Australia alone advances have been made in aid of mining work, equipment, mining machinery, prospecting and boring. The amount set aside for these purposes by the State with a population of only 370,000 is about £100,000 for last year. prospecting. MrA . GREEN I am aware of that, and the amount proposed to be set aside by the Government is only £40,000, of which a considerable sum is ear-marked for the Northern Territory. The Government proposes to set aside only about one-third of the amount voted for the assistance of the industry by the handful of population in Western Australia. I hone that this measure w ill not be regarded by the Government as. compensation in the slightest degree to the gold mining industry of Western Australia for what it suffered during the war. The agitation for a gold bonus was fairly familiar to honourable members who were here last session. The demand for it on behalf of the mining industry is Australian-wide and is based upon justice. Prom August, 1916, to January, 1919, sold to the value of £15,000,000 was taken by the Commonwealth Government at pre-war prices, and this involved a loss to the gold producers of at least £3,000,000.

Bank derived the advantage. it was.necessary to stabilize our finances, and, in consequence of the large quantities of gold placed in tbe vaults of tbe Commonwealth Bank, an inflation of the note issue was possible. This assistance to the Government and, indirectly, to the people of Australia was given by an industry which had had to submit to an increase of over 200 per cent, in the price of many of tlie commoditiesi t required. I do not intend to labour the question of a gold bonus at this juncture, as the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) stated at Ararat on 28th October last that the matter would be dealt with by Cabinet, and probably referred to a Royal Commission of specialists. The production of gold in Australia, although it is les3 than it was a few years ago, is an important factor, as £2,500,000 worth was ' produced last year, of which Western Australia contributed over 70 per cent. ance proposed in this measure is not great, but it is a recognition of tbe Government's intention to assist tbe industry, andto that extent it is welcome. member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis) shows that he is fairly conversant with the gold-mining industry, but the decline in the production of gold is not, as he suggests, due to any lack of effort on the part of the gold miners. Eveni f the miners at Charters Towers have, as he says, lost time owing to industrial disputes, the same cannot be said of tbe men at Kalgoorlie and other important mining centres in Western Australia, who, under which they work, have not lost more than one week at a time. Mining at a great depth, such as is being undertaken at Mount Morgan and Charters Towers, becomes expensive, particularly when the ore is refractory. Although probably 600 miners in Western Australia, many of Whom are working at a depth of 3,000 feet, are suffering from miners' phthisis, and, according to the medical authorities, are endangering their health, .they have always observed the awards of the Arbitration Court. In many cases tbey consider that they have not had a fair deal. I do not think that tbe honourable member for Kennedy would, for political purposes, wilfully malign the men to whom he has referred. men who were responsible, but the agitators. MrA . GREEN I would be neglect ing my duty if I failed to state that : the men employee! on the Western Australian gold-fields have always observed tbe awards of the court, even when, as the judge stated, the rates were uot based on the cost of living, but on what the industry could stand. Many tof these men are receiving less than is being paid to miners at Broken Hill, who work under much better conditions. The Mount Morgan Mine is, unfortunately, approaching the condition of the mines at Ballarat and Bendigo. The ore is too extensive to treat, . and mining is -more difficult owing to the increased cost of commodities. The miners' wages bave nothing to do with the decline in the gold production of Western Australia. I can The assistonly repeat that owing to the embargo placed on the export of gold produced in Western Australia, and the purchase of gold by tbe Government at pre-war prices, a loss of £2,000,000 was incurred The speech of the honourable by the gold producers of Western Australia.

I have before me the report"" of the Western Australian Disabilities Commission showing the value of gold produced in all tbe States from 1903 to 1924 inclusive. The decline synchronizes with what has been termed the high standard of living in Australia. The figures over this period show a marked decline in the production of gold in every State. It has been shown by the honourable member for Kennedy that the value of gold has not increased, but the cost of production and the cost of living have increased considerably. The figures for £1,080,029; Victoria, £3,259,482; Queensland, £2,839,801; £28,665; Western Australia, £8,770,719; Tasmania, £254,403; Northern Territory, £69,801; or a total for all the States and the Northern Territory of £16,302,900. For 1924 the figures a r e New South Wales, £87,002; Victoria, £312,746; Queensland, £445,617; South Australia, £3,664; Western Australia, £2,258,440; Tasmania, £20,841; Northern Territory, £3,273; or a total of £3,131,583. ten or fifteen years has been gradual, and it must be apparent that with a continuance in the increased cost of production, gold production will eventually cease. There are a number of lew-grade deposits in Australia containing millions of pounds worth of gold, but high protection it is impossible for them to be profitably worked. The Western Australian Disabilities Commission considered tbe position of the gold mining industry, and recommended the payment of a gold bounty of 20s. an ounce. palliative. If it is considered desirable to stimulate the gold-mining industry, the payment of £40,000 as provided iu tbe bill will be found inadequate. intend to support the bill in the hope that a rich gold mine may be discovered. pleased to know, that my free trade friends intend to support a proposal which means, in effect, the granting of a bounty to the mining industry. Like most men who have invested in mining I have lost more than I have gained by it. cost of gold production. Many of the increases are in no way attributable to the tariff. Even in my own electorate there are many rich mines which have been closed as a result of an all-round increase in operating costs.

To make this grant available for expenditure upon existing mines will be to waste it , but we should encourage prospecting for gold as far as possible, for the goid mining industry has done much to develop Australia. I had personal experience of the gold rush to Western Australia, and I say without fear of contradiction that tbe rapid development of that Statei n recent years is tbe direct consequence of the gold discoveries. As the mining industry declined, men who had been at tracted to the West from other parts of the Commonwealth turned their attention to other industries and rapid expansion followed. I believe that further discoveries of gold in that State are possible, and the Commonwealth should assist genuine prospectors who are prepared to test the back country. They should be rewarded according to the new discoveries they make. the existing mines are showing a loss, and they offer little prospect of success. Therefore, the Government would be ill-advised to throw away the people's money in the form of grants to those enterprises.

Such a sum, though not large, w ill be an inducement to experienced miners to go out and prospect.

All the speakers have emphasized tEe fact' t h a t while the cost of production has increased the price of gold has remained stationary. The proposed grant of £40,000 will not remedy that state of affairs. If the existing mines which have Deen sunk to great depths have become too expensive to work and I unhealthy for the miners, the country would be benefited by their closure.

It is a mere drop in tbe bucket. Most of the mines are worked out and are not paying dividends. 3ihis money will be spent merely to assist the shareholders. The grant should be confined to prospecing for new minerals in the Northern Territory, to assist in attracting men to tbe mining fields there. A discovery of mineral always attracts population.

I should not care if the gold-mining industry petered out to-morrow. Gold is one of the most useless metals that we .produce, and by its constant juggling the people are kept in thraldom. Its use as personal adornment is unnecessary. In its production thousands of men have died from miners' phthisis, and although it is claimed that the discovery of gold has been responsible for the progress of certain countries, yet I contend that, if gold had not been disr covered, that progress would have come about by other means. of gold in Victoria that put that State ahead of South Australia. values expressed in gold, but £40,000 expended in developing our agricultural resources would produce real wealth and be of some value to the people. become great purely through agricultural development.

I give credit to the Western Australian Government for its sound and sensible policy of settling people on the land to produce the valuable commodities that are required by us. Manufacturing industries, quite apart from mining, will make any country great. Australia is too far situated from the centre of the world to attain the' position that is today occupied by Great Britain and America. It must become self-contained to compete with other great countries. The Government's policy is to develop the mining industry, but I doubt whether anv result will accrue from the expenditure of such a small sum of money.

They would become good citizens if they were producing something of value, something to make Australia self-contained and prosperous. If the BrokenH ill mine petered out to-morrow the surrounding country would be of no use, excepting for grazing cattle and sheep. The miners would have to leave the town to obtain work elsewhere. Coolgardie is an example of what would happen. MrA . GEEEN -The. pastoral country there is better than at BrokenH ill . would be better develoDed by the water scheme pushed on by the late Lord Porrest. I take exception to the encouragement of the gold-mining industry. quite understand that all other metals are useful, and that we must pay the cost of their production. I should like honourable members opposite to experience the life of the miners, from the cradle to the grave-men who reach tbe grave much more quickly than those who live in cities and agricultural areas. I suggest that the Government, instead of introducing this bill for the benefit of the goldstores, and adequate provision was made mining industry, should give encouragement to other avenues of development in the Commonwealth. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. [8.0] -Lik e some other honourable members, I had no intention of discussing this measure u n t i l the mining industry generally became the subject of the debate. That must inevitably occur whenever the successful prospecting for minerals is under discussion, for it is of importance to know what has happened when precious metal has been discovered previously. Por a time, it was my fortune -no t for any merit of my own-to be a director of the biggest copper-mining company in South Australia. I refer to the Wallaroo and MoontaM in in g and Smelting Company, which carried on successf u l operations for 60 years, and was the first mine in Australia to pay more than £1,000,000 in dividends. years ago it ceased operations, notwithstanding that is was worked on extraordinarily sound lines. It was r u n not only in the interests of tbe directors or the shareholders, although, incidentally, tbey both profited, but consideration was always given to the welfare of the thousands of persons who were employed by it . The sliding-scale method of paying wages was adopted many years before arbitration courts were established. Three scales were in operation to determine the wages of the employees. Speaking from memory, the first scale came into operation when copper was £60 a ton; the second when it was £75 a ton ; and the third when it was £90 a ton. The management realized that it was a good thing to give the employees a distinct interest in the success of the mine, and one method by which they did it was to regulate the wages according to the price of copper. I do not wish to extol this company unduly, but 1 make these I statements to show that nothing was overlooked that was likely to make the mine a success. The machinery which was obtained from time to time was always of tbe first quality, thoroughly competent managers were engaged, and the welfare of the employees, in addition to the sliding-scale arrangement, was always carefully considered. Special concessions were given in regard tohousing and for sports. Under these, methods the mine was a great success for 60 years, and I venture to say that its employees were as satisfied as those of any mine in Australia. I was on the board of directors when war was declared, and one of its first actions after the news was published was to interview the State Premier to see whether it would be possible to continue mining operations. It s chief object in doing so was, not to carry on the mine for the benefit of tbe shareholders, but to provide work for the employees. It realized that there was a serious likeli hood of the employees being thrown out of work. I mention these facts primaril y because of the suggestion that is frequently made by honourable members opposite that capitalistic concerns are never actuated by any motive but the making of dividends. I know that the fact was different in this case, for I was one of the. directors. The board was in About three doubt as to whether it would be possible to dispose of its products. It had endeavoured in peace time to sell its copper to the British Government, but without success. A t tbe outbreak of the war the",39,Second Reading

108,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES (Boothby)copper was going to Germany. market disappeared at once, and the management might have been compelled to close down the mine, because it had no market. I am glad to say, however, that later a contract was entered into with the British Government, which took the whole of produced and used it for munition making, although it was thought, at one time, to be unsuitable for that purpose. There is every reason to believe that a large tonnage of ore could still be rained, but increases in wages and in tbe cost of all supplies, among other causes, have obliged the management to close' the mine'. Another contributing factor was tliat, as the ore had to be mined at a greater depth than in the early years of the mine, it was more costly to w in , for operations say about the bill, but I must confess had to be concentrated on a few shafts that bad been found to be successful. Still another factor was that the ore was yielding a smaller percentage of copper all over than formerly. The average was 3 per cent, to-3$ per cent., and tbere were no "" nuggets."" after the establishment of the Arbitration Court, the employees of the company did not avail themselves of the opportunity to approach it . They felt that, in the circumstances, it was in their best interests to carry on under the existing conditions, proach the court for an award, and from that time tbe end was in sight. Copper, as everybody knows, dropped in price almost as soon as the war ended, and it has continued to drop since. I gladly make the acknowledgment that, as copper continued to fall in price, the employees did what they could to assist the management to carry on. They realized that their interests were involved in the success of the mine, and on one occasion, at least, an arrangement was made with the approval of the Commonwealth A r b i tration Court, by which the miners were able to take less wages than those prescribed in the award. Notwithstanding even this, it became impossible to carry on, and the mine closed down. Quite apart from the fact of my being a shareholder, I very much regret this, for I am sure that much more copper could have been extracted under favorable conditions. However, it could not be expected that operations would be carried That on at a permanent loss, so wdrk had to cease, and the water had to be let into the shafts. The history of the Wallaroo and Moonta Mining Company has been repeated in other parts of Australia. I have described it simply to illustrate the difficulties that face mining companies the copper which was which are obliged to deal with low-grade during the war period, ores. The mine has been a valuable asset to the Commonwealth. It has produced great wealth and enabled good wages to be paid to many thousands of employees. The copper that was won from it was most useful during the war time, and also for long years of peace. In addition to all that, as the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) knows very well, it caused a large agricultural district to spring up all around the mines. I have not very much, to that I cannot understand how the Minister will administer it . Clause5 reads that the Minister may "" make advances to assist persons or companies engaged in prospecting for precious metals in the Commonwealth."" I should like to know For many years tbe method by which he will make the advances. W ill he select the most reputable person dr company, according to actual character, or will he take into consideration -the districts in which the prospecting is to be done ? If the first method is to be adopted, I onlywish to Eventually, they did appoint out that not every one gets his deserts in this world. The very best' individual or company is not by any means certain to be the on'e that will find gold or silver or any other precious metal. By the way, clause 2 of the bill reads ' For the purposes of this act, "" precious metals "" means gold and silver .and such other metal as the Minister, by notice in the Gazette, declares to be a precious metal. Why should it be l e f t to 'the Minister to decide which is a precious metal? One would have expected a list of precious metals to be given in the ""bill. Certainly it should not be the responsibility of the Minister to determine the matter. If the individual or company to receive assistance is to be determined by the particular p a r t . of the Commonwealth in which operations are to be carried on, it must surely be obvious to honourable members that very little will be achieved by attempting to spread £40,000 over the whole of the continent. My own opinion is that, if there is any likelihood of successful prospecting being carried on, the Government will not be approached for assistance. There w ill be plenty of capital available to exploit a likely proposition. The mining magnates, if that term pleases honourable members opposite, and capitalists generally, may be trusted to invest their money wherever there is any possibility of a return. Perhaps we are acknowledging the greatest merit of the b ill when we say that it is, to a certain extent, an appeal to the sporting instincts of the Australian people. But is that a sufficient basis on vernment justified in making available £40,000 on the mere bilit y that gold, silver, "" or such other metal as the Minister declares to be a precious m e t a l "" may be discovered ? One can never tell what will result fro m the search for precious metals, and it is possible that tbe expenditure of this £40,000 may mean the discovery of some new field. ' Nevertheless, I feel that the chances are very greatly against such a result. still intends to proceed with this legislation, to enact it for one year only. If it then finds that the results are not up to its hopesI do not say its expectationsi t would be an easy matter to leave the discovery of precious metals in the future to individuals or companies. ister) [8.16] -It is pleasing to note the reception that has been accorded to this measure by honourable members on all sides of the House. I wish to make it clear that the Government does not pro-, pose to expend any of this £40,000 to place any existing mine on a profitable basis. As I pointed out in my introductory remarks, tbe bill is intended only to assist in prospecting for new fields j but many honourable members who have spoken appear to have misunderstood the position. Some very valuaDle suggestions nave been made, but tbey, for the most part, referred to mines whicb have become unprofitable, and are not working to-day. It has been stated that £40,000 is a very small sum with which to encourage the mining industry, particularly as of that amount £15,000 has been set aside for the encouragement of mining in the Northern Territory. be a large amount, I feel certain that it will encourage people to go out in the search for precious metals.

In committee: Clause1 (Short title). did not realise when th© Minister rose that his speech would close the debate on the second reading of this bill. desired to make some remarks concerning it. I do uot know why the Government, which bas just received a mandate from the people to give effect to certain legislation, should waste time over a paltry measure of this character. posed to provide £40,000 to develop tbe mineral resources of Australia, and of that amount £15,000 is to be set aside for tbe Northern Territory! A t one time Victoria paid £200,000 a year to assist prospectors, but even the expenditure of that large sum did not assist the genuine prospectors, as the whole of the money went to a few companies. Nor did it result in any new fields being opened up. The grant which this bill proposes to make will have no better effect. The Government is only playing with this question. which some of the first gold discovered in Australia was found. To-day there are no mines in that district; I hope that there never will be any. The Ballarat district is now making greater progress than when gold-mining was flourishing there. Victoria to-day is paying for her gold-mining activities. Thousands of men have died before reaching the age of 40 vears as tbe result of the diseases they contracted while working in Victorian mines, and thousands more have developed miners' phthisis. If the Government has received a mandate from the people to do certain things, why is it wastfor you; see how you can squander it to ing time on a paltry measure of this kind? This legislation is an interference with the rights of tbe States, each of which has its Mines Department, and to the State Governments belong the control of mining in Australia, with the exception of the Northern Territory. I can imagine the scramble that there will be for this money -abou t £4,000 for each State! amount will be necessary to pay departmental expenses; no one outside the departments will get one shilling of it. The Government, fresh from the electors with a programme of important work before it, apparently has nothing better to bring before us than a measure to provide a few officials with a few additional pounds! Tor £4,000 it would be difficult to induce two miners to go out into the ranges. The idea is absurd. Mining in Victoria has been killed because of the operations of the men who elected honourable members opposite to this ParliaI ment; I refer to tbe members of the various stock exchanges, the market riggers, and those who sickened the genuine investors. The miners themselves have no desire to sea mining revived in this country, as they realize that there are It is promany other ways' of obtaining a living than by seeking for gold, which, when discovered, is of no value to the world. During tbe election campaign Government supporters made many promises, but I . do not remember having heard of the proposal to grant £4,000 to each State to assist in prospecting for gold. If the Government desires to carry out its election pledges, why does it not introduce a measure to make available £2,000,000 . per .annum to provide good roads, or one to assist tbe workers of Australia to obtain homes? Does tbe I represent a constituency in Government intend to establish a new Federal Mines Department? sign of it. should visit the Home and Territories Department. miniature Mines Department. The Government is only playing with this question. It says, in effect, to the various States, "" Here is a few thousand pounds the best advantage."" If the Government were sincere in its desire to discover precious metals, it would come forward with a proposal, for the expenditure of £500,000, in whicb case it is possible that some result would accrue, as doubtless Australia contains many minerals besides gold. I should have no hesitation in supporting a measure of that character ; but That for Parliament to be asked to deal with a paltry proposal such as this, which leads nowhere, is, I consider, a waste of our time, for which the Ministry is deserving of censure.

The same conditions were found between Pine Creek and the Katherine Eiver. The only two industries by which the Northern Territory can be developed are mining and cattle raising. If I were a young man, I should not hesitate to seek my future in the Territory. The gloomy pictures painted by honourable members of the Country party are not justified, and their only effect is to belittle Australia in the eyes of people abroad. The Territory is capable of providing sufficient cattle to supply the whole of the Australian market and leave a large surplus for export. The miner is the best pioneer of development, and my experience of miners as a class is that they are essentially honest. I support the contentions of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay), because I am satisfied that he has outlined the only means by which the Northern Territory can be developed. There is plenty of land there for everybody, and the Government would not be acting unwisely if it transferred people thither from the States.

The Government has no intention to parcel out this money recklessly. honourable member for Lilley suggested that this money should be paid only as rewards for discoveries. The Government does not believe in that policy; it holds that the discovery itself is a sufficient reward; but if a few men form a party to prospect a particular area, the Government may make a contribution to defray the cost of their outfit and expedition. If they discover a payable field the whole amount which this bill will make available will be small in comparison with the probable fruits of their find. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) advocated that the whole of the Commonwealth expenditure should be concentrated in the Northern Territory. Some honourable members spoke as if great deposits of metals of all kinds, can be seen outcropping throughout that country. But what would be the use of spending £40,000, or even £1,000,000, in assistance to prospecting in the Northern Territory while there is no means of transport there? The Government believes that the first essential for the development of the territory is the provision of railway facilities. carry, the railway right through from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek? to occupy the Treasury bench long enough to see Darwin connected by r a i l w it h Adelaide. I hope the committee w ill agree to tbe clause as drafted. more the Minister says, tbe more he convinces me that this proposal is a misinformation regarding take. I am genuinely alarmed by his statement that tbe Home and Territories Department w ill attempt to administer the expenditure of £25,000 in the various States. Anybody who has had experience of mining w ill agree that that is a hopeless proposal. Tbe honourable gentleman is quite mistaken when he says that the discoverer of a gold-field does not need a reward. I have never known a wealthy company to undertake prospecting, except in respect of existing mines. Mineral discoveries are usually made by individual prospectors or fossickers, who need financial backing for the development of their finds.

After what the Minister has said, I am mo-re than ever convinced that this money will be thrown away. Rather than that the Commonwealth should attempt to disburse this money through the Home and Territories Department, I would prefer it to be spent on the construction of roads or in the remission of taxation of mining companies. The Government will be rushed with thousands of applications from all parts of Australia, and the Home and Territories' Department will not be able to deal with them without recourse to the State departments, which will not have a direct interest, in the wise and economical expenditure of the money. It would be preferable to hand this amount over to the States to be expended by them in their own discretion on a £ 1 for £1 basis. in whicb the fund can be economically administered. that Ministers did not take counsel with honourable members in regard to this proposal, because I am loath to see £25,000 of public money absolutely thrown away, as must happen under this proposal. Governments have experts and departmental organizations to advise them in regard to mining matters, and if the Commonwealth subsidized State assistance to prospecting on a £ 1 for £ 1 basis by the Commonwealth for expenditure on the money would be utilized more judiciously than this £40,000 will be if it is authorities make their recommendations administered by a Commonwealth department. I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to adopt that suggestion, A fund of £40,000 contributed by tbe Commonwealth and supplemented by £40,000 from the States would help the mining industry considerably, and I am satisfied that such expenditure would be more justified than many other past disbursements have beeii. The Honorary Minister should pay heed to the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay). It is obvious that if the Home and Territories' Department is to administer the fund it will public servants and a Main Roads Board, be inundated with applications from all parts of Australia for assistance to prospectors, and it will not have the means of inquiring into the bona fides of the applicants. It will be bound to refer each application to the State authority concerned, and if the Minister intends thathis department shall deal with all requests it is almost certain that the only successful applicants will be those who bave the support of a friendly member or Minister, and others more deserving will be overlooked. The State mines departments have efficient administrative machinery and staffs of experts qualified by knowledge and experience to report on each application and the prospects of the money being wisely expended. I suggest that the clause should be amended by inserting after tbe words "" advances to "" the following words, "" to the States and to the Northern Territory to "" . The clause would then read(1) The' Minister may, out of the money standing to tbe credit of the trust account, make advances to the States and to the Northern Territory to assist persons or companies engaged in prospecting for precious metals in the Commonwealth. It will be very foolish if the Government attempts to consider in Melbourne applications for prospecting grants that will be received from all over Australia. The Homes and Territories Department will have to rely upon the 5 tate Mines Departments for information. Why not follow the practice that is now carried out in connection with grants for main roads? Grants are made roads that are approved by tlie State Main Roads Boards. In Queensland, tbe local to the Main Roads Board,, which considers them and recommends to tbe Commonwealth what roads should be built.

148,Mr Forde,"That is not so. ThoughI ask the Minister to acceptthe suggested amendment. come to the conclusion that the draftsman when drafting the bill had a different idea from that of the Minister. I feel satisfied that before tbe bill was prepared it was proposed that the £25,000 should be ullocated to the States on such conditions as the Minister thought fit. It is preposterous for this Government to attempt to administer the prospecting grants, and in that matter I agree with the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay). If a prospector living in Queensland or Western Australia applies to the Commonwealth for assistance to obtain camels, a horse and dray, or a prospecting outfit, and his application has to be referred back to the State, the delay will be so great that the prospector will give up. all idea of assistance and obtain work elsewhere. The whole idea is preposterous and absurd. Western Australia has a Mines Department and a mining engineer. When an application is received, the engineer makes an investigation and recommendation. If the application is from .the northern part of tbe State, he asks either the magistrate or some local officer to report on the bona fides of the prospector requiring assistance. The present proposal seems to me to' be utterly absurd. able member vote for the bill? member had been here, he would know that I have already made a suggestion to the Government. I suggested the issue of monthly or half-yearly bulletins of the potential mineral wealth of Australia as outlined in the geographical reports submitted to the Institute of Science and Industry. This would certainly do more good than the bill. I urge the Minister, if the bill is passed, not to administer it from Melbourne. J hope that the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) and the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) will not press tbe amendment, because if carried it will to a large extent cramp the opportunities of the Government to assist persons to prospect for precious metals. Sections2 and 3 of clause 5 and clause 6 give the Government power after the pasage of the bill to subsciibe by regulation and otherwise the best method of dealing with applications for assistance. The Government could, under the bill as it now stands, do all that is contemplated by the amendment, and, in fact, much more to assist prospecting. If this work were to be carried out solely by the States there would be no opportunity for the Government to investigate carefully the effect of this legislation. No similar measure has previously been before Parliament. If the amendment is not pressed the Government will have an opportunity to assist prospectors immediately, but if the bill is defeated, some time will elapse before it is again introduced. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) has a great deal to recommend it . The distribution of the Commonwealth roads grant has been relegated by this Parliament to the States, because their departments are better fitted to administer the grant. In all the States prospecting grants are made available from time to time. I have endeavoured to get the Minister to agree to incorporate in tbe bill precious stones such assapphires, opals, diamonds, topaz and other Australian gems. Take for instance the case of the Lightning Ridge opal miners. After considerable negotiation £300 was made available! by the State Government to develop a new field. A number of men were employed there until the money was expended, but during that time a certain quantity of opal was found. In tbe heart of South Australia is a large tract of country which can easily be prospected, and notwithstanding that the Government is obsessed with the idea of encouraging prospecting for gold and other precious minerals. I suggest that some attention should be given to the beautiful gems of Australia. We have no departmental machinery by which the claims of precious metal miners, say at Kalgoorlie or Coolgardie. may be dealt with. What Commonwealth officers are in a position to judge of these things? Should not this work be carried out by the States in view of their long experience in administering prospecting grants?

A l though this is the least important of them, I feel that I should fail to discharge my duty if I did not remind the Government that there bas been no request from any prospector in Austraha, or from any State Government, that the Commonwealth should provide this money.

(&) The said railway may be either-(i ) a railway on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, extending to Alice Springs from Oodnadatta; or (ii) a railway on a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge, extending to Alice Springs from a point on the Kalgoorlie to Port A-ugusta Railway, east of Tarcoola. The agreement also provides that the Commonwealth will, at its own expense, construct a railway of 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge from Port Augusta to RedH ill ; that the State will, at the expense of the Commonwealth, provide a third rail on the railway between Red Hill and Adelaide which will admit of the Commonwealth Railways rolling-stock travelling through to Adelaide; and that the Commonwealth will, at the expense of the State, provide a third rail from a point near Port Pirie to Red HiU. The ratifying bill may, therefore, be divided into two main sections, namely(a) The construction of a railway to Alice Springs, and (o) the construction of a railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill, and the provision of a third rail so as to enable Commonwealth trains to run into the Adelaide railway station. The agreement is very complete, setting out tbe rights and privileges of the Commonwealth and the things required to be done by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, on ine one hand, and the rights and privileges of the state and the things required to be done by the South Australian Railways Commissioners oh the other hand. It is provided, further, that, subject to the necessary approvals and consents being ratified by the parliaments of the Commonwealth and the State before 30th June, 1926, and subject also to any interruptions of work or other circumstances not within the control of tbe Commonwealth, the Commonwealth undertakes to have the railway to Alice Springs, either from Oodnadatta or from a point on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, open for traffic on or before the 30th June, 1929. The route of the railway to Alice Springs, as well as its gauge and all other matters connected therewith are, under the agreement, to .be determined by the Commonwealth, regard being had at all times to the development of the country, the cost of construction, and the estimated revenue from the railway. Mr Hill. It is not proposed at this stage to submit to honourable members definite proposals in connection with the line to Alice Springs, or in regard to the railway from Port Augusta to RedH ill , and the other proposed works associated therewith. The railway to Alice Springs will be the subject of a bill which will come before the House almost immediately. The whole question of the route of the line, and the estimates of. cost in connection therewith, will then be open for discussion. The proposals in connection with the Port Augusta to RedH ill line, and the provision of a third rail to Adelaide, will also, following upon an investigation by the Public Works Committee, be placed before Parliament for consideration. I would urge honourable members to postpone the expression of their views in regard to the route of the line to Alice Springs, and other matters associated with the construction of that line, and also in regard to the proposals in relation to the Port Augusta to RedH ill line; until the bills in connection therewith are presented to the House. The adoption of the agreement will in no way affect the -consideration by Parliament of the proposals in regard to these two matters, which are subject to parliamentary sanction before the works can proceed. Regarding the railway to Alice Springs, it will be seen, by going back to the agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia, dated the 7th December, 1907, which was afterwards incorporated in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act, that the Commonwealth, in consideration of the surrender of the Northern Territory, agreed that it should construct or cause to be constructed as part of the transcontinental railway a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect with the other part of the transcontinental railway on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. It will also be seen that the State, in consideration of the covenants and agreements by the Commonwealth, agreed, at the time of such surrender, to authorize by legislation the Commonwealth to do all. that should be necessary to' enable the Commonwealth to make surveys,acquire . the. necessary land, and to construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway in South Australia proper from any point on the Port Augusta railway to a. point on the northern boundary proper from any point on the Port Augusta railway to a point on the northern boundary line of South Australia proper to connect with that part of the transcontinental railway to be built in the Northern Territory from Port Darwin Southwards to the northern boundary of South Australia proper, and to maintain and work such railway when constructed. Tbis agreement, which was made many years ago, did not fix the time within which the railway had to be built, nor did it , according to the legal advisers of the Commonwealth, definitely define the route that should be adopted. Governments have dealt with this question, and for many years the South Australian Government and the people of South Australia have been clamouring for the railway to be built. Shortly after this Government assumed office, it was decided that the question of the NorthSouth railway should be settled, and the agreement embodied i u the B ill , whicb definitely way to Alice Springs shall be constructed pursuant to the agreement contained in the schedule to the Northern Territory Acceptance Act of 1910, is the result of several conferences between tbe Prime Minister and the Premier of South Australia. ""Without going further into the subject of the actual route of the line at the present stage, I mention that the adoption of the agreement will definitely settle the route for the main North-South line as against the route advocated from Maree through Birdsville. The construction of the line proposed in the agreement will be a compliance with the agreement entered intoby tbe two Governments as far back as 1907, and incorporated in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act of 1910. It is in part-redemption of the original promise by the Commonwealth to the State to provide a North-South railway. Thei n clusion in the agreement of a provision for a through railway from Port Augusta to Adelaide, is an acknowledgment of the urgent need, for tbe better utilization of the transcontinental railway. This railway, built at a cost of approximately £6,400,000, is set between two narrow gauge systems, and until connecting railways, built to standard gauge, have been provided, it can never f u l l y serve the line to South Australia purpose for which it was constructed, nor give a reasonable return to the people of Australia commensurate with the outlay. This proposal will at a later date be presented to tbe Housei n detail. I shall, at this stage, merely state that the object of the proposal is to overcome many of the difficulties experienced in connection with the working of the East-West railway, and to enable the Commonwealth trains to run direct from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide, instead of stopping, as at present, at Port Augusta. The comfort of the passengers from the west will be greatly increased thereby, and the transPrevious port of mails, goods, and livestock will be considerably accelerated. The agreement is submitted for the favorable consideration -of honourable members. It may not be out of place to point out at this stage some of the advantages of the proposed railway between Adelaide, RedH ill , and Port Augusta. It would reduce by 70 miles the length of the jourprovides that the railney between Adelaide and Port Augusta, and the time oocupied from eleven and a half to six and a half hours. It would permit of passengers and loading being conveyed direct from Adelaide to K a l goorlie, a distance of 1,240 miles, obviating the delay and expense at present in curred in transhipment at Terowie and Port Augusta. It would curtail by from eight and a half to nine and a half hours the time at present occupied in the train journey from Adelaide to Perth. It would enable livestock from the trans-Australian railway to be conveyed from the place of loading to market in one vehicle, thus bringing about the delivery of stock in better condition. W it h the existing line livestock for Adelaide has to be transhipped at Port Augusta to 3-ft. 6-in. trains, and again at Terowie to 5-ft. 3-in. trains. It would permit of livestock being conveyed from Port Augusta to D r y Creeki n from ten to twelve hours. W it h the present line 25 hours elapse between the departure of livestock from Port Augusta and their arrival at D r y Creek. It would provide a line on which on each train 85 per cent, more loading could be carried from Port Augusta, arid 54 per cent, to Port Augusta. Tbe existing line via Terowie rises at a couple of points to a height of 2,000 feet, while ou the proposed line via Red Hill the highest point would be only 455 feet. It would accelerate the mail service to and from Western Australia; the outwards English mail would leave Melbourne and Adelaide later and the inwards English mail would be delivered in Adelaide on -Fridays instead of on Saturdays, and would arrive in Melbourne in sufficient time to enable delivery to be effected on the first round on Saturday morning instead of on Monday. It would be sufficiently revenue-producing to at once pay working expenses and a considerable portion, if not the whole, of the interest. It would permit of the quotation of a through rate to Adelaide for Northern Territory live stock instead of adopting South Australian rates for a portion of the distance. For reasons already mentioned, it would afford some measure of relief for the disabilities under which the trans-Australian railway is at present worked. It would increase the revenue from tbe trans-Australian railway by approximately £37,000, due to the stimulation of the through traffic which would be obtained, for reasons already mentioned. It would permit of stores and materials required for the trans-Australian and Northern Territory railways being conveyed in Commonwealth trains from Adelaide, thus minimizing tbe expense at present incurred in freight charges.

This measure provides for the extension of the 3 f t . 6 in. railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, and for all matters i:i relation to the running of such a line. As I explained to honourable members when submitting the bill for the ratification of the agreement entered into with the Government of South Australia on 18th September, 1925, the' construction of the line referred to in the bill now before thHouse will be a compliance with the agreement entered into between the Government of tbe Oommonwealth and the State of South Australia on 7th September, 1907, which agreement was incorporated in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act of 1910. In consideration of tbe surrender of tbe Northern Territory the Commonwealth agreed that it would construct, or cause to be constructed, as part of the transcontinental railway, a line from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect with the other part of the transcontinental railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. The Government of South Australia, in consideration of the covenants and agreements by the Commonwealth, undertook that it would, at the time of such surrender, authorize by legislation the Commonwealth to do all that was necessary to enable the Commonwealth to make surveys, acquire the necessary land, and to construct, or cause to be constructed, a' railway in South Australia proper from any point on the Port Augusta railway to a point on the northern boundary line of South Australia proper, to connect with that part of the transcontinental railway to be built in the Northern Territory from Port Darwin southwards to the northern boundary of South Australia proper, and to maintain and work such railway I shall give that informawhen constructed. It will, therefore, be seen that the Commonwealth, when passing the Northern Territory Acceptance Act of 1910, gave a clear undertaking that the line would be built, but did not fix the time within which it was to be built, nor did it , according to the legal advisers of the Commonwealth, set out the route that should be adopted. Under the agreement of 18th September, 1925, whicb has just been submitted to the House, the Commonwealth undertook, subject to necessary approvals and consents being ratified by the Parliament of the State before SOth June, 1926, and subject also to any interruption of work from cir-",51,Railways South Australia Agreement Bill Second Reading

169,Mr Hill (Echuca,"Minister for Workscumstances not within the control of the Commonwealth, that a railway from Alice Springs either to Oodnadatta, or a point on the Port Augusta railway will be opened for traffic on or before the 30th June, 1925. Steps have been taken by the Government to ascertain which is the best and most economical route to adopt, taking into consideration tbe possible development that will occur as the result of the completion of the line, and the traffic to be provided for. In 1920, the Government of the day arranged for the matter of the extensions in and to the Northern Territory to be considered by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. The committee submitted its report on the 5th October, 1922, details of which can be seen in Parliamentary Paper No. 76 of 1922. An extract from the Committee's report reads: Briefly summarized, the recommendations of the committee are:1. To extend tlie existing railway to Daly Waters, on the understanding that it is to form part of an eventual line from Newcastle WaterB to Camooweal. 2. That a light low-level line be constructed gauge line from Oodnadatta to Alice from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. 3. That these lines be regarded as forming sufficient railway development for the Territory for many years. 4. That when the time arrives for the construction of a through transcontinental railway line negotiations be entered into wit h South Australia to permit of an alteration of the Northern Terriance with the provisions of section 59 of tory Acceptance Aet. of 1910, by whicli such line may be constructed by the route then shown to be best in tlie interests of Australia. that honoring the agreement? proposes to honor the agreement. way to Daly Waters was dealt with by Parliament in 1923, when it was decided that the existing railway from Darwin to Emungalan should be extended southwards to Daly Waters, a distance of 160 miles. Tenders have been called for the 160 miles of railway, which, wben completed, will bring tbe extension southward from Darwin a distance of 360 miles. When the line is completed from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, there will be, in all, 778 miles of 3-ft. 6=-in. gauge line, and there will then remain only 600 miles to be laid between Daly Waters and Alice Springs to complete the whole of the north-south railway from Darwin to Port Augusta. The Government has caused a survey to be made of the suggested route from Kingoonya, on the east-west railway, to Alice Springs, and has had an estimate prepared of the cost of constructing a railway between these two points, and also of the cost of the proposed extension of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. A survey covering this proposal was carried out many years ago. The estimated cost of each proposal is as follows:-Extension of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, 60-lb. rails, ruling grade of 1 in 80, £1,700,000; from Kingoonya to Alice Springs, 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, 80-lb. rails, ruling grade 1 in 100, £4,500,000. Both estimates are ifor unballasted and tinfenced lines. As a result of close consideration of the whole of the facts, bearing in mind the wide difference in the estimated cost of the two proposals, and the estimated traffic to be catered for the Government bas definitely decided in favour of a 3-ft. 6-in. Springs, which is embodied in the bill now placed before tbe House for the favorable consideration of honourable members. All the information required in accordthe Commonwealth Railways Act, including plans, book of reference, estimates, &c, have been placed on the table. In addition, each honourable member has been supplied with a statement showing the estimated expenditure and revenue under I think the Government ihe different bases for each route, together with plans showing the route followed by the ""arty, of which I was a member, which recently visited the Northern Territory. LaterI shall take the opportunity to explain these different proposals and the basis upon which the revenue and expenditure has been estimated. In considering tbe matter, honourable members are requested to bear in mind the nature of the country and the conditions which exist in relation to water supply, rainfall, &c, and the possible extent of the country's development for sheep and cattle raising, and also in connection with mining.

Until the water supply on the various holdings in the Territory until wells or dams are provided at suitable distances, it is useless to expect any considerable increase in the carrying capacity of the country. abundant evidence of the difficulties ex-: perienced nexion, utilize to the fullest extent the area3 held by them, owing to the fact that water is not obtainable at suitable apart throughout result is that the country in the vicinity of the wells supplying out, whilst large areas which are not supplied by wells are carrying feed which to all intents and purposes is useless. this is a serious difficulty so far as cattle are concerned, it is on most holdings an absolute bar to the stocking of runs with sheep, which require at least one well or watering place for every 16 square miles of country, or, roughly, 50 wells for every 1,000 square miles of grazing Between Kingoonya stock water has been found at ranging from 60 to 100 feet, but even in that locality it is not available at frequent intervals, sult the small maps in their which are copies of the larger one which I have before me, they will see a red line which shows the route taken by the party which visited the country under the leadership of the Premier of South Australia ( Mr Gunn). notice the area north of Kingoonya between Kingoonya Mr Bill. between Kingoonya and tbe opal fieldsa distance of approximately 130 miles..

For stocking with sheep, water supplies at close intervals and vermin-proof fencing are essential. North of Kingoonya the rainfall is, approximately, 8 inches, and gradually diminishes u n t i l west of Oodnadatta it is 5 inches. Thence northwards it gradually increases u n t i l at Alice Springs the average fall over the last 45 years has been about 11 inches. Unfortunately, although tbe average rainfall may be 5, or 8, or 10 inches, there is occasionally a period of two or three years during which norain falls. When we visited Todmorden Station, there had been no rain of value for two and a half years, and stock were -dying, in all directions, largely owing, to the fact that the water supplies ,were so far apart that stock coming into the wells ate out thefeed for a considerable distance about them, unti l eventually, after they had filled themselves up with water, tbey were too exhausted to get back to the-feed and perished near the wells. sunk between tbe existing ones? been put down away from the dry watercourses. During our party's visit to the Territory we found wild dogs more plentif u l than rabbits, but indications were not lacking that rabbits had, been tbere in countless millions at soni© time, probably during a wet season. That being so, it is obvious that if the country is to be developed to carry sheep it will be necessary to not only sink wells at frequent intervals, but also to divide the holdings into small vermin-proof paddocks. In regard to the area to be held by lessees, -nothing less than 500 square miles is I was told that not less than 1,000 square miles is a living area, and I believe -feat to be so. Between Kingoonya and the -opal fields the country is f a i r l y jrood and would, I estimate, carry about 30 or 40 sheep to the square mile if water were provided and the holdings were made vermin-proof. Immediately north of the H as the area been prosopal fields there is neither water nor feed. Extending 50 miles west of Anna Creek to a point opposite the opal fields is an area, estimated to I emphasize this point in measure 50 miles long by 30 miles wide, of the poorest country I have ever seen. The country between Kingoonya and the opal fields is already served by the East-West railway, and cattle raising could be carried onwith advantage from the railway for another 100 miles to the north. Butf r o m the opal fields to a point opposite Oodnadatta, and 50 miles west of that centre, there exists some extremely poor country. For the first 160 miles north of Oodnadatta. the Western survey runs parallel with ihe eastern survey at a distance of approximately 50 miles; this distance ta.per3 at thenorthern end as the two routes converge. Between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs the eastern route will serve the country just as effectively as would the western route. That area lying between Oodnadatta and the opal-fields is so poor that it does not warrant a railway. The opal-fields near Kingoonya are already catered for by the East-West line, and for that reason no railway line, either 4 f t . 8^ in . or 3 f t . 6 in., should follow the route of the western survey.

It was estimated that the carrying capacity of that country would be equal to, but no better than, that on the western side of the route, but we found when making our excursion west of tbe western survey, that the land did not improve as was expected. On"" A "" basis, the area coloured blue would carry 40 sheep to the square mile; brown, 30 sheep; pink, 4 cattle; and green, 3 cattle.

In that report they saidThe whole of the country carried such an abundance of good top feed, practically every shrub being edible for sheep.

The report continuesThat under capable management and proper improvement and judicious stocking, that is stocking the country according to its carrying capacity, and not according to water supply, it will safely carry an average of 40 sheep to tha square mile. That condition would render the country practically drought-proof. This report is available to honourable members. In it is given the route over which these men travelled, and I presume they meant that the whole of the country was capable of carrying 40 sheep to the square mile, had an abundance of water, and was well supplied with feed. The first basis has practically been drawn up on the estimated carrying capacity of the country, but I consider tbe estimate altogether too high. According to "" D "" basis,, which accords with my opinion, half the area coloured blue would carry 30 sheep to the square mile, and the other The country on the eastern half l j cattle; half the area coloured brown would carry 30 sheep lo the square mile, and the other half 1£ cattle; the area coloured pink would carry 1^ cattle; and the area coloured green 1-J cattle also.. That is considered a reasonably safe basis. Personally, I should uot be prepared to recommend the House to accept any basis other than "" D . "" It will be seen that similar bases have been prepared for the Kingoonya to Alice Springs route. I might mention that the map of four colours shown in the statement represents an area twice as large as the State of Victoria. The bases are tbe same for both routes. I come now to the working expenses for both routes. I propose to take the "" D "" basis as being the one upon which we are putting the line forward. That shows that the working expenses are £85,300 per annum; the interest on construction £247,500, and on rolling-stock £11,878, totalling £344,678. The estimated revenue from the line is £177,137. The loss would, therefore, be £167,541. source of revenue? later, as development occurs, there would undoubtedly be some sheep. Taking into consideration the profit on the Port Augusta-Kingoonya section the loss would be reduced to £80,665. On the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs line, on the "" D "" basis, the working expenses are estimated at £51,880; the interest on cost of construction, £93,500; and the interest on rolling stock, £11,701; whicb make a total of £157,081. The estimated revenue is £65,097'. The loss from this line would therefore be £91,984. If the profit on the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta section be allowed for, the loss would be reduced to £18,178. The whole of these estimates of revenue are for pastoral products only. I received a letter to-day, however, which I think it only right to read to the House.

The main lode, which is about 500 feet long with an average width of about 10 feet, has two shafts sunk on it . The first shaft sunk on the property was put down on the eastern end of the lode where the formation on the surface was about 12 feet wide. reached a depth of 50 feet, a cross-cut was put in, and proved the lode to have widened out to 26 feet, and to have considerably improved in value. This shaft was then continued down to a depth of 95 feet, when water was struck. The shaft was refilled to prevent the water from rising, and a crosscut was put in the lode at 90 feet. When this crosscut had got into the lode for a distance of 16 feet, a cavity was run into which was 17 feet square. cavity, or blow, was literally lined with carbonate of lead, and looked like a cave of stalactites. cave the shaft had to be abandoned, as it was impossible to get timber large enough in the district to timber up and make the drive safe to work in . 500 feet further west on the same lode another shaft has been sunk to a depth of 50 feet, and a crosscut has been put in at that depth and has proved the width of the ore to be 30 feet. These two shafts prove the lode to be about 500 feet long, and to have widened out from 12 to 30 feet, and the lode is widening out at the rate of about 1 foot for every 6 feet sunk, and is getting richer with every foot of sinking done. We are now standing off the lode at the eastern end, and sinking a vertical shaft, in which we expect to cut the lode at a depth of 150 feet. This shaft is now down to a depth of 90 feet. In addition to tbe main lode, wo have a parallel lode which is 750 feet south of the main lode. This parallel lode is not as long as the main lode, but is much wider on the surface, being in places over 40 feet wide. Only one shaft has been sunk on this parallel lode, and that is down to a depth of 95 feet. At a depth of 50 feet a crosscut was put in and proved the lode to be 28 feet wide. When this shaft has been sunk another 5 feet, making the total depth 100 feet, another crosscut will be put in to prove the width of the lode. This ore body is also widening out and getting richer for every foot of sinking done. The whole of the ore is gossan carrying good copper, lead and silver values. Everything depends on the quality of the sulphide ore to be met with after we pass the water level. Sulphide ore may not come in until we reach a depth of 200* feet. Nothing but the pick and shovel will prove the value of the mine. Whilei t is impossible to forecast the future, it is only reasonable to suppose that with ' such long and wide unbroken lengths and widths of ore widening out and getting richer for every foot of sinking done-that they will continue to widen and Neither get richer, until sulphide or primary rock is reached.

As we were travelling north from Maryvalo we met a mob of 350 cattle, which included stock as fine as I have seen in any part of the Commonwealth. They would have done credit to any lucerne fattening district. They were then somewhere in the vicinity of Deep Well. We saw them again four days later, and they were still on the track, not having reached Maryvale. As a result of their four days on the road they had depreciated quite £2 per head. On arrival at Alice Springs we foundthat about 800 head of cattle had been mustered from the outside stations to be sent to Oodnadatta, but, wben it was found that water and feed between Alice Springs and Oodnadatta were unobtainable, they were all taken back to the runs whence they came.
