So it would be a case of double some remarks about the minister’s Workjeopardy for many of those workers who place Relations Amendment (Fair Terminahappened to be casual and in small business tion) Bill 2002. Let me begin by saying that if this government were to have its way. We what the minister describes as being fair is have to commend the efforts of those in the quite contrary to the commonly accepted other chamber who over the years have notion of fairness in Australian communities. maintained the line that the issue of unfair In the earlier bill, the Workplace Relations dismissal has to be treated on the basis of the Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. principle of a fair go all round. 2], the minister wanted us to believe that fair Back in 1995 the government’s AWIRS dismissal somehow meant depriving a whole survey reported that small business emclass of employees of any recourse under law ployed a higher proportion of casuals than all against harsh, unjust and unreasonable other workplaces-21 per cent of small grounds for termination. That exclusion was businesses compared to 17 per cent of all to apply to anyone who, by chance, hapworkplaces. As we know, and as others have pened to work in a business of less than 20 referred to in the debate on this bill, under employees.

It is difficult to be precise particular employment relationship existedabout the exact number of casual workers that is, where the short-term employment, as who would be affected by the scope of this defined by the minister’s bill, is less than 12 proposed exclusion, but a large number of months. So we see a second attempt to depeople out of the two million currently casuprive Australian citizens of recourse to legal ally employed would suffer the negative imremedies.

Foreign Affairs: Libya (Question No. 1025) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 17 October 2002: (1) Following his recent visit to Tripoli, Libya, is he able to say whether the Libyan Government is considering re-opening a diplomatic posting in Canberra. (2) What is the proposed site of the posting. (3) When was the last time Libya was permitted to have a diplomatic posting in Australia. (4) Has he been advised by the Department of Foreign Affairs on the principal reasons for expelling Libya; if so, what were those reasons. (5) Is he aware of reports dated 6 May 2002 from US State Department Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security, Mr John R. Bolton, of new Libyan programs for acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. (6) Is he aware of further reports of Libyan programs to acquire chemical and biological weapons. (7) Have these reports influenced the Australian Governments attitude to relations with Libya. (8) What is the Australian Government’s justification for allowing Libya to re-establish a diplomatic mission in Australia. (9) Is the Australian Government considering opening a diplomatic post in Tripoli, Libya, following his meeting with Colonel Qadhafi’s son. As the questions raised fall within the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have consulted him on the following answers to the honourable member’s questions(1) While the Government has not received a formal request seeking agrement to Libyan representation in Australia, the Libyans have foreshadowed that they plan to seek diplomatic accreditation to Australia of an Ambassador. (2) See answer to question (1). (3) The Government suspended relations with Libya on 19 May 1987 when the Libyan People’s Bureau (Embassy) in Canberra was also closed. (4) The Government took this action in view of domestic and regional concern over claims of Libyan interference in the internal affairs of Australia and countries in the South Pacific region. (5) Yes. (6) A number of institutions have published reports regarding Libya’s programs of chemical and biological weapons. For example, the Monterey Institute of International Studies has produced a report on Libya’s chemical weapons program. (7) Australia maintains diplomatic relations with a number of countries which are known or reported to have weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, and takes appropriate opportunities to register its concerns about these programs. During my visit to Libya in July 2002, I urged Libya to help resolve WMD concerns by acceding to the Chemical Weapons Convention and refraining from acquiring longer range ballistic missiles. (8) The Government reviewed Australia’s relations with Libya earlier this year, and, in light of international developments and national economic interests, decided on 17 June 2002 to resume normal diplomatic relations with Libya. The Government is satisfied that Libya is no longer actively involved in promoting terrorism. Libya has condemned the September 11 attacks in the United States, has signed all of the anti-terrorism conventions, and is starting to take appropriate counterterrorism measures. (9) No. Libya agreed to Australia accrediting our Ambassador in Cairo. The Ambassador presented his credentials in Tripoli on 11 September 2002.

Family and Community Services: Custody and Child Support (Question No. 1065) Ms Jackson asked the Minister for Children and Youth Services, upon notice, on 23 October 2002: (1) How many citizens residing in Australia are involved in shared-care custody arrangements with ex-partners who are New Zealand citizens residing in New Zealand. (2) In how many cases are both parents classified as low-income earners.",100,Aciar
261,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is the same as that given to(3) Under the current agreement between Australia and New Zealand, in cases in which both parents are classified as low-income earners and each parent has equal custody of the children, what percentage of (a) Australian parents are required to make child support payments to the New Zealand parent and (b) New Zealand parents are required to make child support payments to the Australian parent. (4) Has his attention been drawn to my representations to him concerning the Child Support Agreement between Australia and New Zealand as it relates to a Hasluck constituent, Mr Deon Roberts; if not, why not. (5) Is there an anomaly in this case, whereby Mr Roberts is required to pay child maintenance to his ex-partner in New Zealand for his daughter, even though he is caring for his son in Australia; if not, why not. (6) Is this Agreement which requires Mr Roberts to pay child maintenance to his ex-partner because he resides in Australia, anomalous and requiring urgent attention; if not, why not. (7) What steps has he taken to address the anomaly and when will it be removed. (1) The Child Support Agency (CSA) does not have the ability to determine the specific number of Australian parents who are in shared-care custody arrangements with ex-partners who are New Zealand citizens residing in New Zealand. It would be fair to say, however, that the number of these clients would be extremely small, as only 1.9% of all Australian CSA Collect cases are where the parents both provide equal care for one or more children of the relationship. It would be reasonable to assume that less than 10 cases would fall into this category. (2) Not known. The CSA does not separately record on any of its databases the range of incomes for New Zealand cases transmitted to Australia. (3) (a) The CSA does not record this information, however, less than 10 cases would fall into this category. (b) Nil. (4) I have responded in writing to a letter dated 17 June 2002 in response to these issues. A response to a letter dated 15 October is currently under preparation. (5) and (6) The Australian and New Zealand Child Support Schemes are similar but not identical. The determination of child support payable is undertaken by the country in which the parent caring for the child resides. Where parents are both caring for one or more children of the relationship, this produces a different outcome than would be the case if both parents lived in either Australia or New Zealand. An administrative remedy is available to parents where the assessment results in an unjust or inequitable outcome. Either parent can apply to the Australian Child Support Agency to increase or decrease the Australian child support assessment to take account of special circumstances. (7) The administrative remedy described in (5) and (6) above is already available to parents, therefore further steps are not necessary. Defence: Funding (Question No. 1070) Mr Wilkie asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 October 2002: (1) What is the current level of expenditure on defence in Australia expressed (a) as a proportion of gross domestic product and (b) in real dollar terms. (2) How many members are there in the (a) army, (b) navy and (c) airforce arms of the Australian Defence Force. (3) What are the major equipment expenditures due to be undertaken over the next decade and why is it necessary to undertake this expenditure. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:",102,Aciar
262,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) (a) and (b) The current level of expenditure on defence, based on the departmental appropriations and equity funding, excluding the capital use charge, is $14,270m. This equates to 1.9% of the gross domestic product. (2) This information is contained in Chapter Five People Matter of the 2001-2002 Defence Annual Report. (3) The largest Defence Capability Plan projects for which expenditure is planned over the next decade include: AIR 6000 Phases 1A and 1B, New Aerospace Combat Capability Acquisition. The estimated expenditure of Phase 1A is more than $6000 million and the estimated expenditure of Phase 1B is $4500-$6000 million. Another phase of AIR 6000 is planned beyond the decade. SEA 4000 Maritime Air Warfare Capability. Estimated expenditure is $3500-$4500 million. AIR 5077 Phase3 Airborne Early Warning And Control System. Planned expenditure $3,455 million. AIR 5402 Phase1 ADF Air Refuelling Capability. Estimated expenditure is $1500 million$2000 million. AIR 87 Phase2 Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters. Planned expenditure is $1,858 million. AIR 5276 PhaseR AP-3C Orion Replacement/Remanufacture. Estimated expenditure is in excess of $1500 million. AIR 5376 Phases 2.2 and 2.3 FA/18 Hornet Upgrade. Combined estimated expenditure for both sub-phases is $1,524 million. LAND 121 Phase3 Overlander – Field Vehicle Fleet Replacements. Estimated expenditure is in excess of $1500 million. The classified 10-year Defence Capability Plan was developed in conjunction with the Defence 2000 White Paper to provide the Defence Force with clear, long-term goals for the development of our armed forces and the funding needed to achieve those goals. The Defence 2000 White Paper provides the justification for the equipment expenditure outlined in the Defence Capability Plan. Defence 2000 emphasises the need for a professional, well-equipped force that is available for operations at short notice, and one that can be sustained on deployment over extended periods; and outlines capability goals for Defence’s land, air, maritime, strike and information capabilities. The Defence Capability Plan is reviewed and updated annually to take account of changes in Australia’s strategic circumstances, new technologies and changed priorities. The current review of the Defence Capability Plan is being informed by the 2002 Annual Strategic Review.

Parliament: Postage Entitlement (Question No. 1104) Mr Leo McLeay asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 12 November 2002: Are Members allowed to use their postage entitlement to circulate reply paid petitions outside their own electorate. ourable member’s question: In the absence of details of any particular case it is not possible to provide definitive advice. The Remuneration Tribunal provision in relation to the Communications Allowance is as follows: Remuneration Tribunal Determination 26 of 1998, Clause 10.3 states: ‘…a senator or member shall be entitled to use commercial services for the distribution of letters, newsletters and parcels and electronic services (including establishment and maintenance of web sites) at Commonwealth expense in relation to parliamentary or electorate (but not Party) business…’ The Remuneration Tribunal’s capacity to determine the postage entitlements of Parliamentarians for parliamentary and electorate business derives from s.7(1) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 which requires it to determine the allowances to be paid at official expense ‘…by reason of their membership of the Parliament or by reason of their holding particular offices, or performing particular functions in, or in relation to the Parliament or either House of the Parliament.’ The Tribunal in 1997 when asked what constitutes parliamentary and electorate business advised as follows: ‘The Tribunal considered the question of defining these concepts during the course of its annual review. It has decided, however, that it would be inappropriate (indeed improper) for it to define them to exclusion. Its position on this question essentially revolves around the due reticence which all in the executive arm of government must have that they do not impede the elected arm in the exercise of its function.’",105,Aciar
