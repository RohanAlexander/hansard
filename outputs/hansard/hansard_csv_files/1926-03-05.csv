The honourable member was informed, in reply to representations made hy him respecting the inadequacy of the passenger accommodation on the vessel with which tliis service is now being carried out, that, upon the entry into the island trade of a new vessel which the contractors were obtaining, it sliould be possible to place a more suitable vessel in the New Hebrides service. Upon expiry of the contract on the 31st'January last, the contractors stipulated that the subsidy for the trunk-line service to the New Hebrides bo increased from £.12,000 per annum to £22,000 per annum if a larger vessel were put on the run. The contract for the whole of the Pacific Island shipping services was renewed for a further period of six months, commencing on the 1st February last, to enable fuller consideration to he given to certain features of the services.

Already the various agricultural have been of great assistance in this way. The fact is often overlooked that many of the improvements in agricultural machinery originated in the brain of the practical farmer, whose crude ideas were later developed by scientists and made applicable to industry. tion campaign I was afforded the opportunity of inspecting the experimental plots under the control of Mr Saunders, of Karoonda, i u the South Australian mallee. mactical fanner, but he is also an enthusiast, and has made a hobby of experimentation. mallee are conducted under the supervision and direction of the Department of Agriculture of South Australia. WhatI saw on these plots was a revelation to me. very light rainfall he was obtaining wheat crops yielding upwards of 20 bushels to the acre. He was experimenting with at least a dozen varieties of wheat and fertilizers, and notwithstanding that the district was experiencing a very dry spell, the crops were as high as the fence, and were looking particularly well. bad patch amongst them. was a striking demonstration of the value of the application of science to primary production. in conjunction with the State Agricultural Department, is doing valuable work. He is experimenting with fodders and different grasses, and also with manures, to ascertain the amount required to give the best results. taking place over a series of years. Lucerne was planted at the time of plant[11.10] ing the crop, and also after the crop was taken off. The results were contrary to expectations, because the lucerne planted with the crop proved to be the better proposition. The planting of the two seeds at The farmer, I rethe one time will undoubtedly be a great saving. Mr Saunders is trying in that sandy country to grow subterranean So far as the comclover, couch grass, various rye grasses, and other fodders. It was interesting io me to find that he was experimenting The timehas gone by when with buffalo grass as a fodder. What impressed me was the fact that co-operation was necessary between the GovernThere must be ment and practical fanners. The man. in charge of the experiments had to be an enthusiast. It was a matter not of departments paying a man to do the job, but of getting a man who was prepared to work in the interests of his country, not for any monetary gain, but to enable his fellowAustralians to reap the advantage of his experiments. I admit that there is room for improvement in farming. It During my elecwould be ridiculous to say that we had reached the limit of thei possibilities of science as applied to farming. Some time ago I had the pleasure of listening to a very interesting address given by MrW . Mr Saunders is a successful S. Kelly, who was at one time chairman of the Advisory Board of Agriculture in South Australia. Mr Kelly is an enHis wheat tests in the thusiast whohas done an immense service to South Australia, and, incidentally, I may say that he has received scant courtesy and bad treatment from the present State Government. Mr Kelly is In white sandy coxmtry having a not an egotist; he is prepared to glean in formation from any source to further the progress of the countiy. He has studied agriculture very closely, not only here, but in the Old Country, and in the report of his address occurs the following statement by Dr. Richardson, respecting agricultural education in America: "" They hold the view that an efficient system Tbere was not one of agricultural education is an absolute necesThe place sity for national progress. They contend, too, that money spent on agricultural education and development is a wise national investment, which is repaid to the nation many times over Mr Saunders, in the form of increased material prosperity."" Mr Kelly's address continued: They back this opinion to the extent of investing £12,000,000 annually on agricultural education. They have magnificently equipped agriculThese experiments are tural colleges in every State. These colleges are of University standard. Four thousand county agents aet as local agricultural advisers and organizers for the farmers.",15,Pkatten
17,Mr Parsons (Angas),"The Canadian Federal Government disburses £1,000,000 per year to tlie States for agricultural work, This is in addition to the work carried on by the State Departments. There are over 4,000 Agricultural High Schools in USA. and Canada. Lord Lee, who was lately Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain, says, "" We are now spending eight times as much on agricultural education ivnd research as we did ljefore the war."" Denmark has increased the average yield per acre of crops by 24 per cent, during the last 20 years, and the average production per cow by 100 pet' cent, during the last 27 years. Sir Daniel Hall (Secretary Board of Agriculture) says, "" This .remarkable advance has been achieved deliberately by educational activity in the widest sense."" During .1920 the N.S.W. Government appointed a Select Committee to report on the agricultural industry and the methods of improving the same. A large amount of evidence was taken, much of it of a startling nature. I would particularly recommend a perusal of it to our members of Parliament. Something of a like nature must be done here to make the public understand bow we lag behind in this essential matter of agricultural education and research. We have passed quickly over the amount spent in otlier lands. Now let this Select Committee speak as to the value of some of this work. I quote from the final report issued 1923:-""It is not realized, except by a few, the extraordinary economic value of the organized work performed in connection with agriculture in other advanced countries. Mr Valder cited instances, viz. : The Department of Agriculture of TJ.S.A spent 250,000 dollars in establishing Durum wheat in that country. The Durum wheat now produced there is worth 50,000,000 dollars per year. They spent less than 200,000 dollars in selecting and introducing a suitable variety of rice, and in establishing it in California. The rice crop in that State is now worth 20,000,000 dollars per year. They spent 40,000 dollars on a selected variety of Egyptian cotton to suit the arid regions of the South-West; the crop therefrom is now worth another 20,000,000 dollars per year."" It is computed that the work of Dr. W . H . Saunders, the Canadian wheat breeder, is worth not less than £4,000,000 per year to the wheat-growers of that country. No more convincing figures can be quoted than those drawn up by Professor Richardson as to the relative production in Kansas and Victoria. After submitting a table comparing the production of the two countries, Professor Kichardson says: ""Here are two States alike in size, population, rainfall, and material resources. Both are cereal and dairying States. The climate of Western Kansas is even drier and more uncertain than that of North-Western Victoria. Yet Kansas produces approximately six times as much wheat, several hundred times more maize, five times as much oats, three times as much hay, and raises 1,500,000 acres of dry land crops, such as grain sorghums."" T h a t statement shows t h a t we have a long way to go along the road of science as applied to agriculture. north-western farmers have nothing to learn from the Kansas farmers so f a r as dry-farming is concerned. I thought our farmers were second to none in the world, but it is said that two heads are better than one, even if one is a sheep's head. There is always something to learn from the other fellow, even although he may be a failure. Does the honourable member say that we can of the British learn nothing from the Kansas farmers? can also learn something from ours, too. ' submit that we have a lob to learn from other countries. If we dispute that we are not likely to improve our methods of f a r m in g. MrK e l ly added that since Professor Richardson furnished his report upon his return from America, Victoria had developed her Agricultural Department remarkably. Mr Kelly in his very interesting pamphlet respecting the need for a Veterinary Institute, saysAnother great need is the establishment ol a Veterinary Institute. We simply cannot afford the great uncounted losses that are yearly taking place, particularly amongst our sheep. Our stock department are fully aware of the need for investigation of the causes of sheep diseases, but these officers are fully engaged in their present duties. Men should be set apart to study these matters. A laboratory is required where the work can be effectively done. A movement is already on foot amongst public minded men towards raising funds for this great need. The whole State would appreciate the munificence of any body of men who might make an institute available. But the onus lies on the State to see that this matter is not neglected. We simply cannot afford to be the only State that is practically doing nothing in reference to the study of sheep diseases. There are many other needs, but we can only afford to meet the most urgent. Mr Kelly's pamphlet continuesEvery student of breeding and feeding is convinced that we can raise the standard of our dairy herds to such an extent that would place the dairy industry on a very sound footing. A good deal has been done in a practical way to improve our grasses and grazing lands generally. On this point the pamphlet states1. Mr Leslie Cowan has been top-dressing subterranean clover land in the Mount Barker district for 12 or 14 years. The result is that he has magnificent fields of fodder that -are able to carry quite five times as much stock as formerly",16,Pkatten
18,Mr Stewart,"The ""Wimmera and",17,Pkatten
19,Mr Parsons,I stated earlier that,17,Pkatten
20,Mr Stewart,No ; but I say that they,17,Pkatten
21,Mr Parsons,"That is so, but I. 2. Messrs. Shepherd ond Shinkel, of Kybybolite, have also established clover. The result is hard to exaggerate. Land that was formerly of very poor feeding value is now heavily clothed with the nutritious fodder. The stock are improving by leaps and bounds. Tlie carrying capacity of the country has been raised quite as much as has been the case around Mount Barker. 3. The Yalkurie Pastoral Co. property, situate between the Coorong and Lake Alexandrina, is comprised partly oE land that was formerly covered wi.th Yalkurie reeds and other unedible bush. This is now being ploughed, and lucerne being established which almost rivals the wonderful Booborowie Flats. A little later Mr Kelly observes' I could have quoted other men almost equally as successful. But think of the thousands that are not developing their country. potentiality of this country is marvellous if it were fully developed in its grazing capacity. . . . . Test first, then carry the fact to the farmer in such a way that it will be taken up by all land owners living within adequate rainfall. Yes, the room for improvement is very great. In increased wheat yields, in improved pastures, and in the improvement of our live stock. Is it any wonder then, that many of us feel that one of the most essential needs of the day is a progressive agricultural policy ? My object iii referring to tbese developments in our wlieat, dairying, and driedfruits production is to emphasize that the Commonwealth help the primary Australia. send overseas for all that we require, and therefore place a duty on to stimulate we cannot continue struggle high cost of living has increased burdens tremendously. tion to the high cost of living in itself, for it is indicative of our high standard of living, and nobody admires high standard of living more than I do; but we must realize that primary tion needs encouragement as well as secondary production. wrong that there should be such a big difference between the price the consumer ducts, gets for them. ing, for I was engaged solely in primary production for two years.

I draw attention to the fact that the. Government benches are empty. The honourable member is distinctly out of order. quorum? member is in order in doing that. The the state of the committee. [Quorum formed.'} debted to the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) for causing honourable members to be in attendance to hear my remarks; but I have no desire to adopt the role of the previous member for Angas( Mr Gabb), who, I am told, was chiefly noted in this chamber, for calling for quorums should help the States to honourable member to resume his discusproducers to develop sion of the tariff. the unsatisfactory methods that are importations adopted in distributing our primary prolocal manufactures, so ducts to consumers, particularly in our allow our farmers to metropolitan areas. It is ridiculous that indefinitely their great half a dozen greengrocers and butchers, to make ends meet. The as well as milkmen, should serve customers their in the same street. That means altogether I have no objecunnecessary expense which must be added to the cost of the goods delivered. One bu teller, from whom I made inquiries on Australia's this point, told me that I d . per lb. was added to the price of meat to cover the produccost of delivery. I asked h i m why somucli as a penny need be added, and he told me It is regrettable and that the wages of the employees who deliver the meat are very high. I do not object to high wages for useful and necespays for our primary prosary work, but I do object to them for and the price the producer unnecessary and wasteful work. I feel I speak with feelsure that if a proper inquiry were made into the matter it would be possible to devise more economical methods of distribution, and yet not interfere with private enterprise, or even w it h the fads and should be given close attenfancies of the consuming public.

29,Just As We Cannot Afford To Mr Parsons,"I was referring toprimary prodiicers would get a better price for their products, and would sell more, because the purchasing power of the public would be increased. .Keverting for a moment to the question of the adoption of scientific methods in our primary and secondary industries I wish to say that I can see no reason why some of our manufactures should not be exported. Australian worsteds, for instance, are rapidly obtaining a good name overseas; and it should not be long before we build up a good export trade in this line. There is a class of person in both G-reat Britain and the United States of America who w ill pay any price for the best quality of goods. When Lord Burnham was in Australia he said it was necessary for us to cultivate, in Great Britain, a healthy imperial trading sentiment. I believe that i : we send the right quality of goods abroad we shall find a good market for them. A famous essayist once said that if a man produced a better article than any one else, though he buried his workshop in the forest, the world would make a beaten track to his door. It will be useless for us to think of building up an export trade in cotton tweeds, but seeing that some of the best wool produced in the world is grown here there should be no obstacle whatever to us manufacturing, at marketable prices,the be3t of Avoollen tweeds and worsteds. Not so long ago I was speaking to a life-long friend who is now the manager of the warehouse of a big woollen m ill . I questioned h i m about the duty on cotton tweeds. He said, "" So far as we are concerned we do not want it . We are busily engaged in producing good tweeds and high-class woollen goods. We do not consider that cotton tweed interferes with our business in auy way."" I asked him, "" Could you produce woollen trousering that would wear as well as cotton tweed?"" He replied, "" We could produce a pair of woollen trousers to retail at £3] but to sell them would be impossible. Eveni f we produced an article to sell at £ 3 retail it would not be equal -and I say it w i th experience behind me -to cotton tweed, engineers' twist, or nap. It would not wash without shrinking, and would be too ""Fot."" We have heard from the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), aud the honourable inember for Forrest( Mr Prowse), a great deal about free trade. I disagree with both of them. Free trade and protection as an issue in Australia is as dead as Julius Caesar. It was settled many years ago in an argument between the late Sir George Beid, Sir Edmund Barton, and Mr Deakin. I believe in protection, and every Australian should believe in it . The alternative to protection is to throw down all our tariff barriers. W h at would then become of our secondary industries, and even of our primary industries? Many thousands of persons would be thrown out of employment, and the effect on the country would be worse than the worse drought, and even more disastrous than our experience during the war, when we had a drought and the war. prosper ? question. We have to consider the stage we have reached in Australia. Free trade is beyond the region of practical politics. It would be all right if there were international free trade. If we returned to free trade our position would be the same as that of Great Britain, which, owing to free trade, is unable to compete with the rest of the world. She is, as it were, out in the cold, while others are working behind cosy, protecting barriers. The home market is the best market for our primary producers. The workers in our secondary industries are the most highly paid workers in the world. The market gardeners depend very largely upon them. AlthoughI believe in protecting secondary industries, I do not approve of prohibitive tariffs. The Parliaments of this country have decided that we shall have protective tariffs for the development of our secondary industries; but we must recognize au obligation also to our primary producers. If we raise the standard of living in f u r therance of our protective policy-and I do not complain about that being donewhen the primary producer asks for assistance we must, as true protectionists, grant it to him. If we raise millions of pounds by tariffs for the benefit of secondary industries, it is fair to say to the primary producer, when he asks for protection by bounties, "" Yes, that is the policy of the country."" If that is not done, the primary producer will be starved, and if Parliament will not do it , I , for one, must seriously",18,Pkatten
30,Mr Pbowse,Ho w does New Zealand,19,Pkatten
31,Mr Parson&,"That is not thereconsider my attitude .to tlie policy of protection for the secondary industries. In the long ru n protection for the second* ary industries, without corresponding assistance to the primary industries, will mean the r u in of the primary industries. dustries as nothing, and without industries, it would not . be what it.ought to be. The policy of the Commonwealth Parliament should be to apply a sound, comprehensive, protection policya policy of protection all round, for the primary as well'as the secondary producers. The primary producer w i ll not always be worrying the Government for help. In his out-back home he is too busy even to think of his own troubles. Just as persons go to a picture-show and forget their headaches, so. the primary producer who is busy forgets the troubles, worries, and the difficulties of life. I hope that I have made it clear that I am a protectionist, an all-round protectionist, but not a one-eyed protectionist. I do not want to protect one section of the community while neglecting another section. I commend to the Government my contention that the primary producer, under entitled to assistance in the form of bounties. All sections of the people of this country should work together for the good of the country. It seems to me, as a life-long student of politics-althoug h I do not say it dogmatically-that politicians are as much to blame as any one else. In Parliament there is too much party bantering, strife, and turmoil, which cause us sometimes to lose sight of the reason why we are here. We are here as a Parliament, not as parties, to advance the true interests of Australia. It is our first duty to govern this country, which is without doubt the brightest jewel in the crown of ""the British Empire, and we should take care that by our acts in this Parliament we advance its true in terests, as well as those of the Empire as a whole. My first complaint is of the delay that has taken place in submitting this tarilf schedule for the consideration of Parliament. Never before in the history of this Parliament has taxation been collected and so much time been allowed to elapse before Parliament has been given an opportunity of considering the Government's proposals. The Government may have had reasons for delaying parliamentary consideration of the schedule, but I am not aware of them. The proWithout primary incedure has been most unusual. It is this country would be necessary to emphasize the fact that the secondary right to impose Customs duties does not rest w i th governments. Parliament is the final arbiter. When duties have been imposed they should be considered by Parliament at .the earliest possible moment. These duties have been collected for many months, and to-day industries that are not included in the schedule are languishing. to restore law and order. to be more important than the national policy of protection. To-day no one ia satisfied. The Minister is much like the owner of the donkey who, after many struggles w it h that animal, emerged from the conflict without satisfying any one. From Western Australia we have heard complaints about industries being injure d by duties, and from elsewhere we have a system of protection, is' heard complaints about want of duties. I have supported the policy of protection from my infancy, but this schedule fails to satisfy me because it does not protect the secondary industries. The industries protected under it can be viewed from the Post Office towers of every capital city, and from nowhere else. An industry beyond that range of vision receives no consideration, no matter how many thousands of people it may employ. I have noobjection to protecting every industry in this country, whether primary or secondary. While I do not object to any industry receiving its share of protection, I protest against the liquor trade being singled out for special preference, while other industries employing thousands of work people are neglected. I wish to see the manufacture of Australian whisky encouraged, but it is unfai r to single out one trade for special treatment. I shall now deal w it h my honourable friends from Western Australia. in the corner. I thought that the last free trader in Australia was politically",19,Pkatten

36,Mr Watkins,"I refer to the triodead, but tbere are two or three who remain with us like hardy annuals. While I admit that Western Australia is handicapped by the long length of our coast line and the cost of freight from the Eastern States, there is nothing to prevent secondary industries from being established in that State. I know of one industry that is about to be established there. The :advocates of free trade in Western Australia prefer to place their orders outside this country, even when the Australian -tenderers quote a price as favorable as that "" of the foreign tenderer. Australian Government called for tenders for railway wheels and axles. A firm on the east coast submitted a tender at Is. a pair of wheels and axles over the foreign price. The Western Australian Government placed the order overseas because of that one-hundredth part of 1 percent, difference in price, and yet the freefrom a local workshop, a new part of a traders say that they are willing to give secondary industries a reasonable chance. They have had something to say about the cost of Australian railway rails. They should remember that, during the war period, when the transcontinental railway was under construction, it would have been impossible to complete the line had we not been making steel rails in Australia. Rails were supplied for that railway at less than half the world's price at the time. Now, although, in common with other industries, this industry has cut prices to bedbetween Federal and State rights. The rock to keep the business in Australia, orders for hundreds of miles of steel rails have been sent overseas owing to a lack of adequate protection. Looking to the history of the past I challenge any one to point to any country which has attained to a high degree of civilization that is not a producer of iron and steel. We are in the iron age, and the sooner we realize it the better. Most of the means adopted for the development of this vast continent depend upon the basic industry for the production of iron and steel, and the sooner that is realized the better it will be for the people of Australia. WhilstI admit the difficulties of the farmer, let me tell him, through his representatives in tliis chamber, that he is much safer in the hands of the Australian manufacturer than he would be in the hands of any foreigu manufacturer. Those who desire that the farmer should use imported machinery ""contend that, under the system of protection, the price of the local article is raised to that of the imported machine, plu3 the duty. I do not admit that, but even if it were so it is quite unreasonable to reckon the increased price of the local article attributed to the duty as having to be paid by the farmer out of the first year's life of the local machine he uses. No one will contend that a reaper, or binder, or other agricultural machine lasts only for one year. If it has a life of five or ten years Some time ago the Western is it not fair that the increase of price in the local machine, attributed to the duty on such a machine, should bo spread over the life of the implement? If a farmer happens to break one of the parts of an imported machine he cannot get a new part from America, or any foreign country as readily as he could obtain, locally-manufactured machine. Farmers and other primary producers should recognize that it is the secondary industries, through the people to whom they give employment, that provide the best markets for those engaged in primary production. This country is too rich in resources, and too bountiful for the operation of any tariff to retard its development. Where its progress is retarded we must look to other causes.

I know something of fanning, and I candidly admit that I could not make a success on a holding under such conditions. settlement of returned soldiers has. up to date, shown a loss of £20,000,000. The Commonwealth Government has already contributed its share of £10,000,000 to that loss, and it will have to contribute a great' deal more. There has been an influx of people into the capital cities of Australia. We want our cities to grow, but not at the expense of the country. The overcrowded capital cities contain over half the population of the Commonwealth. This is ' a grave reflection on the various governments of Australia, which for years past have made no attempt to encourage decentralization. On the contrary, they have encouraged people to desert the country for the city. lor remarked some little time ago in Several States have signed this chamber that if primary industries had been given the same encouragement as secondary industries, Australia's position would be vastly better than it is. It must be expected that the young people in the country will seek the city, for the rates of pay, recreation, and every element of social life is better here than in the country. It is most regrettable that the sons of farmers, who have such a capital stock of experience to carry It does. I refer the on our primary industries, are, in many cases, migrating to the city when they I claim to know reach the age of 20 or 22 years. They should be given every possible encouragement to remain on the land. We should be showing far more sense if we -assisted them to stay on the land than we are showing by encouraging what maybe termed raw new chums to take up agricultural pursxiits. This Government, however, has done a great deal to foster rural development. In the first place,-it has established a rurals credits branch of the Commonwealth Bank, which I trust will have the effect of reducing the rate.of interest on money loaned to primary proThat applies geneducers. A t . present the rate varies from 6f to 8^ per cent., but it ought to be no higher than per cent. If reasonable advances were available to enable farmers' sous to establish themselves on the land, the d r if t to the city would be stemmed to some degree. Private financial institutions will not lend money except on gilt-edged security. I speak from considerable experience of their methods, The for, whatever may be my position now, I -have, in the past, been very heavily in debt. I know how reluctant the private financial institutions are . to help a man i u those circumstances. Without assistance it is almost impossible for even an ambitious young man of limited means to take up farming, for he is involved at the outset in an expense of £2,000 for land, and I suppose that his implements, house, and other necessaries would cost him not less than £3,000. He would need not less than £3,000 at his back; and if he has £6,000, so much the better. Interest on £3,000 at 7 per cent, per annum is a heavy burden on a man just making a start on the land.

The Government proposes to refer the whole matter to the board immediately for an exhaustive inquiry and report with a view to the consideration of such measures Q3 will place the industry in a more satisfactory position. Last year we imported about £3,000,000 worth of leaf. Importations could be very greatly reduced under a proper system of encouragement by the Government. A reward should be offered for a remedy for blue mould. In addition to the inquiry being made by the Tariff Board, import duties, if necessary,' should be imposed, and excise duties reduced. By such, means this industry would be extended to supply the whole of Australia's requirements. made by members of the Opposition that Australia can manufacture goods of a satisfactory quality. If . the people of this country would smoke only Waratah tobacco or other tobacco' of Australian manufacture they would render a great service to the tobacco-growing industry iu this country. inember smoke it? enough for me it should be good enough for the honourable member. This is an industry in which a family can make a living on ten acres of land. We have large areas of some of the most suitable land i u the world for tobacco culture employed only for fattening cattle. If the services of trained experts were available, .and if the Government would take steps to settle people on land where there is a reasonable prospect of success the industry could be greatly extended. The £3,000,000 worth of tobacco leaf that we buy annually from America we could grow equally well ourselves, with a little scientific teaching and the encouragement which I am pleased to say the Minister for Trade and Customs has promised. During the last three years £1,750,000 has been advanced by the Commonwealth for main road construction. This is a comparatively small amount in view of the work to be undertaken, but its expenditure has proved very beneficial. I can speak on this subject with the experience of one who .has been a member of a municipal council for twenty years. The Government has been requested on every hand to its intention to bring down a b i l to pro-1 vide for an advance of £20,000,000 to cover a continuous roads construction policy over a period of ten years. W it h the advent of the motor vehicle good roads have become more important than railways for the opening up and development of the country. Objection is sometimes taken to a motor, tax, but motorists have said to me, ""Give us good roads which w ill prevent the wrecking of our cars, and we shall not mind paying a substantially increased tax."" The same thing will be said by any man who has a knowledge of the difference between good and bad roads for motor traffic. If the policy I agree with statements announced by the Government is given effect, municipalities throughout the Commonwealth will be able to adopt a co-ordinated programme of work, and road-making contractors, instead of looking for a job here and there, with all the difficulty of securing good men for temporary jobs, will be able, under a continuous policy, to secure contracts for twelve months which will enable them to the honourable obtain the services of the best men for their work, and we shall, no doubt, have roads constructed very much more cheaply than has been possible under the policy of spending money on this most important work in dribs and drabs. I have referred to these matters to convince persons outside who will read this debate that, during the past three years, the Pederal Government has assisted the primary producers to a very large extent. Bv all accounts it is its intention to assist them even to a greater extent in the future. In opposition to the argument of the honourable member for Perth( Mr. Mann') and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory)., I have endeavoured to show that the primary industries of the Commonwealth have received a very substantial instalment of protection. Good roads, assistance in the opening up of markets, and bounties on unpayable exports is the assistance needed for primary industries. If such assistance is not true protection, I fail to understand the meaning of the word. The production of the agricultural industry represents 90 per cent, of the wealth produced",26,Pkatten
54,Mr Fenton,Does,28,Pkatten
55,Mr Cook,"Yes, and as it is goodi u Australia. This is therefore a national industry, and each and every individual in the community should contribute to its upkeep. ""WhilstI should like to see the greatest protection possible for our secondary industries, I do not forget that the surplus products of our primary industries must compete in the world's markets produced in other countries by all kinds of coloured and sweated labour. Those concerned in the secondary industries are in an position than the primary producers. The workers have the protection of arbitration court and wages board awards, and enjoy equal, if nbt better, industrial conditions than are enjoyed by the workers of any other part of the world. The number of artisans employed iu our' secondary industries is, roughly, 500.000. The manufacturers have to pay these workers, but they are in the fortunate, position of being able to pass that payment on to the consumers of the articles they manufacture. Only4 per cent, of our manufactures were exported last year, and the export markets are not at present profitable for the productions of our secondary industries. They, however, enjoy the benefit of Australia's trade, and are in a position to put a price on their manufactures which it is impossible for our primary producers to put on the products of their industries which are exported. I agree with moderate members of the committee that the very gravest consideration needs to be given to the tendency to continually increase duties imposed by our tariff. -South Wales the Government at present in power has reduced the hours of labour by four per week. This reduction may become general throughout the Commonwealth, and, if it does, it appears to me that our output must be reduced. should be clear that our manufacturers must suffer from the reduction of the hours of labour, and if they do we shall have them coming along for an increase in the duties imposed by the tariff for their protection. The settlement of the matter is largely in the hands of the manufacturers and the TradesH a l l Councils of Australia. able member suggest should be done? question. I noticed that yesterday, in Melbourne, Mr Deputy President Webb was engaged in the settlement of a dispute which reflected very great credit on the parties to it . W it h the display of a little more of the spirit that characterized the parties to that dispute, we would have much greater efficiency. My answer to the honourable memberis that a more friendly spirit between employer and emagainst similar products ployee should be cultivated.' WhilstI am prepared to give to the worker the last ounce of protection we can possibly afford to give him, and to encourage to infinitely better the fullest extent our secondary industries, which must work hand in hand with our primary industries, I want both in return to give a fair deal to the consuming public. They can do so, but not by reducing the hours of the worker or by increases in the duties imposed by the tariff and in the prices charged to consumers. W h a t we really want is a thorough investigation of the conditions of industries by a scientific body representative of all parties and independent of political considerations. An investigation by such a body would be far more effective than any which can be conducted by the Tariff Board.

The conditions of the timber industry in other countries are so different from ours that it is imperative, if we are to keep up our standards-and I want to see them kept up-that we should give greater consideration to the Australian timber industry. The hardwood timbers of Victoria differ, to some extent, from those of New South Wales, and the Ne.w South Wales timbers differ from those of Queensland. Queensland the royalty amounts to about 7s. to los. per 100 super, feet. In the circumstances, before deciding what increase in tbe timber duties is necessary, an investigation requires to be made into the circumstances in each State. Victoria the royalties are very much lower than in Queensland, and, speaking generally, the hardwoods are inferior to those of New South Wales and Queensland. I do not suppose that 33 per cent, of our hardwoods are up to the quality of the New South Wales hardwoods, which grow more slowly and take longer to mature. We, of course, have timbers in Victoria that are equal to any to be found in any other part of the world. If the consideration of adequate timber duties is carefully undertaken by men with a f u l l knowledge of the subject, there should be no great difficulty in deciding upon duties which will be in keeping with the requirements of the Australian timber industry. vernment raises the royalties, on timber every time this Parliament increases the timber duties. duties to be imposed on timber require very careful investigation, and I claim that the industry in Victoria, any rate, is entitled to a reasonable increase in the duties. member for Adelaide said that the poultry and pig-raising industries were in a flourishing condition.

Honourable members opposite who have had a good deal of experience of arbitration work will realize the desirability of having on the Tariff Board one member with legal experience, so that, if foT nothing else, he may ask questions which bring out both sides of the case. I take it that at present this is not done, and that the curtness about which the honourable member for Perth made . was probably due to the fact that the members of the board are not trained lawyers, are not accustomed to asking questions so as to elicit the merits of both sides of the case, and probably put their questions in a way that was not acceptable to one side. I make that suggestion, and I leave the matter. Returning to the question of protection, I believe in a form of protection, and I believe in preferential treatment to the Homeland. The aim of protection has been described as "" the greatest possible diversification of home products,"" aud it has been said, and rightly so, that "" if the productive energy of a nation has but a few outlets as in exploiting natural advantages, there is a great danger that the nation's economic life may become stagnant. diversified, even by an artificial process -and I suppose we shall agree that protection is an artificial process-it is much easier to keep the current of protective energy in motion, allowing it to be turned in whatever direction new advantages may open up."""" I call attention to these words, "" the greatest possible diversification of home products,""'' and I qualify that by saying, in conformity with common sense,and with the real benefit of the . nation, which things, I presume, are intended. It will be interesting to lionorable members to know not only Parliament is thinking of the tariff, but also what is being said of it by people outside, and particularly by the university professor. ber of the Australian Economic Record, published in November last year, contains au article on the present tariff. may be honourable members here who do not think that the opinion of a university professor on such a matter is of much weight, but I dissent from that view, because his orjiniou may be of some assistance to us in making up our minds on the tariff. Of course, it will be generally known to honourable members that the university professor, for a great number of years, has tended towards the free trade school. One may almost go so far as to say that from the very beginning he has a free trade bias. men are tories.. honourable member had been educated at a university, as I had the good fortune to be, he would know that there are to be found very radical men at the universities, and even at the most conservative of them. Often wisdom comes with increasing years, but during the period of university training there are a great many men, even in the biggest and oldest English universities, who have radical leanings. *This article on the tariff is by Mr J. B. Brigden, Professor of Economics at the Hobart University. He is quite unknown to me. I found his article interesting, and I propose to read a few quotations from it, to give honourable members an idea of the conclusion arrived at by him. HeI f , however, protection be begins by saying that the general feeling of economists has usually been, in favour of free trade, and he ends by admitting that there is a distinct trend at present amongst professors in the opposite direction. I shall give one of his conclusions, with which I do not think that the honourable member for East Sydney will greatly disagree. He saysThe economy of regulation or of no regulation, it must he repeated, is never determined by generalizations, but is relative to particular circumstances. The economy of protection or free trade is relative to three very important what circumstances-to the growth of population, to' diminishing returns (a smaller return per unit invested), especially from land, and to the effects upon the equation of international demand. The criterion by whicli it must bo The first numjudged is that of general welfare, whicli can most simply be described as the standard of living in a community. There He. then saysFrom this point of view, it appears that protection has been as beneficial to Australia as free trade has been to Great Britain.

In fact, he says so in another part of his article, which I shall read later. I have heard a great deal of argument in this chamber, on the one hand, that, because Great Britain has free trade, we should follow her, and, on the other hand, that because America, has protection, we should follow her. professor takes a different, line of argument when he says that the circumstances of each case should govern the country concerned. cede that, in every circumstance and in every country, free trade or protection is necessarily' right. much used by honourable members as an argument for prohibition in Australia. Professor Brigden contends that that is no argument at all so f a r as Australia is concerned. He returns to his view that we should consider the particular circumstances of each and every country. He saysBut what of the United States of America? Tariff policy has there been'a bone of contention since its early history, and it is associated with the Declaration of Independence. In the eighteenth century, Alexander Hamilton, and others before liim, propounded the doctrine of protection to "" infant industries."" But, as a real factor in the national economy, the tariff dates from the Civil War, and from the necessities of the Federal Government. As in our own Federation, the need of revenue determined the policy of customs taxation. During and after the Civil War, manufacturing interests expanded, and established the tariff as intentionally a protective instrument. But the tremendous growth of fanning in the Wes' tern States developed after that tariff policy was established,, and manufactures were in no sense necessary to employ population. Tliere is every reason to suppose that the maiu body of manufacturing industry would, although less rapidly, have expanded in the United States of America without and that with its extraordinary natural resources, ary 2>roduction were natural. ' Both were subject to increasing returns. home market of great size aud prosperity offered itself to the possibilities of manufacturing production. Extraordinary natural advantages were possessed to balance the initial disadvantages of ' technique and marketing, without requiring the payment of lower wages. It is more than probable that to the main body of the United States of America .manufactures protection has W h e n he been irrelevant. The United States of America owes much to its "" Yankee ingenuity,"" especially in the mass production of machinery, 'but it owes more to its natural endowments, with which no community could fail to prosper. Australia has no such degree of advantage conferred by nature. Beyond the partially developed coastal fringe, we have neither the magnificent river .systems, nor the rainfall, nor the accessible minerals.. He ends this portion of the article by saying. There is therefore no analogy to be drawn cither from Britisli or American experience,' and Australians .niiiist think out their tariff The problem for themselves. MrE . BILEY -S o far as minerals are concerned. He is not prepared to contralians hope, and most of them believe, that there are in this country great untapped sources of mineral wealth. CerAmerica has been tainly those that have been tapped have, to a great extent, lost their productivity . Many of them have closed down, and we now await the discovery of others. The professor is talking not of possibilities or probabilities, but of facts, and I think that if the honourable member w ill test the professors facts, he w ill find that they are not f a r from the truth. The first point is this, that the standard of l i v i ng has been kept up as well by protection in Australia as by free trade in England. The circumstances of a country and not theoretical considerations should determine its fiscal policy. He also saysThere is . . . . no escape from the fact that the tariff involves a cost which, in the absence of the strictest care,, is likely to be greater than necessary. He adds One of the unnecessary costs is over-protection. On page 44 he saysProtection's unavoidable costs have been those of over-protection and the shelter of inefficiency. a tariff, That view is sound on both points, I believe. On page 45 he saysboth primary and secondThe question of how far particular industries, A growing supported by bounties or Customs duties, are economical for Australia, is another problem,",32,Pkatten

Nothing can justify an unnecessary burden of Customs taxation or unnecessarily high local costs. Nothing can justify the creation of permanent properly in protected interests, similar to property in land. I am sorry that the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) is not present, for I should like to commend . the next sentence to h i m particularly. follows:Nothing can justify the unmitigated operalion of either free trade or protection, sans phrase. That is without qualification, and that one sentence appears to me to be a sufficient answer to the statement of the honourable member that there was no sound or consistent course, except absolute free trade or prohibitive protection. I wish to be f a i r to the honourable member. believe that he is an absolute free trader in theory and in practice. Brigden goes on as follows:Our duty is to face the details in the same spirit as a business manager, who incurs one cost to avoid a larger one, but who bends his energies to the fullest economy and imposes upon that oust a resolute and unremitting censorship. We expect this unremitted censorship to be exercised by the Tariff Boardi n the first case, but even after it has carefully considered the matters submitted to it and made its recommendations to the Government, I consider it to be the distinct and definite duty of the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs to tell us all the facts, and of. honourable members to give their earnest consideration to the 'consideration of them, so that any wrong item in the schedule may be corrected. A t the very least, we should hear the Minister before we determine to oppose any particular item. upon us to say whether the recommendations of the T a r i ff Board are sound or not. There is the possibility that they may make a mistake. I trust that we shall all exevcise the duty that rests upon us. Apart altogether from my being a moderate protectionist, I agree w i th a good deal that Mr Lloyd George said in the House of Commons on tbe 16th of February, 1925. The following are his exact words:Once you adopt one system , whether it is 1 protectionist or free trade, industry adapts itself to that particular system. If it is a protectionist system, and it has been in a country Afr. Duncan-Hityhes. for 50 years, you cannot change it without a. complete dislocation of the whole of the industry in that particular country. The industries that fit into tariffs, the industries that build on tariffs, they arc the industries that prosper. It is equally the case with free trade. For 75years the industries have adapted themselvesto free trade conditions. Some honourable members may think that that begs the question; but, in my opinion, it is a sound statement of the It is as case. It would be foolish for a country that had been under a system of protection for 25 years to, in one act, change to a system of free trade, and it would be just as foolish for a country that had been under free trade for 75 years, and whose whole business practice had been developed under that policy to change, in a day, to a system of protection. Such conduct would dislocate the whole social aud economic structure of the -country. I Professor lived in GreatB rita in all his l if e, and he does not understand Australian conditions. lionorable member for East Sydney preGeorge is wrong? Would he, in a day, abandon our whole system ofheavy prolection, or would he expect a country that had developed for many years under a. system of free trade to become highly prostated the case concisely and clearly. In dealing with a matter like this, one should, give consideration to the whole of the surrounding facts. Of course, one's judgment in dealing with such a matter would depend upon his view of the object of a tariff. If he were of the opinion that its object was to protect industries u n t i l they were able to fend for themselves, The responsibility rests his view would be different from that of a man who considered that industries should be permanently protected. U n fortunately, the tendency in many of our industries is to seek higher protection as the years go by, rather than to try to get on without any duties.

I referred on that occasion to a copper mine thab had been closed, and there are many other mines which have been similarly closed, because their working expenses, including not only Arbitration Court wages, but also the cost of supplies, particularly of coal, made it impossible for them to be worked at a profit. If we force out of existence a number of industries which supply a great many persons with work, because they cannot comply with the legal And why not? conditions prescribed by this Parliament, directly or through Arbitration Coiirts, Of course, to what extent are we justified in keeping alive secondary industries by the constant increase of the tariff ? Surely the principle, if we want to be fair, ought to be made to apply both ways. If a primary industry is to be forced out of existence, is it justifiable to foster a secondary industry by constantly increasing the tariff? Tbere is only one answer to that, and it is that certainly we must keep the secondary industry alive if it is vital to the country, if it is essential to our well-being, and if it is, in fact, the more important; of tbe two ,: but otherwise I cannot see that constant increases i u the tariff, amounting eventually to prohibition, are justifiable unless we do at least something for the primary industries. In saying that, I . am not suggesting that we should give unlimited bounties to the primary industries. I shall say something on that subject later. Itmay be said, with perfect fairness, that In my opinion, that is not a the large manufacturer cannot help himself, that we are putting him in an impossible position, that he is employing large numbers of workmen, that he is running his business as well as possible, and that it is simply the high co3t of wages prescribed under awards that make is better for a man to have ir essential for him to come to the Governa loaf than to go huugry. ment ancl ask. for increased duties.

I u answer for Perth( Mr Mann), who asked, "" W h e r e would you stop?"" my view, which is held by many, people in Australia, and by large numbers in my State, is that the 1921 tariff, when it was passed, was generally regarded as being high enough for the present. We must have some line of cleavage, and I suggest that we should regard that tariff as fixed, and review with great care any proposals for increasing or reducing it . The comparisons that I made between the original tariff and the present tariff show a sufficiently rapid increase to justify one in saying that any further considerable, increase should be very carefully scrutinized not only by the Tariff Board, but also by the Parliament. The Minister turned, rather hastily I thought, on Western Australia, which,' we all know, has suffered great 'drawbacks under federation. I must state, in fairness to Western Australia, and in justice, also, to mv own State,that I believe the feeling in that State is that the last tariff was quite high enough, and that further increases ought to be substantially justified. Some of the items of the schedule are so petty, so small, and so unnecessary as to be hardly worth criticizing. anv honourable member suggest that it is necessary to Australia's salvation to protect the manufacture of artificial flowers here 1 ficial flowers is being increased 35 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent., British preferential, intermediate, and general respectively. suppose that, in the first place, artificial flowers were a luxury, but they are now so generally used that they have become almost a necessity to most women. But I cannot for the life of me see that there is anv value to Australia in having an artificial flower manufactory, or that we should increase the price of artificial flowers to all the women in the land in order to have one or two factories manufacturing them ployment for women. the honourable member can. inform me how manv artificial flower factories there are in Australia. Several years ago I was told, and the statement stuck in my mind, that there was only one. I hope that, when we come to consider this item, to the honourable member the Minister will supply this information. The manufacture of artificial flowers cannot in any way be regarded as essential to the future development of Australia. It is notnecessary that we should impose a tariff ranging from 35 to 45 per. cent, to protect that industry unless, indeed, this duty is not a protective, but a revenue duty. If it is meant to be a revenue duty, the surplus which the Treasurer has been showing on his customs receipts for the last year or two does not justify any increase. In addition to telling lis how many manufactories of artificial flowers there are in Australia, perhaps the M in ister will also inform us how many employees there are in the industry. There will be an opportunity later to discuss the various items in the schedule. I am not speaking either as a free trader or as a prohibitionist, but if I see anomalies in the tariff schedule, I feel justified in acquainting the committee so that they may be dealt with. Another matter to which I wish to direct attention is the increased duty on children's toys. In the original tariff of 1901 children's toys were .dutiable at 20 per cent. Under this schedule toys are listed ad valorem 30 per Can cent. British, 50 per cent, intermediate, and 60 per cent, general tariff.

89,' Motion (By Mr Bruce) Proposed,"direct the attention of the Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse) to the following paragraph which appeared in this morning's Melbourne AgeAdelaide, Thursday -About 108 members of the 43rd Battalion in camp at Seacliff to-day left camp and came to the city for meals, declaring that the food supplied at the camp was poor and insufficient. The trouble has been simmering since they had the first meal. When they lined up for the midday meal to-day one said they found the food consisted of a piece of mutton the size of a cotton reel and enough potato to fill a spoon. They went to the eompany commander, who tried in vain to get them an adequate supply. They then held a meeting and decided to come to town for tea. They intend to .return to-night. This clearly indicates that something is wrong at that camp. It is no new complaint. I speak from personal experience. In war time, many complaints were made against the quality of the food supplied to the men and invariably little notice was taken of them. On one occasion I was bold enough to speak on behalf of the men at Maribyrnong about a shortage of vegetables. the camp knew a thing or two. He paraded the men, asked all those who supported my complaint to step out from the ranks. Only one man stood out, and I am proud to think that he was a South Australian. A day or two later vegetables appeared in the daily rations, and when the men asked what had happened, my friend reminded them that while they were glad to get the vegetables they were not game enough to support me when I made a complaint. I know what happens in these camps. commanding officers exert their authority pretty solidly. There is something more than the smoke which presages fire in this complaint from Seacliff camp. hope the Minister will order an inquiry and, if necessary deal with the responsible officers as severely as the men would be dealt with if they had is talking out of his turn. He should wait made a complainton active service. u n t i l I have concluded my quotation.

If any Government dared to do such a thing, it would be hurled from office."" It was then urged that the measure would be used only when a necessity for its use arose. I went lengthily into the evidence given before the Navigation Commission, and quoted a long letter by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes), when he was Prime Minister, in which he said that he would not alter the Navigation Act at the behest of Tasmanians, to meet the requirements of a "" fastidious few.""

94,Mr Yates,"-The honourable inemberThe first overseas steamer to leave Hobart after the suspension of tlie act will be the Otranto, whicli will arrive at Hobart to-day from Sydney, and sail to-morrow for Melbourne. The Otranto, so far as is known by the Melbourne agents, will not carry any interstate passengers on this trip, There are no interstate passengers on the Otranto. members opposite to say about it ? It is not a question of the apple trade. Oversea boats have carried apples from Tasmania without any suspension of the eoa.stal provisions of the Navigation Act, and they could continue to do so. It is clear now that the purpose of the bill recently'passed i'-i to undermine the industry carried on by the steam-ship owners of Australia. The Government is building up the business of the foreign trader, and is permitting black labour to be used in our coastal trade. The Argus paragraph continuesthough any Victorians returning to Melbourne may travel by the steamer, and it is possible that there will he some last-minute bookings from Hobart. .After the Otranto. a regular weekly service of mail steamers will be run to Hobart on the way from Sydney to Melbourne for the duration of the fruit export season. Some years ago, when overseas vessels were permitted to carry interstate passengers, the ""apple trip to Hobart was a popular holi11 day, but since the ban, only vessels of the Australian Commonwealth Line have entered for this tripThat statement is wrongwhich still attracts a number of people each year. Melbourne shipping agents allccted are unwilling to venture an opinion, but it is considered probable that the suspension of this clause of the Navigation Aet will lead to the ""apple trip "" gaining an increased popularity. I have not the slightest doubt about that. My point is that the bill was passed on the strength of quite a different statement as to what was intended and what would happen. The honourable member for Fawkner stressed the wording of the principal clause of the bill, whicli readsWhere it is shown to the satisfaction of the enjoyed by those engaged in the AustraGovernor-General that the tourist traffic between any ports of the Commonwealth, or in the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth., is being injured or retarded, and the Governor General is satisfied that it is desirable that unlicensed ships he allowed to engage in the trade, he may, by notice published in the Gazette, grant permission to unlicensed British ships of sueh sizes and speed as are specified in the notice, to engage in the carriage of passengers between those ports, subject were proved guilty of conspiracy in an to such conditions, if anj\ ancl for such period as is set out in the notice. Mr Yiites. It is clear from that that the Government would require to be satisfied that the tourist trade was retarded or injured before a notice suspending the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act would be published in the Gazette. I should like to know how the Now. what have honourable Government obtained the information upon which the notice referred to in the Argus was gazetted. I suggest that the circumstances at present are only just those which were revealed during the investigation of the matter by the Navigation. Commission, and that the requirements of tourists to Tasmania are more than met by the ships supplied by the steam-ship owners of the Commonwealth. Immediately upon notice of assent to it , the Government has put the new act into operation; and if it had been able to do so, it would have issued the necessary notice within 24 hours after the bill was passed. We had the same specious argument put forward by the same specious gentleman when the CrimesB ill was under consideration. He said that it would not be put into operation u n t i l it was essential and necessary that a declaration of a state of industrial disturbance should be made. I suggest that when such a declaration is required by the persons who are the power behind the throne in the case of the present Government, such a declaration w ill be issued, and what was said here during the passing of the measure will be proved up to the hilt. We contended that the desire of the Government in passing the Navigation B ill was to introduce black labour into the coastal trade and to undermine theconditions of Australian seamen. There is no justification for the notice which has just been published, but its publication was required by the "" f as t i d i o u s "" few, as Mr Hughes called them, and with the object of breaking down the conditions lian shipping industry. I have been challenged as the member for Melbourne to have, the courage to bring under the notice of the House certain facts in connection with a case which was recently tried in this city.

An article on the matter appeared in Truth, and I amglad that some newspaper had the courage to publish such an artiele. members to read it . The man who was victimized by the convicted police seems to have been picked out by certain other members of the Victorian Police Force for persecution. this community knows more than I do of the Victorian police as a body. I have found that, in the main, they are a straightforward and honourable lot of men, and are exposed admittedly to many temptations. there are in the force some of the vilest scoundrelsthat Melbournehas produced. If a man is to be persecuted and prosecuted as this man has been, because he exposed some of these scoundrels, and the State authorities are -unwilling to prevent them getting away with their loot on their release from imprisonment, I want to find out whether the Commonwealth Government is strong enough to see justice done in this case. If not, as the numbers of the notes which were paid to the scoundrelsengaged in the conspiracy are known, I shall find out later if they are cashed by the Commonwealth Bank. wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) a statement made on Thursday night last at Bombala, during the Eden-Monaro election campaign, by the Deputy Leader of the Government ( D r .

I wish to tutional session would be held and that the States would be invited to attend a conference for the purpose of reconsidering the financial relationsbetween the Commonwealth and tbe States. There was a great deal of insincerity in the speech made by the Treasurer at BombalaI ask honourable last night. For the last four years he has been Deputy Leader of the Government, and half the members of the Ministry belong to his party, yet he has not opened his mouth in. this Chamber on Probably no man in behalf of the new States movement. During the last Federal elections he went into the Capricornia electorate, and when Mr. P. Isbjel, ,a Nationalist 'organizer, arranged adeputation to him, he expatiated on the virtues of the new States movement, and hoped that the Queensland I "" know, however, that New States League would keep its powder dry. He saidI pay a tribute to the consideration always given, to new State matters by Sonator Thompson while in Melbourne. They had weekly meetings there and kept very much alive with matters concerning the movement. I regret, however, that we were never able to get a member of the Labour party along to those meetings, not even tlie member for Capricornia, who seemed' to always leave the little he intended doing for the movement until he got back to Ms electorate. Evidently the Treasurer leaves what he intends doing for the movement unti l the eve of an ejection campaign such as that in Eden-Monaro. We have had no evidence in this chamber that he is whole-heartedly behind it . Many of us would like to see the Constitution amended to make provision for self-government in areas like northern New South Wales and central Queensland, but we do not believe in multiplying the number of sovereign States with afl the powers of existing States', and upper houses, and' similarexpensive institutions, which are quite superfluous, and could very well "" be' done without. The Treasurer has striven to make a great an elodeal of political capital out of the now State movement, and in an area where he thinks the people are anxious to have a States. new State he says that certain things must be done. But what has he done to bring about tbe creation, of new States? And what does the Prime Minister intend I should like to to' do in the matter?

That remark could very well be applied to the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), who endeavours to blame the Labour party for nob joining the New States Committee which meets at Parliament House. intention of creating new States, when does it intend holding the special constitutional session at which honourable, members can put forward their views regarding amendments they may think necessary to remodel the Constitution, and give autonomous powers to subordinate legislatures? Honourable members opposite differ from us in regard to details, but on broad general principles we are all agreed that there is need for amending the Constitution upon certain lines. It is time the Government ceased talking platitudes upon this matter. In a telegram which the Prime Minister sent to the New States Conference at Armidale, to whioh I was a delegate, he congratulated the conference on its large assembly, wished it success in its deliberations, and stated that he recognized that the time was ripe for an amendment of the Constitution. I want him now to tell me when he intends holding the special constitutional session he promised, and the conference with the State Premiers for the purpose of reconsidering ithe financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. for the first time a report of the operations under the Export Guarantee Aet has been laid on the table. For weeks past I have been, looking for a report of these operations. I was anxious to get information as to what had been done, what amount of money had been allotted, and what was the actual position. But I was not able to get a report. I learned to-day that the document presented to the House is the first report of the operations under this act to be laid on the table. As the act, which was passed in 1924, provides that quarterly reports of the operations under it shall be presented to Parliament, by now at least four reports should have been tabled. As a matter of fact, this is not the only instance in which the requirement of an act that reports should be presented to Parliament has not been observed. I am drawing at-' tention to this fact because I think it department to supply reports to Parliament those reports should be presented within a reasonable time. I ask the Minister for Defence to bring this matter under the attention of the Minister entrusted with the responsibility of administering the Export Guarantee Act, who is, If the Government has no I understand, the Minister for Markets and Migration. it under his attention.
