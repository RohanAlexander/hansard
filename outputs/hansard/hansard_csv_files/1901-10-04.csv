Ib may be that there ought to be stricter legislation with reference to trade marks, but I think we should deal -with that quesbion in a broad and comprehensive way ab an early date, and nob pass specially disabling legislation with regard to particular trades. The matter is one of the greatest importance, and the sooner we deal with it the better. I can assure honourable members that it is the policy of the Government to take it in hand at the earliest prolific source of fraud upon the public. possible date. An HoifORABLH MEMBER -What is the objection to putting the name of the State on the package ? it will cause some trouble, although perhaps to a lesser degree. I do not mind saying thab the Government are considerably influenced in dealing with this matter at tliis particular moment, by the necessity for getting the Bill passed and in working order in time for such action as may be necessary under the proposals bo be submitted bo bhe House in the forthcoming week. The Government propose to accept the amendment, and trust they will have the support of the committee. Since last evening I have been communicated with by anumberof the journeymen interested in the cigar industry, and I am exceedingly sorry bhat the distributing trade is in such a condition that there is a considerable degree of force in their contention that if the distributors knew where the cigars were made imported cigars would take bhe place of the local article. In view of what the Minister has stated as to the intentions of the Government with regard to the introduction of trade-mark legislation, and also having regard to the more telling fact that the passing of the Bill is a matter of urgency, perhaps the honourable member for Bland will take my view, that under the circumstances, matters should be allowed to stand as they are. strongly as ever the view I expressed last Minisber for Home Affairs)I moveevening as bo the desirability of encouraging our local manufacturers generally, and the follow clause 10 :. necessity of having trade marks properly regulated, but there is some force in the with the valuation of the damage, if any, in -statement of the Minister that we should not respect of which a claim is made, does not exceed deal piecemeal with a matter of such undoubtedly large importance. Perhaps, therefore, it would be wiser to wait for the introduction of a measure dealing with the whole question of imported goods as well as those of local manufacture. It would certainly be hardly fair to subject cigar makers to conditions different from those under which other local producers are allowed to work. The whole question of labels and trade marks ought to engage the early attention of Parliament, because the present want of regulation is a But I am impressed wibh the argument that we have no justification for singling oub any particular indusbry, and I will, therefore, let the matter go for the present. that the Minister has agreed to the amendment. When I spoke last night I was anxious to see tliat no injustice was done to our local manufacturers. I believe that the question of trade marks and labels should be dealt with by this Parliainenb at an early dabe, in order to protect fair-dealing manufacturers against those who are using trade marks which they know to be false.

(2) Unless the claimant and the Minister concur in the appointment of a single arbitrator, who shall be either a District or County Court Judge, or a Police, Stipendiary, or Special Magistrate, the compensation shall be settled by two arbitrators, one to be appointed by the claimant and one by the Minister. (3) Por the purpose of carrying this section into case any number of people could be secured effect, the laws relating to arbitration in force in the State in which the land is situated shall be applied as nearly as practicable. (4) The costs of and incident to the arbitration as settled by the arbitrators shall be borne by the Minister, unless the sum awarded by the arbitrators is the same or a less sum than was offered by the Minister, in which case each party shall bear his own costs incidental to the arbitration, and the costs of the arbitrators shall be borne by the parties in equal proportions; but if the sum awarded is one-third less than the amount claimed, the whole costs of and incidental to the arbitration and award shall be borne by the claimant. This clause has been introduced to meet as far as possible the views expressed by certain honourable members when the measure was under consideration the night before last. The honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Flinders upon that occasion raised the question of whether some power ought not to . be provided for the appointment of arbitrators before any case in which a dispute was involved concerning land which the Commonwealth had compulsorily resumed came before a Judge of the High Court. It was suggested at that time that there should be a limit placed upon the value of land which might form the subject of arbitration, and the new clause fixes that limit at £250 . MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs will see his way clear to strike out this limit. When we talked about a limit the other evening it was not in connection with the question of arbitration, but in connection with the question of whether a property of small value-if its value was to be settled by a court at all-shoul d be determined by the High Court, where the expense involved would necessarily be out of all proportion to its value, or should be settled by a lower tribunal such as the Police Court or the Count}' Court. W it h regard to the principle of arbitration no limit should be imposed. Our contention was, that the claimant whose property was taken from him compulsorily should have the option either of taking his case to the court, or of referring it to arbitration. That, I think, is a fair principle to lay down. This question is a very serious one. In my opinion it is utterly impossible for a Judge who has never seen the particular land in dispute, and who cannot reasonably be expected to know its worth, to accurately appraise its value. In such a to swear that in their opinion the land was worth so much. But the opinion of one practical conscientious man would be worth the testimony of a gross of such witnesses. It is not necessary that an arbitrator should be a professional valuer. Probably the claimant might know some person in the neighbourhood who was qualified to act, and whose decision he would be prepared to abide bj'. Very often a person is picked as an arbitrator, because he is a thorough judge of the matter in dispute. Probably he would give his services for nothing, as is frequently done in such cases. On the other hand, the Government would appoint their expert, and I am sure that if two men were secured who were thorough judges of laud, and they visited the property in dispute, and assessed its value carefully, there would not be much difference in their respective estimates. If they were both judges of the value of land their estimates would almost certainly be within a very narrow margin of each other. I have seen experts of the highest character differing tremendously. MrA . M c LEAN I may tell my honourable and learned friend tliat I have had a great deal to do with the subdivision of large estates, and with putting a value upon each block, and I have rarely been more than a few shillings out in the price per acre. Possibly, in the case of land worth £ 2 5 an acre, I might be £ 1 an acre out. But I have always found that any expert in valuing land, who is acquainted with the district in which the land is situated, is rarely out more than a very small sum. I admit that in city or town properties the case is different, because one cannot then estimate the value of the land upon its income-earning capacity-as is the case with country land-and what it will bring is therefore a matter of opinion. Buti n country districts it is very easy for an expert in valuing land to know what he can make of the land, and, of course, the true value is the capitalization of its income. All values based upon the income-earning",16,Property Acquisitionbill
19,Mr Higgins,"-That is a great mistake.capacity of the land, if accurately assessed, are sure to be close to its true worth. It would be folly to bring such cases before a J udge who has never seen the land in dispute, and who cannot reasonably be expected to pronounce an expert's opinion upon the value of such property, because he has not devoted his life to the business. In Viotoria, I am aware that there are one or two County CourtJ udges who are experts in tlie value of land, and to whom I should be perfectly prepared to trust the valuation of any property of mine. But to trust to a Judge who was compelled to be guided solely by the evidence which comes before him would be a mistake. Why not give the parties interested the option of having their disputes settled either by arbitration or by the court? public purposes, takes away from a man the piece of land by which he lives, thereby depriving him of his means of livelihood, surely it is reasonable to allow him to have the value of that land assessed in the way in which he believes to be best. If he is willing to allow the matter to go to the Court by all means let it go there. -as I would-the valuation likely to be placed upon his land by the court, why not allow him to have the matter decided by experts? manner in which the Minister has drafted the Bill. Where two parties are content to agree to one arbitrator, I think that the arbitrator ought to be either a County Court Judge or a Police Magistrate, because it is possible to select men in that capacity who are experts, and who would be willing to visit the land in dispute. But I should not like to see the value of the property of any person left to the decision of a Judge who had never seen ib, and who was guided by the irresponsible statements of persons who were prepared to say that in their opinion it was worth so much. I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to give the person whose land is compulsorily resumed, tlie option of having its value assessed by arbitration, or by a Supreme Court Judge. That is a fair and reasonable thing to do. 1 hope that the Government will be prepared to concede this principle to the citizens of the Commonwealth, and thus avoid litigation. We do not live by litigation. I have never heard of a nation that was made prosperous by litigation. Why then should we force it upon people in every possible direction ? I am perfectly sure that the Minister for Trade and Customs in his inner mind agrees with what I say. I am certain that he does not allow his professional views to bias his judgment. Many of ray best friends belong to the legal profession. Buti f the Minister wanted a wet-nurse he would not send for a Judge. There are many things which require to be done, and which a Judge is not the best person to do. There are some Judges, I admit, who arc exceptions. For example, there is Judge Chomley. I should be perfectly prepared to allow that gentleman to assess the value of any land of mine. This is a very important matter, because when we take away a man's property which perhaps forms AVhen the Commonwealth, for his sole means of living, it is very hard to create heart-burning by compelling him to go to a tribunal in which he has no confidence. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this matter, and strike out the limit imposed. He admits that that principle is right in the case of small properties, and if so, surely it is also right in regard to large properties. The question which the Buti f he distrusts committee have to decide is-""AVhich is the way in which we are most likely to get an accurate value of the land ? "" I say that we ought to leave it to the judgment of the I thoroughly approve of the applicant himself. Let us give him the option of having any dispute which may arise settled either by arbitration or by the courb. If bhere is any Government which should be careful not to err in the direction indicated, it is the present Government, which is composed chiefly of lawyers. If every Bill which we pass is calculated to provoke litigation, public attention will soon be directed to the fact. If the Government wish to do what is fair and just to eveiy citizen of the community, let them give some evidence of it by showing that they do not wish to force people inbo the law courts whether they desire to go there or not. I have to express my sympathy with the honourable member in his views. But I wish to point out that he is mistaken as to the effect of this clause. The Crown and the person whose land is resumed may agree upon arbitration, if they think fit. If the Crown resumes certain land, and cannot agree with the owner as to its value, the parties need not go to law. It is quite open to them to allow some person whose judgment is",17,Property Acquisitionbill
20,Mr Higgi Ns (Northern Melbourne),"mutually acceptable to decide its value. People are sure to do that in small cases. a claimant to s a y "" I will take the decision of so and so."" whole meaning of this clause is to give to the claimant tbe right to go to arbitration against the wish of the Crown. The question for the committee to determine is whether it is advisable to enable the claimant to force the Crown to arbitration. I think that the dread of arbitration, and ignorance as to how long proceedings will occupy, are enough to make a Government hesitate, because we all recognise that the Government usually come out worse. . I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland as to the inexpediency of going to law if we can possibly help it , but people can always arrange amongst themselves as to whose opinion they will accept in order to arrive at on agreement. It is open to them to say"" We will take the opinion of so and so."" In nine cases out of ten it will be found that tlie claimant is willing to accept some person's opinion. in will be sure to adopt that course. The question raised under the first subclause is, whether the Crown ought to be forced to go to arbitration if an agreement cannot be come to with the person from whom the land is taken. It happens sometimes that a claim for £1,000 is made for land which is really worth only £50, and there ought to be first an attempt to arrive at an agreement by leaving the matter to some impartial person. I do not want the Crown to be forced to go to arbitration in those unreasonable cases, because no one can tell how long on arbitration will last, and, while Judges are paid by the State, the parties have to pay the arbitrators. MrA . McLEAN have to pay the arbitrators. I have known cases, iu which the arbitrators have been weak or unskilled, spun out for weeks over the question of. a small piece of land. The Crown, knowing that, submits to be fleeced rather than go to arbitration. I am speaking from a good deal of experience, and if ib is thought that it is in the least in my interest to refer thus to settlement by arbitration, I shall say no more. I want people to get a fair price for their land, but I do not desire to see the Crown fleeced simply because it is possible to force the Crown into a corner. The proposal of the Minister goes too far in forcing It is perfectly competent for arbitration. But the living of lawj'ers. in talking in that way, is doing an injustice to me, and to all the lawyers in the House. Outside the House he may use such arguments as much as he likes, but in the HouseI think it is recognised that lawyers are quite as anxious as is the honourable member himself to do what is just. MrA . McLEAN I know that; but lawyers are accustomed to litigation, and advocate it as a means of settlement. I am anxious to help the honourable member for Gippsland to get optional arbitration, because there are cases in which that is the better course. The best way, in disputes of this kind, is to choose a fair man, by whose opinion the parties will be bound. If an agreement cannot be arrived at, there is still the option of appointing arbitrators; If the land and if, even then, there is not an agreement, dispute is a small piece, he there are cases in which it would be best to have the assistanceof a skilled J udge. It is only in cases where experts differ that the assistance of the court will be called in cases where experts on oath differ widely as to values. I have known experts say, on the one side, that land is worth £500, and experts on bhe obher side say bhat ib is worth only £ 5 0 ; and it is only in cases where there are such egregious differences that it is advisable to call in the assistance of the court. The only value of expert evidence in regard to land is where the witnesses or some of them cannot be believed, and the advantage of having the assistance of a Judge is that from long experience of witner.ses he is able No t always. to differentiate between evidence tliat is of use and evidence that is of no use, and to come to a conclusion. No doubt the best mode is for the assessors to look at the land for themselves; but the honourable member for Gippsland must have known cases in which the arbitrators were in . Melbourne or some other town where expert evidence is called from the whole countryside at a huge expense. dicts the other. MrA .

The ideal way of assessing tlie value is to leave the matter to some men who are experts, and be bound by their decision ; but arbitration is not necessarily leaving the matter to experts in that way. Arbitration very often means calling a long list of witnesses, and then estimating the value of their evidence. If the Crown has to be forced to arbitration, it is reasonable to have the limit of £250 . I would not, however, go so far as the Minister has gone, but would say that after the writ is issued, or after a claim is made, a Judge may have discretion to select assessors whose decision should bind tlie parties, and those assessors may go and look at the land, or do whatever they think fit. worth) -'We all know that there are processes in law which are very long and harassing. We know the terror which a court, and the delays of a court, possess for some people. time, as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has pointed out, arbitration is very often a much longer process than proceedings in the court, though it must be remembered that the arbitration suggested in bhe clause is not ou a very complicated quesbion. It is a mabber of arriving ab the value up bo £250, and the arbitration, oughb bo be confined bo mabters of this kind.

Although not perhaps quite relevant bo bhe question under discussion, I may express the hope that in the resumption of land by the Commonwealth prompt payment will be made. within a month, or interest paid. MrA . McLEAN It would be a good thing to limit the fee to be paid to the arbitrator. always depends on the character of the case and the amount involved ; and i u a matter of only £25 0 a very big fee cannot bo allowed.

MrA . C. GUOOM (Flinders) -There should be no limit to the amount. As to the cost of arbitration, and the sbatemenb bhab the amount is generally given against the Government, I would like to quote from this morning's Age the results of six or seven cases in connection with the Lilydale and AVarburton railway line. A t the same In one case, Messrs. C. W. and H . P.. McLean claimed £ 3 6 4 l is . , while tbe trust offered £ 9 5 16s. 3d., and the amount awarded by the arbitrators, for whom Judge Chomley was the umpire, was £50, or £ 4 0 less than the amount offered ; Messrs. J. C. and T. C. Wildman claimed £2,500, while the Government in the face of the enormous amount claimed, declined to make an offer, and the arbitrators awarded £ 5 0 ; Messrs. M . A. and E. A. Vernon claimed £ 3 8 7 10s., while the trust offered £50, and the arbibrabors awarded £ 9 0 ; F. A.

The total amount of the claims against the trust was £8,.994 18s. 6d., while the trust offered £ 5 3 8 19s. 3d., and the arbitrators awarded £682 . These cases clearly show that, by going to arbitration, the Government benefited in every way, and the costs were much smaller than if there had been process at law.

This is a valuation not of land only, but also of the estate or interest of the claimant therein. In some cases it may be merely the valuation of land, where there is only one person interested and only one person claiming; but the scheme of the Bill also recognises separate interests in land, if they exist, so that there may be a claim by a life tenant or a tenant in remainder. That is clearly set forth in sub-clause (3) of clause 12; in fact, it is recognised in the first line of the new clause by the distinction between tlie ""valuationof the land, or of the estate, or interest of the claimant therein."" That appears in the new clause, in clause 12, and in several subsequent clauses. Isi t safe to hand over to the special magistrate the valuation not of the land, but of the life interest, or interest in remainder ?

In South Australia these magistrates have a jurisdiction up to £ 4 9 5 . A t all events, I say that it is not safe, putting New South Wales aside, to leave this matter to special magistrates in some of the States.

The question whether it is advisable to hand over to a special magistrate, who is a layman, and who may live perhaps 250 miles from Adelaide, tlie calculation of the value of interests in land which it would require an actuary to explain to the bench, is one which ought to receive a little consideration.

Supposing for instance there is a claim for £9,000, and the Minister £7,500. That would not be less by one-third than the total amount claimed. That is a case in which A Judge, of course, is a the Judge ought to have the right to say whether one party ought to bear the But he could whole of the costs.

40,Mr Glynn,"That is so in South Austlie experience of the honourable member for Gippsland, with regard to arbitration, has been of a very favorable character, because most people have not found it a cheap and satisfactory method of settling disputes. Therefore I am not inclined to extend the power of resorting to arbitration in the way that he has urged. I wish to direct attention to the wording of sub-clause (2), which states thab when the claimant and the Minister concur in the appointment of a single arbitrator, the compensation shall be settled by two arbitrators, one to be appointed by the claimant and one by the Minister. In most laws relating to arbitration, it is provided that the compensation shall be sebbled by bwo arbitrators, or by an umpire appointed by only two out of three arbitrators; and therefore I think that it should be provided thab, unless the claimant and the Minister concur in the appointment of a single arbitrator, reference shall be made to two arbitrators. I think that will bring the wording into accord with the form in which similar provisions exist in the State laws, and that it will probably obviate difficulty when these matters have to be dealt with. I move That the words ""the compensation shall be settled by two arbitrators,"" in sub-clause (2), be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" reference shall be made to bwo arbitrators "" MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I quite agree with the honourable member for Tasmania, and I think there must have been an oversight in the wording of this clause. same, but the proposal of the honourable member for Tasmania more clearly expresses it. Mr A. M c LEAN I may explain, that when I stated that two persons who were judges of land would very rarely differ to any material extent regarding values, my statement did not apply to the damage done by severance. That is very difficult to assess, and in some cases there may be a very considerable discrepancy in the views of two persons. the greatest discrepancy appears between the amounts offered, and the amounts asked. It is quite possible that the owner of the land may think that the damage done by severance is a great deal more than it is considered to be by the person who takes the land; in fact, according to my experience, there is just as much disposition on the part of persons taking land, to underestimate the damage done by severance, as there is on the part of those who suffer the damage to over-estimate it ; and I contend that it is only by submitting the matter to independent judges that these questions can be decided. I know of a case where a property was square in shape, and cut up into a large number of small paddocks, in order that it might be worked to the very best advantage. A railway wa7 construcbed bhrough this property, coming in at one corner, running diagonally through the property, and going out at another corner. In that case, the damage done by severance was very great; because the shape of every paddock was changed, and it was a very difficult matter to plough the land without leaving a greab deal of it lying wosbe, and going to greab expense for ex bra labour. In that case the amount offered by the Railway Commissioners was considerably less bhan one-half the amount asked by the owners, and the question-althoug h an intricate and difficult one-wa s settled in one day by arbitrators, without any expense at all to the owners, and only the expenses of one arbitrator for one day so far as the Railway Commissioners were concerned. I have seen many cases whore, in connection with the railways, the Railway Commissioners and the owners of the land could not agree, and the matter was left to arbitration. Every one of the cases that have come under my notice was, wibh one exception, sebbled wibhoub reference to an umpire. The umpire accompanied the was the arbitrators over the land, and discussed the question of damages with each of them, and thoroughly acquainted himself with the circumstances, but there was no necessity for reference to him, except in one case. In most of these insbances some experienced farmer in the locality would act for the owner of the land, and probably withoub any fee. I admit thab where land is taken in a city, the circumstances are different, because it is very difficult to arrive at the true value in such a case. Therei t is just a matter of Ib is here that opinion, guided by considerations as to the revenue-producing character of the property.

42,Mr Drakin,"The intentionparticular locality, to act arbitrators. I move That all the words down to and inclusive of the word ""pounds,"" sub-clause (1), be omitted. The effect of that will be to remove the limit that is now imposed, and to give the claimant the option of having his case dealt with by arbitration. Sir WILLIAM raise the limit? MrA . McLEAN -Becaus e a question of justice cannot be circumscribed by an arbitrary limit. If the mode of settlement were better-if I believed the courts to afford a better mode of settlementI should be inclined to keep the limit very low. But the experience of a life-time in matters connected with the land has shown me that reference to the courts is a very faulty method of settling disputes. I believe it is unfair to the man whose property is taken from him, and I am sorry that there should have been any opposition to giving him tlie option of having his case settled before arbitrators. The honourable member for Flinders has cited a large number of cases which have been settled during the last three weeks, and in which the decision of the arbitrators has been invariably given in favour of the Government. the arbitration may take, the Government pays 30s. for £ 1 . MrA . M c LEAN is so. In one case, which came within my knowledge, I thought that the award of between £ 4 0 and £ 5 0 per acre for some land was excessive, because I knew its intrinsic worth to be only about £ 4 or £ 5 per acre, but when I saw the way in which it was cut up, and the way in which the paddocks were cut off from the water, I came to the conclusion that the compensation given was not too much. By considering only the intrinsic value of the soil, people are often misled to the conclusion that the compensation awarded is excessive, forgetting the damage that often results from severance. In many cases persons from whom land is taken would infinitely prefer that the land should be left alone. My own district is a very fertile one, and when the Government proposed to run a railway through the heart of it, a petition was unanimously signed by the farmers in the district asking that tlie line might be taken down the opposite side of as judges or the river, in order to avoid the cutting up of their farms. They knew tliat they would have received compensation, but they thought they would be better off with the land intact. The Government acceded to their request, and the farmers have now tocart their grain for distances of from 1 to 3 miles, because they preferred not to have their farms cut up. I saw a case the been mentioned, where the damage done was almost inconceivable, because therailway ran along the high-water mark, and cut off the high land from the low land. The intrinsic value of the land in that case was a mere bagatelle, but the damage done by severance was very great indeed. I do not often move amendments, because I always prefer to accept the proposals of the Government, unless I have very strong reasons to the contrary; but I -wish the Government would show some disposition to meet proposals mode by honourable members, when they know that they are brought forward in the best interests of their Bills and of the public. member has no doubt put forward a very strong and fair case, but the arguments used by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne raise the question as to whether this new clause is required at all. As Minister in control of the Works department of New South Wales, perhaps I have I do not think that had as great an experience as any one in dealing with land resumptions, and I invariably agreed to arbitration unless there was something difficult and knotty about the case, or unless the amount involved was very large. Sometimes as much as £50,000 was involved in one resumption. that care has to be exercised to get a sound decision. member must not forget that he proposes to take away a very considerable right from the Crown. for the usual way of settling these matters. It is quite an innovation to compel people to go to a court.

47,Mr A. Mclean,"I propose to provideSouth Wales law make provision for arbitration ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE does not compel the Government to resort to arbitration. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has pointed out tliat if this clause were not inserted, there would still be power to resort to arbitration. MrA .

The aspect placed upon this matber by bhe honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has, I confess, somewhat changed my opinion. As I am not a lawyer, I did not know the exact legal position. If the honourable and learned member is correct, I do not think there is any necessity to pass this clause at all. But whether we pass it with a £250 limit or with £ 1,000 limib-and I am quibe agreeable bo adopt the latter courseclaimants can compel the Government to go to arbitration first. MrA . McLEAN agree bhat up bo bhe limib of £1,000 the claimant should have the option ? wish to point out bhat unless in the fubure the Commonwealth has somebhing to do with railway construction, it is hardly likely thab any resumptions of land by. the Commonwealth will exceed £1,000 in value. I suggest, therefore, that the wishes of the It does; but it honourable member for Gippsland will be met if we increase the limit to that amount.

The position in Australia is very little different. If one gets the real screecher-the big eagle lawyer of this country-h e can chew-up as much costs as can any lawyer in America. Are we going to protect the big man? I am the champion of the rich man upon this occasion. We must retain the rich man in order to pay the taxes to keep the Government going.

This clause has been drafted to meet the case suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who desired that the State Courts should have the power to deal with coses until the establishment of the High Court. that the Minister would again consider the question of whether we should not allow the Supreme Court of a State to have jurisdiction even after the High Courtis established. To destroy the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of a Statei n matters of valuation is 16 s a very big matter. In some of the States there are six J udges on the bench, and in all of them bhere is a minimum of bhree. Apparently the Minister thinks that the Supreme Court Judges of the Stabes will be so biased in favour of a claunanb tliat he will not allow them to have jurisdiction in determining valuations under this Bill. I should have divided the House upon this matter the other night, if I had thought there was a sufficient number of honorable members present to carry an amendment but unfortunately they were not here. I now venture, even at this late stage, to protest against the attempt, on the creation of the High Court, to deny to the State courts -. jurisdiction which legitimately ought to belong to them, and which they are quite as. capable of honestly discharging as any High Court we like to establish. I do not want to impugn the High Court of the Commonwealth when it is established, for I have no doubt that tip-top men will be appointed tobhe bench. A t the same time, we havequite as honest material in the Supreme Courts of the States, in connection with which there is as litble fear of prejudice in* favour of individuals as we are likely to havein the High Court.

But I have always taken a very great interest in the development of this branch of our Constitution, and I readily respond to the demand to resume the second reading debate. I presume that now we are on the eve ancl very threshold of free trade between tlie various States of Australia, we may accept the determination of the Government to resume the second-reading debate on this Bill as an evidence of a resolution on their part to leave no stone unturned, and to neglect no constitutional power available tliat may be necessary for ciple of Inter-State free-trade. I must admit, however, that the best friends of this Bill will feel some degree of regret at tlie isolated and detached manner in which it has beenadvancedinthis House.' It was certainly worthy of more continuous discussion, involving, as it does, many complicated considerations, and many very serious arguments that may be advanced both one way and another. First we had the opening of the debate many months ago by the Ministeri n charge, who gave a very clear and comprehensive exposition of the measure. Then came a long interval which was broken by a leader of the Opposition; and since then there has been no discussion of the Bil l whatever. In the meantime, the unfortunate measure has been pelted and assailed and misrepresented throughout Australia, and has even been misrepresented, I believe, to the Imperial authorities. Sir JOHN QUICK I do not remember any Bil l in this Parliament that has received such unceremonious treatment, and, I may say, to a certain extent, unfair treatment on the part of many of its critics. A great deal of the misrepresentation indulged in, and the unfair treatment which it has received, might have been prevented if by the exigences of parliamentary business to proceed continuously from beginning to (Ballarat Attorneyend.

I have no doubt that those petitions and the representations therein will receive the fairest consideration at the hands of this House. There is not the slightest danger of any important interests, either Australian or Imperial,being unfairly treated in the Eederal Parliament of Australia, and, therefore, I for one regret the attitude of some of the opponents of this Bill, who have not been content to protest and to petition within the Commonwealth, but have thought fit to go to the Imperial authorities. lians have done that. Sir JOHN QUICK rate, that the action has been instigated by people in Australia. not; the mail companies have acted of their own volition. if the mail companies have seen fit to apply to the Imperial authoritities regarding Australian legislation, they certainly have not shown much confidence in or respect for the Australian Parliament.

BeforeI proceed to speak of some of the principles of this Bill, I should like to refer to two sections of our Constitution, which deal with this matter, and which certainly justify and warrant the establishment of an Inter-State commission, if they do not demand it . Section 92 contains one of the basic principles relating to commerce contained in our Constitution. It enacts that upon the imposition of uniform duties of merce, and intercourse between the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free. I invite tlie attention, of honourable members to tliat mandate of the Constitution, because it is, as I take it, mainly for the purpose of giving effect to that mandate that the Inter-State Commission is proposed to be constituted, ancl the framers of the Constitution, when they went further than the bald declaration in favour of Australian free-trade, on the occurrence of a certain event, considered the whole of the surroundings of these Australian States. They considered tlie antecedent history and conditions of each of the States, and found it necessary not merely to put in a declaration to the effect of section 92, but to go further and provide the necessary machinery for giving effect to that declaration. is necessary. future the framers of the Constitution saw that probably there would be attempts on the part of some of the States to resort to No Austrathe tricks and artifices that have been resorted to in the past, with a view I believe, at anyto the prevention of freedom of trade and equality between the various States. The framers of the Constitution saw has that trade and commerce and intercourse between the various States was carried on, not only by means of internal carriage, that is, by railways or any other means of land carriage, but by means of ocean navigation, and it was conceived that if it were possible for obstacles to the complete establishment of Inter-State free-trade to exist in connection with internal carriage, it would also to resort to artifices and expedients in connection with ocean navigation by which the equality of Inter-State free-trade might be interfered with. That is the reason why these words were put into the Constitution, contemplating the establishment of Inter-State free-trade not merely by internal carriage, but by ocean navigation, and, looking forward to the possibilities of the future, power was taken to interfere in case necessity might arise, or in case resort might be had to unfair expedients in connection with ocean navigation. Of course, it was never contemplated that there should customs and excise, trade, combe any unnecessary interference ; that there should be unjustifiable tinkering or tampering with ocean navigation, or that there should be any prying into the conditions of ocean navigation unless the occasion should arise, and I think that if a number of the petitioners who have addressed this House, as well as those who have complained elsewhere, had understood that it was not intended to interfere with the processes or conditions of ocean navigation unless ocean navigators interfered with Inter-State free-trade, we should not have had the great",28,Mcmillan T H A T Means The Debate On The Bill Had Been Permitted

88,Sir John Quick,"Looking into theoutcry that has been raised throughout Australia. provisions of the Bill. framers of the Constitution provide by section 101 that there shall be an Inter-State commission with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance within the Commonwealth of the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and all laws made thereunder. I invite intention to the words of section 101 There shall be an Inter-State Commission charged with bhe execution and maintenance within the Commonwealthnot beyond the Commonwealth. of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerceThere we find a mandatory requirement within the Constitution, not that there may be but that there shall be an Inter-State commission, for the purpose of executing and maintaining the law of the Constitution, and the laws thereunder relating to trade and commerce, and the intercourse by railways and navigation, so far as these matters relate to Inter-State and foreign trade. Now, I think that special regard ought to be paid to the introductory words of section 101 of the Constitution. We have heard it contended, by gentlemen whose opinions are certainly entitled to every respect, that it is entirely optional on the part of the Federal Government to organize the proposed Inter-State Commission-that the commission is not a necessary adjunct to the Constitution. that, I would like to point out and emphasize strongly the words providing that ""there shall be"" an Inter-State Commission, and in the face of these words tlie question may be well raised as to whether there is any other means or any other machinery known to the Constitution, besides the InterState Commission, which could discharge the important duty of executing and maintaining the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce including, of course, Inter-State free-trade. l t has been suggested, and I do not say without force of argument, tliat the provisions of the Constitution might be enforced by a private individual, supposing he were harassed or obstructed by any railway rate or State law antagonistic to the principle of : Commisnion BUI. 5657 Inter-State free-trade. Whilst there may be argument in support of this suggestion, on the other hand we cannot disregard the mandate of the Constitution. Supposing any private individual could be found in Australia having sufficient courage and means to fight one of the States on a great constitutional question, he might find himself confronted in the High Court with the contention that the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and particularly Inter-State free-trade, could be enforced, executed, and maintained only by the authority contemplated by the Constitution. Parliament may legislate under section 102? Sir JOHN QUICK I say that is an argument-no t that it is right. I merely put it as a possible contention that might be sustained-becaus e on these constitutional questions it would be a very great mistake on the part of any one to assume any dogmatic attitude, the possibilities of constitutional argument being so open. able and learned member carefully abstained from giving it as. his opinion. called upon to pronounce an opinion at this stage? It might be regarded as premature for any lawyer to take up any distinct attitude as to the possibilities of legal developments in connection with the Constitution. I am directing attention to what would probably be argued, if we could find a citizen with sufficient temerity to rush into a great constitutional conflict with a State. Therefore, this Parliament, in the face of In reply to the mandate of the Constitution, cannot lightly disregard its requirements, and ought not to lightly set them aside. Now that we are on the eve of the attainment of Inter-State free-trade, according to the declaration of the Constitution, it is advisable that the Federal Government should take ever}' step contemplated by the Constitution for the removal of all the artificial obstructions and impediments which have grown up during many years past, and which will, unless removed absolutely, interfere with the accomplishment of that Inter-State free-trade to which we all aspire.

This Bill may be for a Bill such as this.

It aims at the the district of Port Phillip was fixed as being establishment of a great arbitration trifrom the 141st meridian along the course of bunal for tlie settlement of disputes which the Murray,up the Murrumbidgee, and undoubtedly will require to be adjusted, thence along the southern boundaries of the unless they are previously settled amicably counties of Murray and Vincent to the sea. a great friendly tribunal of arbitration That was the original boundary of Port which will regard the interests and the Phillip, the future colony of A ictoria.

A t the time when the boundaries of Port Phillip extended to It is a pity it the Murrumbidgee, the district was an important centre of colonization and enterI f we lookat the map prise. From Melbourne bands of pioneers which have been scooped cause it was nearest in point of distance to that centre, and this city became the natural port and outlet for the trade and commerce of its hinterland. When the boundary was reduced southward to the Murray, although the alteration was made in point of constitutional law, the settlers of the Riverina maintained their connection and their business relationship with the port of Melbourne, from which they had migrated. I mention this fact to show that the Riverina country, which is now a part of New South Wales by constitutional law, was for upwards of 30 or 40 years, on account of its historical relationship to Melbourne and Victoria considered almost a part of Victorian territory Trade and commerce were allowed to proceed for many years regardless of the alteration of the boundary. So identified were the people of Victoria with the Riverina district that in 1862 that State proceeded to establish lines of railways from Melbourne to tap the Murray at various points for the purpose of facilitating and retaining the trade and commerce which its people naturally regarded as belonging to their own territory. Those railways were found to be a very great advantage and convenience to the people of Riverina. They eagerly availed themselves of tlie advantage. The first line was constructed to Echuca in 1862. well pushed along through Bendigo, and I know with what celerity, energy, and determination the Victorian Government prosecuted its construction for the purpose of tapping the Murray, and giving facilities for trade and commerce to the people of Riverina. That line was followed by the establishment of other railways tapping the Murray at Wodonga, SwanH ill, Yarrawonga, and Wahgunyah. Eventually upwards of six railways weie established along the Murray, giving the people of Riverina convenient communication with the great port of Melbourne. Up to 1880 the Government of New South Wales-althoug h the Riverina district was a part of that great and important colony-too k no action whatever for tlie establishment of railway communication with it, apparently acquiesceing in the action of the Victorian Government in providing all these facilities. It was not till 1880 that action was taken by the New South Wales Government for the establishment of railway communication even between S3 d7 ney and Melbourne. About 1881 or 18S2 tbe railway was extended to Albury. This was followed by a request on the part of the enterprising Victorian settlers in Riverina, that the railway should be extended from Junee to Hay. These settlers thought it would be conducive to their own interests to have two strings to their bow in the shape of two systems of railway communication, one leading to Sydney and the other keeping them in regulartouch with Melbourne. It may have been somewhat selfish on the part of these settlers to ask for two systems of communication, but they did so, and the Government of New South Wales in the exercise of its undoubted legal and constitutional right, constructed a railway from Junee and Narrandera to Hay. That was about tlie year 1882. I wish to draw attention to the fact that up to 1882 the Government of Victoria, through their railways, had a monopoly of the Riverina trade. They conducted that trade and carried the goods to and fro at ordinary rates. There were no discriminating rates up till that period. The Victorian Government charged the people of Riverina the fair ordinary rates, and it was not t ill 1882, when the line from Junee to Hay was constructed, that tlie deadly system of cutI throat railway rates commenced. I find remember that railway being that the railway was extended on tlie New South Wales side to Alburyi n 1S81, to Narrandera in the same year, to Hayi ii 1882, and to Jerilderie in 1884. Prior to that, of course there were the numerous lines on the Victorian side, to which I have already referred. The importance of fixing these dates is to show that it was only when the railway was built to Hay, and got into touch with the Riverina territory, that the fight for traffic began. Before1S82, only ordinary rates were charged on the Victorian railways. I make this statement on the authority of the Victorian Railways Commissioners, that there were noconflicting rates prior to 1882. In that year, however, the New South Wales railway authorities, so soon as the line was open to Hay, offered to carry traffic at differentia] rates. The consequence was that Victoria was forced to resort to preferential rates in order to retain her trade. She could only retain that trade, that is the trade which she had succeeded in developing, and which she considered a part of her territorial rights, by offering I to carry goods at special rates. The New South Wales railway authorities at once said-"" You should carry at ordinary local rates between Echuca and Melbourne. .have, no right to this business, because it -originates in our territory."" sized the fact that New South Wales had .incurred serious financial responsibility the building of this railway through the representations of the settlers of Riverina, and they contended, therefore, that Victorian authorities, though first in the -field with railway communication, had no right whatever to resort to the same means of retaining business as the New South Wales -authorities had resorted to in order to gain new business. At this stage it is necessary to draw attention to another and a powerful -factor which was operating in reference to -railway communication and to the interests -and policy of the people of Victoria. -question involved was not whether toria should make a rate in order to encounter the competition of New South Wales alone. whether Victoria was to hold her position in competition with the natural namely, the River Murray. rmatter of historical interest and import-ance, I should mention the fact that the Darling River trade was in tlie main originally developed from the State of South Australia. Australia who worked their way up the Murray, and then up the Darling, and who facilitated the navigation of those rivers by establishing trade and intercourse the outlying districts and Adelaide. -was not till 1870 that Victoria came into (Competition with the Government of South Australia for the Darling trade. and candour alike demand that I should 'State that in the year mentioned the Government of Victoria, through its railway policy, -determined to make a strong bid for the Darling River trade. It did so by offering a bonus of 6d. per bale on every 10,000 bales of wool introduced into the colony of Victoria vid the Darling River. The consequence was that carrying firms and steam-ship firms sprang up in order to earn this bonus, and Victoria made a deep cut into the South Australian trade. Victoria caine into conflict with the New South Wales railway authorities, the question at issue was not merely as to whether the former should retain her trade with Riverina, but whether that State should maintain its position in competition Sir John Quick. the traffic on the Rivers Murray and Darling, which was going towards South You Australia. The river, as the natural highway, is undoubtedly one of the greatest and They emphamost important factors in connection with this question of trade and commerce between in the States. Each of the three States of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia may be said to have a special claim the in favour of her own position. Victoria claims predominance on account of her geographical position. Melbourne claims to be the natural centre and outlet of the Riverina trade. From Hay, which is the pivot town of Riverina, to Melbourne, there is a distance of only about 270 miles by land. On the other hand, from Hay to Sydney is a distance of 455 miles by land. From Hay to Adelaide, partly by river and The partly by railway, the distance ranges Vicfrom 1,000 miles to 1,100 miles. So far as the geographical position is concerned, Melbourne has the predominant advantage. It became a question then as to Therefore, Victoria claims that she ought to have a fair share of the Riverina trade. highwayOf course, New South Wales has the advanHere, as a tage of the territorial right-the constitutional, and the legal right. That is her strong position. Then, again, South Australia has the great advantage of having a natural highway in the Rivers Darling and It was the pioneers of South Murray, which allows commerce and trade to gravitate from the competing area, so to speak, towards Adelaide. I take it that the object of the proposed Inter-State Commisbetween sion is to endeavour to reconcile and harIt monize all these various competing forcesthe legal and constitutional right of New South Wales, the geographical position of VicJustice toria, and the undoubted advantage of South Australia as represented by the river trade. Of these three forces probably the river is tlie strongest. The river undoubtedly represents a natural law which it would be very difficult indeed to interfere with, or to modify in any way. it is a continental advantage, and the river traffic and the navigability of the When river have to a large extent assisted in regulating and modifying, if not in absolutely, determining, the railway rates which have had to be imposed by Victoriai n order to retain her trade.

94,Mr Glynn,A continental advantage.,33,Malcolm Mceachakn I Do Not Be Possible Though Not Perhaps Probable
95,Sir John Quick,"Undoubtedlyfurther powerful factor, the river traffic, which has been to a large extent influencing and determining the railway rates, so far as Victoria is concerned. We cannot fail to recognise the existence of this conflict which has been going on for the last 30 or 40 years between these three States. It is in existence at the present time, and will undoubtedly continue unless the Federal Parliament makes some provision for the settlement of these disputes. As an i l lustration, I may remind honourable members of the various forms in which these railway conflicts have been pursued. First, we have the special rates charged on the Victorian railways from the Murray to Melbourne for the carriage of Riverina wool. It must be admitted that special rates, lower than the local rates, have been so imposed as part of this all-round system of cut-throat competition. From Melbourne to the Murray special rates have been charged on merchandise destined for Riverina stations and known as "" back-loading."" Much lower rates have been charged for merchandise -intended for the Riverina than for that destined for the Victorian side of the river. Special rates have been charged for the carriage of Riverina wool along the South Australian Railways, from Morgan to Adelaide, and from the Murray Bridge to Adelaide. Then, dealing with freights from Adelaide to the Murray, we find that special rates, of a differential character, have been charged destined to the loading, as it is called-o n the same lines as those which have been imposed within Victoria. boola the Victorian Government have imposed what is known as the blocking rate in order to prevent or minimize the introduction of merchandise from South Australia into Victoria as part of the same system. Turning to the rates from Riverina to Sydney we find that special differential or preferential charges have been imposed on the New South Wales railways from Hay and Jerilderie, and the New South Wales border towns, for the carriage of wool and grain to Sydney, in order to attract to the capital of the mother State that wool and grain which, if left alone, would, with other trade and commerce flow, in the natural order of events, towards the port of Melbourne. AVbol to Alburya blocking rate, almost equal to 50 per cent, of the ordinary rate, has been put on between stations such as Junee and Wagga to prevent the flow of wool from New South Wales towards the Victorian border. This has been imposed just as the rate between Serviceton and Dimboola has beeu put on. It has been done under the same short-sighted policy which we are now bound to take into consideration, and we must decide once aud for all whether this wretched miserable policy is to continue any longer. Another example of these differential rates is the charge for the carriage of merchandise from Albury into the interior of New South Wales. A blocking rate has been imposed in regard to this traffic similar to that charged on lines from the Victorian border. I need not go into the figures which are somewhat confusing, but tlie specification of these varying forms of differential or preferential rates will be a sufficient illustration of the contention I am now submitting to tlie consideration of the House. This conflict has not been confined solely to the three States which I have mentioned. It has existed also-a t times in an acute form-betwee n New South Wales and the great State of Queensland. So acute did the struggle for border trade become between these two neighbouring States that in 1893 the Parliament of Queensland was called upon to pass an Act known as the Railway Border Tax. Act. ThatA c t was assented to on the 21st Jul}', 1893. The preamble contains an interesting summary of the grievances for merchandise suffered by the Government and the people river stations-back of Queensland on account of what they contended was the unfair competition of the railway system of New South Wales, in its Between Serviceton and Dimdesire to grasp the border trade which should have been allowed to flow towards Brisbane. The preamble to the A ct recites that large sums of money have been expended by the Queensland Government in extending and maintaining railway communication with the southern and western districts of the State, for the purpose of promoting agricultural and pastoral settlement in those districts. It further recites that large sums of money have at various times been expended by the Government in harbour and river improvements for the purpose of increasing the shipping facilities of the State; that a large sum of money has been and is being annually paid by the Government in subsidizing direct steam communication with Europe, primarily with the object of facilitating the speeding and direct shipment of goods and produce therefrom and thereto. Then ib goes on to formulate a very formidable indictment against the railway that disastrous failure has attended these authorities of New South Wales by assertefforts, because it is not for want of endeaingAnd whereas it has been ascertained that sioners bhat these efforts have not been differential rates on the railway lines of the neighsuccessful. I find that in May, 1895, a bour! ng colonies have been promulgated aud otherdraft agreement was enbered into bebween wise arranged for which have had, and are conthe Railway Commissioners of New South tinuing to have, the effect of diverting the traffic, which ought legitimately to be conveyed over the Wales, Vicboria, and Soubh Ausbralia, as railway lines of this colony, thereby entailing a the result of a conference at which the leadconsiderable loss iu railway revenue: And whereas ing officers of the various departments met ib is considered desirable to prevent as far us and endeavoured to arrive at a solution of practicable this diversion of traffic It goes on to enact this law by which a tax ment arrived at was of a very important is imposed upon the transportation of goods, character, and I have made a short wares, and merchandise across the border analysis of it.

Sir JOHN QUICK In times past, efforts have been made by various Governments to suppress this evil. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, knows that conferences have been held from time to time by the representatives of tlie Government, and by the railway authorities, at which strenuous efforts have been made to arrive at a modus vivendi in reference to this question. of the agreement of 1895. Sir JOHN QUICK It is to be regretted vour on the part of the Railway Commisthese difficulties. The provisional agreer merchandise from Albury towards tlie interior of New SouthW ales should be also r abolished. It was further recommended that the differential block rates on the carriage of merchandise from Serviceton to Dimboola should be done away with, but that the Victorian local classification rates on the carriage of goods destined to border stations except Echuca and SwanH ill should be adhered to. The tendency of this agreement was generally to equalize rates, and to remove a number of anomalies which had been the subject of complaint in the various colonies for many years. That agreement, however, was not ratified by the respective Govern-",33,Malcolm Mceachakn I Do Not Be Possible Though Not Perhaps Probable
96,Mr Glynn,The honourable and learned,35,Malcolm Mceachakn I Do Not Be Possible Though Not Perhaps Probable

98,Mr Glynn,"Only by the non-adoption I ments.was tlie only one which stood out. Sir JOHN QUICK Government, I believe, were led to form the opinion that this agreement was prejudicial to the interests of Victoria; in other words, that Victoria gave more than she received as a consideration. the South Australian commissioner did not mention the BrokenH ill rate; he suppressed it really. Sir JOHN QUICK that was the real reason. Sir JOHN QUICK one of the primary factors in connection with the rejection of this agreement was that the proprietors of the Murray River steam-boats felt that if the agreement -were adopted their interests would be prejudiced, and that they would lose therebates which they had been in tbe habit of receiving under the old agreement of 1870. Whether that be true, or not, I am not quite sure, but I have no reason to doubt that the Government of Victoria had sound and tangible reasons for not acquiescing in this agreement. I mention this as illustrating, not only the manner in which efforts have been made in times post to settle these conflicts and antagonisms, but as illustrating also the failure of those efforts, and further, and most important of all, as illustrating how it is possible for experts meeting together on common ground to arrive at an approximation of an agreement which will be acceptable to the whole of the States. If these railway experts, meeting together in May, 1895, were able to make such au important advance in the direction of an agreement, how much more likely is it than an InterState Commission, composed of independent men, and equipped with constitutional authority,, would be able to discover some modus vivendi that would reconcile and harmonize the various conflicting and antagonistic interests of the States. BeforeI go into the details of the Bill, I would like at this stage to mention the contention which has been raised that it was never intended that this Inter-State Commission should have any power or jurisdiction over commerce borne from one State to another by ocean navigation. I have already drawn attention to the section in the Constitution which clearly and specifically contemplates control over Inter-State navigation, or over commerce which is carried from one State to another by means The Victorian of ocean navigation. It is also said that there is no reason whatever why the federal authority should vest any power or jurisdiction in the Inter-State Commission over this class of carriage. W it h reference to that point, I had the opportunity of a conversation with Mr John Mathieson, late Railways Commissioner of Victoria, a few days prior to his departure from this State. I think honourable members will recognise I do not know tliat in that officer a very able, rebable, and valuable man, whose opinion is entitled to I heard that it was. respect. Mr Mathieson, in discussing with I have heard that me the functions of an Inter-State Commisssion, made this observation, which I took down at the timeAmong other matters it might report on are the sugar trade, the emigration of aliens, and the rates charged by steamers between coastal ports. The rate charged by steamers for the conveyance of goods from Sydney to Townsville is cheaper than bhe rate from Brisbane to Townsville. Brisbane is suffering from this undue advantage given to Sydney. I know as a fact that cargoes have been left on the wharves of Brisbane weeks and weeks whilst cargoes have been sent direct from Sydney to the northern ports. That was the first piece of information I received on the subject which led me to make further inquiries as to whether it was necessary or desirable to give the InterState Commission any j urisdictionover coastal steamers. I mentioned the matter to the honourable member for Oxley, and asked him whether he could give me any information on the subject. The honourable member very kindly undertook to send a telegram to one of the leading merchants in Brisbane, as followsIs it true that steamers give preference in loading fi-om Sydney to northern Queensland porbs, charging cheaper rates, and giving better facilities bhan are given ab Brisbane? The reply received wasYes; sbeamers give preference 5s. ton as between Sydney and Brisbane; prohibitive for heavy goods.

I find in the Brisbane Courier of Monday, 15th July, this paragraphA prominent merchant of this city was also seen, and he stoutly maintained it was a fact that the three Inter-State shipping companies gave a preference to loading from Si'dney to northern Queensland ports, and charged Sydney shippers os. per ton less than they levied on Brisbane shippers of goods for the north. This preference which he declared was shown to Sydney as a shipping port was the means of depriving Brisbane of a deal of the northern trade, and was, he considered, a decided blow at the commerce of this port. These are facts which demand explanation, and which justify some limited jurisdiction being given to the Inter-State Commission to inquire into anomalies of the kind. I should say, in justice to the steam-ship companies, that the three InterState steam-ship lines doing business with Queensland ports have repudiated the correctness of the reply sent to the honourable member for Oxley; and that involves a question of fact which I cannot pursue an}' further. I merely point this out as evidence, showing the existence of these preferential rates on the part of some of the coastal steamers. There is another matter in which it may be deemed desirable that some control should be exercised over coastal shipping and navigation by the Inter-State Commission. I refer to the recent action of the New South Wales Government, through the Sydney Harbor Trust, in making Harbor Trust regulations, which was alluded to by the Minister for Home Affairs in introducing this Bill. The Minister mentioned that the New South Wales Government had instigated or had taken action through the Harbor Trust for the purpose of abolishing, or reducing, the wharfage rates upon trade and commerce between Sydney and the various coastal ports of New South Wales. I have before me tlie New South Wales Gazette, dated 18th June, 1901, in which the following announcement appearsThe following regulations, made by the Sydney Harbour Trust Commissioners,under the provisions of the Sydney //arbour Trust Act 1900, having been approved by His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor with the advice of the Executive bad apart from the commission ? Can they Council, are published in accordance with the requirements of the above-cited Act. Sir John Quick. WlTAKFAGE RATJSS. 1. No outward wharfage rates shall be charged on any goods shipped to any port in New South Wales to be used or consumed in tliat State. 2. No inward wharfage rates shall be charged on any of the goods mentioned in the schedule hereto, which are the produce of, or have been manufactured in, New South Wales. Then there is a schedule showing goods on which wharfage rates have been abolished. inwards. An Honorable MEMBER -That is protection. like protection of a pronounced character. In support of my contention that the InterState Commission should have some control in this direction, I would point out how wharfage rates of this kind, preferential as regards steamers trading between Sydney and the various ports of New South Wales, might be utilized for the purpose of defeating and prejudicing to a large extent InterState free-trade. As the Minister in his speech pointed out, a steamer trading between Sydney and south of the Tweed Heads would be entitled to trade, carrying goods to and from Sydney, with immunity from the payment of wharfage rates, whereas a steamer trading from the Queensland border, or from Southport, a few miles further north, would be obliged, whenever it entered the port of Sydney, or whenever it cleared out for Southport, or other ports in Queensland, to pay wharfage rates. The competing steamer favoured by New South Wales would be free from this burden, and that undoubtedly would be a very serious interference with Inter-State free-trade. Such a thing as this Harbour Trust regulation ought not to be tolerated, as undoubtedly repugnant to the principle of Inter-State free-trade. If that be so-and I presume it will be generally conceded that such a regulation will interfere with Inter-State free trade, and be undue favouritism to a certain class of steamers-does that not furnish another, and a very strong argument indeed, in favour of the Inter-State Commission being established for the purpose of dealing with difficulties and anomalies of this kind that are not supposed to be tolerated by the Constitution 1 not he challenged in a court of justice t",36,Malcolm Mceachakn I Do Not Be Possible Though Not Perhaps Probable
105,Sir John Quick,It certainly looks,37,Regulations Under Sydney Harbour Trust Act 1900
106,Mr Glynn,"Are these regulations notearlier, these laws may be bad and unconstitutional, but the question is, who is to set them aside ? ""Who is to take the initiative in order to quash them ? Does the honourable and learned member wish to impose on private citizens tlie initiative of fighting a big constitutional battle ? Where is the private citizen who will undertake to fight the State of New South Wales on a big question such as this, or on other great questions somewhat similar? It is expecting too much from private citizens that they should rush into the arena and fight these battles. If a private citizen did so, he might be met with the contention mission is the guardian of Inter-State free-trade, and that the commission is the body charged by the Constitution with the duty as well as the right of executing and maintaining laws with reference to freedom of trade. Inasmuch as the Constitution contemplates an Inter-State Commission, I think the House will have to give effect to the meaning and intention of the Constitution in some form or other. I do not say that we ought to accept tha Bill absolutely in the shape in which it has been presented ; but I do say that we ought to accept the Billi n substance, and that it is advisable and necessary that the InterState Commission should be constituted by Act of Parliament to perform the duties contemplated by the Constitution. Even if we pass a Bill containing only the bald words of the Constitution, declaring that there shall be an Inter-State Commission to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth with reference to trade and commerce, it will be quite enough. As far as the control of the Inter-State Commission over railways is concerned it is practically embodied in clause 16 of this Bill. That clause is really the heart of this Bill, so far as it contains any definition or grant of power, and honourable members will see that it merely repeats almost word for word the terms of the Constitution itself. It says that there shall be an Inter-State Commission practically to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth. Now, what are the laws of the Commonwealth? If we look at section 102 of the Constitution we shall see what are the laws contemplated. By clause 16 it is provided that the Inter-State Commission shall have power . to deal with the rates on the State railways, and the provision practically takes the form of a prohibition. That is the constitutional form. The Constitution says that the Parliament may forbid preferences and discriminations to be given by the States, but until Parliament moves by passing a Bill that power is dormant. Section 102 will not' come into operation until it is set in motion by this Parliament, and the object of clause 16 is practically to bring into operation the latent power of the Constitution. Yet we are told that there is no necessity for this Bill, or for the InterState Commission. Until this Parliament legislates, the prohibitions contained in section 102 of the Constitution are latent that the Inter-State Comand have no force whatever, and the railway authorities of the three States, Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, may go on passing their preferential or differential rates in.the same way as they have done for the last 40 years. Mr O'MALLEY -Yes; slaughtering InterState free-trade. justice could prevent that. ferred by section 102 of the Constitution cannot be exercised until they are brought into operation by this Parliament. Sir JOHN QUrCK -There may be other provisions of the Constitution which are open to argument, and about those I will express no formal opinion ; but the power contemplated by section 102 will not be brought into operation until this Parliament takes action by passing this or some other corresponding Bill. Clause 16 brings this power into operation, because it forbids that which the Constitution contemplates as being forbidden. It provides that;It shall not be lawful for any State or for any State railway authority to give or make upon any railway the property of the State, iu respect of external or Inter-State commerce, or so as to affect such commerce, any preference or discrimination which is undue and unreasonable or unjust to any State. Now, there is nothing in any other part of the Constitution which corresponds with these prohibitions. What is wanted is something to bring them into operation, and there is no other way than by passing a B ill of the Federal Parliament. I am aware that there is a declaration in the Constitution that on and after a certain date trade and intercourse between the States shall be",37,Regulations Under Sydney Harbour Trust Act 1900

The only other matter which has been referred to is as to the order of business next week. Naturally the Budget will come first, and the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill will be dealt with.
