The right honourable gentleman is represented to have said that he cannot see the advantage of having representatives of the Dominions upon the Imperial Defence Council, who would sooner or later be out of touch with those they represented, and would thus become dead channels through which the policy of their Governments would not flow. Does that represent the views of this Government on the matter? substantially correct epitome of what I said. I have always expressed the view that a live Minister alone can reflect the opinions of an Australian Government, and that no delegated person remaining in Great Britain could do what is necessary to provide the safeguards required for Australian and Empire defence. Ministers on the Committee now. that we are represented on the Committee of Defence, but that representation is not the sort of thing referred to by the Daily News. What the cablegram refers to is the delegation of power to speak for Australia to a person not possessing Ministerial office.

I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he and his colleagues have considered what power is given to us by the Constitution to prohibit the employment of aliens, and whether we can prohibit their employment in the furniture-making trade and other industries, as well as the sugar industry, in which it is desirable that they should be prevented from competing with white workers ? of a legal opinion on the subject, which, time to consider.

In Committee: (Consideration resumed from 26th September, vide page 3555.) Clause1 agreed to. Clause 2This Act shall commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation. I have not addressed myself to this Bill before, but I have taken a great interest in the discussion on the second reading; and, in my opinion, there is room for amendment in this clause. debate the opinion has been expressed by those well qualified to judge, that there is grave doubt as to the constitutionality of the measure. member will not be in order in discussing the constitutionality of the measure on this clause, which deals only with the commencement. propose affects the constitutionality of the Bill, its object being to postpone the proclamation until the High Court has had an opportunity to say whether or not the Bill is constitutional. The amendment, if carried, can cause but little delay; and it would be far better to have that delay than to have the Bill passed and put into operation, and then declared to be ultra vires. ""This would place us in a far worse position than if we take the precaution I am now suggesting. Honourable members opposite ought to listen to my reasonable proposal, because it will be remembered that in the session of 1910 there was passed, at the instance of this Government, a Bill amending the Judiciary Act in such a way as to permit measures to be submitted to the High Court for en opinion as to their validity. One section in that Act is as followsWhenever the Governor General refers to the High Court for hearing and determination any question of law as to the validity of any Act or enactment of the Parliament, the High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. I do not know that that is a very wise piece of legislation, and I did not approve of it when it was introduced; but it is 1 now the law, and I contend that, under the circumstances, the Government ought to make use of it. So far as I know, the amended Judiciary Act has never been put into operation; but this, in my opinion, is a very fitting occasion to do so. There does not seem to be much conflict of opinion as to our power to appropriate money under the Maternity Allowance B ill ; but, so far as I can gather, every lawyer in the Chamber is satisfied that the Commonwealth will experience great difficulty when they come to provide machinery for the distribution of the grant. Under all the circumstances, such an amendment as I suggest would be preferable to rushing forward headlong with this measure only to find subsequently that it is unconstitutional. ber does not regard the amended Judiciary During the Act as a piece of wise legislation. ciary Act is in existence, and I cannot understand why the Government do not seem at all anxious to take advantage of a law passed at their own instance. Even if the amended Judiciary Act is not commendable in a general sense, it may pos : sibly be of use in some cases such as the present one. It would seem, however, that honourable members opposite have forgotten that such an Act is on the statute book. If the High Court hold that the Bill is of doubtful validity it would be the easiest thing in the world, after the debate we have had, to pass an amended measure to carry out the object we have in view. We are all in favour of doing something for the womanhood of Australia at the time of childbirth, and no one recognises more than I do the value to the",16,Dissent From Speaker S Ruling

53,Sir John Forrest,"I do not thinkproperly lo the highest judicial Court in the country. It is, on matters of law-and to this no possible exception can be taken-the last Conrt of Appeal. But in another direction it exercises functions of quite a different nature. Although nominally inferior to this Legislature, in reality it has shown, over and. over again, not merely in this country, But more particularly in the United States of America, that it is above and superior to, not only the Parliament, but, what is yet more important, the constitutionally expressed will of the people. I admit at once that it is inevitable that there must be such a body to determine the respective limitations of the States and the Commonwealth, and that it will never do for us to contemplate for a moment a condition of things in which the Stales and the Commonwealth may make what laws they please irrespective of the extent to which either may trespass upon the other's sphere. Consider how absurd and unnecessary is the position that has arisen whereby a Court created principally-and I speak now not of its functions as a Court of Appeal for private litigants-to determine the constitutional authobeing done to the Commonwealth, to the States, rity of State or Federal Statutes is unable to move until some private individual who considers that he has suffered an injustice, or a State authority which is interested, brings an action which the validity of a Statute is incidentally determined. As a fact, the Court never directly determines the validity of any Statute; it merelv deals with it in connection with the facts of the case brought before it. A litigant thinks that he has suffered a wrong, and appeals to the Court for a remedy. If the wrong be one for which there is a legal remedy, and one it is in the power of the Court to apply, and the plaintiff deserves relief, he will succeed, and incidentally the Court may declare that a particular Statute is or is not ultra vires. That is to say, that the Court especially created to determine the validity of Commonwealth and Slate laws, does in fact never directly decide the constitutionality of any such laws. This is not a proper and sensible procedure for a great and growing nation like ours to continue, and it is the purpose of the measure to substitute for this cumbrous, antiquated method of determining the validity of any Statutes, one which, on the face of it, will more speedily and effectively inform us as to the constitutionality of a measure, enabling the Court to give a calm, dispassionate, and impartial decision upon this one point, without the complication of personal relations and personal wrongs. The Attorney-General will be able to ask Ihe Court the plain question, "" Is this measure one which it is within the power of the Parliament to nass?"" and we shall get from the Court a straightforward answer. I ask honourable members to consider the net result of ten years' experience of the present system, and the amount of money spent and time wasted on sporadic efforts to determine what the law really is. . If there has always been need for a simpler method of testing the validity of Statutes, the present need is twice as great. We have a crop Sir John Forrest. of new legislation as important at least as any that preceded it, and in many cases inviting questions as to validity. Obviously, the plain, sensible, business-like course, where a Court has been created and charged specially with the duty of deciding what are the limitations which the Constitution imposes, is to empower the Commonwealth to go straight to the Court, and ask whether a Statute is or is not valid. This Bill has for its object the giving of the necessary authority to enable that course to be taken. But even if we admit for a moment that these duties are extra-judicial duties-no t usually thrown upon the Judges of a CourtI submit that we have a perfect right to ask the Judges to perform them. For clearly they are functions that cannot be exercised by any one else. And assuredly they ought to be exercised by somebody. But the Bill supplements existing rights, and does not take any away. It removes uncertainty, obviates delay, and prevents injustice or to individuals. I think I have quoted enough to show that, when he introduced that Bill, the Attorney General thoroughly approved of the procedure there proposed. He said the Court was specially created to determine the validity of Commonwealth and State laws. I believe that if this Bill is referred to the High Court it will be proved to be beyond our powers.. It appropriates where it has no power to appropriate. It is not similar to the Surplus Revenue Act, where the appropriation was for purposes authorized by the Constitution. This Bill appropriates for purposes not enumerated among our powers in the Constitution. I believe that it is not constitutional. I assure the Committee that I am not taking this attitude for party purposes. It is simply because I believe the Bill is not within our powers. It deals with a matter that is not given to us to legislate upon, and therefore I feel very strongly that it is an attempt to invade an arena of usefulness or political activity that does not belong to us. Believing that, I regard it as my bounden duty to support the amendment. We should, at any rate, have the opportunity of obtaining a decision removing all doubt and all chance of litigation, because, depend upon it, it is open to the State Governments, if they like, to question the validity of the Bill. They are particularly interested, because they are being deprived by the Bill of some revenue that might be surplus revenue to them; and it is being devoted to a purpose which they may fairly and rightly claim belongs to them. 1 have much pleasure in supporting the proposal that the Bill, before it comes into operation, should be referred to the High Court for its decision under Act 34 of 1910, which was introduced by the present Government for the very purpose that we are now seeking to accomplish. It is remarkable that, whilst so many members are in sympathy with the measure, every means is being adopted for the purpose of delaying it. For the first time, I suppose, in the history of the Federal Parliament we have heard that it is desirable to make application to the High Court to test the constitutionality of legislation it, and, if that be so, it is time enough before it is put into operation. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Did not your Government pass that Act? vernment passed it, and, strange to say, the Opposition, who never thought of it before, now that it suits their purpose are endeavouring to have it applied to this Bill. Why? Because in this case there does not appear to be any possibility of an appeal being made by any outside person. This is humane legislation. It does not come up so much against vested interests. Had it done so we should not have heard this plea put before the Committee. There would have been sufficient private interests affected to test the legislation in the High Court, but in this case what individual or company or syndicate would be likely to bring an action in the High Court against the measure? The answer is that there is no party that would consider it desirable to test its constitutionality. would. member for Swan has consistently held that the Bill is an interference with the privileges and rights of the States; and that it is unconstitutional, inasmuch as its to defeat the Bill, are now bringing forpurpose is not enumerated among the powers of the Commonwealth in the Constitution. He has throughout taken up that position. But does he think that a"" measure of this kind will not be beneficial to the States as well as to the Federation? Does he think that any State Government would take exception to .the Government of the Commonwealth spending money in connection with a maternity allowance? I do not think that there is in Australia any Government so inhuman as to raise an objection with the purpose of testing this legislation in the High Court. If any State Government is prepared to do so, it must be prepared to take the responsibility. It will have to reckon with the people of the Statei f it takes up any such attitude in respect of legislation of this kind, and I have no doubt that in the end it will be called upon to pay the penalty. In the circumstances, therefore, I believe that there is no likelihood of any appeal being made to the High Court as to the unconstitutionality of this legislation. I am advised by the Attorney-General, and the Department over which he has control, that we have the constitutional power to pass for honourable members to suggest that the decision of the High Court should be obtained when some one outside is prepared to make an appeal to the Court. If this Bill were likely to affect any particular outside interest, no doubt its constitutionality would be tested in the High Court, just as the constitutionality of other measures has been tested by the Shipping Combine and various other bodies. In this case, however,, the question would not be raised except by a State Government, and even that is a very remote possibility. It has been urged that the granting of the maternity allowance will interfere with the surplus revenues of the States. I think, however, that the State Governments may make up their minds at once that there is going to be very little surplus revenue. The obligations of tlie Commonwealth are so expanding that we shall require all that we get to carry out our undertakings. The State Governments, therefore, may make up their minds that they are not likely to receive anything beyond the present per capita payments. There is no prospect of any appeal being made to the Court against this humane piece of legislation; and for that reason, and that alone, those who endeavoured last night ward this amendment in order to delay its coming into operation, because they do not wish to see it made law. member in order in imputing that the Opposition are endeavouring to delay this Bill, and are bringing forward this amendment solely with that object in view?

I fail to understand why, if honourable members of the Opposition, like those supporting the Government, are in favour of the principle-as they say they are-the y should raise this question for the first time, unless it is that they hope to obtain a decision of the High Court which would destroy the Bill, and probably have some effect in connection with the next general election. that the amendment is brought forward because the Opposition anticipate that no outside body or individual is likely to make any appeal to the High Court in respect of the Bill, inasmuch as it does not affect any particular individual or corporation.

H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [11.20]. -The attitude of the Prime Minister in holding that the Government must accept the conclusions of the Attorney-General as to the constitutionality of a Government measure is one with which no one can quarrel. The responsibility of the Attorney-General with regard to the limits of our constitutional power is greater by far than is that of any other member of the House. that the Attorney-General, being clothed with such responsibility, ought not finally to make up his"" mind regarding the constitutionality of any measure until he has had an opportunity to hear and give effect to other legal opinion in the House. He himself will admit, I think, that if , during the During the whole time that I have been a discussion, any serious doubt is thrown upon the constitutionality of the measure it is his duty, not merely to the Government, but to the whole House, to give consideration to the arguments that may be advanced. I am not enamoured of the Act which was passed by the present Government to enable a request to be made to the High Court to express opinions in a nonjudicial capacity as to the validity of Acts of the Commonwealth Parliament before In my 'opinion, it questions have arisen in connection with them for determination in the ordinary judicial way. The judicial functions of the Court are entirely confined to the determination of questions which arise in the ordinary judicial way. by the High Court on such a reference as is now proposed would be just as binding as would a decision given in the ordinary way. Mr W. H . IRVINE -I express this opinion subject to some doubt, but it is open to question whether the High CourtI believe would undertake the functions thus imposed upon it, and whether, if it did, those functions could be called judicial. A similar question has arisen under a Canadian Act by which, if I remember rightly, the Privy Council is authorized to determine matters of this sort or to answer questions put to it. My recollection is that the Privy Council has declared that any opinion which it might give under that Act would not be a judicial determination, and would not bind any one if a question were raised in tlie ordinary way for judicial determination. Mr W. H . IRVINE -But little value except as a means of obtaining an opinion to guide the Parliament. given, in a non-judicial way, by the High Court, after hearing evidence, would be the same as one given in a case coming before it in the ordinary way. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Probably it would be, but not necessarily. It would not bind judicial decision. That is the weakness of the Judiciary Act of 1910. But I think But the point that I wish to make is that if that Act is of any value the case now before us is one eminently suitable for its application. I am as reluctant as is any honourable member to express an opinion that would curtail the powers, and especially the financial powers, of the Parliament. member of this HouseI have been particularly desirous to assert to the full the",20,Maternity Allowance Bill

63,Mr Fenton,"But surely a decisionfinancial rights and privileges of this Parliament. with this Bill a matter concerning which I am not going to express an opinion, but regarding which I am going to show there are reasons for serious doubt, and that there are strong practical reasons why that doubt should be settled during the financial year. The American Constitution gives Congress an express power to appropriate public revalues for "" the welfare of the United States."" There is no residuary provision, no right, given to any one to any surplus revenue or any money not appropriated. The question whether that general power authorizes Congress to appropriate moneys to any purpose it chose has been a matter of considerable discussion in the United States of America. No judicial decision has been given so far as I am aware, but undoubtedly from the time of that great jurist, Mr Justice Story, to the present day, the great bulk of authority has been in favour of the proposition that the United States Parliament, once the money goes into the exchequer, has unlimited power of. appropriation. . That is undoubtedly so. who dispute the view; but the great authority of Mr Justice Story, and of subsequent writers, has been urged in its favour. limited within the enumerated powers? Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. It is also true that we have adopted the general scheme of the American Constitution, and that is a strong argument in favour of the contention that the principle which has practically been sanctioned by all the leading writers in the United States should apply to this Parliament, and that we too should have a general and unlimited power of appropriation of moneys once they come into the exchequer. ments are strongly in favour of this unlimited power. have certain express provisions in our Constitution giving the States a clear and legally enforceable right to the payment of surplus moneys not appropriated to Commonwealth purposes. Constitution provides thatAl l revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one consolidated revenue fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of th ; Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. and the question arises whether that means But there arises in connection any purpose whatever to which we choose to apply them. Prima facie, one would think that it does not, but still there is the great weight of American authority to support such a position. When we come to the sections dealing with the rights of the States we find that in the first place section 93 provides thatDuring the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise providesthe duties on goods passing from one State to another shall be adjusted, under paragraph 1, in a certain way, and11. Subject to the last sub-section, the Commonwealth shall credit revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to the several States as prescribed, for the period preceding the imposition of uniform duties of Customs. That is to say, during the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides, there is to be an express payment to the States of the balance of the unappropriated revenue of the Commonwealth. Section 94 saysThere are some writers After five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. Having regard to that specific residuary right given to the States, there is some reason for thinking, and it is considerably fortified by the expressions of some of the learned Justices of the High Osurt in the Tasmanian case, that the States possess an absolute right to all moneys not appropriated for Commonwealth purposes, and that therefore a limitation is necessarily imposed on Commonwealth purposes. To see what Commonwealth purposes are, you have to look to the legislative powers given to the Commonwealth Parliament. I should be sorry to express a definite opinion on the So far, the argusubject, and do not say that the view which I have put forward would necessarily be On the other hand, we the determination of the High Court. But the Attorney-General, in the highly responsible position which he occupies towards this Committee, as well as towards the Government, might have favoured us with Section 81 of the . more definite reasons for assuming that the provisions of the measure are included within the Commjonwealth powers. He merely gave us the bald statement that the measure is constitutional, and there was an end of it. We are entitled to more than his mere ipse dixit.

64,Mr Hughes,"That Congress is notopinion, but I desire that it should be supported by some definite reasons. This is not a light matter, and I entirely repudiate the suggestion that the question has been raised to delay the consideration of the Bill. The delay occasioned in making a reference to the High Court would be extremely short, because the matter could be brought at once before the Court to be determined during its present sitting, to which, no doubt, as a matter of urgency, the Court would agree. member think that the States weakened their claim on the surplus revenues of the Commonwealth by accepting the annual payment of 25s. per head of population? is an Act of this Parliament. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is an answer to the question, and another is that that Act expressly reserves to the States the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth not appropriated by this Parliament, in addition to providing for the payment referred to. It all comes back to this : What is the meaning of "" appropriated "" under section 81 ? No Act that we may pass, even though the States may assent to it, can deprive them of their Constitutional rights. The question is: Have we given a sensible reading to the Constitution? Our reading may be the only one. We may be absolutely governed by the expression of opinion df American jurists on a similar Constitution. But is it certain, or almost certain, that the States have no power whatever to say that we must confine our expenditure to Commonwealth purposes. Are we so sure of that, that it is not desirable to obtain a definite opinion on the matter? I have very little hope that the Attorney General will reconsider his definitely-pronounced opinion, but I have considered it my duty to place the difficulties of the situaif the Government promised to do what we tion before the Committee. This Bill is not like an ordinary measure, which might be ultra vires, and in regard to which measures Ministers have more than once asked Parliament to chance their constitutionality. If we are wrong in assuming the Bill to be constitutional, and during this financial year spend money in giving effect to its ""provisions, the States will be entitled to compel us, through the High Court, to repay to them the sums so expended. quickly get Unification. legal, we could pay the money into a Trust Fund for general Commonwealth purposes. Mr W. H . IRVINE I think that I am responsible for the first suggestion that a Trust Fund should be created. It was on my advice to this Chamber, subsequently fortified by the High Court, that the power to make general appropriations was adopted and exercised, and I do not intend to attempt to cut down that power. We, undoubtedly, have the right to appropriate for some other purpose, provided that purpose is within our constitutional powers, but if we proceed with this Bill, any State may have the right to say, "" You are bound to pay to the States the balance of the moneys not appropriated by you for Commonwealth purposes."" The States may have a right enforcible at law to compel the Commonwealth Treasury to repay to them the sums paid out by way of maternity allowances. surplus. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. If tlie Attorney-General is not right, if his view is not certain to be right, can we contemplate any case in which it would be more desirable to have the matter determined before the Exchequer proceeds to make a payment ? I should think that the Government, to secure the stability of its financial operations for this year, ought to embrace the opportunity to obtain an authoritative opinion on the point. Opinions have been expressed by lawyers on both sides of the chamber which are contradictory. I have not expressed any definite view. be decided without the carrying of the amendment ? Mr W. H . IRVINE I have not a copy of the Judiciary Act before me, but ask, it would remove all difficulty, and I would advise the honourable member for Wilmot to withdraw his amendment. Ministers might reasonably, before committing themselves to this course, ask for an opportunity to ascertain whether the High Court would promptly determine the matter. Seeing that a considerable body of legal opinion entertains the strongest doubt as to the constitutionality of the Bill-and I am aware that some very high authorities outside strongly hold the view that it is unit is desirable to fortify our position by an",22,Maternity Allowance Bill

General) [11.40] -The amendment is one with which I cannot agree, and which I hope will not be adopted. It is proposed that before the measure takes effect it shall be referred to the High Court under the provisions of the Judiciary Act of 1910 to determine its validity. There appears to be doubt in the minds of some honourable members as to our power to appropriate moneys for the purposes of the Bill, and we are asked to invite the High Court to declare its views on the matter. Let us fir-st consider the practical effect of accepting the amendment. It was the intention of those who oppose the measure, biid support the amendment, to make provision for a much larger expenditure than the Bill proposes. They wished to engraft on the. measure a scheme involving an expenditure quite unknown, but certainly very large, and with possibilities infinitely greater than those with which we are confronted. Mr W. H . IRVINE -I s that relevant to the amendment? asked to say that there is doubt as to our power to appropriate money for the purposes of the Bill. To agree to the amendment would be, in the first place, to cause delay. To that we may fairly take serious exception. But there is another objection to the course proposed which should be emphasized. It is only in the last extremity, when the Parliament and the Crown have grave doubts as to the constitutionality of proposed legislation, that the High Court should be invited to express an opinion upon it. Under a Federal Constitution the Judiciary has its well-defined place, and performs necessary and valuable functions, but for Parliament to legislate under the censorship, as it were, of the High Court, would be, in effect, to make that body a third Chamber of the Legislature, which I decline to allow. When the Judiciary Bill of 1910 was before the House, honourable members opposite expressed grave doubts as to its constitutionality, but a recent Privy Council case has, I think, placed the matter beyond doubt. Mr W. H . IRVINE I hope so. mined that the High Court may fairly be asked to give an opinion under the circumstances set forth in the Judiciary Act. In' doing so, the Court merely declares the law, and advises the Crown. The Judiciary Act provides an excellent and necessary expedient, and I do not apologize for having been responsible for it. But it ought not to be resorted to unless there is the gravest reason for doubting the constitutionality of a proposed law. To invite the opinion of the High Court upon every measure, the constitutionality of which is questioned by its opponents, would be not only improper, but dangerous to democratic government. I now come to the question of the validity of this proposal. The honourable member for Flinders, whose opinion on points of law I always accept with, the greatest possible respect, has stated that in the United States the power of appropriation is unlimited; and I have no doubt in my own mind that that is also our position. No doubt duties and limitations are cast upon us by the Constitution, but, subject to these, we may appropriate money for any purpose we please. Let us assume for a moment how a case under this Bill may come before the Court. A woman applies for the money, and is refused; the matter comes before the Courts; what has the High Court to consider? It has to consider whether the woman is within the Statute, and whether the Statute is a valid exercise of our power. If the point is taken that the appropriation of this money is for a purpose not within the Commonwealth's sphere, the Court has to determine what that sphere is. It is not contended that if this money be not appropriated for the present purpose it will be handed over to the States; because, by an Act passed during the currency of this Parliament, there was substituted for the provisions of section 87 of the Constitution, a payment of 25s. per head to the States, and, I take it, all the rights of the States to unappropriated Commonwealth moneys are thus satisfied. It is perfectly true that there must be an appropriation --that there cannot be moneys at large, but they must be appropriated and for a lawful purpose. The only purpose that could be unlawful is one under an illegal appropriation; that is to say, an appropriation which had been agreed to by this Parliament in some other way than that which it is proper for this Parliament to agree to. For instance, it might be an appropriation which was not covered by a message, or was not passed by a majority, or there",23,Maternity Allowance Bill

Mr W. member is incapacitated for serious work when he is in Parliament, but he is not an invalid. must admit that many mothers have died as the result of maternity. It has been said that there are more lost in child-birth than on the battle-field. However, let us consider the constitutional point. The honourable member for Flinders desires that this Bill shall be referred to the High Court; and I suppose that he is animated by what, in other circumstances, would be a very noble desire-to find work for the unemployed. Many a time, when I was a member of the Queensland Parliament, and it was moved that a report be printed, I have said to myself that, though the document was hardly worth the trouble, it would, at all events, find employment for a few compositors. Apparently, the honourable member for Flinders is not satisfied with the glorious harvest that the legal profession has been reaping since the establishment of Federation. Some Australian barristers must now be earning many thousands of pounds per annum; and never before, I suppose, were such large incomes so earned. Is that what the honourable member proposes? Is he not satisfied with the number of cases appearing before the Courts-wit h the ,Â£10,000 spent in connection with the Boot Trade Union, and other arbitration cases?

88,Mr Higgs,"If I am imputing imnot apologize? apology is necessary, and I am sure the honourable member for Flinders does not think so. An apology is due from honourable members opposite to the Committee for the delay they are trying to effect. Babies are being born every day, and every day mothers are in want of the assistance which the Government desire to give them, yet the Opposition are trying to hold the measure up. What a spectacle we may anticipate if their desire to refer the measure to the High Court is carried out! Under one section in the Act of IQIO the High Court must inform every person who is affected of the case; and every person affected is entitled to appear before the Court. What sort of a building should we require if every person interested in the Bill wished to attend the hearing? Every person about to become a mother may approach the High Court, as she has an interest in this Bill. Where does the honourable member propose that the High Court should sit to inquire into the case? To deal with the matter from another stand-pointI find that we spend a lot of Commonwealth money on various things. If honourable members will turn to the Estimates, page 57, they will find that we are spending money on a Commonwealth literary fund. Where is there any provision in section 51 of the Constitution that we shall spend money in helping literary men who happen to want assistance? Are they invalids? honourable member rely on when he says that every one interested in this matter must be notified by the High Court, and that there would be endless delay in consequence ? will see the provision at page 91 of the Commonwealth Acts, volume 9, 1910, as follows:The High Court or a Justice may direct that any person, or class of persons, or association claiming to be interested in the matter shall be notified of the hearing of the matter, and be entitled to appear or be represented at the hearing. the High Court must do it. another question now. I find, among other items of expenditure, an annual payment to the International Agricultural Institute at Rome. If we can spend money to help an institution of that sort in Europe we can surely spend it to assist the mothers of the Commonwealth. Another expenditure is for the advancement of the study of diseases in tropical Australia. Under what heading is that money spent? There is a contribution to the funds of the Imperial Institute. By what section of the Constitution is that authorized ? There are items for an international bureau of public health, an international congress on entomology, and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and we are paying no less than Â£5,000 towards an Antarctic expedition under Dr. Mawson. There are expenditures for the repatriation of distressed Australians, and for the Hague Congress on social insurance. If we search the Commonwealth Constitution we shall not find a single one of the thirty-nine articles to which any one of those dozen items can be attached, if , as the honourable member for Flinders tells us, we cannot connect the question of a maternity allowance with the question of invalid and old-age pensions. I am inclined to accept the view of the Attorney General that there is a general power given to the Commonwealth to spend its money as it likes. That seems to be a common sense view. It is generally claimed by the legaj profession that the law is the embodiment of common sense, although we know that Charles Dickens had a different view when he wrote that "" The law is a hass."" It is surely the embodiment of common sense to say that the Commonwealth can spend its money as it likes, after making due provision for that part of the Consolidated Revenue which must be returned to the States. The honourable member for Flinders has said that if we spend this money the States may -take action against us. Is it reasonable to assume that they aie likely to do so if we spend money in this way? would collar every penny they could get hold of. assume that they will take action in this case, because during this debate I notice that neither the honourable member for Flinders, who outside the House described the proposal as political flypaper, nor any other honourable member on that side of the House, while using gross expressions outside, dares to come here and make user",26,Maternity Allowance Bill

He has said that it is a scheme to sap the self-reliance of the people.

108,The Chairman,"I ask the honor-Court. Let us see whether ""they will have ithe honesty and moral courage to proceed to a vote on the amendment to refer the BiU to the High Court. it later on, just as they have withdrawn other proposals. Mr J. H . CATTS -If they do they will show that the amendment was simply put forward to be ' debated for a couple of hours and so to delay the passing of the Bill to that extent. I rose merely to ask honourable members opposite whether they have the courage to vote for this amendment-whethe r they are prepared to place on record their votes in support of an amendment which means indefinitely hanging up this proposal with the idea of ultimately defeating it altogether. I must congratulate the honourable member for Cook, who has appealed to us to show our courage, upon the courage and wisdom he has displayed, because, although he opposed last night an amendment to provide for a scheme of general insurance he has since thought the matter over. .opposed to the principle of insurance. -statement that he was in favour of the principle, and it is interesting to find that he is jprepared now to address to the Minister a .request amounting practically to a direction that he should prepare a scheme of general insurance on the lines suggested last night by the Opposition. I admire his wisdom, judgment, and humanity, as well as his courage in taking this action; but I regret that-he did not help us yesterday by voting for the amendment to provide for a general insurance scheme. I have no desire to elaborate this question, for I am anxious to see the Bill passed as soon as possible. I have only to say that if this is not the class of Bill* intended to be referred to the High Court under the Judiciary Act of 1910, I cannot understand why that Act was passed. It was brought in by the present Government. The Prime Minister himself said, at the Hobart Conference, I think, that he doubted the constitutional power of the Parliament to carry measures of this kind, and if that is so I fail to see why he should object to the course we now suggest. to understand why the Attorney-General should object tn refer this measure to the High Court for an opinion as to its constitutionality. I strongly supported the Judiciary Act of 1910, believing that it would give us an opportunity to test the validity of Acts passed by this Parliament before trouble, and perhaps loss and injury to the Commonwealth, as well as to individuals, had arisen in connection with them. For private reasons I have not spoken on this subject this week, but I wish to say that I am a whole-hearted supporter of the Bill. I should be very glad to give my reasons for supporting the Bill in its original form if I would be permitted at this stage to do so. I favour the submission of the Bill to the High Court for the reason that I have heard that one very high constitutional authority believes that it is beyond our powers. That points to the fact that, sooner or later, the Bill will go before the High Court. An honourable member has said this morning that no State would dare to test the question and run the risk of being credited with the destruction of such a law. Knowing the feelings of some of the State Governments towards the Commonwealth, I am quite prepared to believe that they are prepared to do anything to destroy legislation passed by this Parliament, and to secure as much of the revenue of the Commonwealth as they can possibly obtain. We cannot forget their action in the wire netting case; we know also that they raised a test question with regard to the Surplus Revenue Act. We know the lengths to which they went in those cases, and we may be perfectly sure that they will test this question. They cannot do so, however, until the end of the financial year, when they may claim the surplus which they hold to be unexpended. If they do, and if it be held that the appropriation made for the purposes of the Bill was ultra vires, the money we shall have spent under it will be held to be surplus revenue, to which the States are entitled, and we shall have to pay it over to them. I , as a strong antiStates righter-as a strong supporter of Australian interests-woul d be very much aggrieved if the Â£250,000 that we bad expended under the Bill between this and the end of the financial year, and which, if we had known beforehand that we had no-power to expend it, would have been applied to other purposes, had to be handed over to the States. It has been said that this amendment is submitted to hring about delay. If we are to look for",28,Maternity Allowance Bill

As a strong supporter of the Bill, as one who believes in its constitutionality, I think that it would be well to submit it to the High Court in the first instance. If it were held to be illegal, it would be but another addition to the many cases that are hastening on the time when the public, without any request from the Labour party, will demand an amendment of the Constitution. The decision of the Court in the Vend case, the possible decision in the Royal Commissions Act case, and a possible decision as to the unconstitutionality of this Bill will make the public wonder whether there is any reason for keeping this Parliament in existence. They will come to the conclusion that if it is to be a Parliament should possess.

[12.56] I am not sure that the honourable member for Hunter has stated the position accurately, because I am rather inclined to think that the State Governments view with some concern the invasion of their legislative domain by the Federal Government. In some of the States, and particularly in New South Wales, the Government have evinced a desire to deal with this question, and they are certainly in the position to attain, in a much better way, the end in view. This legislation seems to savour of a desire-thoug h I do not say that such a desire exists-to push this Bill withdraw any forward with undue haste in order to anticipate anything the States may do in the same direction. In my opinion, the States should be encouraged in this work, seeing that they are much better equipped for it in the way of administrative machinery. fore us is whether the Bill should be referred to the High Court. am submitting reasons why a little delay, assuming diere be any, will not seriously jeopardize the operation of the measure, but will, on the other hand, be beneficial in permitting the States to perfect any measures they may contemplate. A reference to the High Court would give us an official pronouncement on the validity of the Bill, and, in the meantime, the' States would be enabled to introduce what measures they may deem, desirable.

It has been argued here by those learned in the law that we have not the machinery, and cannot create it under the Constitution, to carry through this maternity grant -^-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, If there is to be no discrimination, then the administration of the B ill is going to differ very materially from the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act, for instance. The strictest and most particular inquiries are instituted under that Act before an old man or woman is given any benefit. Do the Government intend under It has to be made by this B ill to exercise the same powers of inspection and control ? They do notgive any one a pension if it is thought that he cannot use it properly, but care is taken that somebody is set over the pensioner to see that the money is expended wisely on his .behalf. Are the Government going to set up any machinery of the kind in conT h is is a matter relating nexion with this Bill? To put an extreme case, which I do not know is so extreme after all, it is unfortunately too true that there are plenty of people who have no respect for themselves in these matters. I am speaking now of the submerged tenth, who will have children under the terms of this B ill , and therefore be entitled to the grant. OUnless great care is taken, the money in those cases will not get near the mother at all, except in the most formal I s it proposed to give way. It is very likely to go into the hands of the husband or some other person delegated by the mother to receive it , and be spent in vice, not reaching her at all. If the husband is a confirmed drunkard he will contrive to get hold of it, and there will be an end of it . ThereT h a t is satisfactory to are other ways in which the money can be squandered, the mother getting absolutely no benefit from it. What machinery have I do not believe there should be the Government ready for dealing with On the producsuch cases? Under the Old-age Pensions Act, if the Conduct of a pensioner is not what it should be, the Government have power to stop the pension. There are all sorts of aribitrary police powers under that Act to punish people who mis-use the vote, but there is no such machinery in this B ill. The payment is to be apparently an unconditional grant, irrespective altogether of the merits of the case. It is not an answer under this B ill to say that the production of the child is to be the authority for the payment of the money, because the PrimeM i i i -' ister expressly repudiated that idea. He said it is not a baby bonus at all, but is for the mother-to help and assist her. What guarantee has he that the mother will get the money, or that it will be spent for her benefit and comfort? Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [2.23]. has put his finger upon a weak point in connection with the whole B ill , and especially with this clause.

208,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"the Bill, but there is no constitutional power that the Government, in framing the reguto discriminate. We have not here, as we have under the special power to grant invalid and old-age pensions, the power to make laws incidental to the grant. That power includes power to create all the machinery necessary to discriminate between those to whom we grant old-age pensions and those to whom we do not grant them. In this case,' assuming that we have the power of appropriation, we have no other power, and we cannot have discrimination unless we have the power to compel people to make returns and the power to punish those who make fraudulent returns. Therefore, even if we have the power to appropriate the money, we have no power to impose penalties on anybody for fraud in connection with the Bill. We have no power to do anything which imposes any obligation whatever on anybody in connection with the Bill. All we can do is to shell out the money-to give it out indiscriminatelyassuming that we have that power. We cannot create machinery in this connection imposing an obligation on any person. Under the Canadian Constitution the central Parliament is invested with a general power of making laws with regard to criminal offences. We have no such power. Therefore, we can justify the creation of an offence or imposition of a penalty only by some special power given to us by the Constitution. No special power is given to us by the Constitution to grant maternity allowances. If the Attorney-General's bold argument, that maternity allowances come under invalid pensions, was correct, then we should have the power, because we have power to do everything incidental to the granting of invalid pensions. Unless, however, the making of the allowance comes under any of our stipulated powers, we have no authority to impose any civil or criminal obligation on any person in the community in connection with the payment of it. The most favorable interpretation of the Constitution is that we have power to dole out this money, but we have no power to impose any penalties in connection with frauds regarding it, or to oblige any person to make a return as to his means or circumstances, or to punish him for false returns. Not only does the Bill not discriminate, but we have no power to provide for discrimination. Mr J. H .

CATTS I hope it will be provided that, where possible, the mother shall collect the money with her own hands. The objections that are being raised to this Bill could be raised against the Old-age 1 Pensions Act. If an old-age pensioner is under somebody else's influence he can collect the money and hand it over to such person, and have no control over its expenditure afterwards. It is not possible, even under the Old-age Pensions Act, to provide against abuses of that kind. It is all very well to raise objections, but the thing is to find some means of obviating them. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is what we cannot do. Mr J. H . CATTS -The objections from the Opposition, therefore, do not help us. when they do help. Mr J. H . CATTS -Any number of suggestions are accepted byWs side of the House, but it is admitted in this case that all the Opposition can do is to point out difficulties which, no doubt, we see ourselves. They cannot provide any means of overcoming them. The honourable member for South Sydney referred to the administration of the measure. In the payment of old-age and invalid pensions, and in various other directions, the Government takes a paternal attitude and seeks to offer assistance to various classes of the community. Mr W. H .

The proper way to extend it to the white women of Papua is through the agency of the Legislative Council of that Territory; and we are quite in favour of giving that Council an appropriation sufficient to cover the payment of the allowance for which this Bill provides. The honourable member should not allow his enthusiasm to run away with his discretion. member of the Government which brought in the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Bill, but it did not occur to him to make in connection with that Bill the provision that he suggests should be made in this to meet Papuan conditions. should like to say that there is no proposal to create under this Bill a new administrative staff. Allen, Secretary to the Treasury, to act as Commissioner, and the Assistant Secbecome Deputy Commissioner. They will carry out their duties under this Bill in addition to those which they are at present discharging. I do not believe that the administrative expenses will amount to much more than \ per cent. They certainly will not amount to 1 per cent. The revenue of Australia is collected at a cost of less than 3 per cent., and the administration of the old-age pensions law costs less than 2 per cent., so that honourable members will recognise that no proposal could be on a more sound economic basis than is this, under which 97 per cent, of the people's money will reach those whom the Bill is designed to assist. We intend to use the machinery at present available through our own officers, and, to make doubly sure that the women who are entitled to this allowance shall actually receive it in their own hands, it will be sent to them in the shape of a document which can be negotiated only when their signatures have been attached to it. -Although the Prime Minister said that the position of Papua had been considered by the Government, this important issue has not previously been raised during the whole of the debate on the Bill. I wish to point out a remarkable inconsistency on the part of the Government. Very strong objection has been taken by honourable members opposite to the State Governments, which are elected upon the same franchise as our own, being used in any way in connection with the administration of the maternity allowance, yet the Prime Minister now states that it is intended to hand overt to a nominee Legislative Council-member s of which are appointed for life-the entire control of these payments in Papua.

The right honourable gentleman told us that the allowance was to be paid in each case by postal note, and he has said that the cost of administration will not be much more than \ per cent. He proposes, however, to administer this law by adding to the already very onerous duties of the Secretary and Assistant Secretary to the Treasury, who have quite enough to do if they are to manage the finances of the Commonwealth efficiently. These gentlemen have already had imposed upon them the duty of administering the old-age pensions law, and they are to have the further duty of seeing to the proper application of maternity allowances. This is absolutely beyond their ability, especially if the point of the honourable member for Flinders can be sustained. They cannot look to the proper expenditure of the money, because they have no power to make inquiries into applications, or in other directions, to see that the intention of Parliament is carried out. The Prime Minister's friends may say, "" We accept your expression of good intentions,"" but we are entitled to more than that.

In a previous speech he made a very unfair attack on the honourable member for Darling Downs because of his criticism of the Bill respecting the omission to apply its provisions, to Papua. He taunted the honourable member with having been a member of a Government which neglected to apply the provisions of the old-age pensions law to Papua. But, in so doing, he showed that he is not acquainted with the provisions of the Act which he is administering. In 1909 the Fusion Government took steps to declare a white resident of Papua to be a resident of Australia for the purposes of the old-age pensions administration.

Clause agreed to. Clause ft (Grant of maternity allowance). The clause contains a general provision for every woman who gives birth to a child under certain conditions. I think this is perhaps the first occasion in our parliamentary life on which a direct grant of money has been paid to a certain class of persons without any discrimination, and with only the one condition, viz., that of motherhood. In our other Acts we provided a good many conditions, especially in that relating to old age and invalid pensions. A great many of those conditions are based on the assumption that there is need for the payment. A limit of income is fixed above which the pension is not payable; but in this measure there appears to be no such provision, and every mother, whether rich or fairly rich, moderately well off, or in need, is to receive the amount. It is quite true that application has to be made for it, We are now beginning to recogbut I wonder that the Government went even so far as that. I wonder it is not provided that people must take the money. The reason for this policy, as stated by the Prime Minister, looks on the face of it fairly good, but it will not stand examination. He seems to think that if the payment is not made general there will be what he called a taint of charity about it. I do not think it is any disgrace to be poor. At any rate, we are always saying that it is not. We cannot all be affluent, and from the beginning to the end we shall have those who are in need as well as those who are not.

I see no reason why those who are able to pay for anything they want should not be made to do so. I do not see why the people of this country should pay for them. We often hear that the humbler classes of the communityI mean those who are not so rich as others-pa y most of the taxation. If they do, I do not see why they should be taxed to support people or the children of people who are wealthy enough to pay for themselves. I should not legislate in a direction that would give the latter an opportunity of accepting such assistance. It is only a pretence to say that they will not take it. If they will not take it, why put it into the law? Why hoodwink the people by saying that this is a law applicable to everybody, but that only a few will take advantage of it? But in this case I cannot see why we should go out of our way to provide money from the public chest for those who have no right to take it, and ought not to have the opportunity to obtain it. So far as I know, this very generous, open-handed Government are giving that which no one has asked for. I have never heard that those who are not in want have asked for legislation to give them a maternity allowance, nor have I heard that the people who are in need, and who will probably take the allowance, which I hope will do them good, have asked for it. The Government seem to have been looking about for something beneficent to do, and determined to do it, not caring whether it was within their power or not. We have asked that this matter should be investigated, but our request was refused. The Prime Minister says he is quite satisfied that it is all right. He takes no more notice of the opinion of the eminent authowe want a great deal more than we are rities that he has heard here as to the law than if that opinion was vouchsafed by some one with no knowledge of the subject. the most profound respect, but I stand by the Attorney-General in this matter. member does not seem to pay any respect to their views. If ever there was a volte face in this House, it is that of the Attorney General in his speech to-day as compared with the speech he made two years ago when introducing the Judiciary Bill. On that occasion he seems to have said exactly what I should have expected him to say, but to-day he throws his previous utterance to the winds. The reference of a measure to the High Court was all right, in his opinion, so long as it was used in the way that he liked; but now that it is proposed to be used in a way that does not suit him, it is quite a different story. I hope that those who are not in need, and who have no right to receive assistance from the general public on the occasions to which the Bill refers, will not apply for the allowance. If I had my way, I should not give them tbe opportunity; but, as I cannot have my way, I hope the Prime Minister will be able to announce .later on that what he thought would be the case has happened, and that the right has not been availed of by such people. If that is so, there will be no harm done from my point of view, because we shall not be taxing the people of the country to provide for those who do not require it. We must remember that we have other things to do with the money that we raise by taxation.

The question would be whether a man earning Â£200 a year, or Â£300 a year, or Â£500 a year, should be entitled to the allowance or not. Where are the Government going to draw the line? When it is drawn, there are bound to be many hardships. drawn a man who was previously above the line may be underneath it, and there will be all sorts of complications. Some people may say that the wife of a man in constant employment should not have the right to receive the maternity allowance, because her husband can provide for her and their family. If that were given effect to, there would be continuous appeals from one end of the country to the other. The simplest and fairest way is not to discrimibirth registration certificate in nearly all nate between rich and poor, but to give the allowance to every woman in the Commonwealth who brings a child into the world. That is the policy of this party; and, when the Bill is passed, I am sure that the members of the Opposition, who have on the whole treated the Bill very fairly, will see that it is the simplest way to bring about even-handed justice.

The fraudulent production of such a certificate would, of course, be an offence under the Act. [3.35] I suppose that it is useless to attempt to second the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan with regard to the indiscrimination of this grant; but the more I think over it, the more does it occur to me to be an absurd way of dealing with public money. It is often claimed by the Government, and members of their party, that the workers are contributing most of the taxation of the country. Only the other night, in another place, the same argument was developed. It was said by one of the members of the Caucus, that the workers were paying up to 20 per cent, of their total earnings toward the taxation of the country. In view of the heavily laden condition of the working people of Australia, it strikes me as absurd that the Government should begin to dole, out of the money so raised, gifts to the rich who do not want this money, who do not ask for it, and to whom the",42,Ministerialists Hear Hear

This serves to emphasize the need for a national scheme of insurance to which every one in the community would contribute, ami under which every one would be entitled to an equal benefit. That is the only way to put this indiscrimination on a logical footing. The sooner we set about removing the anomalies to be found in every clause of the Bill, the sooner we shall come to a rational condition of affairs in Australia. Give this money to the people who need it. See that it goes to the purpose intended, but there is no need to offer it to the people who are rolling in wealth, and who could better afford to give away thousands than to take this allowance of Â£5ber vote against the third reading of the Bill? orable member vote against a scheme of national insurance? have to contribute to it. how a man who believes in Socialism could logically give any other answer. The honourable member believes that the Government should do all these things for every one ; but I do not know of any scheme of Socialism which, through a Socialistic Government, has set out to make unconditional gifts to persons who have millions of money. I know of no Socialistic tenet requiring that to be done. The sooner the Government seriously undertake a scheme which can rest upon some basis of equity and logic, the better for the workers and the taxpayers as a whole. Meanwhile, it is useless, apparently, to argue for any difthe allowance will be a very great ferentiation. The Government have made up their minds that the Bill must pass unaltered. That being so, it is useless for us to further urge this matter which has been raised in a timely way by the right honourable member for Swan. Ca'll it what you like, this is a gift from the Government to the womenfolk of the country. ment, but from the people to the people. orable member makes a distinction between the Government and the people. Does he admit that the Government does not represent the people ? That is my view; and we shall see a few months hence whether or not it is true. Meantime, I point out this anomaly of making gifts to people who do not want them, out of taxation which the Government say is contributed more largely by the workers than by any other section of the community. should be very sorry to think that any woman to whom this gift is offered would consider it an affront. To my' mind, the popularity of the Bill throughout the countrya popularity which has rather surprised members of some political partiesis due to the approval with which it has been received by the mothers of Australia. It has been opposed by some women who, unfortunately, are childless, and it has been opposed by others who are not likely, having regard to the age they have reached, to bear children. member to deal with the clause. tion of this indiscriminate grant of Â£ 5 to every woman in the community. Such a grant is, to my mind, of far greater significance than would be the mere making of the allowance to those who may be in want. We talk about nation building and patriotism, but this is the first time that the nation has ever recognised the great trials and sufferings, of its women, and the lives that the women of the British Empire-the real"" nation builders-hav e sacrificed in giving birth to their children. That is why the Bill is becoming so popular with the women of Australia. Although there may be many women who may never want the money, and who thank Heaven that they never will, it will be found' that they are just as proud of this recognition, by a Parliament of men, of their great act of maternity, as are those to whom help in time of trouble. It is surprising to hear the honourable member for Parramatta talk about general insurance. When the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill was before the House, the same arguments were used against it that have been used against this Bill. for Parramatta. that the old-age pensions system was really an insurance system to which every one in the community was, by means of taxation, contributing.

That sums up the spirit of the opposition to the BiU. The measure is opposed because it comes from a Socialistic Government. The opposition comes from professional politicians, but individual honourable members, having sympathetic hearts, feel bound to admit that it will prove a blessing to the people. mittee the opinion that the only women opposing the measure are childless women, I conveyed an opinion that I did not wish to convey. Although the Bill has been opposed by women who are, unfortunately, childless, I did not say that all the women opposing it are childless. some of them are not. [3.54] I wish to remove a stigma that the honourable member for Cook and others have tried to fasten on the Opposition, whom they accused of inhumanity. have always resented attempts to charge those on this side as being less humane than the members to whom they are opposed. Honourable members opposite cannot point to a single instance, in connection with this or any other measure, where any honourable member on this side has exhibited a lack of human sympathy. Indeed, if we examine the legislation of this Parliament, we find, as a matter of fact, that there has been more genuine humanity shown by honourable members on this side than by honourable members opposite. The criticism of this measure is not directed against, relieving necessitous mothers in time of child-birth, but to indiscriminate largesse with public funds to others who are already amply provided with means, and to its crudeness, slovenly drafting and the failure to provide proper safeguards that the money shall find its way to its proper destination. draw attention to the utter illogicality of honourable members opposite when they declare that they will not support any measure based on a contributory system. What is this but a scheme based on a contributory system, and in the worse form? It is proposed to levy a tax on the poorer classes in order to put money into the pockets of people who do not require it ; and that is one of the imperfections we desire to remove. Poor and rich alike are to have it, we are told, and so the Bill provides. The Prime Minister, and others underlying principle is that of humanitya wish to help mothers to tide over a period of trouble-bu t how does that declaration apply in the case of people with large incomes, who have servants and motor cars, and own or pay heavy rentals for their houses? Either the Bill has not the humanitarian purpose claimed, or it has not been properly drafted; and the Opposition would be remiss in their duty if they did not call attention to its defects. We realize, if the Government do not, that if the Bill passes in its present form it will have to be amended in a very short time, for, as it stands at present, it opens the door to wholesale abuse. There is no desire whatever, on the part of honorI know that able members on this side, to oppose any humane legislation, but we do desire to safeguard the taxpayer, on the one hand, and the poor mothers on the other.
