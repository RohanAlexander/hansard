The principal object of the amendment is to place an act relating to advances on wheat. trading companies which distribute their ""profits through the medium of holding companies in the same position as trading companies which distribute their profits directly to tlieir individual shareholders. The existence of a holding company, ber (vide page 1395), on motion by Mr which may be merely a channel through FOEDEwhich a trading company distributes its profits to the persons entitled to them, has the effect, in many cases, of making regret to find myself in opposition to this the profits of two years, in the form of bill. The proposal has considerable dividends tc the holding-company and the merit; but, at'a time like the present, far shareholders of the holding company, more discrimination than has obviously subject to the super tax in the first year to been shown in regard to this matter which this tax applies, that is, 1930-31. should have been exercised by the GovernSuch a position does not arise where there ment in selecting a public work on which is no holding company, aud individuals to expend a large sum of money. Money interested are the direct shareholders of is scarce, in fact, practically non-existent, the trading company. In the latter case and yet, in the closing days of the session, the super tax for 1930-31 would be charged the Government is proposing to commit only on dividends received by the sharethe Parliament to an expenditure of pracholders in 1929-30 out of the profits of tically £725,000.

That this anomalous disadvantage obtains to a serious extent has been demonstrated by reference co a number of actual cases. The amendment which the Government proposes to accept will effectively remove the anomaly. This amendment gives effect to representations which I made in the course of the debate, when the resolutions on which this legislation is based were before the committee, and I am glad the Government proposes to give effect to the request made in another place.

It is essential also that public works expenditure should provide a maximum of employment as soon as possible. was interested last 'night in listening to the speech of the honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey), who declared that if the bill were agreed to 1,000 men would be immediately employed. But the expenditure of only £20,000 is contemplated on the work in the present financial year. devoted to wages, employment would be found for 1,000 men for precisely three weeks, and if we spent £15,000 over the next six months, employment would be found for not more than 115 men. Yet this' is said to' be a measure that will relieve unemployment. The Government has not £725,000 to spend on this work. It has not even the £20,000 which it proposes to spend in the present financial year. Like the Gold Bounty Bill, this measure is a piece of sheer electioneeringa mere pretence that the Government is finding work for the unemployed. It is an absolute sham. The party opposite desires to advertise to all the world that the present session must not be closed until something has been done to relieve the unemployed. All that has been achieved is the passage pf the Gold Bounty Bill, which will not employ one man in the next six months, and the precious measure now before the House, which will give employment at the utmost to 115 men for a. period of six months. This is' the great measure of Christmas relief which this Government presents to 300,000 or 400,000. workless people! Honourable members ' opposite should be ashamed to bring this bill into the House as a means of relieving unemployment -rail for a considerable distance, and the Tf they think that the unemployed will be fooled by treatment of this kind they are mightily mistaken. There is a persistent rumour that the Government has entered into an arrangement with a contractor in Australia in connection with the financing of .this railrail proposal from RedH ill to Adelaide, way. ' sinister suggestion; but since there is no money in sight for this railway, and the The expenditure conprospect is that next yean will be still more difficult financially, the Government should make some statement as to how the £725,000 is'to be raised for this work. The rumour is that it will be I financed by the issue of bonds or by some otherirregular means. On general grounds I shall have the greatest satisfaction iu voting against the bill. When the proposal was referred to the Public Works Committee, it was in a somewhati jdifferent form from that, in If £15,000 of that were which it is now presented to the House. It was' then intended to lay a third rail : from BedH ill to Adelaide to provide a standard gauge line in conjunction with the existing 5-ft. 3-iu. railway. Will the Minister state whether, in the event of the line being built fromPort ;1 Augusta to Bed Hill, .the, original idea of the third rail will be '.adhered to ? I cannotunderstand any railway engineer making such a recommendation., -. The first duty of a railway engineer .is to study the safety of passengers by. train.

The surveying of a railway line involves a lot of detailed work. It is the duty of a Minister, when introducing a railway proposal, to place all the plans upon the table, but that has not beeu done in the present case. I have not seen any detailed surveys, and if they have not been made, practically the whole of the £20,000 will be swallowed up in their preparation.

Tho Government is not able to carry out works to which it is definitely committed, because of the difficulty of finding the necessary money, and it is surprising that it advances this proposal. The financial troubles of all the States are due mainly to the fact that they are losing large sums on their railway systems. We have been told from time to time by the Postmaster-General, that he could profitably spend thousands of pounds upon the provision of postal services that are esseutial in country districts if the money could he found. Instead of being extended, those services are being curtailed on account, of the financial stringency.

In spite of the fact that i-oad transport is being more and more preferred every year, and it has been found necessary to curtail'railway services almost everywhere, the Government proposes to construct yet another line. I have expressed the view that when private enterprise has difficulty in financing works proposals, the Government should, if possible, make available funds for public works generally. I am always anxious to see put in hand work that will give employment to our people. This proposal, however, I do not consider will readily provide employment. It will not be reproductive, and there are many other more profitable works that could be put in hand if the Government, could find the necessary money. [11.42 | -The House was naturally somewhat surprised when it, was confronted with this proposal, and that feeling was intensified hy the failure of the Government to furnish a business-like reason for its adoption at a time like the present, and in such curious circumstances. Honourable members have not been supplied with information with respect to the interest charges, aud their bearing on the total expenditure. formed that the return in excess of interest and working expenses is estimated at about £6,000 a year; hut tliat is to be obtained by . taking traffic from existing lines in South Australia. There has not previously been less likelihood than exists at present, of expenditure upon such a railway proving advantageous. Tho proposal merely is to provide another line that will give greater convenience to the travelling public. If we were asked to assent to a proposition that would open up a great mineral field or make available a large tract of arable land, we could consider its value to the country and its importance economically. There is no such feature in this proposal. The Minister was unable to toll us anything to justify us in agreeing to this prois a worse proposition than the Oodnapostal to assist in the provision of work for the unemployed. Wo know to-day tliat South Australia, in common with every other State, is harassed financially by its railway system. In New South Wales an endeavour was made to avoid a deficit of £2,000,000. That was successful, but then the Government found itself faced with a further deficit of £4,000,000. South Australia is in a somewhat similar position. Were it not for the capital expenditure on our railways, and the conFrom time to time sequent heavy, interest burden, this-, country would be in a sound financial position..' In Australia there arc 4.25 miles of railway for every thousand of population. That percentage is exceeded only hy one European country. We have expended in Australia over £300,000,000 on railway construction, and the annual interest charge ou that outlay is £15,000,000. No action has been taken in the past to make provision for the redemption of loans expended on railway construction or to wipe out the cost cf railways that are not paying or likely to pay. Yet we are asked in this time of depression to support a proposal to construct a. new railway at a cost of over £1,200,000. The country that it is to serve is already served by a network of railways, and to provide a route hundreds of small properties will have to be cu? through. stock routes for miles. We havo been inway will open no new country. It is one of the extravagant proposals that entered the minds of federal politicians soui'e years ago, when they imagined that the' prosperity of Australia was so great as to permit of the provision.of a uniform gauge throughout, the whole continent, regardless of cost. knows nothing about this proposal. orable member, when he spoke, was not able to convince me that the railway, when constructed, would be of any use except to South Australia. This railway is to be built by the expenditure of Commonwealth money in a territory which i<s already served by several railways. It datta to Alice Springs railway. The wages bill on the railways of Australia amounts to £31,000,000 a year. The Government, instead of rectifying past errors, now intends to make the position worse by constructing this railway.

46,Mr Bernard Corser,"The honare many better avenues in which our unemployed can be absorbed. The Queensland Government recently built a railway to Mount Isaa distance of 60 miles-a t a cost of £3,600,000. That railway is to assist in developing that great mine which will eventually give a revenue of millions of pounds to Australia. There are £35,000,000 worth of ore in sight, and it has been proved by the bores that have been sunk that there is £100,000,000 worth of ore in the mine. We should spend any money that is available for the relief of the unemployed in constructing railways for the development of mining fields and agricultural lauds. Not one of the argument's'' that have been put forward by the Minister in support of the bill is worth consideration. The loss on our existing railways has brought about Australia's downfall. There is au army of 112,000 men employed on the various railways. Our interest bill amouuts to £605 per completed mile of railway. Yet we are now proposing to add .a further 84 miles and 54 chains to our system of railways at an immediate cost of £725,000. Rolling-stock will cost £104,000, and the laying of the third rail £380,000. au ultimate expenditure of £1,218,000 on a railway 180 miles in length. The present proposal is to construct only 82 miles of that railway. . No argument has. been, adduced that would justify this proposal, and. I certainly do not intend to support it. No engineering report has been submitted with the plans. The book of reference contains no information that would cause one to believe that the railway was necessary. Among the papers laid upon the table of the House there was no report by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. There is no report indicating that the Commissioner has approved of the construction, of. this line. The Commissioner's evidence contains nine points in favour of the line. there was no report of the Commissioner accompanying the book of plans and reference. The' only advantage that this railway offers is greater travelling facilities. Grey has admitted that passengers at present have the option of travellingfrom Port Augusta by rail or by motor car. Now it is intended to construct another line at a cost of £1,200,000. I shall oppose the bill.

53,Mr Archdale Parkhill (War,"against the manner in which the bill haa been introduced. Section 59 of the Commonwealth Railways Act provides thatWhere tliere haa been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works any public work involving the construction of a railway, the Commissioner shall transmit to the Minister under his official seal the following information:This information includes a plan of the railway and of the lands through which it is to pass, a book of reference containing certain specified information, the estimated cost of the railway when completed, the amount of additional rolling stock likely to be required and an estimate of the cost of it, and an estimate of the working expenses and probable revenue of the line, together with certain other information. Section 60 of the act provides thatIf the Minister moves that the House of Kepresentatives declare that' it is expedient to justification for the introduction of the carry out the proposed work, the information supplied to him in pursuance of the last preceding section shall, ut the same time, be laid before the House of Representatives. [ ask you, Mr Speaker, whether this information has been submitted to the House. Makin) I have seen the plans and documents laid upon the table by the Minister in charge of the bill, and am of the opinion that they fulfil the requirements of the sections which the honourable member has quoted; but I shall make a further investigation to satisfy myself on that point. Such information should be available, not merely <to the Minister, but also-to honourable members; otherwise it has no real value from the point of view of debate. This measure, like the Gold Bounty Bill, has been introduced by the Government with the specific object of providing employment for our people. After months and months of consideration these are the only two propositions which the Government has been able to introduce to relieve the unemployment which is so prevalent. It has been said that these measures will make some work for the unemployed before the festive Christmas seasons One almost hesitates' to speak of a "" festive season"" in present circumstances. nature for the purpose of providing work, the Government is merely throwing the shadow of a substance before starving and penniless people. No one can say that the gold bounty will -.result in the employment of any additional men; and, in view of the fact that only £20,000 can be spent on the Port Augusta to RedH ill railway up to the end of this financial year, it is ridiculous to suggest that this measure will .provide much employment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) showed clearly that it would only give employment to 115 people. So far as I can see) it is quite likely that more than that number of men will be killed in the rush for the jobs when they become available. Neither this bill nor the Gold Bounty Bill can, possibly do anything effective to relieve unemployment. In these circumstances, there is no measure at this stage. As the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) pointed out, the main disabilities of the different States are due to the fact that their great railway systems are unprofitable. Railways have been constructed (Hon. Norman in every State without proper consideration as to the need for them, and their revenue-producing possibilities. Many lines have been laid in the wrong places. In the district through which this railway is intended to pass there are already three lines running parallel to the. pro-, posed route of this one. In fact, there are more railway lines in this part of South Australia, probably, than in any other similar area in the Commonwealth. Whilei t is true that the building of the line would reduce the number of breakof-gauge stations on the transcontinental line by one, it would add a break-of-gauge station on the route from the great north-west, over which so many cattle are railed. There is no justification whatever for the building of this line in a district which is already railway infested, if I may use that term, particularly in view of the-fact that the country cannot afford to pay for it. The railways of Australia are government owned and controlled, while the railways of other countries are privately owned. When particular railways in In introducing bills of this other countries become unprofitable, then",16,Railwa Ybill Second Readin G

If the people of South Australia are so desirous of assisting those on the land by building railways, why have they not constructed, a line south of Wallaroo, in Yorke Peninsula? That area is not served by any railway, yet it is far. richer than that through which the proposed line is to run from RedH ill to Port Augusta. The fact is, of course, that the people of Yorke Peninsula are well satisfied with the transport facilities provided by. the small steamers which trade on .Spencer Gulf, and St. Vincent's Gulf. The construction of this line will certainly provide some employinent for those now out of work, and the. Minister for Defence. ( Mr; A.,. Green) . apparently regards that as an important reason for beginning it . I remind him, however, that, if work is found for men on the construction of this line and on its maintenance, the completion of the undertaking will throw out of employment many now engaged on traffic duties on the Terowie to Port Augusta section. There is only a limited amount of traffic between Port Augusta and Adelaide, and; if the proposed line .proves as successful as is expected, it must take some of thetraffic now going over the line from Terowie to Port Augusta. I admit that it w ill be more comfortable to .travel over the new line. In company'with yourself, Mr Speaker, I once travelled, over the existing, line through this section of the country, and no one was louder than, E o doubt, but this is myself in condemning the ""dog boxes"" into which we were put at Terowie. Had it not been that I . had the company, of friends who' were as fond of-playing bridge as. I was, the journey would have been almost insupportable. As I have W h e n the scheme was said, however, this is not a time for spending money on luxuries, and because I believe that the money could be spent to better purpose, T oppose the bill. The honourable member for Oxley( Mr. Bayley). objected to the building of this line for the reason, among others, that South Australia is financially in a' bad those way. That, I admit, is true; but it is true not only of the Government of South The country through which this Australia, but. of most other, governments in Australia and 'elsewhere.

Minister for Markets and Transport) [12.29] -When I spoke on the second reading of this bill I placed on the table of Parliament, for the convenience of honourable members, plans and particulars of the proposed railway. I did not then formally move that they be presented to Parliament. I now do so, in accordance with section 60 of the Commonwealth Railway Act. I have here a plan of the proposed railway, and of the lands through which it is to pass, together with a book of reference setting forth the names of the owners of the land, and a. report of the Commonwealth Railway Commissioner regarding the estimated cost of the work. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Tn committee: Clauses1 to 4 agreed to. Clause 5The maximum cost of the railway, exclusive of rolling-stock, shall not exceed seven hundred and thirty'five thousand pounds. I move That the words "" seven hundred and thirtyMinister should seek the advice of the live"" be omitted, and with a view to insert in lieu tliereof the words ""six hundred and twenty-five"". The object of the amendment is to ensure that the maximum cost of the line shall be, at least, 15 per cent, less than the estiI do not know whether the honourable mate made several years ago before the decline in wages and the slump in prices. The price of steel has fallen all over the world; if it has not fallen correspondingly in Australia, there is no .reason why it should not come down in conformity with the trend of the world's market. The basic wage in South Australia is considerably below what it was three or four years ago. The Minister may reply that the maximum amount specified in the bill will not necessarily be spent, and that the Government will call for tenders and accept the lowest. That does not dispose of the fact that, if the clause be passed in its present form, the Government will be empowered to accept a tender up to £735,000. Any construction undertaken mainly to provide employment for those who otherwise would be on the dole should be at a cost considerably below what was estimated years ago when prices and wages were higher. The amendment' proposes a reduction of slightly less than15 per cent., and is reasonable in view of the present financial and economical circumstances. support the amendment, which is designed to bring the bill to some extent into touch with realities. This Parlia-. ment has been discussing some very unreal measures recently, and now we are asked in the blithest manner to authorize the Commonwealth to spend up to £735,000 on the construction of a railway without any indication as to where the capital is to be found. When I questioned the Minister on this subject he replied that the money would be provided on the Estimates in the usual way. To my further question as to whether the work was to be financed out of revenue, the honourable gentleman merely answered that I was being facetious. surely does not think that this amount can be paid out of revenue ? honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) and the honourable member for ' Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) who, apparently, have been added to the Cabinet in order to equip it with some ability in finance. gentleman consulted that superior authority before proceeding with this bill. If he has not obtained the concurrence and support of those gentlemen, he may find himself in difficulties. I cannot work out the relation of these watchdogs to the Cabinet, but it is possible that the Minister will be summoned before this unofficial committee to give an account-of his actions. If we could be assured that this proposal has the unanimous support of the committee of two, as well as that of the Cabinet, we should be able to pass it with more confidence.

The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr four years ago, that sum will be available Paterson) has advanced reasons in support of his opinion that, because the estilingly large army of unemployed in all mate presented by the Minister is based upon condition obtaining about four years ago, it should be revised. It is remarkable that the Minister is unable to present an up-to-dateestimate of cost. I doubt whether a proposal of this magnitude has ever been submitted to Parliament unaccompanied by up-to-date information. The Commonwealth and the State of South Australia will, apparently, be involved in an ultimate liability exceeding £1,000,000. but do not know how long it will last.. The Minister does not appear to know whether the third rail proposal will be proceeded with, but we sre asked to support the bill as portion of a larger scheme, although some South Australian members have said that the balance of it wall never be proceeded with. The Parliament is asked to appropriate a large sum of money on the basis of estimates that are years old, and cannot be regarded as reliable at the present time. In those circumstances, the amendmeut is reasonable. L support the amendment. way cannot pay its way for years, and when it does, that will be largely at the expense of State instrumentalities. money on a losing proposition, even to relieve unemployment, at a time when the country is desperately hard up, is evidence of recklessness, and of failure to appreciate the circumstances of those who are out of work, and those who fear that they may be. Such a proposition can be justified at this time only if it is -carried out very cheaply, and 15 per cent, -The Minister is not prepared to accept is the minimum saving that should be made on the estimate of four years ago. The honourable member for Gippsland has mentioned items of cost which are very much lower to-day than when the estimate was first prepared. This committee should have an assurance that all the savings mentioned by him will be effected. When works are undertaken principally for the relief .of the unemployed, the expenditure should be spread as widely as possible, in order to benefit the maximum number of persons. If £110,000 can be saved on the estimate of to provide work for others of the appalparts of Australia. No section of the community should be more ready than the unskilled labourers to make some sacrifices, so that the;limited funds available may give relief to more of their fellows. The sooner we accept the principle that works to help the unemployed should be carried out cheaply in order to spread the benefits and avoid saddling the country with unnecessary debt, the better for the unemployed and those who have work Minister for Markets and Transport) [12.44] -The amendment would serve no useful purpose. The estimate of cost was based on a basic, wage for construction workers of 15s. 4d. per day. Since it was prepared the wage has been reduced by only 4d. The estimate of revenue was founded on the figures for 1924, when the basic wage was, if anything, lower than it is to-day. There are ample safeguards against wasteful expenditure. .The work will be thrown open to public tender, and there may be a half a dozen tenderers, This railincluding the Commonwealth Railway Commissioner.

It is almost inevitable, however, that before the railway can be put in hand a further reduction will occur.

A considerable reduction has taken place in the cost, of railway construction since the estibound by it . mates of four years ago were prepared. There is no reason why this work should not be carrie 1 out cheaply.

114,Mr Fobde (Capricornia,"ActingShortly after the Minister for Markets left for the Imperial and Economic Conferences, strong representations were made to me to review the position of tlie wlieat industry, and although the' path was beset with many difficulties, l agreed LO caw a conference of wheat-growers, and the representatives of including merchants and millers. That conference was held at Canberra on the 11th and 12th November last. was representative of every interest in the wheat industry throughout Australia. It was hampered, however, from the outset by the fact that there was on the statute-book no legislation which would enable the industry to give effect to any of its recommendations which might be acceptable to the Government. That was a considerable disadvantage. The conference submitted to the Government certain proposals, the principal one being the imposition of a sales tax of : t'7 4s. a ton on flour, the proceeds of the tax to bo distributed among the wheat growers by way of a bounty -Such a tax would have increased the price of flour in Sydney from £8 10s. to £15 14s. a ton, and in Melbourne from about £9 at that time, to about £16 4s. a ton. The Government, however, on examining the scheme found that it would be well nigh impossible to administer, and the Ministry, tneret'ore, decided not to accept it. Furthermore, it would no doubt have resulted iii au increase in 'the price of bread. Had the Commonwealth Government f u ll control of the prices of commodities it would have been possible to fix the price of bread; but, in the absence of price-fixing machinery, it was not possible for any action in that direction to bo taken by this Government. Flour and bread are used more extensively by the poor than by the wealthier section of the community. Many children of poor families eat bread and butter or bread and jam three times a day. The wealthier section of the community has variety of diet, and does not cat nearly so much bread as the poor, so any increasein the price of flour and bread would have placed a heavy impost upon those least able to pay. The result of the conference was and more will follow them after somewhat disappointing to the GoChristmas, unless something is done to vernment, which, however, continued Mr Forde. J Advances BiU. to give serious consideration . to the situation of the industry. Representations were received from day to day from members of both sides of the House in respect of giving assistance to the wheat-growers. The Government on three occasions made representations to the Commonwealth Bank-twic e through marketing organizations, myself, as Acting Minister for Markets and Transport, and again through the Cabinet. We asked that an advance of It 2s. 6d. per bushel f.o.b. be made by the bank to the wheat-farmers. The bauk considered the proposal, but intimated that it was unable to grant more than 2s. per bushel f.o.b., which is equivalent to from Is. 4^d. to Is. 6d. per bushel ai country railway stations. The bank conveyed that intimation by letter, which was received by the Acting Prime Minister on the 4th December, and published in the press on the same date. What the Commonwealth Bank agreed to pay was 80 per cent, of tlumarket value of wheat. The announcement of the advance proposed by t.lnCommonwealth Bank was received with disappointment, not only by the wheat growers, but also by a large section of the wlieat distributing organizations. It was pointed out that the rate of advance was no higher than what could bcobtained by growers froni trading banks or merchants in the ordinary course of business. The position of the wheat growing industry was becoming more and more acute. There are 50,000 wheat growers throughout Australia, and the industry itself employs a considerable amount of labour. In addition to the growing of wheat, there is the manufacture of flour and the utilization of railway workers, carters, labourers, and all the employeesin the wheat-fields and flour-mills of Australia. When the bottom fell out of the world's wheat market, the unemployment problem in Australia was seriously accentuated. The Government was faced with the fact that thousands of the wheat growers were on the verge of being forced off their holdings. The banks were foreclosing on mortgages. Because of the wheat-growers not being able to pay their way, many business men have already become bankrupt, meet .the situation. The repercussion of anything like this will be felt in every part of the country in the additional unemployment that will occur in town and country. Consequently, the Government regards this problem as of national importance, and considers that the people, as a whole, should be prepared to assist iu solving it, and if necessary carry a portion of any financial loss involved in its solution.. The price of wheat on the world's market is lower to-day than it has been for the last 36 years, and Australia is faced with the task of disposing of a record crop, the saleable surplus of which is estimated at 160,000,000 bushels. Every public man and almost all members of the various political parties appealed to the wheat-growers to grow more wheat this year. were told that by doing so they would render a great national service. It was said that a record crop would enable us to export a larger quantity of wheat, and so assist us to correct our adverse trade balance. In response to this appeal the farmers taxed their credit to the very limit. They obtained the largest possible overdrafts from their banks, and also secured every assistance possible from merchants and others iu order to sow a record area. Unfortunately, as things have, turned out, the more they sowed the greater will be their loss; but they acted patriotically. They believed they were helping the nation in its difficulty. The Government, therefore, hopes that the nation will now turn round and help them. We realize the difficulties of the situation which faces us, but feel that something must be attempted to assist the. farmers. Honourable members of this House and those of another place have moved special adjournment motions in order to discuss the plight of the farmers. When the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) moved such a motion the other day I believe that he was supported by every member of the Country party, many members of the Nationalist party, and also by honourable members on this side of the chamber. During that debate the Government was criticized for its failure to take further action to meet the situation. I , therefore, hope that its action in introducing this bill will be approved, and that the measure will have a speedy passage through this House, and also through the other place. The-Governmeiit has examined all the proposals that have been made for assisting the wheat-grower, arid has come to the conclusion that the only practicable method of helping him is to guarantee him a fair price for his wheat, having, regard to the present price of wlieat on the world's market. It has decided, aftervery careful and serious consideration, to guarantee the grower 3s. per bushel f.o.b., equivalent on the average to about 2s. 6d. at country sidings for f.a.q. wheat of the 1930-31 crop. Owing to the financial stringency, the Government cannot make any money available for this purpose without the assistance of the Commonwealth Bank, The farmers but it is prepared to guarantee to the Commonwealth Bank the repayment of aiiy loss involved in connection with the disposal of the wheat on which the advance is made. If honourable members approve of this proposal, as I hope they will, the bill should be passed before the Christmas recess. I , therefore, again appeal to honourable members to deal with the measure expeditiously. Although the representations made to the Commonwealth Bank, first by myself, as Minister .for Markets, and, secondly, by the Cabinet, to grant additional assistance to the wheat-growers, were not successful, it is felt that if this request -is backed by honourable members of all parties, as it will be if this bill is carried unanimously, the bank will be prepared to make the necessary advances. The Government is of the opinion that, the bank should make this advance available, in view of the unprecedented circumstances of this case, and the possible effect on every class of the community if some assistance is not given promptly to the wheat-growers. The estimated wheat harvest of the Commonwealth for the 1930-31 season is 175,000,000 bushels, of which about 15,000,000 will be required for seed, leaving 160,000,000 bushels to be sold. The present f.o.b. price of wheat is about 2s. 6d. per bushel. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the average price for the season does not exceed that amount -thoug h it may easily do so-the total loss on the guarantee would be £4,000,000. It is a question whether the whole nation, or the wheat-growers alone, should bear this loss. In view of the fact that the wheat-growers responded to the appeal of the nation to grow more wheat in order to assist in the rectification of our adverse trade balance, it is felt that the nation should assist the farmers in the matter. The Government does not take such a pessimistic view of the future as is taken in some quarters, but considers that the average price throughout the season will be higher than 2s. 6d., f.o.b. Indeed, it has received information that large shipments of the present season's wheat have already been made at an appreciable advance on that figure. The exchange rate affects the position considerably. I believe that the rate is likely to be raised in the future. increased long ago. orable member. A 10 per cent, increase in the exchange rate would represent about 2£d. per bushel, or approximately €1,500,000 on our exportable surplus of wheat. The subtraction of that amount from £4,000,000 would leave £2,500,000. The price of wheat would thus only have to advance by 3fd. per bushel to altogether liquidate this loss. I do not deny, however, that there is some risk, and, may be some loss, in making this guarantee, but I feel that the nation should be prepared to go thus far. ing a much bigger loss than that. they were paid this guaranteed price they would still be producing wheat at something below the actual cost of production. ducing at Is. 6d. below the actual cost of production. for Echuca is well informed on these subjects, and if that is his opinion, I am prepared to accept it. The wheat industry is of such transcendant importance to Australia that assistance to the growers to the extent now proposed should readily be granted by Parliament. Some honourable members may be of the opinion that, the exchange rate will remain stationary; but I predict that it will advance; if it does so, the amount of the advance will be equivalent to the payment of a bounty on such wheat as is exported. This would -help to reduce any loss that might otherwise have to be borne by the Commonwealth. The Government considers that the situation is sufficiently serious to justify it in calling upon the people to help the farmers. Unless such assistance is granted, many wheat-growers will be compelled to abandon their farms, and many business men in country towns, as well as some in the capital cities, will become insolvent. The result would undoubtedly be that unemployment would increase disastrously. . A letter, in which is enclosed a copy of this bill, has already beeu forwarded to the chairman of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. to-day. As the Minister dealing with this measure, I deemed it my duty to communicate personally with the chairman of directors pf the bank, and advise him of the action that the Government intended to take. I told him that the bill would be presented to Parliament immediately, and that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Fenton) would communicate with him in regard to it. I considered that that courtesy was due to him. The bank is being asked to help the nation in its emergency by making the advance on the guarantee of the'Government, backed by the resources of the whole of Australia. Anticipating a favorable response from the bank, the Government has introduced the bill. is received, what does the Government propose to do? tical friend of mine once advised me never to jump until I came to the stile. The bill provides for a guaranteed price of 3s. per bushel for wheat of the 1930-3.1 season, of f.a.q. quality, less dockage in respect of wheat below f.a.q. quality. Thf guaranted price is on a f.o.b. basis, or itsequivalent, that is, the farmer will receive for f.a.q. wheat 3s. per bushel, less railway freight and handling and other charges, either to the port of shipment in the case of wheat for export, or to the miller's store in the case of wheat for manufacture into flour. The aetual guaranteed price to the farmer will be 2s. 5d. or 2s. 6d. per bushel at country railway stations. It",25,Wheat Advances Bill Second Readino

124,Mr Forde,"An experienced poliis specially provided in the bill that, on the delivery of his wheat to the country siding, the farmer will receive 2s. per bushel. This, it is hoped, will afford him much relief in his present very difficult financial circumstances. The extra 6d. that will be advanced, in addition to the Is. 6d. which the bank itself has undertaken to advance, will make a big difference to the farmers and assist them considerably. It must be remembered that it costs the farmers approximately 3d. per bushel for bags for their wheat, and other charges come to a considerable amount. The extra 6d., therefore, will be wonderfully helpful. Honourable members know that an additional return of 10 per cent, in a business can make all the difference between profit and loss. While this extra Od. will not turn a loss into a profit for the farmers, it will enable them to face the future with a good deal more courage than they could otherwise do. The Commonwealth Bank has been asked to arrange for the necessary finance. The bank last week decided to make an advance of 2s. a bushel f.o.b., and we have asked that this advance be increased to 3s. f.o.b. Organizations, such as the cooperative wheat pools, which are being financed by the Commonwealth Bank, will receive the necessary"" funds to make a first advance of 2s. a bushel when the wheat is delivered at country railway sidings, and to meet necessary expenses such as freight, handling charges, &c. Provision has also been made in the bill for proprietary distributors such as wheat merchants to obtain the benefit of the guaranteed price, provided they pass it on to the growers. purpose of clause 4. Will the Minister say how it is proposed to deal with wheat already delivered? presently. required to arrange their own finance, and to pay the growers a first advance of 2s. a bushel on delivery at country sidings. At the end of the season, or when it is well advanced, the merchants will, provided the conditions of the guarantee have been complied with, receive if necessary from the Commonwealth Bank such amounts as are required to bring the price realized by the sale of the. wheat up to 3s. a bushel f.o.b., or its equivalent. merchants will finance themselves? not only to wheat delivered in the future, but to all wheat harvested since the beginning of the season. Although the merchants naturally do not favour this proposal, I believe that, as a body, they are very reasonable men, and are public spirited enough to co-operate with the Government of the day in making the scheme a success. Representations were made to me that the advance should be made only on wheat marketed through pools; but on inquiry I found that such a provision would inflict a tremendous amount of hardship, because harvesting has been in progress for some time. Hundreds of thousands of bushels have already been delivered. There is a torrent of wheat pouring into the silos, and shipments are going abroad every week. It was necessary to give every consideration to the interests of merchants and wheat-growers in the States where there are no pools. For instance, in New South Wales, the present Government intends to legislate for the inauguration of a compulsory wheat pool, but there will not be time to have it in operation for this season's harvest. As honourable members know, there was a change of government in that State recently, and it has been impossible to get the legislation through. Not more than 10 per cent, of the wheat grown in New South Wales is sold through pools. One pool in that State is run by the Farmers and Graziers, and another by Dalgety& Company. Ninety per cent, of the wheat is sold . through merchants. In Victoria from 50 to 60 per cent, is marketed through the Victorian pool. In South Australia about 50 per cent, is marketed through a pool, and the percentage is even higher in Western. Australia. In Queensland, Proprietary firms will be where there is a compulsory pool as a result of legislation passed some years ago by a Labour Government, the whole of the wheat is handled by the pool, and, being just about sufficient for local consumption, is sold at a fixed price of 4s. a bushel. wheat sold through a pool returns a price of a little more than 3s. ?",28,Wheat Advances Bill Second Readino

[ say that advisedly, because I took it upon myself to get in touch with thein when this proposal was first mooted, and we discussed the matter thoroughly. Those managing the wheat pools are, of course, most anxious that the scheme should be inaugurated. They have no grievance at all, and the merchants, who might be said to have a grievance, have had an opportunity of stating their objections, which we have met as far as possible. Full power is given in the bill to make the necessary agreements and to protect the public interest. The scheme will be administered by the Minister for Markets, and very close supervision will be exercised over its operation by the Department of Markets. Naturally, a considerable amount of administrative machinery will be required, and this can be provided by regulation. The Government, being desirous that the scheme should be a success, does not adopt the attitude that it knows everything about the wheatmarketing business. It suggests that au advisory council be appointed, comprised of representatives of the merchants and of the pools, to confer with the Department of Markets in regard to the framing of regulations. terms of the bill. becomes law, merchants will be asked to co-operate, and give any advice they can.

This will prevent any undue holding of wheat because of the guaranteed price, and will assist in the financing of the scheme by the Commonwealth Bank. I have said enough at this stage of the bill to explain its main provisions; it can be discussed more satisfactorily in committee. The Government has put the scheme forward after a good deal of consideration, as something likely to be of benefit to the wheat-farmers of Australia. It believes that the farmers should noi be made to. bear the whole burden of any loss which may be incurred on the wheal crop. Eveni f we render them this measure of assistance, they will still suffer a loss, because they have produced a record harvest at the request of the Prime Minister. Honourable members of this House and of another place have now an opportunity of supporting this bill, so that it will go forward as an assurance to the Commonwealth Bank that, not only this Government, but the Parliament of the Commonwealth, is behind the guarantee of 3s. a bushel f.o.b. for the 1930-31 crop. adjourned.",29,Wheat Advances Bill Second Readino

Having regard to the short period for which the loan has been open, the response has been most gratifying, and the indications are that the f u l l amount w ill be subscribed. honourable members must have beard with satisfaction the announcement made by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Fenton).
