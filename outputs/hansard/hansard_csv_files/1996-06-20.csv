In my about what I believe is the erosion of the introduction to the parliamentary scene in Westminster system in state parliaments and Victoria, that was very much part of the in this parliament. The thrust towards process. There was no difficulty about getting privatisation is, I believe, out of kilter and out the head of Treasury to speak to opposition of balance. I don't believe that there is any members or to a shadow minister-none at overwhelming evidence that privati sing an all. It was simply a question of ringing the area of government or handing it over to Premier or the Treasurer and asking and there private consultants ultimately does anything was never an occasion when that permission more for the government than that which has was not given. traditionally been performed by a public service. In Victoria that system has now changed because the public servant's position is no It is not an accident in Australia that, longer guaranteed. He is now under contract despite the crossfire of politics, we have never for three years-not even to his minister but had a serious allegation of corruption-some to the Premier.

The problem is not necessarily the There have been errors of judgment, yes, but emolument, which I think is excessive. The never an allegation of corruption. problem is that the public servant, as head, That is not an accident. That comes about can be sacked with three to four weeks notice. because, basically, the pressures on ministers That makes the concept of an independent and the range of information and material that public service a highly questionable exercise they have to deal with comes from a public indeed. I do not know that those systems service which, over years of tradition, has which are appropriate to a private company produced a process whereby, by the time the ought necessarily be the systems that apply to material comes onto the minister's desk, he or government administration. I think the role is she has had an opportunity to make decisions clearly different. on the best available material. The decision is his or hers. The minister will be argued with We also need to look at the social problems by public servants but there are only two that are occurring in many parts of Australkinds of ministers: those who run their public ia-not merely unemployment but the rift that servants and those who are run by them. is developing between rural Australia and the metropolitan areas.

It now is the Albury-Wodonga complex. is just not on. Therefore, I am concerned at the thrust of what is taking place in my home We are seeing a cutback in services at state. One of the roles of the Public Service many levels to regional towns and cities, and is not just simply to advise the government that is a matter of concern. As a parliament, but to brief the opposition, which they used we have to ask ourselves whether banks have to do with great skill and discretion. Some a social responsibility or whether they are matters are properly formulated in government simply private agencies that set their own policy which they would not want to discuss. policy standards and can say, 'It's bad luck But if either the Leader of the Opposition or for a country town of 800 or I ,000 people but a parliamentarian needs advice on some we're going to have to close the bank and the aspect of government policy, he is entitled to small shopkeeper may have to drive an hour and a half to do his normal financial busiWe cannot continue with a situation where ness.' the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Is that an acceptable standard?

Therefore, I believe it is important that are many people in this House, there are more emphasis be given to these issues. many people now holding leading positions in It is not good enough for banks simply to Australian society, for no other reason than say, 'Our main concern is profit and the the fact that the Chifley government in 1948 bottom line.

We have to ask ourselves some serious It is the same with unemployment. We still questions. I do not really care whether the have a high rate of unemployment. I believe Treasurer ( Mr Costello) was bested by the there is a genuine concern and commitment state premiers or he believes he bested them. on the part of all members on both sides of I think that is irrelevant and, apart from that, the House that it must be brought down. But the ego of the Treasurer is such that he will you do not bring it down by cutting existing never concede the argument anyway. services which are working, and working It is important, however, that one look at well.

MC 2476 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 Thursday, 20 June 1996 Consideration resumed from 30 May. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996 is to protect the Sydney 2000 Olympics and Paralympic Games licensing revenue from being undermined by unauthorised use of the games indicia and images by corporate competitors of the official games sponsors. The bill will achieve this by regulating the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the games. The hosting of the Olympic Games in the year 2000 is an event of great significance to Australia. It provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements. Preparations for the games have proceeded in a very professional manner. This has been under the guidance of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, SOCOG, and with a high level of cooperation between the New South Wales state government and the Commonwealth government. The organisation of the games is an inspiring venture and the public interest in every aspect of the build-up is intense. The government will ensure that the cooperation which has marked the first two years of preparation for the games continues. We will continue to cooperate with SOCOG and other agencies and organisations involved in organising the games. This cooperation is to ensure that Australia's competitors in the games are given every opportunity to succeed and that the games will be an outstanding success. The task of organising the games is very large and complex. It is also very expensive. As the host nation for the year 2000 games, Australia will be expending considerable sums of money in the lead-up to the year 2000 for the construction of facilities and infrastructure, organisation and marketing. The cost of staging the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games is estimated to be around $2 billion. It will be shared between the organising committees, SOCOG, and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee, SPOC, the government of NSW and the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth government's overall budgetary contribution to the games will exceed $400 million. Sources of revenue to meet the costs of the Sydney Games include the sale of television rights, ticket sales and the licensing of the right to use the games indicia and images. After television rights, licensing or sponsorship rights are the most important source of revenue to meet the costs of organising and staging the games. It is expected that the revenue raised from official sponsorships would need to be of the order of $700 million to meet the revenue budget of the games. The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to attract sponsors will depend to a large extent on the degree of exclusivity afforded to the licensed indicia and images. Official sponsors recognise the commercial value of associating themselves with events of the magnitude of the Olympic Games and are willing to pay considerable sums of money to use the words and symbols",118,Adjournment To At Least Maintain The Level Of Common

210,Mr Moore (Ryan,"Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism) (10.00 a.m.)-I move:Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2477 associated with the Olympics. In this regard, I note that SOCOG has announced that Telstra and IBM are to jointly contribute more than $100 million. They are the first members of Team Millennium, the corporate sponsorship program for the Sydney 2000 Games. The agreement was negotiated in anticipation of the strengthening of the legislative protection of intellectual property rights associated with the Sydney Games. Ambush marketing, however, has the capacity to seriously erode the official sponsorship revenue if not stopped or minimised. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event, such as the Sydney Games, without paying for marketing rights. Typically it is the competitors of official sponsors of major sporting events that engage in these activities. Australian and overseas experience of recent Olympic Games has highlighted the threat that uncontrolled ambush marketing activities can pose to the value of exclusive licensing rights on Olympic Games symbols and indicia. Because ambush marketing can be very effective in creating a perception that the free-rider is in fact an official sponsor, it can dissuade official sponsors from continuing their association with the Olympics. It can also substantially reduce the amount that sponsors are prepared to pay for the rights. The preservation of sponsorship revenue is fundamental to achieving a sound financial outcome for the games thereby ensuring the least call on the public purse. The government of NSW has underwritten and bears full responsibility for any deficit between the games income and expenditure. The protection of official sponsorships against ambush marketing is therefore critical. The terms of the host city contract for the Sydney 2000 Olympics present obligations to the signatories for these matters. The host city, the New South Wales government, the Australian Olympic Committee and SOCOG are obliged to ensure that there are no other marketing programs in the host country which will have an impact on the games marketing program. The measures introduced to the chamber today are the result of a series of initiatives from the coalition parties. In 1994, the Liberal and National parties initiated an inquiry into the effects of ambush marketing on sponsorship revenue for the games. This followed early indications of serious problems for the organisers, the sponsors, and therefore ultimately the taxpayers. In February 1995 we announced we would support legislation to provide property rights in the words and expressions and names of bodies associated with the 2000 Games and the Paralympics. In March 1995 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs unanimously supported this position. The AOC, SOCOG and the previous New South Wales government had called for this legislation from the time of awarding of the games to Sydney. The previous government introduced the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1995 into the Senate on 29 November 1995. It did not introduce it in time to make it law before the proroguing of parliament. This has created the very real risk of part of SOCOG's marketing revenue being siphoned off, with the cost being borne indirectly by Australian sport and the taxpayer. The bill I am now introducing is essentially the same as the bill introduced into the Senate last year with the exception of three minor amendments. The amendments clarify the legislation and provide additional protection in accordance with the organising committees' wishes. It gives additional protection to that provided by the Olympic Insignia Protection Act MC 2478 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 1987 which protects Olympic symbols such as the five rings and the designs of the Olympic flame and torch. That act was amended in 1994 to extend the protection available. The new legislation will protect the use of a wide range of words and expressions against ambush marketing during the lead up to and including the Sydney Games. It will pick up most of the recommendations made in March 1995 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in its report entitled Cashing in on the Sydney Olympics: protecting the Sydney Olympic Games from ambush marketing. The bill will have a limited period of application and will cease to have effect after 31 December 2000. I will now briefly outline significant features of this legislation. The bill seeks to provide protection to indicia encompassing words and expressions associated with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Words and phrases such as 'Olympic', 'Olympiad', 'Paralympic', 'Paralympiad', 'Sydney 2000', 'Sydney Games', 'Millennium Games', 'Team Millennium' and 'Summer Games' will be protected against unlicensed commercial use under this legislation. Particular word combinations will also be protected under this legislation. These include, for example, any combinations of the words 'Olympics', 'Olympian', 'Paralympics' and 'Paralympian' with words, numbers or phrases such as 'Sydney', '2000', 'Two Thousand', 'Games', 'Medals', 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Bronze', 'Green and Gold' and 'Sponsor'. In addition to protecting particular words, numbers and expressions, the bill also seeks to provide protection to certain images that in the circumstances of their presentation suggest, or are likely to suggest, a connection with the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games. These images may be either visual or aural representations. The rights in the above protected indicia and images vest with SOCOG and SPOc. These two bodies have the power to use and to license others to use the indicia and images identified in the legislation for commercial purposes. To constitute use for commercial purposes, the Sydney Games indicia or images must be applied to a person's goods or services for advertising or promotional purposes, or for enhancing the demand for the goods or services, and in a manner which would suggest that the person is or has been a sponsor of, or is or has been providing other support for, the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games or both. That is, a person who sells or promotes their goods or services by using any of the protected indicia or images in a way that would be reasonably understood as suggesting that the person is claiming sponsorship of, or to be providing other support for the games, would be using them for commercial purposes. In order to enable the public to be aware of the identity of those licensed to use the Sydney Games indicia and images, a register will be established and maintained by SOCOG. It will be made accessible to members of the public at its office in Sydney. The register will also be accessible throughout Australia at state offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. An entry in the register will include details such as the name and principal place of business of the licensed user, the Sydney Games indicia and images that the licensed user may use, and the circumstances in which the indicia and images may be used. A person whose name is entered on the register is to be taken to be a licensed user of the Sydney Games indicia or images specified in that entry. A document certified by the chief executive officer of SOCOG is evidence that the particulars set out in the document are entered in the register. This bill, however, is not about placing an absolute fetter on any use of the protected Sydney Games indicia and images. The government recognises that the preservation of sponsorship revenue is essential to achieving a good budget outcome for the games. But the fundamental Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2479 rights of the community to freedom of expression must be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage. It must therefore be emphasised that restrictions on the usage of the Sydney Games indicia and images will apply only to unlicensed commercial use of the protected indicia and images. Moreover, it is made clear in the bill that the legislation is not intended to affect the working of many aspects of everyday business. It is recognised that some individuals and corporations already use the indicia prescribed in the legislation in conjunction with their goods and services. There are, for example, goods and services which either have the trademark 'Olympic' or include the word 'Olympic'-such as Olympic tyres and Olympic Airways. This legislation is not about stopping traders who have been using these indicia and images for years from continuing that use. The established rights of owners of registered trademarks or designs containing those indicia and images remain unaffected, so long as the trademarks or designs are not used in a way so as to imply a connection to the games. The use of the Sydney Games indicia or images solely for the purposes of providing information, or for the purposes of criticism or review, is not of itself prohibited. Examples of such provision of information include the reporting of news and presentation of current affairs, the factual description of goods or services provided by a business, such as stating that accommodation is available at a hotel that is located near the Olympic site or the factual statements by an athlete to promote their own achievements. Examples of criticism and review are those which are likely to appear in newspapers, magazines or similar periodicals, in a radio or television broadcast, or in a cinematographic film. The government recognises that the reasonable needs of sporting bodies in relation to fund raising for and promotion of their preparation of athletes and teams for the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games should be allowed to continue. Those reasonable needs could involve use of the Sydney Games indicia or images for the purposes of providing factual information. As I have just explained, the bill is not intended to affect this type of use. In the interests of clarity and certainty, the government believes it would be desirable for sporting bodies to negotiate memoranda of understanding with SOCOG to cover their proposed use of the Sydney Games indicia and images. The Australian Sports Commission has negotiated such an agreement. While strategies are being devised to ensure that new business opportunities will flow to all industries, including small and medium enterprises, the tourism industry in particular has the greatest contribution to make in securing and dispersing spin-off benefits from the games. It has therefore been a major concern that the legislation does not inhibit the capacity of tourism marketing bodies and individual firms to undertake advertising and promotional activities which complement the role of SOCOG and the Olympic bodies. The provision of the information clause, which I have just mentioned, accommodates tourism marketing. That is, tourism marketing involving the provision of information that is both generic tourism promotion by official marketing bodies and factual statements about products and services by individual firms, should not require SOCOG's approval. Those tourism businesses wishing to become directly associated with the games will need to apply to The bill provides various remedies to SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to enforce their rights in relation to the Sydney Games indicia and images. Thus, where an unlicensed user uses Sydney Games indicia or images in contravention of the bill, SOCOG, SPOC or a relevant MC 2480 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 licensed user may bring an action against the unlicensed user. The remedies available under the bill include injunctions, damages and corrective advertising. However, in addition to those remedies, the courts have the discretion to provide remedies under any law (whether a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory) that confers any rights or powers on SOCOG, SPOC or a licensed user. Most notable in this regard are the remedies provided under the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive. The bill also includes appropriate customs measures to limit the possibility of the importation of goods which seek to ambush the games marketing. The ongoing cost to the government of administering this legislation will be minimal. The Australian Customs Service will be able to carry out the measures of this legislation relating to the monitoring of imported goods at the barrier within their existing resources. It is likely that the increased security of the Olympic 2000 indicia and images will enhance SOCOG's and SPOC's capacity to ensure the financial viability of the 2000 Games through its marketing program. I believe that the bill introduces significant protection for the Sydney Games indicia and images. The protection provided by this bill will both complement and enhance the protective measures already in place under Australia's current intellectual property laws to ensure, to the extent possible, that a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Tourism( Mr Moore) for reading the second reading speech again on the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996. BeforeI make some comments about that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I make a suggestion for you to take up with the Speaker. I should have made this suggestion previously. When the bill has already passed through the Senate, perhaps the opportunity could be pursued for second reading speeches to be incorporated in Hansard in the House of Representatives. It might save the honourable minister's time and those of us who are going to speak will know that the debate has already occurred in the other place. We can get hold of the legislation from there and prepare our response accordingly. convey his views to the Speaker. not oppose the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996. In fact, we wholeheartedly embrace it. As the honourable minister indicated, this particular bill with three minor changes in fact had been put before the parliament just before it was prorogued last year, and regrettably did not therefore receive passage. As a result, it has had to be put in again now. Clearly, because of all the reasons that the minister has espoused, it is a bill that should be supported. I do want to pick up on a couple of the points that are there, though, because I do think it is extremely important that we not understate one or two very significant matters associated with the year 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Very recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Homebush site. If members of this parliament get the opportunity to organise a visit to the Olympic site at Homebush, I commend the visit. It is extremely enlightening to see the work that has already taken place and that is ongoing. It is a real eye-opener to look at the plans that are in place and to look at the magnitude of the proposal which Australia was successful in obtaining.",120,Representatives Main Committee

213,Mr Martin,"You are very kind. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The opposition doesThursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2481 That said, one of the things which concerns me a touch when talking about the Olympics, about marketing and about why we need this legislation in place to protect the indicia and the images associated with the Olympic Games is that maybe we place too much emphasis on the commercial aspect of the games. I had the opportunity to talk recently to Lois Appleby from the paralympic organisation here in Australia and she was telling me she has just come back from Atlanta. She said, 'You would be surprised. The word ""athlete"" was hardly ever mentioned. What they were concerned about in Atlanta was Coca-Cola sponsorship or sponsorship by AT&T or sponsorship by Nike or Reebok, or whoever it might be that has gotten that sponsorship, and the athletes hardly rate a mention at the moment in Atlanta.' I think to some extent we might tend to lose sight of the fact that the modem Olympics are the ultimate test of the athleticism of men and women from around this globe brought together in the summer Olympics in a spirit of peace and harmony but certainly fierce competition. Perhaps it would not hurt for a few of us at least to continue to remind people that that is the case. But it still is important to protect the revenue raising ability of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and also the Sydney Paralympics Organising Committee and their opportunities to maximise revenue from the Olympics in the year 2000. It is important, because of what we have seen in past Olympic Games, for that to occur with a legislative base. There is no doubt that ambush marketing is something which could have a detrimental effect on the revenue capacity of the games and its organisers and therefore a consequential effect on whether the games are seen to be successful in terms of a dollar making ability. It is said that when the bid was put forward by Sydney, with the support of the Australian government and of course the New South Wales government, very tight constraints were imposed on that bid in terms of bUdgeting. Part of that budgeting went to the issue of revenue that could be raised through the licensing of particular companies to sell products which were endorsed by the organising committees and which clearly carried some identifying logo relevant to the Olympic Games. Ambush marketing is defined as the unauthorised association by businesses of their names, brands, products or services with a sports event or competition through anyone or more of a wide range of marketing activities. It is unauthorised in the sense that the controller of the commercial rights in such events, usually the relevant governing body, has neither sanctioned nor licensed the association itself or through its commercial agents. That is really what our concern is about in respect of this legislation. What we are concerned about is the fact that the Olympic Games in Sydney are estimated to cost between $2 billion and $3 billion, and there is some $700 million expected to be raised from commercial sponsorship. That commercial sponsorship is going to be an underpinning feature of meeting budget commitments and ensuring that the facilities that are going to have to be built on the way through are in fact ready in time and are leading edge facilities. That is happening now. As I said, take the opportunity to go and have a look at what is happening at Homebush and you will see for yourselves. Some licences have been announced already, particularly for a whole range of clothing, from underwear through to tracksuits. A whole range of preferred suppliers have been licensed by those people that have been given a licence to manufacture products and put the Olympic logos on them for Sydney and have some revenue raised in that respect. But it goes further. As we MC 2482 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 know, large commercial sponsorships from organisations, whether they be telecommunications carriers, banks, airlines or whatever, ate just around the comer. Clearly, people are paying substantial amounts of money to be the up-front premier sponsors of the Sydney Olympics, and they want recognition for it. They are not going to throw hundreds of millions of dollars into this to let somebody else come along and by some sleight of hand, or by the use of the Olympic rings, or the torch, or by talking about gold or silver sponsorships-as the minister outlined in his second reading speech-having a de facto sponsorship and therefore giving the indication in the minds of some that they are official sponsors. Only the ones that are licensed by the organisations mentioned have that responsibility; only they have the right to market themselves in that way. There are some exemptions contained within this legislation, and the minister mentioned those. I want to reinforce the point that businesses already using prescribed words or symbols-such as Olympic Airways-can continue to do so providing, of course, that they do not link themselves specifically to these games. They are permitted the use of prescribed words in news and current affairs reporting. Factual information, tour operators and hotels are the examples that the minister used. I think that is absolutely correct. You cannot stop the genuine need for news broadcasts to refer to the Sydney Olympics or to talk about it and, clearly, this bill makes the necessary exemptions. But what we do not want is to get into some of the ambush marketing that occurred in some previous Olympics. For example, the Nike-Reebok sneakers war during the 1992 Barcelona summer Olympics saw members of the gold medal winning USA basketball dream team, with personal sponsorships from Nike, threatening to boycott the medal presentation rather than wear the official team uniform featuring Nike's rival, Reebok. That sort of thing should not be allowed to happen again. During the Barcelona Olympics General Motors Holden advertised that it would give a golden Holden to any gold medal winner, despite Toyota's exclusive deal of sponsorship. These are some of the examples where I think it is important that protection is given to those people and those large businesses that are putting many tens of millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions, towards the Sydney Olympics. The question about memorandums of understanding being signed between sports and organisations has some merit, and I think the minister is absolutely right to highlight that. There are already some examples with the Australian Olympic Committee where that is happening, and I commend the minister's action as well. I will not delay consideration or passage of this bill. As I said, the opposition wholeheartedly supports it. It had its genesis when we were the government in the last parliament, and regrettably, it did not get passed in time. It has a sunset clause; it will conclude at the conclusion of the Olympic Games and I think that that is appropriate. I would like to conclude by commending both John Coates, from the Australian Olympic Committee, and Michael Knight, the minister in New South Wales responsible for the Olympics. Those two have the highest public profile when it comes to the Olympics at this stage. They have negotiated an extremely fair and reasonable set of circumstances for year 2000 Olympics, particularly in respect of the matter of ongoing sponsorship. Michael Knight has one eye, quite obviously, on the finances of the state government of New South Wales-as any responsible minister would have-and John Coates, an absolutely dynamic, committed Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2483 individual for the Australian Olympic movement for many years, has his eye on protecting Australia's Olympic interests into the future. Both of them have been accommodating, and both have accommodated the need for commercial sponsorship. I think that this bill, which was discussed previously with the organising committees and which has been discussed before this parliament, is something which reflects very well on the New South Wales government and, in particular, on Michael Knight, the Australian Olympic Committee and John Coates. And we should not forget the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and the Sydney Paralympics Organising Committee. Those people also have been well and truly involved in the negotiations on what the structure of this bill should be and the way in which the outcomes of the bill, in terms of protection of sponsorship, will enhance those organisations. They have been given the primary responsibility for ensuring that the Olympic 2000 games are successful. They need to be successful for Australia for all the reasons that we know. Not only do the games give us a chance to showcase our own Olympic athletic prowess, but they also-as the minister at the table would know-give us that opportunity between now and then, and subsequently, to market Australia more broadly as a destination for international tourists. We have to make sure that we get it right and that we tum on games the likes of which the world has never seen. I think we can. After all, it is going to be in one of the best cities in the world. I think we would all agree with that. Even my Tasmanian colleague, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government ( Mr Warwick Smith), would agree with that. I think it is important that we ensure that this legislation gets a speedy passage through the House. I wish it success. Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.30 a.m.)-I thank the Shadow Minister for Sport and Tourism, the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Martin), for his recognition of the fact that I think Sydney is a great city. I do, in fact, think it is a great city-second only, of course, to Launceston. I can see that the member for Denison( Mr Kerr) has been putting in a bid for Hobart. I take this opportunity to speak on the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill in my capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, in which capacity I have an overarching responsibility for all matters Olympic as we go forward, and also in my capacity as Minister for Sport. The Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games are already a major focus for sports development in Australia. This focus is not only on Olympic sports and elite Olympic athletes; it is also proving to be the focus for grassroots participation development and in many cases for non-Olympic sports. We ought not to forget that. The sporting community as a whole is excited about the Olympics and enthusiastic about the contribution the games will make to the development of sport in our country. The whole community shares this enthusiasm. It is important for Australia and Australian sport that these games are a success. The commitment by the shadow minister and the work of others whom he mentioned are certainly recognised. One of the critical factors in the success of the games is the ability of the organisers, funds necessary to host the games. That is certainly a massive task. The budget for simply hosting the games is nearly $2 billion-not including construction of facilities. Of that,",124,Representatives Main Committee
214,Mr Warwick Smith (Bass,"Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government andMC 2484 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 sponsors, licensing and marketing. If SOCOG falls short of raising enough money to host the games, then the New South Wales taxpayers will be required to foot the bill. SOCOG's ability to meet the target relies to a large extent on the degree of exclusivity an official sponsor will gain over games indicia and images. That is the reason for this bill, which enjoys very strong bipartisan support. My colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism( Mr Moore) went into some of the detail of the legislation. I shall not traverse that same territory. Let me refer to ambush marketing, which is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event. Typically, the ambush marketer seeks to gain some benefit by suggesting that it is associated with the event without paying for those rights. It is emerging as a bit of a problem in Atlanta already, I understand. We want to try to avoid that problem occurring here. Ambush marketing can have a severe impact on exclusivity and consequently on the ability of SOCOG to raise the necessary funds. In keeping with our strong commitment to support the Sydney Olympic Games, the coalition recognised, as did the former government, that legislation was necessary to protect the Sydney Olympics from ambush marketing. As early as February 1995, we announced that we would support legislation to protect the games from ambush marketing. Our 1996 sports policy committed the government to 'enact strong and effective Olympic anti-ambush marketing legislation in consultation with the Australian Olympic Committee.' I am pleased to say that this legislation implements our election commitment and mirrors almost exactly the draft legislation that the previous government put forward. Those consultations have been extremely positive. I hope that this is the beginning of a very positive and cooperative relationship at all levels of government and with all in the broader Olympic family as we all work as a nation to deliver a very successful games in the year 2000. The minister covered most of the detail of the legislation, and I do not propose to repeat those details. Naturally, however, with the games four years away, the situation is still evolving. The government is discussing with SOCOG and other parties some additional requests for protection. This may result in further amendments to the legislation being required to be brought to this place. Despite the possible need for later amendments, it was clear that the need to have protection in place prior to the Atlanta games made the immediate introduction of this legislation necessary. So we are particularly pleased to be dealing with that matter today and we are pleased that the opposition has already signalled its strong support. I am confident that the government's prompt action on the legislation will put the Sydney games organisers in the best possible position to secure the revenue needed to finance the games. That is an issue that will be concerning all of us. This is a very vital piece of legislation to enable them to do that. Perhaps the most important issue and the greatest challenge for the government was to draft legislation which would give SOCOG and SPOC the protection they deserve without producing unintended consequences. The intention is quite clear: unscrupulous people should not be able to cash in on the Olympics when they have made no contribution to supporting the event. The official sponsors and licensees need to be sure that they are not going to have their marketing advantage or their market taken from them. This goes for the biggest sponsor in the corporate category right through to the person producing Sydney Olympics pens. Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2485 However, as sports minister, I believe it was also important to ensure that the legislation did not unduly restrict the legitimate activities of sporting organisations and individual athletes. For an athlete, a blanket restriction on the use of the words 'Olympic', 'Olympian' or 'Olympic gold medallist', for example, might have serious detrimental effects. Most Olympic athletes make huge financial sacrifices to get to the top of their sport. Very few have time to undertake normal work and, as a result, most defer their careers and their financial security for many years. For those athletes, the opportunity to gain sponsorship or market themselves as Olympic athletes brings a small recompense for the years of effort they have put in. Very few athletes have the stature or earning potential of, say, a Kieren Perkins bu., as an example, just imagine how his earning potential would be affected if he were prohibited from promoting himself as an Olympic gold medallist. As a result of the involvement of the Australian Sports Commission in the development of the legislation, I am confident that the rights of athletes will be preserved by the legislation. Under the legislation, athletes will be able to make a factual statement of their performance or achievements, subject to any other agreements they might sign. This means that an athlete who is a member of the Atlanta Olympic Games team will be able to describe himself or herself as an Olympian or an Olympic athlete and, if that athlete is fortunate enough to win a gold medal, as an Olympic gold medallist. Sporting organisations also had the potential to be affected by the legislation. The Olympic sporting organisations, for example, may have perfectly legitimate uses for words such as 'Olympic' or 'Olympic team'. Once again, these organisations will be able to make factual statements. Olympic sporting organisations are already obliged by an Australian Olympic Committee by-law to observe certain restrictions in the use of Olympic words and symbols. As a result, this legislation should not prove unduly restrictive on the activities of Olympic sporting organisations. The government was obviously also concerned to ensure that the Australian Sports Commission and particularly the Australian Institute of Sport were able to continue their legitimate promotion and fundraising activity in the lead-up to the games. The government, through the Australian Sports Commission, is making by far the biggest financial contribution to the development of our Olympic athletes. The $135 million Olympic athlete program, combined with other funding, is crucial for the development of our team. It is reasonable to expect that the commission should be able to gain credit for its role and its expertise. In addition, the ASC raises approximately $10 million per annum from a combination of program revenue, other funding and sponsorships to supplement government funding. The government believes the ASC should be able to continue to attract sponsor support, and should not be unduly restricted by the legislation. In the discussions which led to this legislation, it was clear that some uses the AIS might have wished to make of protected indicia or images might have constituted a breach of the legislation. The AIS may, for example, wish to state that it is 'training athletes for the Sydney 2000 Games' -a factual statement, but one which might have breached the legislation. To ensure that the Australian Sports Commission's legitimate uses are protected, the commission has negotiated with SOCOG a memorandum of understanding governing the use of protected indicia and images. The MOU sets out the purposes and circumstances under which the commission can use protected indicia or images. It also includes a dispute resolution procedure in the unlikely event MC 2486 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 that a disagreement should arise. The MOU has continued the very positive and constructive working relationship which has developed between the Australian Sports Commission and government works with SOCOG to ensure that the Sydney Olympic Games are a success. The legislation is a tangible sign of the government's commitment to ensuring that the Sydney 2000 Games are a success. It adds to a broader range of assistance that the government is currently providing. As Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, I have as one of my tasks to be involved in the coordination of the Commonwealth's involvement in the games. My appointment by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) to this position, in addition to being Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, is another important sign of the government's commitment to having a cooperative, coordinated approach to all that is going to be required to ensure that the games are a success. the Commonwealth is very broad. Apart from financial assistance of $150 million, paid already by agreement between both major parties in this country for construction of facilities, $135 million for the preparation of athletes-which I have already mentioned-and $25 million towards staging the Paralympics, the Commonwealth is providing assistance with land for the Olympic village, drug testing, security, immigration, Customs and quarantine, health care, coin issue, communications and transport, and promotion of Australia. I predict that, over the period, very few areas of government will remain untouched by games activity and there needs to be a positive approach from all of us. I hope to ensure also that very few Australians will remain untouched by the overall Olympic experience. We need to ensure that it is not just Sydney that is going to see the benefit of the games. The bill we are debating today will help to ensure that the staging of the games themselves will be a success. The government's commitment to Olympic athlete development will help to ensure that our athletes' performances wiIl be successful. The third element of a successful games is to ensure that they produce benefits for all Australians. Later this year the government will announce how it is to implement its 2000 Plus election commitment. 2000 Plus wiII ensure that Australians in all states and territories benefit from Sydney hosting the 2000 Games. I indicated when I commenced my remarks that the 2000 Games were proving to be a focus for the whole sporting community. The chaIIenge is to utilise the focus on 2000 to ensure that, after 2000, we have a legacy of a fitter, more active society, a more professional sports industry and a range of ongoing economic and social benefits. These games will be a wonderful experience for all Australians and for the sporting community in particular. I am pleased that, through this biIl, the government wiIl be making a very substantial contribution to ensuring that the games are a success, and doing so in a very timely fashion in advance of the Atlanta Games. I congratulate my coIleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism( Mr Moore) for the work he and his department have done in putting together this piece of legislation which is quite complex. I also thank the opposition shadow spokesman, and the opposition generally, for the support they have given; originally, of course, it was their bill.

I, too, commend the bill to the committee. be a short contribution to this debate on the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996. I do so because I think the balance has been struck in a way which is quite defensible. It enables protection of the commercial sponsors of the Olympic Games, but does not include some of the provisions that might have been thought to offend against the rights of individual athletes and critics and others who may wish to engage in some debate about the sporting event, in a way that was the case with the bicentennial legislation. I have taken the opportunity to speak in this debate because I have a small personal history in the litigation that was conducted against the bicentennial legislation. At the time before my election in 1987, I spent some period as principal solicitor for the Aboriginal Legal Service. They were under instructions from an Aboriginal small business person who wanted to make certain statements on tee-shirts he was manufacturing. The statements expressed some antagonism towards the spirit of the bicentennial, and pointed out that, as well as the 200 years of European settlement in Australia which the nation was celebrating, there was a period of 200 years of dispossession which Aboriginal Australians were concerned about. Many of the ways in which the bicentennial act had been constructed would have prohibited the use of free speech and the use of expressions in common use. I was responsible for drafting the action and for appearing in the High Court before the then Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs. But by the time the case actually came on to the final determination I had become a member of parliament, and I was spared having to agitate for the case before the full court of the High Court, which heard it. The points which we had raised, however, were successful in Davis v. Commonwealth, which is reported in 63 ALR 35. It is an interesting case, because the High Court, in a sense, anticipates its later decisions in terms of implied freedoms of speech-doctrines which have been the subject of some considerable controversy since that time. But, whatever the merits or otherwise of that stream of judicial law making, it is appropriate to reflect on the substance of what the court said, which is that it is inappropriate for legislation to go beyond what is a legitimate extension of the Commonwealth's interests in providing the lawful and appropriate protection, in the commercial sense, of the symbols. I am pleased at the balance that the bill has established. As the minister indicated, this is legislation that was introduced by the former government and has been picked up-without any change at all-by the incoming government. It will prevent abuse of the commercial interests of those persons participating as sponsors in the Olympic Games. But it will not have the far reach of previous attempts to protect symbols, which were brought undone in the Davis v. Commonwealth case, for example, during the bicentennial.",130,Representatives Main Committee

Commonwealth was entirely pyrrhic. By the time the High Court had decided its case, the bicentennial year had concluded. Townsville, in North Queensland, to be up here talking about the Sydney 2000 Olympics. But it is important not to lose sight of the fact that, while Sydney will be hosting the games, all Australians must get behind the effort to ensure that it is a success. the national Olympic effort is in the policing of the anti-ambush marketing laws spelt out in the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996. This bill reflects one of the great features of Australian culture and society: having a fair go. With so much potential investment in the commercial sponsorship side of the Sydney Olympics-an expected $700 million-it is only fair that we do the best we can to ensure the commercial sponsors are given a fair go for their dollars. If we were to open the Olympic name and symbol to everyone to capitalise on we would very quickly lose the meaning behind the name and the meaning behind the symbol. It would become cheap, commercial and, ultimately, of no use to anyone. Going to a rugby league match today is almost like sitting at home watching it on television; commercials blare out over loudspeakers and giant video screens broadcast as to the crowd during half-time. by one group or another, as are the man of the match, try of the match, most valuable player and so on. The Olympic Games are big business and there can be no doubt about it. But it does not have to become overcommercialised; that will cheapen the event. I smiled to myself when I went through the submission prepared by the New South Wales government and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games when this bill was in its infancy. In their appendix they list a range of business names that have been applied for since 1993 when Sydney won the bid to host the games. At the top of the list is the business name 'Sydney 2000 Olympic Condoms'. I am no advertising whiz but I can imagine the advertising campaign that would have been based around the Olympic motto 'citius, altius, fortius' or 'swifter, higher, stronger'. It does not take much of an imagination to see what they probably had in mind. Unlike the upcoming Atlanta Olympics, where the corporate dollar funds the event almost 100 per cent, the Sydney Olympics will be funded to a large extent by the taxpayer. The New South Wales state government has agreed to pick up the shortfall in funding for the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. With taxpayers already footing part of the Olympic bill, I am sure they will not be pleased if we do not ensure that sponsors maximise returns on their investments and minimise the chance of further demands on the state or federal governments. What we should be trying to do in Australia is to encourage sponsorship investment in sporting events. Why should the taxpayer always have to carry a large part of the bill? Tight laws protecting or limiting the use of key words, phrases and images associated with the Sydney Olympics encourage and protect that investment.

It is a very tempting advertising market and the potential rewards for successfully tapping it are huge. No doubt the temptation will prove too much for some and they will try to make a serious dollar or two by illegally associating themselves with the Olympic Games or the Olympic symbol. The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games is awarding 45 product licences under a $1 billion retail and marketing deal. Late last month the committee awarded the first seven licences; the top sponsors invested about $40 million each for exclusive product rights. Each of the companies is expected, according to the Australian, to generate about $400 million in retail sales in the run-up to the Sydney Games. The games organising committee estimates that the sale of lapel pins alone for the Sydney 2000 Games could be up to 20 million units. The committee will be taking a 15 per cent cut from the revenue; this is approximately $50 to $60 million, depending on the final gross. Senator Kemp said, in the second reading of the bill, that the revenue raised from official sponsorship would need to be of the order of $700 million to be in line with budget expectations for the games. In July 1994, the New South Wales government and the Sydney organising committee produced a joint submission for the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Olympic related words and symbols. In that submission it stated that: If the Commonwealth government fails to implement the proposed legislative protection, there could be a serious threat to the financial viability of the Sydney 2000 Games ... The amount that sponsors will be willing to contribute to the Sydney 2000 Games will depend on the sponsors' degree of confidence that their sponsorship exclusivity will be protected by Australian laws. The games organising committee would have a difficult time attracting such sponsors if it were not for tough laws preventing or deterring ambush marketing. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, there are about 850 companies interested in trying to get one of the 45 product licences. The interest is certainly there, but only because of the prospect of laws to protect companies once they get the contract. In Atlanta, the committee has established a $10 million budget to police ambush marketing tactics and people or companies trying to make an illegal buck from the 1996 Olympics. The team they have set up for this includes private investigators, media monitors, volunteers and market researchers. Their job is to identify and stop ambushers and people engaging in the production of counterfeit Olympic paraphernalia. They have invested $10 million to give protection to licensed sponsors. Sport is a big commercial money-spinner; the Olympics is the biggest game around and it is only going to get bigger. The worldwide television rights for the Montreal Olympics went for about $US32 million; the Atlanta rights have gone for $US900 million. My home city of Townsville stepped into the Olympic spotlight last week when members of the Australian Olympic track and field team travelled north for training and acclimatisation sessions before heading off to Atlanta.

The head of the sports department, Dr Robert Griffiths, said that JCU had been able to offer the Atlanta-bound athletes advanced blood analysis technology. This monitors their bodies during training and their recovery rates after extensive training in the challenging climate. James Cook's sports science department will be a key link in making TownsviIIe an international centre for acclimatisation research and training. Dr Griffiths said that the department has been in close contact with the Australian Institute of Sport and has been able to offer valuable input, based on sophisticated blood test results, of the effects of heat and stress on athletes. Dr Griffiths has also expressed his interest in extending the department's facilities to other areas, such as the Australian Defence Force. The rigorous training they go through could be enhanced through the use of the facilities at the neighbouring James Cook University. While the vast majority of people are in favour of this biII, some groups have argued against it, saying that there is no way to accurately measure whether these seemingly anti-competitive laws are of real benefit. Surely, they say, it would be more lucrative to open competition up to everyone and allow all business to benefit from being able to use the Olympic Games names, phrases and images. I do not think so. We all have to realise that, in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympic Games, Australian businesses and tourism are going to benefit regardless. They will continue to benefit, although not at the same level, when the Games have passed to another country. No matter how hard we try, we cannot force tourists and visitors coming to Australia to shop in one shop, buy one label of clothing, eat at one food outlet, or use the film of one company. The tens of thousands of tourists who will flood into every city in Australia will have to eat food, buy clothing, watch television, take pictures, travel to and from places, and they wiIl do it through a multitude of different companies and businesses. The major sponsors will hold a special position, but then they have invested the money. This biIl protects that investment. I commend the biII to the Main Committee and look forward to its recommendation to the House. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (10.59 a.m.)-The original modem Olympic Games organised by Pierre de Coubertin in 1896 was attended by 311 athletes from 13 countries who competed in 43 events in nine sports. At the Atlanta Games from 19 July until 4 August this year, lO,768 athletes from 197 countries will compete in over 600 events, 37 disciplines, and 26 sports. Some 40,000 volunteers will look after two million visitors and 11 million ticket holders. Some 140,580 rooms will be cleaned, 8,679 kilometres of toilet paper will be used, 727,272 kilograms of linen will be laundered-that is a stack about 4.8 kilometres high-and 110,200 towels will be used. Some two million soft drinks will be sold, and 890 litres of steak sauce, 950,000 apples, 30 kilometres of aluminium foil, 3Y2 million serviettes and 90 kilograms of garlic will be used. From its humble beginnings in Athens, the modem Olympic Games has become a major commercial event. To ignore this commercial reality is to commit your bureaucracy to years of debt, as Montreal did in 1976. The city of Montreal will be paying off the 1976 games well into the next century: great games, but a financial disaster. In fact, the result was so bad for the IOC that they had great difficulty in attracting cities to bid for the 1984 games. Luckily, LA came to the rescue and we had the 1984 games which set the scene for the games today. Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2491 The IOC has three aims: firstly, to ensure the regular celebration of the games, to make sure that they actually occur; secondly, to make them increasingly perfect, more and more worthy of their glorious past and in keeping with the high ideals that inspired those who revived the games; and, thirdly, to encourage and organise all events, taking all steps likely to lead modem athletes along the right lines. Miss JACKIE KELLY-That is our aim. In order to ensure the continued celebration of the games all over the world and not just in large nations, a commercial approach was taken to the LA Olympics. The sporting, commercial and financial success of the LA Olympics ensured the event for years to come. Therefore, this parliament must do everything in its power to ensure the financial success of the Sydney Games in the year 2000. Failure to do this would discourage other cities from holding the games. To make the games even better and more and more worthy of their glorious past, and to organise all events and accommodate the growing number of athletes and events-the number of athletes has grown from 300 in 1896 to over 10,000 in the 23 times that the games have been held-is going to take more and more money, so protection of all areas of revenue is important. Before potential sponsors commit themselves to pay about $40 million per category for exclusive rights, we need to assure them that they are protected from ambush or parasitic marketing practices by commercial rivals. The image we must give to international businesses is that we are up to speed on current business practices and marketing techniques such as those covered by this bill. It is said in advertising that you never get a second chance to make a first impression, and the hosting of the games will introduce many overseas companies to the Australian market for the first time. It must be remembered that the people of New South Wales are committed to covering the costs of the games and, in effect, have purchased the product of the Olympic Games for a short period. We must ensure that they are able to maximise their returns from the valuable product, and the Olympic Games insignia, as a marketing device, are very valuable assets. We must continue to display the level of professionalism and strategic foresight displayed by Mr John Fahey and his team in the successful bid to host the Olympics. We must prepare ourselves to harvest the fruits of such a boon, and the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996 is just such a measure. The bill will contribute to the success of these games and help to protect the citizens of New South Wales and the athletes of Australia. It is important that we do not place the people of Sydney and New South Wales under unnecessary financial burdens as a result of the Olympics. The New South Wales government has committed itself to picking up the tab for many shortfalls from SOCOG's funding; we do not want to be like the citizens of Montreal after the year 2000. The hosting of the Olympic Games is a big business and, as an international event, many overseas companies will be interested in sponsorship deals with SOCOG. These deals will go a long way to covering the more than $3 billion needed to stage the games. The people of Sydney will benefit greatly from the boost to infrastructure that will result from our hosting of the games. I am happy to say that the people of Lindsay will be hosting the rowing events at the Penrith Lakes and the Nepean River is the training venue for the rowing teams. In Penrith, we have the fastest growing junior basketball region in the state of New South Wales. Therefore, our area would make a great location for one of the basketball venues.

Miss JA CKIE KELL Y-That is right, they are. The Sydney Games will allow the people of Lindsay the opportunity to present our area as a wonderful tourist destination to the people of Australia and to the world. The international visitors and worldwide television audience will have the pleasure of watching events held in our area and see the beauty of the Nepean River against the backdrop of the imposing Blue Mountains escarpment. What of the athletes themselves? The definition of 'amateur' has gone by the board. The training required to reach Olympic standard today is almost full-time. The commitment and sacrifice is huge and the athletes should be able to realise financial reward for their efforts. All too often we lose talented young athletes in their late teens or early twenties because they can no longer rely on parental support; they must support themselves. They must look to their future careers. All too often their chosen sport is unable to provide their pay cheque. They find themselves turning to other avenues and other careers in order to get a pay cheque. I know, because in 1988 I was faced with a similar decision. I was a struggling athlete. I had represented Australia at the senior B level and I had dreamed of representing Australia in Seoul. That was my ambition for about two years. I had a full-time job. I was spending most of my income on my rowing equipment. I was studying part-time to keep my university studies relevant and I was training five hours a day. So was the rest of my crew. We were not amateurs and we did not get AIS sponsorship. In 1988 we won a national title, only to be told there were insufficient funds to send a women's team to the lead-up regattas, let alone to the Olympics in Seoul. I left rowing to follow a military career: I needed the pay cheque. But I still have the dream that the Olympics will be the battlefield of the future, that nations will sort out their differences and aggressions on the sporting fields and abide by the umpire's decision. It is possible to use the Olympics for political ends and, except for the Munich Games, such exercising of political will does not have the enormous cost to human life that military action does. Winning an Olympic medal brings great kudos to your country. To give our athletes the best chance of reaching the world No. 1 ranking in their sport we must provide all the financial assistance we can. We need to encourage and safeguard sponsors' rights and promote private investment in our games and our athletes. The more young sportsmen who can make a living out of their sport instead of a military career, the closer to my dream we will be. This bill is the start of financially rewarding careers in sport in Australia. May I remind the House of an Olympic motto: the most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part. Do not let us take financial constraints as any reason for athletes not to be able to participate at this level. The most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The physical activity of our young and upcoming athletes teaches them the discipline that they can maintain right throughout life. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well. Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (11.09 a.m.)-by leave-I might just take the opportunity to sum up on behalf of the minister who is absent launching a spaceship somewhere.

228,Mr Warwick Smith (Bass,"Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government andThursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2493 the contributions of Mr Martin, Mr Kerr, Mr Lindsay and Miss Kelly. Mr Martin was particularly positive about the legislation. Mr Kerr told an interesting story about his High Court appearances. He won the case but, because the decision was made well after the bicentenary, he was unable to get the benefit for his clients. But particularly I want to thank Mr Lindsay and Miss Kelly. Mr Lindsay indicated in his remarks that the Olympic Games can be an opportunity for a broad benefit for all Australia. What has happened in sports medicine at James Cook University in Townsville with the visiting Olympians who went there for climate activity prior to going to Atlanta is an indication of what can happen in the Sydney 2000 Games. We must ensure that all areas of Australia are going to be able to participate in some positive way and that those communities are going to get the benefit. It was particularly interesting to note that the TV rights-and this is the genus of what this legislation is about, providing marketing protection-in Montreal cost $32 million whereas in Atlanta they cost $900 million. Quite an extraordinary amount of money has now been paid. It is very much an international event. We ought not to forget here in Australia that when the games take place here and coincide with the change in the millennium that we are going to be showcasing Australia to the rest of the world through our sporting endeavours. The honourable member for Lindsay made a very interesting contribution. I had not realised that she had committed so much to rowing. We are very lucky to have her in the House and her contribution was particularly positive. You will find, of course, there is some similarity between rowing and politics in that you look one way and go another. Do not take that as being a negative remark. I also was a rower but I did not last very long. I thought the contribution by the honourable member was very positive and I thank her for that. The bill, as all speakers pointed out, will provide significant protection for the 2000 Games. It is particularly important, as I have said and as did the minister, to have this done at such an expeditious time in advance of Atlanta. The whole issue of protecting the games licensing revenue from ambush marketing was originally brought to the parliament by Senator Ian Campbell, a Western Australian senator who prior to the election was also shadow minister for sport. He moved a motion that the matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs back in June 1994. He is now the parliamentary secretary in this area. It was through that initiative that this legislation came about. The committee was chaired by another Western Australian lawyer, Senator Chris Ellison, and it brought down a unanimous report supporting the introduction of this legislation to protect the games revenue from ambush marketing and here we are in 1996 putting it into effect through the committee process with a report now to the House of Representatives. The government has been particularly conscious, in preparing the legislation, to give the games organisers the best possible protection without unduly inhibiting the legitimate operations of business. There is always a fine balance to be struck. We believe we have got it right. As I mentioned in my speech, there may be a necessity to bring in some further amendments to refine the matter but at this stage we think we have got it about right. A number of commercial firms have been using the word 'Olympic' as a business name and as a trademark for many years. This legislation is not about stopping traders from continuing with those legitimate uses. Traders may not, however, use the word in a way as to suggest a connection with the games unless they are duly licensed. Indeed, the member for Herbert MC 2494 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 ( Mr Lindsay) gave us some examples of what had taken place yesterday with the 45 licences that have been issued. We wanted to make sure that there was a proper balance between the rights of the games organisers to protect that licensing revenue and the existing rights of members of the public and the wider business community. We believe that that protection provided by the bill will complement and enhance the protective measures already in place under Australia's current intellectual property laws and that it will help to ensure that a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games. I pay tribute to the people in the minister's department in the intellectual property law area who had the prime responsibility for preparing this legislation. It is complex. There is keen interest in the definitional aspects and I think they have done a particularly good job. With those words, I thank again those who have contributed to a very positive debate and discussion of this matter. On behalf of the absent minister I can say that I hope that this matter can now proceed to the House of Representatives without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 June, on motion by Mr Warwick Smith: That the bill be now read a second time. bipartisan approach to all matters associated with sport generally, let me indicate to the honourable the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government ( Mr Warwick Smith) at the outset that the opposition wholeheartedly supports this particular legislation, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1996, as well. I am particularly delighted to be speaking in support of the legislation. Ever since the Australian Sports Drug Agency was established in 1990, each time some legislation has come before this parliament I have taken an opportunity to speak in support of it. I have done so because at the time when there was a Senate committee-or it might even have been the drugs in sport inquiry, which was chaired by Senator John Black from Queensland-I was chairing another inquiry in the House of Representatives into the funding and administration of sport. There was a degree of overlap in there, and occasionally there was a little bit of confusion about which committee was actually responsible for what part. But at the end of the day, the drugs in sport report, which came down in May 1990, saw the Australian Sports Drug Agency established. In the Department of the Parliamentary Library Parliamentary Research Service brief, Bills Digest No. 103 of 1995-96, entitled 'The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1996' -and I go to that length so that I am not accused of stealing anybody else's words here-it indicates on page 2 that ASDA's mission is to ensure that Australian athletes are able to compete in sport which is free from banned doping practices. The agency's vision is to be one of the leading sports agencies in the world and to achieve excellence as a small statutory authority.",136,Representatives Main Committee
229,Mr Martin (Cunningham) (11.15 A.m.),"While we are in the mood for taking a veryThursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2495 I have to say from personal experience-not by being tested, but by involvement through my rugby league club, through the rugby league generally and through a number of other sports-that that vision has been achieved now and is appropriate, and that its mission is also being achieved. As an organisation, it is at the leading edge and one which the rest of the world could look to. It is not a secret, and I am not saying anything to anybody in this room that is not already known, that Australians have always prided themselves on their athleticism, their love of sport and the fact that they had always wanted to see that they were competing on equal and drug-free terms. One of the things that we have always championed in this country is drug-free sport. We have seen some fairly famous cases involving Australians where our credentials in this area have been open to scrutiny. The drugs in sport inquiry was largely started because of an Australian athlete who maintained that the caffeine level in his body was related to his intake of several cups of coffee before he participated in his event. As a result of that there were all sorts of activities undertaken at the time. Most recently we have seen the Sam Riley case. Could you ever take a more Australian Australian, someone as dedicated as Sam Riley, somebody as a role model, and say that simply because she took a headache tablet that contained a banned substance, she deserved to be banned? Incidentally, as I understand it, the substance was not performance enhancing but was, in fact, exactly the opposite. It was something designed to slow down performance. Yet she was faced at one stage with a possible ban, and we have seen a ban being imposed on her coach. calling for testing when we saw the pictures of the Chinese swimming team, for example-I would not mind a couple of them playing for the Illawarra Steelers as front rowers, but they were swimmersaround that suggests that the international authorities thought that because an Australian was involved in this, they should make an example of her-'Let us just see how the Australians like it when a particular ruling is given against them'. I hope that the international authorities are bigger than that. It is unfortunate that Sam's swimming coach has got to suffer that ban. It has been reduced, I know, but he still has that ban. Fortunately, he is still able to coach. But, whilst he might be in Atlanta, he is not going to be poolside, and that is a great shame. Fortunately for Australia, and fortunately for Sam Riley, she has been able to get above this and put it behind her. She is training extremely well. She was given an Order of Australia award in the recent announcements, which I think is a great recognition of a superb Australian. Yet she has had to go through so much. The point is that what we in this country have done is matched the rhetoric of our absolute opposition to drugs in sport with some positive action. The government is to be commended for bringing this bill forward, because what it is doing is enhancing our ability to test not only Australian athletes but also those from overseas countries, and to put into place a number of arrangements which perhaps have existed in an informal sense.",138,Representatives Main Committee

233,Mr Martin,"When we saw them, we were actually critical of that. There is a viewMC 2496 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 In no way are we talking about infringing on the rights of athletes in some way. That is not what this is about at all. In fact, it is very clearly set out in the legislative base. Going through the clauses, one finds that it talks about the techniques of sample taking; who does the testing; if there is a positive test, how that is reported; processes so that, if someone has an intellectual disability of some kind, whoever is the guardian or parent is given the results of those tests; and so on. All of that is captured in here so that the rights of athletes are protected. What we are doing is actually extending the ability of the Australian Sports Drug Agency to do what it does best: that is, ensure that people in all forms of sport in this country-from the highest competitive level to the most basic level-compete equally against each other, so that whoever wins the gold does so on the basis of natural ability and natural talent. That is something that we should all be delighted about. As I have mentioned, I have had involvement with ASDA. On a number of occasions they came to check out, at random, clubs that are participating in the Australian Rugby League competition. Of course, my club-the Illawarra Steelers, of which I am still a director-is occasionally subjected to those testing procedures, and we see the ASDA people down in the dressing sheds waiting for the appropriate people to test. That is extended not only to the Australian Rugby League but also to the AFL, the National Soccer League, the National Basketball League and the Uncle Toby's Professional lronman and Ironwoman Super Series. That is important. As a parent, somebody who has kids involved in sport or somebody who is coaching a sporting team at home, what you want are role models who are going to be there as competitive athletes: people who are going to be out there striving, training hard and showing what it is like to be a competitive athlete without having to rely on banned substances to get across the line first. That is the sort of thing that we should be holding up to people, not the likes of failed pop stars who come back to Australia and say that they like taking drugs. That is not the sort of role model we are talking about. What we are talking about are Australian athletes-people like Sam Riley-who are out there and are clearly the sorts of role models that we want our children to emulate. In terms of ASDA and its international initiatives, to again go to the brief provided by the Parliamentary Library, on page 3 there is a whole series of arrangements with foreign antidoping bodies which have been approved under the principal act. They are required to maintain lists of who they are actually working with, and they are listed here: the British Council Doping Control Unit, the Canadian Centre for Drug-Free Sport, the New Zealand Sports Drug Agency and International Doping Tests Management. I notice that we are also assisting China, at the present moment, in developing its anti-doping policies and testing procedures. I think that is quite appropriate. In fact, sport can be a very useful tool in assisting with the democratisation of countries where, perhaps, there are some concerns. I am not specifically talking about China in this case. Basically, if people in a sporting community understand-through coming to international meets and so on-the aspirations of other athletes and the types of environments in which other athletes participate, and see the freedoms that are involved, that can assist with political democratisation in their countries in a broader sense. I think that is quite an appropriate thing to do. The fact that we in Australia have been able to assist so widely in developing drug testing programs, signing memoranda with a whole range of governments around the world to assist in that and entering into intergovernmental agreements is a great tribute to this country, to the Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2497 past government and, certainly, to the present government that has taken these initiatives in bringing this legislation forward now. I am not going to go into all the provisions that are contained in this because they have been adequately covered by the minister in his second reading speech. I would simply say, though, that we have to be ever vigilant. I say that because very recently-and I am not sure if honourable members saw this-a survey was done again of Australia's leading athletes and questions were put to them about drug usage. The one of greatest concern to me was that a very high proportion of Australia's leading athletes indicated that they had actually thought about using performance enhancing drugs. They had given it some thought because, like all athletes, like anybody in any business, if you are striving to be number one in what you want to do, clearly you make sacrifices. Whether you are talking about elite athletes or whether you get down to the kids running around in the park or the kids running around in my Collegians under-14 rugby league team, they are striving to the best of their ability. But they get to a point where they suddenly say, 'I really want to win this. Is there something more I can do? Is it just swimming the hundreds of laps each week up and down the pool? Is it the sessions in the gymnasium? Is it running hundreds of kilometres? Is it pedalling hundreds of kilometres?' They ask if there is something more they might be able to do to compete against some of those competitors in other countries where you get a bit of a feeling, or pick up in dressing rooms around the world at international meets, that maybe they have done something additional, that maybe there is some new substance they have been able to take which is not able to be detected at this stage. Their performance is enhanced and therefore they get that little extra edge. They are the things that do concern us. And the fact that this survey pointed out that a number of Australia's athletes were of the view that maybe they could at least think about doing it is a bit of a worry. But the fact is that we have ASDA doing a fabulous job. There is a commitment amongst Australian sporting organisations in this country to stamp this practice out and we have commitments at all levels of government to provide the facilities, the best possible training venues and assistance to travel overseas, which I know the honourable minister for sport supports through the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport. Provided we have all those sorts of things, we are giving our athletes the chance. I think they recognise that this is the case. But I do just sound that warning that we have to be ever vigilant, because they put in those hours and efforts and if they think there may be something else they could do that would give them that ultimate reward, that gold medal in an Olympics or another championship somewhere, I think we have to be careful. The fact that, in this country, so few people do says something about Australian athletes. I can only commend them all. I can only echo the sentiments that most honourable members would express-that Australian athletes do it for themselves and for Australia. AndI think that is quite appropriate. The opposition does not oppose in any way any aspect of this legislation. It is an amendment because it is necessary to take what the Australian Sports Drug Agency is doing a step further. It provides some certainty and it provides protection for athletes. What it also does, though, is to again give a clear indication, not only to Australia's athletes but to organisations right around the world, that we are deadly serious about the fight against drugs in sport. We will do what is necessary to ensure that our athletes are clean, that they are participating on their MC 2498 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 natural ability and that what they want to seek is that ultimate reward, that gold medal, in whatever event they happen to be participating in. In conclusion, I thank the minister for the way in which he has brought this bill before the parliament. I think it is important that it be given, as with the previous bill in relation to the Sydney 2000 Games, a speedy passage through here, through the House of Representatives and, indeed, through the Senate. It can then become law and the Australian Sports Drug Agency can continue to do the very fine work that it has done since its inception. extraordinary chain of events when we look at the listing of this morning's program in the Main Committee and see that a bill on the Sydney 2000 Games is followed by the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill. It really highlights some of the difficult questions that will need to be faced between now and the 2000 Olympics. No doubt, the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta will raise many questions about performance enhancing drugs and whether they might have been used during those Olympics. The fundamental question about drug use these days is: what is a drug? I think this is where it is becoming a very technical area. The Australian Sports Drug Agency, as the member for Cunningham ( Mr Martin) explained to the Main Committee, is a very professional body. It has reached a very high standard in terms of its identification of drugs and in terms of the technical procedures that it uses, which are recognised worldwide. I have had some brief contact with the agency and I want to compliment it on its very fine work. I would like the minister, who is here, to pass on my comments to the agency. I believe Australia is leading the world in this. The agency has the intention of trying to keep our sports clean not only now but also into the future so that, as the member for Cunningham also said, the competition is fair. If only we could achieve that in trade; what a remarkable achievement that would be! We talk about level playing fields. One of the things we want to ensure in sport is that competition is always fair so that it is a true measure of a person's ability, and of a team's ability to compete at international level, and to be successful. My first question was: what is a drug? My next question is: what is a performance enhancing drug? This can take many shapes and forms, depending on the sporting activity a person is involved in. I noted in a bit of background on this particular bill that the use of substances to enhance performance in sporting competition was reported as early as the third century BC, in the ancient Greek Olympics, with athletes using mushrooms or meat. A lot of our drugs are derived from botanical material. For the future it could mean that parents could create a diet of certain foods for their children which may lead to superb performances in later life, and hopefully that might happen. There is always the spectre looming over international competition that perhaps the substance has been recently introduced and has not been inherent in a person's diet, from early childhood right through his or her lifetime. I think there have been some passing references in sporting journalism in recent times about the physique of various athletes. The question has been posed as to whether athletes' physiques are natural, whether they have been developed from early childhood right through their sporting life, or whether they have been developed through something that has been introduced into their bodies in recent times to enhance their performances at a particular event or a series of events.",139,Representatives Main Commitiee
234,Mr Reid (Bendigo) (11.31 A.m),"I am delighted to speak on this bill. I think it is anThursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2499 It really does open up a Pandora's box in many respects, not only for organisations like the Australian Sports Drug Agency but also for sporting organisations. The difficulty is for the controlling bodies of sport, whether it be at Olympic or international competitions, to know precisely what impact and effect some of these materials have on an athlete's performance. I suppose you could cite a lot of the particular sports where individual events are created, like cycling, power lifting, rowing, swimming, triathlons, weight-lifting, athletics, et cetera, and you could probably identify substances that perhaps enhance individual performance and create a better performance at the top level. But then you look at some of the team sports like football, basketball, netball, water polo, volleyball and hockey: every sport requires a different level of skill and prowess and different characteristics in the person competing in that sport. I know that random testing has been done with a number of sports to try perhaps to identify a substance that might enhance performance, but not all of the substances in fact do enhance performance. As the honourable member for Cunningham explained to the Main Committee, some of them may in fact be detrimental. I look back at the case he mentioned of Samantha Riley. I have been involved in swimming all of my life, both as a competitor and water polo player and also as an official both at state and national level, and I look at the unfortunate situation of Samantha Riley where innocently she took a tablet from her coach to alleviate a headache, then was found to have taken a substance that clearly she did not know was in there. Whether it improved her performance or not would be highly debatable. I think this is the dilemma that is posed not only for the Australian Sports Drug Agency but also for international and world sport, whether it be at Olympic level or at any other level. That is the difficulty and that is why the Australian Sports Drug Agency is to be commended for its international recognition. I know that ASDA is becoming very involved in the lead-up to the 2000 Olympics and I wish it well in its preparations for that. As part of an agreement with the People's Republic of China, the Australian Sports Drug Agency is trying to assist China to develop its drug testing and sports drug agency as well. That is to be commended, because I am sure that China will be looking to the Atlanta Olympics and also to the Sydney Olympics as being a showcase for their athletes' skills and talents and I am sure that they would be wanting to comply with the requirements and to ensure that their athletes do have success at both of those Olympic Games. I am delighted to hear that the opposition does not oppose this bill. It is an important bill, leading up to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and also to the Sydney 2000 Olympics, and I wish it a speedy passage through the House. Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1996 and to echo the sentiments of previous speakers from both sides of the chamber. I think it is tremendous when we get bipartisan support for something that will keep Australia near the head of the world in keeping undesirable drugs out of sport. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act to facilitate more effective cooperation between the ASDA and international sporting organisations, to increase the effectiveness of Australia's anti-doping program and to set out clear procedures, rights and obligations to reduce challenges based on legal technicalities in relation to positive tests. I will return to that later. Particularly when we are to have the Sydney Games in the year 2000, we want to make sure that the games are the Olympic Games and not the 'Synthetic Games'. Drugs in sport go back",142,Representatives Main Committee
235,Mr Cobb (Parkes) (11.39 A.m.),"I too am pleased to contribute to the debate on theMC 2500 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 not only many years but also many centuries. In the third century BC, in the ancient Greek Olympics, athletes were using mushrooms and meat in strange ways to try and enhance their performance. Milo of Croton, one of the great athletes of the past, was supposed to have used special herbs and magic potions, eaten raw meat and done all sorts of strange things to enhance his performance. He died of an early massive heart attack, I heard, and perhaps that was some precursor to what has been happening in recent years here. Anti-doping initiatives in the world did not really kick off until about 1960 when we had the Council of Europe-21 western European countries which passed a resolution against the use of doping substances in sport. Later, around 1965, with the increased use of drugs in Olympic Games, the IOC started to take a particular interest in the issue and adopted a resolution. Things have moved on from there. Drug testing was instituted for the first time at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico. Drug testing programs commenced in Australia in the early 1980s. The Australian Sports Drug Agency was established in 1990 and we now have a testing laboratory in Sydney which is IOC accredited and which will be the one, as I understand it, that will be doing the testing at the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000, only four years away. The latest figures I have for 1994-95 show that in this country we have conducted 3,108 tests, 99 per cent of which were clear. There were 34 positive tests, which made up about one per cent of all the tests, and there was a high prevalence of those positive tests in the sports in which performance is enhanced by drugs-athletics, rowing, weight-lifting in particular, swimming, canoeing and the like. We hope that the number of positive drug test results can be reduced even further. In this country and around the world we need more out-of-competition testing, which is happening, so that we can build up baseline information about the levels of certain drugssome of which, such as testosterone, naturally occur in the body-and so that we can pick up the cheats out of competition. I have been disappointed to see the breakdown in anti-doping agreements between certain countries, such as the agreement between Australia and China whereby we were going to do a lot of such out-of-competition testing over there. It is interesting to look at the Chinese figures, which have attracted most comment in recent times. If you take the top 25 in any particular swimming event in the world, China had only six listings in 1991 but, in the following year, that figure had increased fourfold to 24 listings. In the year following that, 1993, the figure had increased fourfold again, to 96 listings. That in itself was suspicious enough, but what was overwhelmingly circumstantial, as far as the evidence goes, was that out of those listings 95 of the 96 were female. China had only one male swimmer in the top 25 in any swimming event in the world, but they had 95 top female listings. At the Perth world championships in 1991, China won six medals and, at the next world championships at Rome in 1994, they won 24 medals. All their medal winners were female. In fact, they could not even get one male swimmer into a final. At the Asian Games in October 1994, China won all 15 gold medals in the female events. They were pouring testosterone derivatives, particularly the anabolic steroids, into their females and turning them into halfmales, if you like, and cleaning up the pool-which made it very unfair for everybody else. What is sometimes overlooked in this is the undesirable side effects that flow from these drugs. We all hear about the liver damage and the diabetes problems later on. We do not hear so much about the potential infertility that may flow from the massive use of these drugs. In Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2501 that sense, we are really talking about breaches of human rights. I would like to involve groups such as Amnesty International and have them outlaw these drugs in their annual reports as breaches of human rights. To pour these drugs into innocent girls is an absolute scandal, I believe. On top of that, there are other side effects. For instance, at press conferences, we hear girls with deep, husky voices. We see physical side effects, such as excessive body hair, particularly facial hair; thickening and protrusion of the mandible, the lower jaw bone; and so on. I have dragged out a photo of Kristin Otto from the last Olympic Games she attended. The square jaw is quite prominent. She was probably a very attractive girl in her youth; hopefully she has reverted to being an attractive female. I think there is a case to tighten up the level of drug testing over and above the present 10C standards. At the moment, the testosterone to epitestosterone ratios are quite generous. Epitestosterone is the precursor of testosterone in the normal body; it goes around at about a one to one ratio. Occasionally you can have an abnormal level as high as three to one. The last 10C standards allowed levels as high as six to one. In other words, you take a low level of these drugs and get away with it. The Stasi files-the East German secret police files-have been released since the fall of the Berlin Wall and it is interesting to look at the history of the swimmers in those days. Every female in the East German team was on massive doses of these things. If you think six to one is high, some of them were coming in between nine to one and 12 to one. Kristin Otto, whose photo I held up, had a level of 17 to one. She probably had more testosterone in her than the Canberra Raiders and the Collingwood Australian Rules teams put together. That is a tragedy indeed. Not only was East Germany cheating in a similar manner to China in recent years but the damage they were doing to those girls' lives in later life with infertility and body changes is an absolute disgrace. The governments must have known this was going on and they should be condemned for it. It is a very serious situation, indeed, and it is getting more sophisticated and harder to pick up in many ways. Of concern are the flushing and masking agents that are used: the diuretics flush out and dilute the urine before tests are taken; the masking agents block the kidney from excreting testosterone. If athletes know a test is coming up in competition, they can take these flushing and masking drugs up to three days before and within 48 hours they can get their levels down under that six to one ratio. Quite frankly, I do not think that is good enough. I am a strong advocate of constant out-of-competition testing. I know this costs a fortune: many of these tests cost hundreds of dollars each. The high resolution spectrometer machine that has just been put in at Atlanta cost something like $860,000 and it is going to be about $800 or $900-1 presume that is in US dollars-per test. It is very expensive and it is totally regrettable that we have got to waste money in this way. But if it has to be done to eliminate this, it has to be done and that is all there is to it. I do not think anyone would disagree with that. It is interesting to look at the banned substances, as opposed to the restricted substances. There is a list of five categories. There are stimulants, such as amphetamines and caffeine. There are narcotics, such as heroin and pethidine. The dextropropoxyphene, Digesic, that Samantha Riley took is contained in headache tablets. There are the anabolic agents-the steroids, the testosterone that I have been talking about, and the beta-2 agonists. The diuretics are also banned. The peptides and glycoprotein hormones and the analogues of these are also prohibited. It is those that are causing particular concern. MC 2502 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 We need to do a lot of work on these human growth hormones and substances like IGF-1, which is a 70 amino acid insulin-type chemical that can enhance strength and power by up to five to 15 per cent. If you are on it in massive doses, it can cost $5,000 to $7,000 a day. I am alarmed to hear that athletes are taking it, even in lower doses, which may run into only a couple of hundred dollars a day or less, trying to enhance their strength and power. It causes swelling of the cells in the body, including brain cells. Because it mimics insulin, and blood sugar levels can drop, people can pass into diabetic comas in certain circumstances. It can enlarge the heart and can eventually kill you. The more work we do to detect these sorts of substances, the better. We have moved a long way over the last decade or two. Back in Rome in 1987, when Ben Johnson won the 100 metres, it was strongly rumoured that he turned up positive. Nobody did much about it. The next year at the Olympics, when he turned up positive again, he was banned. Nowadays, hopefully, the modem detecting machines-such as those, as I have mentioned, that they have installed at Atlanta-will be able to pick up these sorts of drugs, even if they have been used months before. Hopefully, those reports are accurate. But there are other drugs--drugs that naturally flow in the body, like the human growth hormoneswhere our work is also in the very early stages. In fact, the cheats in some cases are moving ahead of us. A great deal of work is yet to be carried out on those sorts of things. Lastly, in the time allowed to me, I want to mention that there are great difficulties on the chemistry and the biochemistry side in detecting these things, but we are also in the infancy stages of the legal aspects of what to do when these drugs are detected. It is a very complex area, and the legal precedents are still evolving. It is interesting to look at some of the history in this country. Martin Vinnicombe, that magnificent cyclist of a few years ago, turned up his first positive test to stanozolol. He had a two-year suspension by the Australian cycling authority. He subsequently admitted that he had taken that drug, a steroid derivative. To cut a long story short, he appealed, and it was eventually overturned. Even though the test performed by the Canadian Anti-Doping Authority-I presume that was at the University of Quebec--conformed with Canadian law and even though it conformed at the time with international protocols, it did not conform with the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act. On a technicality, that was overturned. So, even though he had returned a positive result, which was subsequently admitted, within the meaning of the Australian act it could not be accepted. It was a technicality. It is these sorts of things that have to be dealt with. Subsequent to that, there were Stephen Pate and Carey Hall. Following the 1991 world cycling championships, they also returned positives for anabolic steroids. Again, the Australian Professional Cycling Council, the APCC, put a two-year professional ban on those two athletes. They appealed that ban using the Tutty rugby league case of earlier years. I think it was about 1971 when that came up. They said that this was an unreasonable restraint of trade. They could have lost up to $200,000 a year in income because they could not attend the world championships: cyclists have to compete in Australia to qualify for the world championships. It was taken to court where it was argued that the international counterpart, the Union of Cyclists Internationale, the UCI, had imposed a lesser ban on them than the cycling body in Australia had. They argued that, because the UCI had imposed a lesser penalty, they should also have a lesser penalty imposed upon them out here. Because the APCC did not have a lot of money to fight this case, it was eventually forced into an out-ofcourt settlement. Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2503 There was also a very similar case to that in 1991 involving a fellow called Robertson. He also turned up positive to a steroid. Again, correctly, I believe, the Australian Professional Cycling Council put a two-year ban on him competing in Australia. After a long, drawn out battle of appeals, our cycling body here, strapped for cash, could not afford the lawyers and, again, had to cave in. That was most unfortunate. I know we have budgetary restraints but it is a terrible position when our sporting bodies, doing the right thing, are forced into this sort of situation where they cannot fight this in the courts. I hope the minister will be addressing that particular aspect. We cannot place too high a priority on getting drugs out of sport in Australia, and in getting consistent protocols, procedures and links between Australia and other countries around the world. We need to have standardised and uniform drug testing procedures and penalties in as many countries around the world as we can. We need to do that through the proper international forum, such as the IOC, so that we can cut out all this nonsense of technicalities and appeals. The sooner that is done, the better. The sooner athletes can compete against each other on an equal footing, and not on an unequal chemical footing, the better it will be-not only because of athletes but also because of human rights. I commend the work that the minister has done on this bill. I compliment the opposition for supporting this bill in the manner that it has. I hope Australia can continue to move forward as a world leader in this particular area. We can hold our heads up high. We can lead the way and say to the rest of the world, and to those that may be dragging the chain a littleChina, for instance-that this is something that we place a very high priority upon indeed. Parkes( Mr Cobb) for a significant contribution to the matters before this House. I am sure the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford) has heard me say before-this is no reflection on you, Mr Deputy Speaker-that I find it quite extraordinary that we are again stuck two storeys up in this place discussing matters of significant concern to the Australian community. As I have said, and I will keep on saying, this Main Committee is a dreadful mistake. This matter should be downstairs where the wider Australian community can hear this debate on an extremely important matter. there because it was his party and his government that got this Main Committee up and running. I was trying to keep it a bipartisan approach and not point the finger at anyone. However, having now been tempted by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide, I say again that the decision was wrong. It was supported by our side of the House but the sooner we get important debates such as this back in the main chamber, where they should be, the better. This legislation is very important to the sporting integrity of Australia in the lead-up to the Atlanta Games and, arguably more importantly for Australia, the Sydney Games. It is leadership legislation such as this which will define Australian sporting men and women as world leaders, not only fighting the fight against drugs in sport but also in standing up for honest and fair sporting competition. This bill will allow the Australian Sports Drug Agency to work more closely and cooperatively with the international sporting organisations to conduct drug tests both at major sporting events and at out-of-competition events on an annual basis.

238,Mr Ronaldson,"I am surprised the honourable member for Port Adelaide interjectedMC 2504 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 Australian Sports Drug Agency, as defined by this amendment bill, are clear. The amendment will allow the agency to more effectively and efficiently deter the use of drugs or doping methods in sport. This bill also acknowledges that it is important to encourage the development of programs to educate the sporting community about matters relating to drugs in sport. Education is vital if we are to eradicate this unfair practice on our spotting fields. This bill also allows ASDA to advocate the adoption of a consistent and effective national response to matters relating to drugs in sport. Policies aimed at eliminating drugs in sport will only be truly successful and effective if there is an international effort to eradicate this problem. This bill further enhances ASDA's objective of enabling it to coordinate the development of a consistent and effective national response to matters relating to drugs in sport. The bill goes further and strengthens the functions of the agency. One such function which is enhanced is the agency's ability to develop and implement drug testing programs. We need a nationally coordinated response to maintain our high standard of action against drugs in sport. If we cannot get our own house in order then we have no right to judge other countries. It is precisely because Australia is so tough on drugs in sport that we have an international leadership role in this area. This bill outlines the agency's function as advocating the international development and implementation of consistent and effective anti-doping programs, and encouraging Australian national, state and territory sporting organisations and professional sporting organisations to develop and implement comprehensive and consistent anti-doping initiatives. This measure includes initiatives relating to the testing for the use of drugs and to education about matters relating to drugs in sport, as well as allowing the use of the services of the agency in accredited laboratories. As a result of this bill, the agency will also develop and implement initiatives that increase the skills and knowledge of people involved in sporting activities about matters relating to drugs in sport. Along with allowing the agency to advocate and support research inside and outside Australia about drugs in sport, the bill will further allow the agency to implement anti-doping arrangements. The bill encourages the establishment of the means for the carrying out, by departments and authorities of the states and territories, of initiatives relating to drugs in sport and of the means for cooperation with those departments and authorities, as well as nongovernment sporting organisations, to implement such initiatives. It is also important to remember that this legislation was not framed in isolation. Given the importance of having a truly national and international approach to drugs in sport, to have attempted to make legislation in this area without consultation and cooperation would have been unproductive, to say the least. The widespread consultation involved in this bill's framing included input from the Australian Olympic Committee, CAS-the national sporting organisation, the Australia and New Zealand Sports Law Association, and the Privacy Commission. This legislation also reflects the privacy and human rights principles laid down in other Commonwealth legislation. In particular, only those people who need to have access to information will be informed. The government has been concerned to protect the rights of athletes, and has built into the legislation certain appeal rights to ensure that athletes are protected. Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2505 But being aware of the athletes' rights does not override the athletes' responsibility to compete fairly with their fellow athletes. This legislation will ensure that drug testing programs continue to deter athletes from using drugs, while at the same time ensuring that the rights of athletes who undergo testing will not be compromised. Furthermore, it is important to remember that this bill will reduce the likelihood of legal challenges which may result from an athlete returning a positive drug test. This bill should leave no doubt in the minds of all honourable members of the government's commitment, not only to the eradication of drugs in sport but also to the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Since its establishment, the agency has conducted more than 3,000 drug tests, and it is a testament to Australian athletes that 99 per cent of these tests were drug free. During my time as the shadow sports minister I had a lot to do with ASDA. In those days I had, and I still have, considerable respect for their expertise and professionalism. I am sure that view is shared by the minister. The agency also plays a highly commendable role in ensuring that our athletes can compete in fairer international competitions. During the past 12 months, the number of out-ofcompetition drug tests conducted by international sports has increased, I understand, by almost 50 per cent. The agency has carried out the drug testing programs for the World Swimming Championships, the South-East Asian Games, the World Weight-lifting Championships and a host of other major international sporting events. The government has also entered into anti-doping agreements with other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, New Zealand and Norway, as an acknowledgment of the importance of having a unified international approach to drug testing. Such multilateral agreements will lead to the establishment of an international benchmark for testing programs, utilising an internationally recognised system of accreditation and certification. It is therefore appropriate that Australia was the first non-European country to accede to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, which aims to harmonise anti-doping programs between countries. What the Australian Sports Drug Agency is essentially about, at both national and international levels, is ensuring that all athletes are given a fair go when competing. It is regrettable that there are some countries which still have athletes using performance enhancing drugs. One such country which has come under international scrutiny is China. This scrutiny is totally justified. For example, after the Hiroshima Asian Games, 31 Chinese athletes tested positive to banned drugs. To be fair, not only did the Chinese government respond to this by increasing the frequency of out-of-competition tests, but last August China passed a law making it a criminal offence to supply banned drugs to athletes, with a penalty of a four-year ban for athletes found guilty of taking these drugs. These new restrictions imposed by the Chinese government have started to have an effect. By the end of last year, Chinese officials had conducted nearly 2,100 tests, which is a 50 per cent increase on 1994. During that period, only 17 athletes tested positive, compared with 31 in 1994 and 23 in 1993. I believe it is appropriate that, if China is genuine in its commitment to ensure that its athletes are truly drug free in competition, China should call on ASDA to help achieve this aim. This is one of the reasons why a joint drug testing program was announced last December between Australia and China under which each country could conduct random tests on the other's athletes. This is a truly historic decision, meaning that for the first time Chinese athletes would be randomly tested outside of competition. MC 2506 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 I am sure that such moves to crack down on sports cheats-and athletes who take enhancing drugs are cheats-are welcomed by the Australian public. It was therefore with some concern that I read recent media reports which stated that the testing of Chinese athletes which I referred to earlier has not happened. As far as I am aware, ASDA is yet to conduct tests on Chinese athletes. I am not too sure whether these notes are out of date or whether the tests have indeed started. I hope they have. It is encouraging to hear that the agency is on the verge of going to China, although this may well be too late for the Atlanta Olympics. It must be remembered that almost every country, including China, has already chosen its team to compete in Atlanta. I would hate to think that an athlete who competed fairly could miss out on going to the Olympics-an honour that every professional athlete strives for-only to be replaced by an athlete who, it is later found, is taking performance enhancing drugs. Although welcoming ASDA's move into China, I fear that this will be too late for the Atlanta Olympics, as I said before. I note with interest that the head coach of the Australian swimming team, Don Talbot, has also recently expressed a personal view that he suspects drugs will be present at Atlanta, particularly in the Chinese women's team. I think it is a great tragedy not only for the competition but also for those who are competing. It is fair to say, however, that the great majority of athletes who are going to Atlanta have got there on their own merits, on their own abilities and, as such, should be congratulated. It is unfortunate, however, that there will be a minority amongst them who are too gutless to compete on equal terms, and instead have turned to drugs to help them along. It is unfortunate that such people will be unfairly performing against decent and honourable athletes. Hopefully, through the continued efforts of organisations such as ASDA, such athletes will be detected and dealt with accordingly. It is time for a little bit of parochialism, and I am sure that honourable members will allow me to indulge in it briefly. Athletes whose honest efforts, I hope, are not jeopardised in the representation of our country by those who are cheating include a number from my electorate. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are no drug takers amongst my constituent athletes. With your leave, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is with pride that I tell the House about the number of athletes who have come from Ballarat, a small region with extraordinary representation. Murray Hocking and Peter Blackburn are in badminton. Steve Moneghetti, the Ballarat Bullet, is, as I am sure you are aware, a Ballarat boy. Shaun Crichton is in athletics. Alison Cook, Robyn Maher and Ray Bomer are in basketball. Russell Mark is in trapshooting. Anthony Edwards and a recent addition to the Olympic team, Bronwyn Thompson, are in rowing, and Shane Kelly is in cycling. Although Shane comes from Ararat, I am sure I speak on behalf of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Hawker) when I congratulate Shane Kelly and include him in the broader Ballarat region. Lots of terrific stories come out of membership of the Australian team. The Ballarat Courier reported recently that Bronwyn Thompson, who had just got into the Olympic team, rang her mother and said, 'Mum, it's not my phone and I can't talk long. We have made it, Mum. Start packing your bags.' Speaking as a parent with young children, any thought of any of them competing in the Olympics is a long way off, but it must really be an extraordinary thing for parents of Olympic athletes to receive such phone calls about their sons or daughters being chosen to represent their country. I am sure it is matched only by the extraordinary pride of those young--or youngish-people themselves. Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2507 Competing at Atlanta will be a thrill, but I am sure that an even bigger thrill for Australian athletes will be to compete at the Sydney Olympics. At least at those games, Australia as a nation-and, more importantly, as a sporting nation-will be on exhibition for the world to see. We owe it to all athletes to ensure that they are the pinnacle of the drug free games. I have no doubt that our hard line on drugs in sport was one of the reasons we were given the honour of hosting the games. These Olympics will also give us an opportunity to show off the effectiveness of our domestic anti-doping programs and, in doing so, to advocate to the international sports community the need for similar efforts worldwide. I am proud to be part of a government which supports a comprehensive package of measures aimed at ensuring that the games are truly drug free, and I am sure that is a sentiment felt by all members of both sides of the House, and it is something we can take great pride in. Some of the measures that the government has implemented and will implement include a drug testing program that targets international athletes competing in tr;rining in Australia; the advocating of out-of-competition testing programs by international sports federations which target their top athletes on an annual basis; drug testing via programs by SOCOG at the 2000 Olympics and the test events leading up to the 2000 Games; maintenance of an internationally accredited drug testing laboratory in Australia; continuing research to ensure new doping practices can be detected; education programs throughout schools and sporting communities; anti-doping agreements between Australia and other governments; and measures to reduce the prescribing and illicit supply of performance enhancing drugs. It is encouraging to see that key organisations from the sport, health, education, law enforcement, government and non-government sectors will be taking up these measures. Agencies such as ASDA will only be truly successful if they have the cooperation of the athletes. Looking at the results of surveys, it is encouraging to see that our elite athletes believe that ASDA's drug testing program is likely to deter elite athletes from using prohibited drugs in sport. Our elite athletes also believe there is a high degree of accord with all aspects of the ASDA testing program, including the existence of ASDA testing and the conduct of ASDA personnel. It is interesting to note that 73 per cent of athletes from one of these surveys rated ASDA as being successful in balancing an individual's right to privacy with the need to maximise the deterrent effect of the drug testing program. The survey also found that the way ASDA works in the sporting community has received wide endorsement, with a majority of elite athletes believing ASDA consults successfully with the sport. The wide range of sources of information on drugs in sport used by elite athletes reflects a generally better informed and aware sporting environment. It should also be noted that 86 per cent of elite athletes believe that a national organisation independent of sport, such as ASDA, should be responsible for drug testing. The overall conclusion from the survey is that Australia's approach to the drugs in sport issue has been successful. It is legislation such as that before the House today which will ensure that this success continues. As we gear up for the Atlanta Olympics and especially the Sydney Olympics, it is legislation like this which provides an excellent blueprint for ensuring that Australian athletes can compete fairly against each other and their international competitors without threat of being unfairly challenged by those athletes who cheat on themselves and their country. I believe we can all be extremely proud of this nation's sporting history and I think we can be extremely proud of the fact that under ASDA we have taken the lead in the world in relation to drug free sport. MC 2508 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 There surely could be nothing more abhorrent to an athlete who has trained for three or four years, whatever it might be, in preparation for the Olympics or other major international sporting competitions to know that there is someone in the field who has enhanced their performance by the use of drugs. I think that, both as a nation and as an international community, we need to ensure that those who are competing at this level, at the highest level, are doing so on equal terms-not necessarily in terms of ability but in relation to the non-use of performance enhancing drugs. Finally, may I say, on behalf of all members, I am sure, that we wish our team at Atlanta the greatest of success. We are extremely proud of the fact that they have even reached the level where they can compete and I am sure we have all got our fingers crossed that they come back with a bag full of medals. But I do not think it is the medals necessarily that determine the outcome; it is the fact that a nation of Australia's size can compete at such an extraordinary level with nations whose populations are far larger and who it is fair to say, I suspect, put considerably more resources into sport than we as a nation do, and have done over a number of years. As I said before, we can be extremely proud of our team. Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (12.18 p.m.)-in replyThis debate has raged over two sessions of the Main Committee. As outlined in my second reading speech, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1996 is designed to ensure that the Australian Sports Drug Agency can continue to undertake its responsibilities effectively and provide a leadership role in the international fight against the use of prohibited drugs in sport up to and beyond the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Both as Minister for Sport and also as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the 2000 Games, I have a keen interest in the work of the agency. I would like to thank the participants in the debate, Mr Martin, the shadow minister, Mr Reid, Mr Cobb and Mr Ronaldson, for their contributions. All agreed that the work that has been done by ASDA has been exemplary in every regard. This bill, which clarifies a number of matters, enjoys the very strong support of the opposition and obviously the government. Indeed, the opposition, to its credit, started the work on the preparation of this bill prior to the election. It is absolutely essential that we position Australia in a very positive light in the world community, given that we are going to be hosting the 2000 Olympic Games. Mr Martin was concerned about the rights of athletes being protected. As one of the other speakers pointed out, there were extensive discussions with the Privacy Commissioner in the preparation of this legislation. Mr Reid was concerned to ensure that our assistance to China was able to be progressed, and indeed it is. He was particularly complimentary to ASDA. overview of drugs in sport and prohibited substances. He made a point, at the conclusion of his remarks, about appeals problems, ensuring that appeals can be heard expeditiously and so on. For the Atlanta Olympic Games there will be a court of arbitration. It will be able to hear matters within 24 hours and get results quickly to alleviate any problems that might emerge where there has been a positive response to drug testing or drug screening. Mr Ronaldson, the final speaker, gave a summary of the bill. He is a former shadow minister for sport. He worked extensively in that area prior to his illness. Now he is obviously fully recovered; he gave a fairly robust account of himself in here. He also indicated that extensive consultation had taken place between the Australian Olympic Committee, the Confederation",147,Representatives Main Committee

He indicated his interest in the China issue and the difficulties that have been experienced in the past-we hope that they will be diminishing in the future-involving Chinese athletes and prohibited substances. I am hoping that the minister for sport from China will be participating in a visit program here in due course; we will be liaising closely with them. ASDA is already involved in discussions with the Chinese sporting federations on developing a drug testing regime for China. They have not started doing formal tests as yet, but that cannot be far away. In common with every other member of the House-and, I dare say, every senatorMr Ronaldson will be taking great pride in the Olympic athletes as they emerge in their particular areas. But he, like all of us, concluded with the view that it is best to be congratulating everyone on having got into the team. We will have our largest Olympic team ever going to Atlanta. He, like all of us, wants that team to do particularly well. Earlier in the week, I found out some information which was a little disturbing. I will take this opportunity, as it is the first I have had, to raise it. It was about an incident that took place on 17 February this year, involving a drug test that was undertaken here in Australia and had some repercussions that were very unfortunate for a particular individual. There was a Russian hammer thrower-Olga Kasinkova-who was able to record a world record under the rules of the International Amateur Athletics Federation. When one sets and reports a world record, one is required to have a full screening test and drug analysis before that world record can be accepted. Under the arrangements that we have in this country for doing the tests, there is a memorandum of understanding between my agency, ASDA, and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, who operate the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory, which is accredited by the International Olympic Committee. What happened on this occasion was that the drug test was taken in and a half-screen test, rather than a full test, was done. By the time it was realised that the technical error had been made, the sample had been discarded. So we were unable to provide a full clearance under the rules of the International Amateur Athletics Federation, even though there was no positive testing at all, and this athlete's world record is not able to be recognised. Contact will be made with the Russian Athletic Federation and the athlete, apologising for the technical error. It gives an example of how careful we must be with our procedures. I will be having discussions with the minister responsible for AGAL, Mr Jull. This week we have instituted some administrative changes to ensure that this occurrence-which, I am advised, has never happened before-shall never happen again. We are making some changes which will involve the laboratory's entering into crosschecking of analytical reports with ASDA laboratory advice forms before despatching reports to ASDA and, subsequently, to the relevant international federations. Secondly, ASDA will do crosschecking of each laboratory report with the request made for specific samples, when in receipt of that report. Thirdly, the laboratory will retain the specific samples, in a frozen form, for an indefinite period-until directed to discard them by ASDA. That would overcome problems such as the one which occurred on this occasion and which, I might say, was very regrettable to the athlete concerned. There will be a redesigning of the advice form, to better highlight the selected options, and there will be automation of the system through bar coding, to eliminate human error. MC 2510 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 That is all that I am able to do to correct that particular incident, but I do want to make the point in this debate, given that there is very strong bipartisan support for what we are doing here, that, even with the best of motives and the best of intentions, sometimes there can be errors. When we find those errors in this very important area we will move very swiftly to correct them. We do feel very much for the particular athlete involved that that world record will not be recorded in the normal way and we will make sure it does not happen again. It will not, in any way, affect Australia's capacity to, as we have done, lead the world in drug testing for the world junior athletics championships to be held here in August or ultimately to be involved heavily in the detailed drug analysis work that will need to take place during the Sydney 2000 Games. Thank you for the indulgence to let me cover that matter. I commend the bill to the Committee and hope that it will be passed back to the House of Representatives without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. Consideration resumed from 17 June. Second Reading move: That the bill be now read a second time. On 19 April 1995, the High Court handed down its decision in the matter of Ridgeway v. The Queen. By a majority of 6 to 1, the court decided that where law enforcement officials use a controlled operation during an investigation into narcotics trafficking and, as a result, commit an element of an offence with which a defendant is charged, a court should normally refuse to admit the evidence of that element against the defendant. Some members of the court-Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, at page 58 of the report in 129 ALR-indicated that if law enforcement officers are to engage in unlawful conduct in the course of investigations, a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need to be established. The bill that is now before the House responds to that judgment. Honourable members will recall that a bill to achieve the same purpose was introduced by the previous government; that bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued. The bill now before the House is based upon that previous bill but includes a number of significant improvements, as follows: the bill has been amended to ensure that controlled operations are used only for the purpose of investigating major unlawful activity. The important, but sensitive, power to conduct such covert operations will not be used for the investigation of minor criminal conspiracies; the accountability mechanisms will be significantly strengthened by incorporating the recommendations made last year by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its report on the 1995 bill; and",152,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General and Minister for Justice) (12.27 p.m.)-IThursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2511 a gap in the bill will be closed by protecting officers who are engaged in properly authorised controlled operations from the possibility of committing offences involving the importation, exportation or possession of narcotics contrary to the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990. This was a possibility that was overlooked in the bill that was introduced into the parliament last year by the previous government. The bill now before the House also incorporates an amendment which was made when the bill was before the Senate. That amendment inserted a proposed section 15U into the bill. Proposed section 15U will require that a certified copy of the certificate authorising the conduct of a controlled operation shall be tendered in evidence in a prosecution for an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act-or an associated offence, such as conspiracy to import narcotics in contravention of that section-that depends upon evidence gathered by way of a controlled operation. This process will place the defence, and the court, on notice that such evidence will be led, and will enable the defence to prepare should it wish to test the process for authorising the controlled operation, and to contest the admissibility of that evidence. It will occur, albeit only occasionally, that a certificate will contain sensitive informationfor example, the name of a confidential informant--{)r information about a related but incomplete investigation. The contents of a certificate are specified in proposed section 15N. It was a deliberate decision by the government-and by the previous government in its bill last year-to require that the certificate contain a comprehensive statement of the relevant information. This is another aspect of the detailed accountability package which will surround the authorisation of a controlled operation. In those cases where a certificate does contain sensitive information which it would be unwise to disclose, it will be possible for the prosecution to seek to have that particular detail suppressed by making a claim of public interest immunity. This will ensure that, for example, other investigations are not compromised, or the safety of an informant is not endangered through sensitive information being disclosed. I should also make one other comment about the extensive debate in the Senate. This relates to the lengthy consideration of the issue of possible judicial authorisation for a controlled operation. This debate was prompted by an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats that would have required authorisation for a controlled operation by an 'eligible judge', being a judge of a federal court. This issue was considered exhaustively during the debate, with the result that the amendment was ultimately withdrawn by the Australian Democrats. Honourable members may be aware that when the House was considering the previous version of this bill in 1995, I suggested that consideration should be given to requiring judicial authorisation for a controlled operation. The then minister, the honourable member for Denison( Mr Kerr), opposed this proposal, speaking at length about the difficulties that this would involve. My remarks were made prior to the decision by the High Court in Grollov Commissioner for the AFP delivered on 21 September 1995. Obiter remarks made in that judgment indicate that the conferral of certain non-judicial functions upon judicial officers may well be unconstitutional, as being incompatible with the essential separation of powers which underpins our constitution. During the debate in the Senate, the government made available an advice by the Chief General Counsel of my department which indicates the dangers which may attend the conferral MC 2512 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 of such functions, particularly those that are related to the investigative process, upon judges. A further practical consideration is the recent reluctance by a growing number of Federal Court judges to issue warrants under powers given to them by the telecommunications interception legislation. I interpolate to say that I understand that 17 of the 44 Federal Court judges are respondents to proceedings in their own court. It has now become apparent that it is impractical, and may be constitutionally invalid, to empower a Federal Court judge to issue a certificate for a controlled operation. In the government's view, the bill now before the House represents the best and most practical way of responding to the High Court's decision in Ridgeway. I interpolate again to say that a case was argued in the High Court on Friday of last week which may provide an answer to the question as to the constitutional validity of the conferring of executive functions upon judicial officers. Apart from the changes to the bill introduced last year, which I have discussed, the general purpose and thrust of the bill now before the House remain the same. The bill will ensure that there is a legislative base for controlled operations by law enforcement agencies and that the officers participating in such operations are protected from criminal responsibility for conduct undertaken in the course of their duty. The bill will also provide an avenue for the admission of evidence obtained from controlled operations prior to its commencement, provided the operation was conducted in conformity with established procedures. Most importantly, the bill will provide a framework of accountability and control which will ensure that I, as the responsible minister, the parliament and the community have the opportunity to scrutinise the usage of this power by law enforcement agencies. Many people, both in the chamber and in the community, might ask: why should we sanction the police participating in criminal activity? I stress that parliament has already conferred upon law enforcement agencies the power to do certain things which, if done in the absence of that legislative authority, would be a criminal offence. The entry onto private property without the consent of the occupier is an offence of trespass; however, police may seek a warrant which will authorise such entry upon property. The detention of a person may amount to false imprisonment unless the detention is pursuant to a lawful arrest or other similar power. The bill presently before the House is in a similar vein to this type of legislation, which is in the best traditions of our system of law. Drug crime is peculiarly difficult to combat. Rarely are there complainants about this conduct. The importation of large quantities of drugs is a clandestine criminal activity involving complicity, or participants who will remain silent for fear of retribution. Organised crime does not tolerate complaint. As a result, the struggle against this trade involves very difficult choices for us as legislators and for the community. We are all committed to the preservation of fundamental values such as equality, privacy, freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and so on. Equally, however, there is the right of the individual to protection by the state. There is a powerful public interest in opposing the spread of illegal drug trafficking, and the official corruption that it can spawn. Good law enforcement is a citizen's entitlement. It must be borne in mind that loss of confidence in law enforcement will lead governments to measures destructive of civil liberties. This is not such a bill. The choice before us is between a society prepared to accept balanced Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2513 legislation to counter criminals, and a society poisoned by the conditions created by those criminals and their activities. The bill lays down a full and open system of accountability. The bill requires that the responsible minister, that is myself, is kept informed of all applications for a certificate conferring authority to conduct a controlled operation. I am also to be informed of the outcome of a controlled operation at the conclusion of the operation. In tum, I am required to table a report in parliament providing details of the applications made under the provisions of the bill and the outcome of the operations authorised under this legislation. The procedure will not lead to 'entrapment' of people. The bill will expressly provide that entrapment is not permissible. A controlled operation may be conducted only in circumstances where the targets of the operation are likely to import---or export-narcotics whether or not the operation takes place. The bill will ensure that it will not be permissible for officers to procure the commission of offences which otherwise would not have taken place. The consequence of a certificate being found to be invalid because the decision to issue was not properly made will be that evidence might be held to be inadmissible. That will be a matter for the court. However, it is not intended that the effect of this will be that a police officer who acted in good faith in reliance on the certificate would then be prosecuted. The situation would be different if a police officer dishonestly procured the issue of a certificate. The law as regards accepting or rejecting evidence obtained by improper methods will be maintained. However, controlled operations may lead to the detection of criminals whose activities might otherwise never be discovered, let alone prosecuted. I should emphasise that controlled operations are an internationally accepted investigatory technique. On 14 February 1993, the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances came into force in Australia. That convention was implemented by legislation that commenced operation that same day. Article 11(1) of the convention provides as follows: Article ll--Controlled delivery 1. If permitted by the basic principles of their respective domestic legal systems, the parties shall take the necessary measures, within their possibilities, to allow for the appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences established in accordance with article 3, paragraph I, and to taking legal action against them. This article indicates the recognition by the international community of the need to employ specialised investigative techniques, like the controlled operation, to deal with organised and sophisticated traffickers. In Australia the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct--commonly known as the Fitzgerald report-also discussed the use of new techniques in combating organised crime. Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that an effective response to organised crime is dependent upon recognition of four factors: the social changes which crime causes and the fact that it diminishes the quality of life; the fact that crime escalates if it is not controlled; recognition that there are vulnerabilities in the social order which expose it to exploitation; and the steps that are needed to control crime. MC 2514 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 In relation to the latter point, Commissioner Fitzgerald stated that consideration should be given to a wide range of measures which would equip law enforcement agencies with new powers, including permitting 'the infiltration of criminal groups'. Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that orthodox policing is quite unable to enforce the law. This bill will ensure that Commonwealth law enforcement agencies have available to them the controlled operation as a tool in the investigation of the trade in narcotics. I tum now to discuss briefly the key features of the bill. The central issue in the Ridgeway decision was the admissibility of evidence. The High Court held that because of the involvement of law enforcement agents in the importation of heroin, the evidence obtained thereby was fatally tainted and should be excluded from the trial of the principal conspirator. Honourable members may notice that the bill before them says nothing about the admissibility of evidence. How then, it might be asked, does the bill respond to the decision of the High Court? The basis for the decision by the majority of the High Court was that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on certain public policy grounds. The public policy ground in question, which then triggers the discretion to exclude evidence, arises where illegal police conduct is an essential ingredient of the charged offence. In such a case there will be 'an extremely formidable case for exclusion' of the evidence by the trial judge. The High Court accepted that the legislature could sanction the use of controlled operations and that such a legislative regime could exempt the officers from the requirements of the criminal law. The court went on to say that: ... in the absence of such a legislative regime, the courts have no choice but to set their face firmly against grave criminality on the part of anyone, regardless of whether he or she be government officer or ordinary citizen. The enactment of the bill now before the House will ensure that the actions of law enforcement officials engaged in a controlled operation will not incur criminal responsibility and, as a result, there will not be a trigger for the exclusion of evidence. It should be noted that the bill, whilst protecting the law enforcement officers from criminal responsibility, will still preserve the essential criminality or unlawfulness of the importationor exportation---of the prohibited narcotics. This will ensure that the importation or exportation itself is not made lawful, thereby exonerating the targets of the operation who planned the conspiracy. It is important to describe the effect of the bill upon prosecutions that are current at the time the bill commences operation. There are a number of investigations that are affected by the decision in Ridgeway. They all involve very significant participation in trafficking in narcotics, for example: conspiracy to import seven kilograms of cocaine---one individual; being knowingly concerned in the importation of 3.8 kilograms of cocaine-two individuals; being knowingly concerned in the importation of, and possession of, two kilograms of heroin-two individuals. I am advised by the Australian Federal Police that controlled operations were employed in each of these matters. These operations were strictly regulated and rigorously controlled covert operations. In each case they were conducted in purported accordance with the terms of a ministerial agreement relating to such operations and the detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines on the conduct of controlled operations. Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2515 The ministerial agreement was entered into on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State-having responsibility for the Australian Federal Police-Senator the Hon. Michael Tate, and the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce-having responsibility for the Australian Customs Service-Senator the Hon. John Button. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service: ... where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an involvement in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authorityto be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny and control and in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods. Once that agreement was obtained, the operation was conducted in accordance with detailed requirements of the Australian Federal Police guidelines. These guidelines run to 50 paragraphs and closely regulate the considerations that should be adverted to when deciding whether a controlled operation should be conducted; the level at which operations must be approved; the procedures for a controlled delivery involving the substitution of the narcotic substance; further procedures for those operations where substitution is not feasible or possible; the requirements for analysis of the narcotic substance; and the making of payments to couriers and informants. These operations were conducted pursuant to these guidelines. The operations were closely monitored. Each of the accused alleged to have been detected as a result of these controlled operations is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. But without the passage of this legislation those trials will have to be abandoned. I believe the community would not see that to be a just outcome. In conclusion, I believe that the community expects that law enforcement agencies will make every effort to catch the ' Mr Bigs' of organised crime, not just apprehend couriers and the dealers on our street comers. Indeed, the community has a right to expect, to demand, that law enforcement agencies will act to protect them and their children, who are particularly vulnerable. This bill will satisfy that demand by providing a firm legislative basis for the use of controlled operations as a device in combating drug trafficking. Other aspects of the legislation are described in the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill. I commend the bill and present the explanatory memorandum to the House. shadow Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, Senator Nick Bolkus, had this to say in relation to the Australian Labor Party's position on this bill: The objective of this legislation is one that we are very deeply committed to. Further on he said: The principle, the objectives and much of the structure of this bill we want to see in place. The only question is which is the best way to go and what accountability mechanisms are appropriate and can be appropriately invoked for this. It is fair to say that that has characterised the debate by all parties since this bill was first introduced when we were in government. Indeed, it was a bill that was strongly sponsored by the then Minister for Justice, the honourable Mr Duncan Kerr, the current member for Denison, and he will be speaking in the debate later and lending his full endorsement to the bill.",154,Representatives Main Committee
242,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.46 P.m.),"In the Senate on Wednesday 29 May 1996, theMC 2516 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 From the initial introduction of the bill in the last parliament until now there have been a number of amendments. From my point of view-and it is acknowledged across the spectrum-those amendments are an improvement to what was originally put to the parliament and I applaud the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice( Mr Williams) for those amendments. There are some of us on both sides of the House that still have some reservation about aspects of this bill. That needs to be looked at in context. I think the Attorney-General was right when he said that there are different principles involved here. As law makers we reaIIy need in some instances to compromise; you cannot be pure one way or pure the other. There are practical difficulties and we need to acknowledge them. This bill certainly has had a lot of scrutiny. It will not satisfy some sections of the community; there will still be reservations about certain aspects. In that respect I would obviously counsel the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice to continue to monitor the operations of this bill because I fear, and I hope it does not come to pass, events will necessitate our revisiting this. WhatI am now presenting are personal reservations. I want to put them on the record, acknowledging that I will be supporting this bill, as will the opposition wholeheartedly. The time has come to pass it; I do not think that we are going to be able to satisfy everyone's concerns. Indeed, at one stage the Democrats in the Senate put in some amendments that related to the concept of external accountability and the Labor Party was prepared to support those amendments. When they were withdrawn we understood why they were withdrawn. It is a debate between people who are trying to achieve the same purpose. My reservations are encapsulated by some of the civil liberties groups. It goes back to the agreement provided on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State, Senator Michael Tate, and the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator John Button. The minister in his second reading speech cited that section of the agreement. I think it is worth revisiting. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service: . . . where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an involvement in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to be exempted from detailed Customs scrutiny and controland here is the crunch partand in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods. So the original agreement reaIIy related to where goods were substituted, not the actual importation of illegal substances.What has happened as a result of the Ridgeway decision, I think it is fair to say, is that the authorities are receiving a bonus out of this legislation. That is where my concern is. I think there is a point where it is inappropriate for the authorities to be not monitoring and reacting, which is what I prefer. I do prefer a monitor, react and substitution situation, rather than allowing people within the authorities to engage in the importation as part of a controlled operation. It is just something I would caution, because the last thing I would like to see is authorities engaging in a controlled operation and not having substitution there, and those goods going astray. That is where the problem will arise: that if there is a controIIed operation in the future and it involves a large amount-and I am not talking about entrapment here-the authorities leave themselves open. But I recognise that it is not a perfect world. Thursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2517 The other reservation was police authorising police. That is where some people in the community took the view that we should adopt what is in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to allow judicial authorisation. I acknowledge what the Attorney has said, that members of the judiciary are not all that happy with that and that there is a case before the High Court to do with the Hindmarsh Island situation and involving Her Honour Justice Jane Matthews. SoI think that will see a further evolution as to whether the obiter that is in Grollo's case is, in fact, going to be the pronouncement by the High Court or not. So it is an evolving situation. In the end, no side is going to achieve totally what they want. There is a balance in this bill. I think the authorities can legitimately say, 'If the politicians want us to successfully stop the big importers, then we need these sorts of powers. We need legislative endorsement.' Basically, that is what the High Court said: if they are to engage in them, they need legislative endorsement. The Labor Party is lending its support. This is really something that is not party political, it is not crossing political boundaries. It is people genuinely having different views. My background is one of a defender; I have never prosecuted in my life. I must say that I have a particular view, and it is based on personal experiences. Others, like my colleague the honourable member for Denison( Mr Kerr), have engaged in prosecutions; they have appeared on both sides of the fence. It is fair to say that he is probably more objective and balanced than myself when it comes to the criminal code. It is fair to say that I tend to err on the side of the accused in terms of keeping those mechanisms in place. I subscribe to the view that it is better that 99 guilty go free, than that one innocent person is convicted. What frightens me is that, in the climate we have at the moment where you do have commentators who are uninformed, we get some bad cases and what happens is that bad cases make bad law and we go to the lowest common denominator. I am not saying that about this legislation. The time has come for it to pass through the parliament. But I have put these reservations on the basis that what I would like to see-and I am sure it will happen anyway-is a monitoring of the situation. If the situation is out of control, it needs to be looked at. If it is a situation where the police forces themselves are vulnerable when these matters come into court because it is authorisation of police on police and so acquittals are occurring because of suspicions-and it is not hard to put that into the arena-then we might need to look at some other form of external authorisation. That is something that will only evolve with time. I am glad the Attorney-General has included in the legislation the amendment that ensures controlled operations are used only for the purpose of investigating major unlawful activity. I know the honourable member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith) will have something to say on this in the debate. I suppose it is really in the eyes of the beholder. My view of major unlawful activity is a little different from that of other people's. I would like this legislation to be used to catch those people who are higher up the chain rather than to pick up someone down the chain. In my view, if it is not substitution and not just a monitoring and reacting situation, this situationwhich allows the authorities to engage in what would otherwise be illegal activities-should be used sparingly. It should be reserved for those in the community whom we believe are engaging in criminal behaviour and not for those at the lower end of the scale. This is something that only time will tell; I am not here to be a prophet of doom. MC 2518 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 I did not speak on this in the last parliament. Because of some aspects of the bill at that time, I took the view that silence was golden. In my position, I felt this was the best thing I could do. I appreciate the fact that the Attorney-General played a role in the previous debate in the last parliament. I understand his role and I have every confidence in the role that he will playas Attorney-General as far as this legislation is concerned. To digress, I welcomed the appointment of Mr Williams as the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. I do not think the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, could have made a better appointment for this particular office. I think his performance has been impeccable. I have one reservation, which I would like to put on the record, and it comes from someone with a legal background. I think the minister should be in cabinet. I come from that old school that says that the role of the Attorney-General is not that of a normal minister. The Attorney-General should be in cabinet; he should be giving proper legal advice to the cabinet. At times, this means that the Attorney-General is unpopular. He is not meant to be a populist; he is there to provide proper advice. He is there to restrain the rednecks in parliament and in the community; he is not there to adopt the populist view. As far as the constitution of the cabinet is concerned, the quicker the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice gets into the cabinet, the better. I will leave it at that. principle that silence is golden. I commend that to him during question time. I have defended on all but one occasion in 13 years of legal practice. I can assure you that I did not enjoy the one occasion on which I prosecuted. This bill comes-and I do not say this disrespectfully-from the prosecutorial side of things, so it is important to get the balance and the experience from the other side of the bar table. My particular experience involved a case that left an indelible mark on me and this has necessarily excited my interest in this particular bill. I seek leave to table the case. I do not want to mention it by name. I will refer to it as 'M', if I may, Mr Deputy Speaker. Leave granted. then relate it to the bill before the House. In that particular case, there was a major drug operation in Queensland. As a result of that major operation, to my knowledge only one person was netted, and that was M. The operation extended over many months. It cost the community hundreds of thousands of dollars and the result that was produced was less than satisfactory. Of the person M for whom I appeared, I can only say this. Having spent numerous hours with the person when I was in conference with her and so forth, I thought I had heard it all before until she came to give her evidence on the voir dire. Hearing her evidence in chief on the voir dire was enough to move me to tears, because it was an unbelievable story. The case extract does not fully illustrate it, but it illustrates it to a large extent. I am concerned that this is the sort of case that might be caught by the bill. In that particular case, the undercover police officer received an indemnity from the Attorney-General. The indemnity said this: that no prosecution or indictment will be brought or continued against RR being the undercover police officer-",159,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Deputy Speaker,I observe that the honourable member for Banks adheres to the,162,Representatives Main Committee
244,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (12.59 P.m.),"Like the member for Banks( Mr Melham),",162,Representatives Main Committee
245,Mr Tony Smith,"I would like to refer as quickly as I can to elements of that case andThursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2519 in respect of any act or omission reasonably and necessarily done or made by him in the execution of his duty as a police officer and in the course of the police operation codenamedI will leave that outand I do hereby indemnify him accordingly. By way of background, the accused gave evidence on the voir dire. The voir dire is a trial within a trial. It is where the judge has to determine admissibility. This is important in the context of the bill. The defendant, or the accused, had to satisfy on the balance of probabilities that the evidence was unfair-in other words, that the evidence that was to be adduced against her was unfair, so therefore, she had to satisfy the judge on the balance of probabilities that it ought to be excluded. It is important to bear that in mind. As I understand the law even now-and the law that will apply here-if the same situation arises, the onus on the voir dire will be with the defendant. It is all very well to say, 'But ultimately, it is ""beyond reasonable doubt""'. But if you cannot get past the voir dire, you go into the trial on the evidence. In the case of people who are caught in these nets, they frequently have a criminal history as long as your arm. Once they are raising unfairness and putting in issue the credit of the police officer, their history comes before the jury and they are gone. They are gone! The jury are not interested any more in the defence side of the case. That is the problem. It does concern me. This woman was 36 years of age at the time of this operation. She was introduced to marijuana when she was 13 and later to speed and acid. She was introduced to heroin when she went to university. She tried on numerous occasions to detoxify; she made a suicide attempt when she was 20. Her attempts to detoxify led to her being introduced to other drugs. She had an injury to her back, exacerbated by a car accident. The degree of pain was intolerable; this led her back to drugs. She had a sexual attack upon her where she was dropped on her head at Bondi. She suffered violently from pelvic problems-this was at the time of the trial. She had had a number of violent relationships with men. She had a history of prostitution, but she had, in her earlier days, excelled as a student. She had great potential but was held back. She had been involved with people who had died over the years from drugs and so forth, but she came to Queensland to get away from the drugs. In the latter part of 1988, she had an accident in which she hit a little boy. The consequences of that were not very serious, but that led her to try to commit suicide again, because this is the way she was---constantly in depression. She took up with a friend who had also been in drugs, and this friend was then approached by the undercover police officer. There was no suggestion that she was dealing in drugs in any way, shape or form, other than that she used to smoke marijuana for pain. That is what she did. On a scale of one to 10, her pain level was somewhere about eight all the time. That was the medical evidence. So what do you do when you are a drug addict, or a former drug addict, and you have that sort of pain problem? She was on methadone at the time, and she was going to university, trying to re-establish her life. Then this individual came into her life. This individual, on the pretext that he was dying of cancer and was a small-time dealer, fed his way into her life. She fell in love with him, and she would do anything that he said. So he inveigled her; he pressured her; he would constantly provide marijuana to her to smoke. Because the story seemed to hang together, it went on. In the meantime, unbeknown to the undercover police officer-she did not know he was undercover, of course-she was seeing a psychologist and was saying quite the opposite: 'He MC 2520 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 1996 is trying to get me into drugs. He is trying to get me drugs. I do not want to, but I love him.' All of that evidence came out as part of it. It was a thoroughly dreadful case. His Honour made the following findings. She had been a heroin addict for many years in Sydney and moved to try to overcome it. She had serious medical, psychiatric and psychological problems, for which she had received treatment and counselling prior to 1989 and for which she was still receiving treatment. She had formed a close association with another drug addict, F, because it was difficult to find other social contacts with people who had not had a background similar to hers. She had used marijuana primarily to cope with her severe medical, psychiatric and psychological problems. She was strongly dependent on other people and prone to depression, with suicidal tendencies. She had taken a number of measures to deal with her problem. She had been a participant in the work of the alcohol and drug dependency unit and had resumed her university studies. These matters were known, at least to a substantial degree, by the undercover police officer. He cultivated the friendship, His Honour found, through this other person and sought to promote the friendship through frequent social contacts. The emotional attachment started. Cannabis was used frequently on those contacts. So it goes on. But time is eluding me. As a result of that, she was used to obtain a source of supply of cocaine in Sydney. One of most hideous aspects of all of this was that when this cocaine was brought back he gave her a cut of that cocaine. Was that necessary to the indemnity? I would say absolutely not, and I believe the man should have been charged with an offence, because it was not necessary to the indemnity to give her a cut. I further say-although His Honour did not find this-that I am absolutely satisfied that heroin was also supplied to her. So, by virtue of all of that evidence, His Honour found it was unfair, and he excluded all of the relevant evidence. So, ultimately, she walked from the court. I hope she has resumed her life to a large extent. The last time. I heard, she had done that, after a lot of difficulty getting over all of this and the shock, too, of being told that this person she was in love with was actually a police officer who had been using her for nearly a year. I will get to the bill very quickly now. it is in a different context from 15M-the words used are 'the person would not otherwise have had the intent to commit that offence or an offence of that kind.' The word 'would' is used, and I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to bear that in mind. The words 'the intent' I have a bit of a problem with too. Should it say 'an intent'? I will leave that aside for a moment. The words are again used in subsection (5) of that same section-'would not otherwise have had the intent' . We then come to this critical section, 15M, which relates to the certificate authorising a controlled operation. Part (b) of section 15M says: the person targeted by the operation is likely to commit an offence ... I caution those who have presented this bill, and I do so with the greatest respect to those on both sides of the House who have expressed views on this, about the use of those words. It is my submission that the word 'would' is a far better word to use there. The reality is that the Mr Bigs are rarely, if ever, caught. We know that that is the intention. We know that",162,Representatives Main Committee

248,Mr Tony Smith,"I am laying the founuation. In the bill, in section 15I(2)(b)-I knowThursday, 20 June 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2521 is what we are trying to do. But, frequently, as happened in this case, it is the person at the very bottom-the broken-down, sad, tragic person-who is caught in this web, and that is my concern. That then goes to the issues on the voir dire, and the onus of proof and the problems there. It is all very well to say, 'If you provide a test like that, the jump is too high'. However, we have to have something that can rectify that onus of proof problem. Indeed, it may be worthwhile considering whether the onus on the voir dire in a case such as this should be on the prosecution. That would go some way to alleviating the problem, again, on the balance of probabilities, as it always is. At the moment, it is on the defendant. Alternatively, we could look at the use of the word 'would' in light of what, to me, seems a somewhat inconsistent use in the earlier section of the word 'would'. I know that it is a separate area. It is a certificate in one area but, nonetheless, we seem to be departing slightly and we leave it open. I think my time has run out but I do urge caution in relation to the matter. I have reservations. I believe the member for Banks has identified in broad terms that we have to monitor it carefully. But, bear in mind, as I said before, that people like M could be caught in the same situation. At the end of these operations, where hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent, we all know that someone has to be prosecuted, and frequently it is that person.
