At a very early date, the Government will give honourable members an opportunity to discuss tbe tobacco duties from every angle. very heavy withdrawals of American tobacco from bond during the few days that have elapsed since the tabling of the new schedule in this House, will the Minister for Trade and Customs consider whether it is possible for the Government to prevent any further withdrawals until Parliament has dealt with the new tobacco duties? honourable member is under a misapprehension as to the withdrawals. The total impost paid by importers of tobacco is just the same now as before the alteration was made in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Importers are still paying a total of 7s. 6d. per lb. in customs and excise duties.

It will be noted from the above that 2,000 pairs of breeches were allotted to Brisbane, but were not accepted by the State Government. As regards the part-worn and unserviceable clothing shown in (b) this is being distributed in the States in which it becomes available. The quantities are small and the condition of the clothing is such as not to justify cost of transport between States. 3. The large quantity of clothing already issued for the relief of unemployed has reduced array stocks to such an extent that the quantities remaining on hand will all be required for army needs. The only military clothing likely to be available in the future will be part-worn and unserviceable clothing. The quantities of this part-worn clothing issued from time to time, as it becomes available, will probably be small. 2. In view of the complaints of the comparatively small quantity furnished tb Brisbane during that period, will he make a proportionate quota available to the unemployed of Queensland for the coming winter? 3.

HARRISON (Wentworth) [3.39] I have no diffidence, as one of the younger members of this House, in addressing honourable members ou the measure before us, although, no doubt, it bristles with legal and constitutional difficulties. I say that because, as a member from New South Wales, I consider it the obvious duty of each of the Government supporters from that State to pass his opinion on this bill in no uncertain terms. I have listened with marked attention to the various arguments advanced for and against the passage of this measure to make a defaulting State stand up to its obligations, and, except for a small minority, who have not contributed in a helpful manner to the general discussion, the consensus of opinion is that some such measure is necessary to bring that State to heel by compelling it to meet its financial commitments. The only serious difference of opinion relates to the methods to be adopted. I do not intend to discuss the measure from the legal point of view. Honourable members with more legal knowledge than I have are convinced that the principle of this proposed legislation is sound. Therefore, I can leave it to' them with confidence. It is desirable, however, that we should pay some attention to the political aspect. If this measure were not absolutely necessary it would be unwise, perhaps, to justly upon some of the States. With the best will in the world, a State may not be able to honour its obligations, and it would not be proper that this legislation should be invoked in order to deal harshly with such a State. In the case of New South Wales, however, the Premier( Mr Lang) has unequivocally declared that he will not meet the obligations of his State, and it is necessary that pressure should be brought to bear to compel him to do so. Facts are important things, 'and, in a discussion of this kind, facts count. We all know that when the Lang Government first defaulted, legal proceedings were instituted against it by the Scullin Government for the recovery of the monwealth. That action was not continued. Mr Lang was taken back into the Loan Council, and granted financial accommodation on conditiothat he made certain promises, and signuu some I.O.U's. He undoubtedly created the impression that he intended to meet the obligations of his State, and to carry out the Premiers plan. Notwithstanding those promises, he defaulted a second time. Some honourable members opposite have sought, to make much of the fact that the Commonwealth did not immediately pay the interest regarding which New South Wales defaulted, but they w*ere merely endeavouring to draw a red herring across the trail. It has taken tliis default by the Federal Government to shake the general public of New South Wales out of their apathy, and make them realize the enormity of the offence of which their Premier is guilty. It has been claimed that the Government of New South Wales has spent money recklessly; but whether or not it was justified in building certain",21,Telephone Subscribers

There has been a decline but to such legislain the purchasing power of the community to the extent of £30,000,000, and a decline iu the value of materials used to the extent of £40,000,000. That adverse position is the direct result of legislation of that State, the aim of which is to definitely shatter its industrial and commercial activities. I do not say that all these conditions have been brought about by the Lang Government alone. We fully realize that we are faced with a worldwide depression, but I wish to make it clear that the Government of New South Wales should have attempted to minimize and not to aggravate, as it did, the natural effect of that depression upon Australia generally. The result of that aggravation is shown in the growing competition of the other States with New South Wales. The irony of it is that the States which are competing successfully with New South Wales are controlled by true Labour governments which have taken definite action to carry out the Premiers plan. The following extract supports my contention:Addressing the Arbitration Court in Sydney recently on behalf of tlie stovemaking industry, Premier of New South Wales that he did Mr W. C. My hi 11 said that, unless that activity were given some relief from unfair interstate competition, local concerns would have to close down. The average wage rate in New South Wales was 40 per cent, higher than in Victoria, and, in addition, Victoria had a 48-hour week as against a 44-hour week in Now South Wales. The unfortunate employer in New South Wales, added Mr Mylvill, was further burdened with a Family Endowment tax, a high unemployment relief tax, and liigher costs of manufacture. livery State is suffering from the effects of the world depression. In every State industry is being restricted and unemployment is rife. In every State but New South Wales, the Government has attempted to restore financial stability, not with much success it is true, but the effort has helped to stem the drift, and to honourable member for Dalley( Mr by their friend and patron, Mr Lang, at Eosevear), referring to the Loan Council, stated his belief in competition between State and State in connection with borrowing, yet he is a supporter of a Government in New South Wales which is objecting to such competition existing between State and State in respect of general industry. He is supporting a government which by means of tbe Trade Marks Act is endeavouring to injure trade between the States. Although the Government. of New South Wales in insisting upon the labelling of various products, the housewife is realizing that she can buy similar products from other States at a price much lower than that of the local products. The demand for the products of the other States as against those of New South Wales is reacting not only upon the industrial and commercial life of the State, but also upon production generally, and is throwing hundreds of men out of employment. Lot me take another example from the public works of New South Wales. Before the Lang rdgime the Sydney Water Board, in its constructional work, including high pressure tunnels, sewerage systems and dams, employed upwards of 5,000 men, but at present most of those works have been discontinued or considerably curtailed, and the number of men employed on them is only 2,500. The Sydney Water Board has been unable to borrow money with which to carry on its works, solely as a result of the announcement of the not believe in, and would not support, the principle of sanctity of contract. A little over two years ago the Sydney Harbour Trust employed 1,500 men on constructional work. To-day, because of the inability of the trust to obtain finance from the Government, it is employing only 300 men. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) said that the plight of New South Wales was the result of the undue and unjust generosity of the. Lang Government. I subscribe fully to that statement. The Lang Government can lay claim to undue generosity, but some people would give it a harsher name. I have a' list of thirteen names of union organizers, secretaries, and others, who have been elevated to the chairestablish sound finance. The manship or membership of various boards salaries ranging from £700 to £1,500. On Friday last the Daily Telegraph published a list of seventeen members of three families-Garden, Graves, and Martin. The Lang Government, which professes to guard the interests of the working people, and states that it will insist on employment being given to the workers, has given to the friends of certain members of the Ministry employment embracing practically the whole of the members of their families.

I do not like this legislation, because it involves a suggestion of financial unification, and gives to the Commonwealth rights over the States which were never intended to be given by * the framers of the Constitution. For my own part, I am absolved from responsibility, because I foresaw the disabilities to which the Financial Agreement would give rise, and therefore opposed it. Nevertheless the Financial Agreement was made, and confirmed by the people, and New South ""Wales was a party to it. It entailed certain obligations upon all the signatories, and New South Wales is the only one that has deliberately disregarded its responsibilities. The first repudiation That declaration is at variance with the occurred before the Conference of Premiers in June last, but Mr Lang subsequently made some professions of repentance, and promised to carry out certain economies in accordance with the Premiers plan. He joined the other Premiers in a pledge to attempt honestly to balance budgets. works following. works followed; evidently his followers were disappointed with his promises, and he chose to be guided by the counsels and demands of the lesser breeds in his camp rather than comply with his honourable obligations. A few weeks ago he attended a meeting of the Loan Council and boldly demanded £500,000, threatening that if this money were not forthcoming his State would default in respect of interest due overseas. Other State Governments are equally in need of money, and haye made some remarkable sacrifices in order to give effect to the Premiers plan.

The Commonwealth tariff, for instance, has proved a great burden to that State. A previous Commonwealth Government gave effect to a portion of the last royal commission's report, but within twelve months of the granting of that relief the Government increased the tariff to such an extent as to deprive Western Australia of more than the advantage that had been given, to it. I remind the honourable member for West Sydney that, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, Western Australia bought from the Eastern States in one year goods to the value of £10,600,000 and sold to them only £1,200,000 worth.

The Premier of New South Wales is prepared to fall into line with the other States in an effort to bring about uniform industrial arbitration legislation, but, as would be explained by the supporters of Mr Lang in this chamber, this is to bring other States up to the level of New South Wales. Fortunately, we are all so familiar with the tactics of Mr Lang that we are not likely to comply with his desires. It is highly improper that a State which has a territory comprising one-third of the Oommonwealth, and but a handful of people, should be checked in its natural development in order to give easier conditions to the State of New South Wales. should make my position clear, otherwise It is dishonest and vulgar that, unable my attitude towards the bill might be misto meet their public obligations, the people construed.

It is quite dishonest for the Governthat steps should be taken to recover the ment of New South Wales to say, ""We moneys that have been paid by the Co»will not pay, but will ruin the Commonmonwealth Government to meet the comwealth "". While I dislike the bill, because it contemplates the introduction of an unpalatable measure of uniformity and interference with the sovereign rights of States, I agree that, as the Financial Agreement was entered into by all of the governments of Australia, some machinery must be brought into being to force defaulting States to fulfil the terms of the contract. the representative of a New South Wales constituency, I feel that, at this late stage of the debate, I should refrain from addressing the House, notwithstanding the important and far-reaching nature of the measure. I rise with both diffidence and regret. With diffidence, because I have listened to so many excellent speeches on the bill, a number of which lucidly expounded its legal aspects; with regret, because the State affected, New South Wales, is that which I represent, the richest in the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I consider that 1 I understand that another I believe, the honourable member himself Every honourable member who has spoken on the measure has admitted the liability of New South Wales, and the mitments of that State.",26,Capital Leaves New South Wales

112,Mr Dein (Lang) [4.20],"Wer e I notTho Scullin Government contemplated resorting to force to recover those payments, but it found the road thorny, with the result that the process became uncertain and expensive, getting that Government nowhere. I believe that the action proposed by this Government will be more effective and expeditious, consequently I support the measure. I do so in the belief that au overwhelming majority of my constituents, together with a majority of the people of New South Wales, and of the Commonwealth generally, would do likewise if given the opportunity. The matter of default was made an issue in New South Wales during the recent federal elections. As honourable members know, the people of that State cast their vote overwhelmingly against the application of such an unscrupulous and fantastic scheme. Repudiation was also an issue during the 1930 New South Wales State elections. Mr Lang, who was then Leader of the Opposition, made very definite statements, which were referred to in this chamber last week. For the benefit of those honourable members who were absent then, I shall repeat them. I quote from the gospel of Labour, the journal known as the Labor Daily. The article is headed, "" Lang Repudiates Repudiation,"" "" No Repudiation;"" and Mr arms, in an endeavour to induce the judge Lang is reported as having said thatTlie Australian Labour movement would not permit for one moment any of its leaders to be associated witli the policy of repudiation. Tlie pledge to tbe people from a Labour man is as binding as bis pledge to a bondholder.^ The Labour party sets its face against all repudiation, whether it is of a kind practised rower than were those who controlled by Premier Bavin, or that which is preached by Alderman Garden. Not only did Mr Lang intimate that his Government would not default, he also stated that if returned to power he would ""balance the budget, would find work for the unemployed, reduce the hours of work, increase wages-whic h had been reduced, he alleged, by a conspiracy-and bring prosperity to all. Mr in those days, a standard of living of Lang reduced the hours of work in many industries from 48 to 44. Indeed, in tens of thousands of cases he reduced those hours from 48 to none at all! Wages were increased, and prosperity did return-to some twenty faithful henchmen, for whom jobs have been created at salaries ranging from £20 to £30 a week. But not only did Mr Lang fail to honour his promise to the majority, of workers,'and restore what had been taken from them by the previous Government in the form of an unemployment tax; he increased that tax from 3d. to Is. in the £1. Now after eighteen months of office, during which time his government has been engaged in legislation of a ""great national character""legislation concerning tin hares, State lotteries and an endeavour to place industry under the control of union secretaries, as well as the famous Shadier bread contractMr Lang comes before the people of New South Wales, and says that he cannot feed the unemployed, and at the same time pay the interest commitments of the State. After admitting failure in that fashion Mr Lang should have resigned, as any honest Premier would have done. Instead, he prefers to act the coward, and hide behind the unfortunate women and children, whose bread-winners he has caused to lose their jobs. He reminds me of a certain woman criminal in New South Wales, who burgled my home at DulwichH ill and, after having been tried and convicted, appeared in the court with a three months' old baby in her to depart from his duty, and so defeat the ends of justice. New South Wales, in common with other State Governments, borrowed money from overseas, but according to the statistics, Mr Lang w.as a much heavier borother States. Not one penny of that money was borrowed for war purposes, although it has been suggested by those who support Mr Lang, that it is part of the war loan. It was borrowed for developmental purposes and public works, and was largely responsible for high wages and good conditions. We were able to build up, which we are all proud. Buti t was Mr Lang, and not the bondholders, who fixed the terms of the loan, including the rate of interest. This relates particularly to certain moneys raised during 1927, when Mr Lang was Premier. During the two years of his regime in that period of the State's history, very large sums of money were borrowed. No less than £10,000,000 was obtained in New York at that time under conditions which I , and many other citizens of New South Wales, regarded as very harsh-the most oppressive, as a matter of fact, that the State had been subjected to up to that Martin( Mr Holman), who are qualitime. The raising of that money in New York was regarded hy Mr Lang and his supporters as a great achievement. But I remember that the brokerage paid on that money-it amounted to £92,000was one of the factors which ultimately contributed to the defeat of the former Lang Ministry. It was contended that this brokerage had not been divided equitably. right, except that the amount involved was £94,000. money that he borrowed at that time that Mr Lang is now refusing to pay. He and his followers were proud of their success in floating that loan, but now they days. I hope I shall not be misunderwant to avoid compliance with the terms of it. As a citizen of New South Wales, I disagreed with the floating of the loan on the terms that were then fixed, but, in spite of that fact, I regard it as my duty, as an honourable citizen of that State, to carry out the terms of the agreemy opinion this extraordinary measure ment. When Mr Lang floats his next loan, I also shall regard it as a great achievement. I support this bill entirely on my own volition, first, because the Oommonwealth should definitely accept responsibility for the payment of these debts; secondly, because the measure seems to be the most effective and expeditious method of recovery; and, thirdly, because an agreement honorably made must be kept, if we are to preserve faith as between man and man. [4.35} I participate in the debate on this bill with some diffidence, because of the legal technicalities which are involved in it. As I am a layman without legal training, it is natural that I should feel timid in examining the provisions of the measure. But a man who has been a citizen of this country for many years, and has taken some part in its political affairs, naturally acquires some knowledge of the spirit, if not of the technical meaning, of its Constitution, even though he may have had no legal training. I listened carefully to the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) and the honourable member for fied, by legal training, to discuss the constitutional implications of the bill, and, if I understood the utterances of these honourable gentlemen, they both expressed grave doubts about the validity of the measure. Like the last speaker, I wish to make my personal position clear. I am not a citizen of New South Wales, but a citizen of Victoria and the Commonwealth. I realize that the position of New South Wales to-day may be the position of Victoria, or any other State to-morrow. I consider it highly necessary, therefore, that we should carefully examine both the circumstances whicb have led to the introduction of this bill and the trend of economic affairs in these stood when I say that I believe many honourable members have allowed political antagonism and personal animosity against an individual to blind them, temporarily, to the interests of the great mass of the people of New South Wales. In is quite unconstitutional. Those who have introduced it appear to be reckless of its consequences. Of course, the legality of the bill will be tested before very long in the High Court, and the wisdom of the utterances of honourable members who spoke on it in this chamber, will then be revealed. I have spent many hours in research to try to discover any precedent for tlie introduction of such a bill in the peace-time political history of any country in the world, but I have been unable to find one. we are now facing has ever previously arisen. world has ratified a financial agreement like that ratified by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States. able members to look carefully at this measure, and not allow themselves to be misled by impatience or antagonisms.",27,Capital Leaves New South Wales

119,Mr Holloway,"I ask honorWe have never before been faced with a bill of this kind. I do not think that we can avoid concluding, if we are reasonable men, that numerous speeches that have been delivered in our various parliaments, and On public platforms, in the last year or two, have shown that; there is a tremendous bias against certain political leaders in New South Wales. This, possibly, has led to the introduction of a bill which savours of wartime, rather than peace-time, legislation. I honestly believe that the measure is unconstitutional. The basis of our Constitution is the absolute sovereignty of the various States which agreed to weld themselves into a federation. Any act which violates the sovereignty of even one of the units of the federation, in my opinion, violates the Constitution of the Commonwealth itself. I cannot, for a single minute, believe that the High Court will do other than declare this measure u n eonstitutional. authority in the Commonwealth to-day. very complex situation which faces us, we should be prepared to do unorthodox things. The Prime Minister referred today to the steps which the Government of Yictoria is taking to solve the unemployment problem in that State; but the success of the move being made by that Government will depend entirely upon the willingness of the Loan Council to make a sum of approximately £1,500,000 available to Victoria. Commonwealth Treasurer, as a member of that council, is willing to make this since the war. Sir Ernest Cassels, and money available, all the efforts that have been made in Victoria in the last three or four months to solve the unemployment problem must inevitably fail. I believe that the political leaders of New South Wales have tried to stand up to their contractual obligations, but I am not prepared to assume that, because they have not, been able to do so, they have freely and voluntarily done sometbing immoral. We should remember that if we pass this measure we shall deal a blow, not at the honourable member are applicable chiefly Premier of New South Wales, or his go to Avar borrowings. vfrnnient, but at the people of that State. ment has been unorthodox; but are not all the States of the Commonwealth also on the point of being unorthodox ? Even if unorthodox things are done, we are not justified in assuming that they have been done from choice. I desire that we shall meet every penny of our obligations, but a time has arrived, as even the most casual scanning of the international situation shows, when every country in the world is asking for a suspension of the financial conditions to which it agreed in other and better days, and it is claimed by experts that a complete cancellation is inevitable. If the countries of the wo:'d are not seeking to repudiate, they are at least seeking to suspend the payment of the interest on their debts, and in some cases, they are even seeking the entire cancellation of all debts. Surely, we should not, because of our hatred of some one who has been charged with au immoral financial action, impose upon ourselves super moral standards! We must recognize that our international, financial, and economic problems have brought into question all ihe standards of other days. In our present circumstances, we have a right, to ask ourselves whether the hard and fast bargains of other times should be insisted upon, and whether it is even possible to adhere to them. Some of the greatest financiers in the world-me n who are neither Labour leaders nor socialists-ar e advocating the suspension of existing conditions. They are saying that to ask people to honour their obligations to the last fraction is immoral, in view of the revoluUnless the tionary change which has taken place during the long period of deflation of values other prominent financiers, are among those to whom I refer. These men are saying that a spirit of compromise must be shown. I wish it to be understood that I am not defending any financial immorality or default on the part of New South Wales; I am. merely asking that serious consideration shall be given to the conditions which face the whole world.

But we should be careful that in seeking to deal with an authority which has adopted an unorthodox course, we do not irreparably damage the 2,000,000 people who live in New South Wales. This bill incites, and even orders, the public servants of the largest State of the union to violate their oath of allegiance, to defy their own State authorities, and to go on strike against them. able member say that? the bill, there is a threat of fine and imprisonment hanging over the heads of public officers, bank managers, and others in New South Wales.

I have said that I believe that the measure will be pronounced ultra viresj but I propose to offer my opinion as to what will happen if it be declared valid. I cannot imagine that the High Court would uphold a raid upon one of the States and the attachment of its revenues. The present Government and its supporters should have had more patience with, and more consideration -than has heen shown for the people of New South Wales.

I have said that Victoria's financial position is just as precarious as that of New South Wales, while Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania are in a similar predicament. effort is being made to balance the budget. that. Yet, if the next conference between the State Premiers and representatives of the Commonwealth Government cannot induce the Commonwealth Bank Board to take a step forward in the direction of a progressive alteration of our monetary system, and to assist the States, it will mean either a cancellation or temporary suspension of some of the external debt or internal revolution. I say these things, not because I want to see them come about, but because if a member believes a thing he should give voice to his opinion. I am honestly of opinion that all the States in the federal union are on the brink of being in the same difficulty as New South Wales. They desire to "" play the game"", and to exhibi t the highest sense of financial morality; but if the Commonwealth Bank Board will not help the Commonwealth Government to save all the States financially, before next winter has passed, they will be pointing out that they cannot pay their debts. In my opinion, such n contingency could be avoided. I belirvi that the only institution that can overcome the difficulty is the Commonwealth Bank. It could relieve the whole situation, just as did the right honourable make matters member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) I am speaking, five or six years ago, when he caused of sympathy for the additional credit to be issued to assist the primary producers more quickly and successfully to market their goods overseas.

It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Bank Board, to come to the rescue of the people of Australia. This bill involves a raid on the revenues of a State. It attacks the very basis of the sovereignty of the States, and must, in my opinion, as I have already said, violate the Commonwealth Constitution. I would very much like to hear what the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) has to say on this point. I have always had the greatest respect for his knowledge of legal matters. I again express my regret in having to say that greater patience should have heen exercised than has been shown by the present Government, and that it should have followed more constitutional methods in dealing with the position of New South Wales instead of resorting to a measure which is abhorrent to the instincts of the people. I believe that the bill originated largely because of personal feeling towards the Premier of New South Wales. I admit that Mr Lang is a difficult man to negotiate with, and likes to play a lone hand. If I were a member of a conference which he attended, I would object to his tactics. able member suggest the Commonwealth Government could deal with him? dicated that it should have proceeded on the lines proposed by the late Government, and I do not remember the honourable member for Fawkner objecting to that measure.

138,Mr Holloway,"I have already in the decision Avhether the Lang Government should remain in office, should he made by the people of New South Wales. The liberties of the people of Australia would be violated, if this Parliament took the drastic, tyranical and undemocratic action contemplated under this measure. Eveni f this action were declared by the High Court to be constitutional, it Avould never be enforced. Any attempt to enforce it would not improve the situation in New South Wales, but would make it infinitely worse. I oppose the bill. pleasure in supporting this bill, and I maintain that the great majority of the people of NeAV South Wales are entirely behind the present GoAernment in the r action contemplated by it under this measure. The attitude of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), the Deputy Leader( Mr Forde) and the member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) is rather beAvildering. The last CommonAvealth Government commenced legal proceedings, and carried them to a certain point, for the purpose of bringing the New South Wales Government to heel. If greater patience should have been exercised in dealing with Mr Lang, will the honourable member for Melbourne Ports explain Avhy his party did not show more patience than it did Avith him, and keep him within its own fold. The Federal Labour party Avas unable to curb Mr ledge. Mr Lang must be dealt with like Lang. He defied it in New South Wales, defeated its representatives at the election, and has sent five of his own supporters to represent NeAv South Wales in this Parliament. honourable member and his friends in NeAV South Wales curb Mr Lang? South Wales elections Mr Lang Avent before the people Avith a policy which, after his return to power, he never attempted to carry out. That fact is admitted everywhere. He told the people that there was no depression; that he Avould find employment for every one Avithin three weeks; that he could borrow money overseas; and, in short, that he Avas going to be the saviour of his State. I admit that the leaders of the opposing political party went to the country with a negative policy. Mr Lang's promises deceived the people. Immediately he Avas elected he set about putting into effect an old plank of the Labour party, the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. New.South Wales has been betrayed by Mr Lang. He has dishonoured every pledge he made during the election, and has since declared that at the elections he received a mandate to do Avhatever he thought best. I am surprised that honourable members opposite should think that Mr Lang could be dealt with in any other way than by the most extreme measures; and I am particularly surprised that the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should find fault Avith the manner in Avhich the CommonAvealth Government proposes to make him stand up to his obligations. After all, the Government proposes only to continue Avhat the Labour party began Avhen it was in office. I ask honourable members of the Opposition why they do not come in wholeheartedly behind the Government in order to show that the whole Federal Parliament, with the exception of the five Lang-planners, are in favour of making Mr Lang face the music without a judgment. proposal has been explained to the honourable member by men with legal IOIOAVa man Avho is seeking to leave the country in order to get away from his creditors.

145,Mr Lane,"Only those who reside inadjunct to government. I have always had the support of the respectable element in the community, and have no patience with the arguments of ignorant, stupid men. West Sydney is not very well represented in this House. On the 9th February, 1931, Mr Lang announced as the policy of his Government that he would not pay any interest to bondholders until certain things had been done. On the 24th March of the same year he advised the Prime Minister that he would not pay interest to the Westminster Bank. In May or June of that year, when he saw that he would be unable to pay the civil servants, he came crawling to the Oommonwealth Government, and said that he would join the Loan Council, and adhere to the Premiers plan, if financial accommodation were granted to him. On the 15th July he asked for £500,000 to pay .salaries and wages, and from that date until January of the present year he accepted the Premiers plan. On the 23rd January, 1932, he again refused to meet his obligations. I cannot understand how the members of the Opposition can be patient with such a man who, besides dishonouring his obligations and dragging in the mud the good name of his State, has dealt such a heavy blow to their own party. Ancl Mr Lang has done much more than that. Consider for a moment the Arbitration Bill which, at this moment, is before the Upper House in New South Wales. By that measure he proposes to take away from the citizens of New South Wales the right to earn a living. A very different line of action was followed during England's time of crisis by Mr Bamsay MacDonald and Mr Phillip Snowden, who were themselves great socialists. They declared that it was no time for socialistic"" experiments, but that every man should put his shoulder to the wheel in an endeavour to save the country. The result is to be seen even now in the steadily improving trade returns of Great Britain, as revealed by the official reports, mittee which inquired into the matter which, no doubt, are unpleasant reading to some honourable members opposite who desire the downfall of Mr MacDonald. There seems no doubt that before long Great Britain will have regained her position as the greatest commercial country in the world. Besides repudiating debts, Mr Lang also repudiated his promises to the workers and to the people generally. . A new departure has been made in the Arbitration Bill, which seeks to grant power to union officials to say whether or not a man has the right to work, and to demand of an employer, under a penalty of the law, that he shall, in certain circumstances, dismiss an employee. I know that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) will agree with that. It has been a plank of his platform for many years. The hont orable member has so much in common with Mr Lang that he and other members of the Opposition in this Parliament refuse to support the Government in the action it now seeks to take, because they wish, even if only afar off, to follow along the track which Mr Lang is blazing. ber knows too much. industrial districts longer than the honourable member has been representing Melbourne Ports, and I know a good deal of these matters. This Arbitration Bill further provides that employers shall engage labour only at or through the office of an industrial union. A lad came to me the other day, and said that he had had offered to him a job as a plumber. He went to the union office and asked for a ticket giving him the right to work, but was told that there were 150 others in front of him, and that he would have to give up the job to some one else. That was. a friendly gesture from one unionist to another! Mr Lang further proposes in this bill to bring under the scope of the Industrial Arbitration Act persons in managerial and other executive positions, including technical experts, who are rightly the representatives of employers, and cannot possibly serve two masters. The. most astonishing part of the bill is clause 24, concerning which a comhas declared in the eourse of its reportClause 24 "" Award to prevail over acts"", the committee regarded as probably the most far-reaching clause of the bill. Under it, where an order or award, in respect of any industrial matter, is inconsistent with any provisions contained in any act, the order or award is to prevail.",33,Capital Leaves New South Wales

If he continues unchecked he will bring about a revolution, but it will not be of the kind which honourable memhers opposite will approve. There are in New South Wales enough men under 30 years of age with the interests of their country at heart to ensure that Mr Lang and his proposals will not be tolerated. Guard. when honest men were endeavouring to carry on the industry, honourable members opposite virtually gave their support to the basher gangs, and encouraged them to carry weapons for the purpose of intimidating the loyal workers. I am reluctant to intervene during the speech of a new member, but too much latitude cannot be allowed The honourable member must connect his remarks with the bill before the House. so. The Commonwealth has a right to pass legislation such as that proposed in the present measure, because of the deliberate actions of the Premier of New South Wales in seeking to destroy the credit of the Commonwealth, to repudiate the debts of his State and to pass through Parliament legislation designed to disrupt the unity of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that we should be patient; that we should do nothing which might precipitate revolution or civil strife. Mr Lang has made it quite plain that it is of no use being patient with him. Two years ago the coal-miners went on strike in New South Wales, and dealt tbe Coal-mining industry a blow from which it has not yet recovered. At the beginning of the dispute they were offered terms by the employers which they refused, but after more than a year of inactivity, they accepted. there has been a Labour Government in months no attempt has been made to vary the terms of the agreement. That shows that Mr Lang and his supporters are making a deliberate attempt to undermine the Commonwealth by destroying what they term the capitalistic system and the present form of government, and to replace it with a socialized system. As a citizen of New South Wales, I have watched the progress of the Lang movement, and I am pleased that at the last election the people of that State made an emphatic protest against it. The members of the Opposition will, therefore, do well to examine this issue thoroughly before they vote upon it. I can produce statements of members of various the New organizations to the effect that New South Wales is suffering from the maladministration of justice. I visited the Domain on Sunday afternoon, and heard a good deal of hot air there. It is extraordinary that Mr Lang should allow seditious language to be used in open discussion without bringing the offenders to book. ber referring to Mr Eric Campbell? knows that whatever opinion may be held of Colonel Campbell, the men behind him are young Australians who will not tolerate the head of the Government prostituting his power and making his name unworthy of the State which he represents. We have difficulty in understanding. Mr Lang's utterances. He says that he cannot meet the interest obligations of his State, yet he continues to make fresh appointments to various boards. He states that he is not meeting his.interest obligations so that he may be in a position to feed the poor. We are always ready to help the poor and needy, and every government of Australia is carrying out its obligations to the unemployed. But Mr Lang is out to destroy the industrial movement. He is forcing the people on to the dole so that when the time comes to strike a blow at the present system of government, there will be men with empty stomachs prepared to fight, to destroy the powers of the Commonwealth.

The people action when these' charges were made of New South Wales have no sympathy with Mr Lang, and would gladly welcome his fall. He is holding office with the object of driving more and more people on to the dole, so that he may obtain their support at the next election. The experience of the members of the Opposition is that Mr Lang is intolerant, and will brook no interference. No other Minister of the Crown has received so many bribes, and still kept himself in office. honourable member receive? I have no knowledge of what the honourable member received.

Only the other day the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the State House, when making certain charges against Mr Lang, offered to surrender privilege to enable hini to stand in the witness-box and answer the charges. The Government of New South Wales has adopted the procedure of proposing to restrict certain private enterprises, and then accepting bribes in return for not taking action. We all know of the tin-hare episode. Mr instructed by the State Attorney-General Lang has so degraded himself that he is beyond the recognition of any decent and moral person. ber imagines that. must be blind politically or else he is awaiting a suitable opportunity to join the Lang group in this House. The New South Wales Government is undermining not only the financial and industrial life of this country, but also the administration of justice. Men are making seditious utterances, no check being placed upon them. I have in my hand particulars of the three-years' plan which Mr Lang proposed to institute in place of honouring the obligations of New South Wales. On the Sth April last he attended the Labour Conference, and presented his plan, which was carried by 57 to 44 votes. He was reported then to have spoken as follows:At Hie Australian Labour party Easter Conference on the 3rd April last, Mr Lang claimed breaking a definite contract to which he that the Lang plan was a step towards socialization, saying: ""This is a time for the Labour movement in New South Wales to use all its powers, whether persuasive or disciplinary, for legislation along the lines of the New South Wales plan, which is a step towards tlic objective of the movement."" That is clear evidence that so far back as April of last year Mr Lang expounded a plan which is designed to undermine the powers' of the Commonwealth, and wreck the present constitutional edifice. In New South Wales, sedition is openly preached. Men are publicly making statements for which they should be imprisoned, and the State Government will not proceed against them. If this continues, the Commonwealth Government will have to consider the increase of its own police force so that it can take action against sedition-mongers when the State Government is recreant to its trust. Even the minds of school children are being inflamed by anti-British propaganda, and in the Domain on SundayI heard a boy sixteen years of age declaring that Australians should not listen to the "" jargon "" about the greatness of the British Empire. Some time ago, a man who is now a member of the Legislative Council in New South Wales was fined for abusive language; a writ of attachment was issued against him, but the police were not to act upon it. with the State Government. of New South Wales obtained money from the Loan Council by misrepresentation and false pretences, and this House will do well to pass the bill unanimously, and thus declare to' the people of Australia and investors overseas that Mr Lang's moral code will not be tolerated. To the best of ray knowledge, this is the first occasion on which one governmeut has been forced to legislate to enforce the honest performance of a contract by another government. To men of British descent aaid ideals, such a situation is abhorrent. Usually punitive legislation is directed against individual lawbreakers, but to-day we have the sorry spectacle of a State government acting like a dishonest person who is deliberately evading his just obligations. In addition to was a signatory, Mr Lang has repudiated his pledged word. Legislation of this' character therefore becomes necessary, but I hope it will not have to be utilized more than once. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has announced that the operation of the bill will be limited to two years, but all honourable members will sincerely wish that long before that period expires the need for such extraordinary legislation will have disappeared. That such a measure should have to be placed on the statute-book is not a pleasant thought, although, as the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) stated last week, this Parliament, having recently been given an additional grant of power by the people, should not hesitate to take the earliest opportunity to test its effectiveness.",36,Capital Leaves New South Wales

170,Mr R. Green (Richmond) [5.32],"Tlie bill raises three issues-first , the general principle underlying it ; secondly, the validity of this legislation; and, thirdly, the means of effectively enforcing it. I do not think that the principle has been questioned. Moneys are owing to the Oommonwealth by New South Wales; that is not in dispute, and the State Government having declared that it will not pay an admitted debt, this Parliament is surely justified in taking steps for the recovery of it. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) admitted that principle, and it has not been attacked even by the small but loud group led by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr ments made with the State Governments. Beasley). As to the validity of this legislation, laymen must be guided by the opinions of the Attorney-General( Mr Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) to the Latham), the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom), the honourable member for Martin( Mr the honourable member, for I fail to see Holman), and other legal luminaries, who were consulted by the present Government and its immediate predecessor. In their opinion the proposals made by the Government are valid, but the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) questioned the constitutional propriety of tacking other provisions to a measure which might be regarded by the High Court as imposing taxation. He therefore suggested the separation, from the enforcement provisions, of that part of the bill in which the Conynonwealth rightly declares itself finally responsible for the debt and interest liabilities of Australian Governments. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) announced that the Government was prepared to consider favourably the suggestion of the right honourable member for Cowper, and I hope that the measure will be amended accordingly. I come now to the provisions for the enforcement of payment by a defaulting State. The Leader of the Opposition stated that the Commonwealth was trying to coerce a sovereign .State. I interjected then that no State of the Commonwealth is sovereign. Even the Oommonwealth itself is not sovereign, because its powers are limited by the Constitution. It has complete powers within certain limits, but the very fact that such limits have been imposed disposes of the contention that the Commonwealth Parliament is sovereign. So far as the States are concerned, even in the spheres reserved to them, their legislation, if inconsistent with that of this Parliament, is, to the extent of that inconsistency, null and void. To that extent the State Parliaments are subservient to the Commonwealth Parliament, and, therefore, their power is not sovereign. That being so, this Parliament cannot be said to be attempting to coerce a sovereign State. Leading counsel consulted by the Commonwealth Government seem to agree that this Parliament has power to legislate in the way proposed for the carrying out of agreeI might here reply to the suggestion that was made by the honourable member for effect that this legislation is undemocratic in principle. . I am unable to agree with anything undemocratic in enforcing the payment of a just debt. I know that if I am owed money, and I take the prescribed legal action to recover it, I do not consider my action undemocratic. It is the same in the larger sphere 'of national finance. If , on the other hand, we failed' to take this action, we should be undemocratic to the three-fifths of the people of Australia who represent the population outside the State of New South Wales. I shall not deal with the validity of the measure. Upon that aspect of the matter we have had adequate legal opinion. I hope that the Government will reconsider clause 6, which deals with the application of the provisions of the measure in cases of emergency. As it takes only one month to have a case heard before the High Court, I see no reason why power should be given to the Commonwealth Government to take direct action without approaching the court. To my mind, clause 6 is unnecessary, and open to considerable criticism, apart from the aspect that was dealt with by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman), and I hope that the Goverument will delete it. I am also a good deal in doubt as to clause 14, which gives the Commonwealth power to retain certain moneys received ou behalf of a State. Eor instance, authority is given to the Commonwealth Government to take any moneys allocated by tlie Loan Council to a State and apply them in discharge of any .liabilities of that State which have accrued under the Financial Agreement. With that I do not agree. I have in mind the case in which a State has practically completed a public work, and needs a further sum of money to convert it from a non-payable into a revenue-producing asset. If the Commonwealth appropriated the money that had been made available by the Loan Council for such a purpose, it would prevent the completion of the structure, which would remain a non-paying liability. I require to be convinced as to the necessity for the provision. I agree that the Commonwealth should have power to seize moneys from the consolidated revenue of the State. I come now to the. enforcement of the measure, and here, I confess, I am in grave doubt. deal with a Premier, of New South Wales, who is, without doubt, an obvious crook. another. not., for it is not my habit to deal with confidence men. into power through a confidence trick, by making promises which he had no intention of fulfilling. I am aware that, in the majority of cases, the revenue of a State1 is received in the form of cheques, bank drafts, or other bank instruments, and that it would be easy enough for the Conv monwealth Government to obtain an injunction for the retention of those moneys by the financial institutions concerned. However, I see a loophole for Mr Lang, who could legislate to provide that all payments to the State should be in currency, in which case there would be no necessity to use the banks as a medium. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) suggested that the revenue of the railways should be attached. I agree with that in principle, but a big proportion of railway revenues is received in cash, and if instructions were given that all payments to the railway department should be made in currency, that avenue would be closed to the Commonwealth. There are other ways of enforcing the collection of these moneys. For instance, the Commonwealth Government could put a receiver into the State treasury, but the State Government could send along members of its police force with instructions politely but firmly to throw that receiver on to the footpath. What would then be the action of the Commonwealth Government ? action against the policeman. Mr E, GREEN -The whole procedure is beset witli difficulties, and, although I am prepared to see this act placed upon our statute-book, I desire to be assured that it will be workable. The enforcement section of the measure gives me far the greatest concern. The bill has been introduced to deal with a government that has criminally defaulted. When you are dealing with a criminal or a criminal Admittedly, we have to government, "" kid-glove "" action is futile, and the Commonwealth Governmeut may find it necessary to do things which, in ordinary circumstances, would not be considered as between one government and another. Mr Lang got able gentleman suggest? many methods of evasion open to the State Government, I certainly think that the attachment of fShds lying to the credit of the State in the Bank of New South Wales and other financial institutions presents one way out of the difficulty. Later, when what I may term the machinery measure is presented to us, honourable members will have on opportunity to debate the methods by which this act may be enforced. At the moment we are more concerned with the validity of this bill. Provided that the Government will appropriately subdivide the measure, and. omit the provisions of clauses C ancl 14, we should be able with safety to pass it. I hope that, when we are in committee, the Government will take heed of the amendments that have been forecast by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) and the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman). Unless the Government is able to advance adequate argumenfs against their acceptance, I propose to support",37,Capital Leaves New South Wales

175,Mr R. Green,"Whil e there arethem. I am very glad that the bill has been introduced. It is a measure about which I do not care much, ancl I hope (hat when it has served its purpose it will be repealed, and that it will never again be necessary for this Parliament to introduce similar legislation. give a silent vote on this important bill. The realization that the measure may affect other States than the defaulting State of which we have heard so much during this debate, obliges one to approach the consideration of it, not in a spirit of vindictiveness, such as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr the Commonwealth Parliament has itself Holloway) suggested that some honourable members had adopted, but in a spirit of caution. I have listened attentively to some of the able speeches delivered in this debate, and have subsequently read the Hansard' record of them. As to the constitutionality of the bill, I feel that I must rely upon the advice of the legal profession in this House, who have given opinions on this subject. The lay members of the House can hardly do other than be guided, in such matters, by their learned colleagues of the legal profession. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr these facts. It is therefore necessary to Scullin) expressed opinions somewhat contrary to those advanced by the learned members on this side of the chamber, but though his effort was an able one, it left me with the impression that the right honorable gentleman was seeking an excuse for opposing a measure introduced by trying constructively to criticize the bill. My impression may, of course, be wrong. I shall not further discuss the constitutionality of this measure. I intend to support the bill for four main reasons. The first reason is that it is imperative that we should do every thing possible to preserve the sanctity of contracts. It has been truly said during this debate that great moral issues are at stake. I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Melbourne Ports say, in what seemed to me a sneering tone, that we ought not to impose a "" super moral standard "" upon ourselves. There is no such thing as super morality. Morality is morality, and that is all there is to it. The National Parliament will he doing only what is its duty if it lays emphasis upon the necessity for morality in both public and private life'. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) in his speech said thai governments must be taught that they cannot deliberately break their contracts. The honourable gentleman had previously said something about the necessity for emphasizing the moral issues. I agree that governments should not be allowed deliberately to break their contracts. It is very necessary to bring that fact home to the people to-day, the more so because recently deliberately helped to break contracts made between various Australian governments and our bondholders. The Oommonwealth Parliament and the State Parliaments recently said to dissenting bondholders that they must convert their bonds. Although the bondholders had. indicated that they did nol of the learned members wish to convert, and were not willing to accept a reduced rate of interest, the various Australian Parliaments have declared that their "" no"" means ""yes"". To this extent there has been definite repudiation in respect of both the rate of interest and the currency of bonds. No one can gainsay emphasize that governments cannot be allowed deliberately to break their contracts. The second reason why I shall support the bill is that drastic action is necessary in present circumstances. The honourable the Government rather than member for Melbourne Ports said thai there was no precedent for the introduction of a measure of this kind; but that is not. a sufficient reason for us to refuse to act. Our hands cannot be tied because of the lack of a precedent. If unprecedented action has been taken by certain authorities the Commonwealth Parliament is entitled, insofar as the Constitution allows it, to take unprecedented action to counteract any damage that may have been done. It is absolutely necessary for us to do our utmost to prevent the economic and financial structure of the Commonwealth from collapsing. The Attorney-General said that civilization itself was being challenged. The present situation has",39,Capital Leaves New South Wales
176,Mr Gabb (Angas) [6.0],"I caunot.been brought about, to some extent, because the New South Wales Government has sought to give certain classes of people within the State, better conditions than the State can afford to give them. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) made some reference in his speech to coolies in South Australia. I do not know exactly what he meant. Our position is that whether we like it or not, we feel that a basic wage of £3 3s. per week of 48 hours is all that the State can afford: to pay under existing conditions. We should like the wages to be higher and the hours shorter if possible, but it is not possible. When theories come against facts, facts always reign supreme. The facts that we are uuable to obtain money from overseas, and that world prices of the commodities which we produce are low, cannot be disregarded. The third reason why I shall support tlie bill is that I desire to perpetuate a White Australia. lionorable member's sincerity in that regard. He and his associates have claimed that their party is thinking about the starving women and children of Australia. To my knowledge there are no women and children starving in this country. I wish to preserve conditions which will ensure a continuation of that state of affairs. It has been claimed that it is the thin red tie of blood and kinship that holds the component parts of the British Empire together. I do not deny the existence of this tie; but I feel impelled to emphasize that it is a very thin tie. There is a much stronger tie. It is the broad yellow tie of gold. honourable gentlemen who support the policy of the present New South Wales Government that the natural consequence of the repudiation of interest payments to bondholders is the repudiation of the liability to repay their principal to them. Vast sums of British capital have been invested in Australia, and if the time ever comes when that capital is idle, and not returning interest, and the people of this country refuse to repay the principal that is due, we shall find that the thin red tie of kinship will not be strong enough to hold us to the Empire. This, I know, is a selfish aspect of the subject; but politics is a selfish business. The longer the new members of this Parliament remain in political life the more they will realize the truth of that statement. I believe that if we do not meet our obligations the tie of kinship will be broken. The British people, in the event of our refusing to recognize the principles of commercial honesty which have always been maintained by the Mother Country, will justifiably turn round and say, "" These people are not worthy to be regarded as our kinsmen "". If that time comes, we shall no longer have the protection of the British Navy. That would mean, without any doubt, that we should not be able to maintain the White Australia policy. We should be left at the mercy of any nation which cared to attack us. I have daughters, and I have no wish to see that time come in Australia's history. We should do our utmost to fulfil our obligations to our overseas bondholders, and not place ourselves in the unfortunate position of having, possibly, to sacrifice our noble ideal of a White Australia. The fourth reason why I shall support the bill is that I do not desire the dissolution of the federal bond. It must be clear to every thinking person that if any one unit in the federation can default, or if it can, without penalty, lean heavily and illegally upon the other members of it, the future of the federation will be jeopardized. Eor these reasons and others, I shall support the bill. I wish now to refer briefly to the comments made by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) in respect of two I put it to clauses of the bill. I listened to that honourable gentleman with great interest, and am very glad that he has indicated that he does not intend to become a party hack. Although this bill was brought down by the Government which he supports, he criticized it in the light of his experience, and gave the House the benefit of his wide legal knowledge-. I sincerely hope that his example will be followed by the' other new members of this Parliament. Although the shackles of party politics are wretchedly rigid in many respects, I trust that the new members of this Parliament will not be afraid",40,Capital Leaves New South Wales
177,Mr Gander,S o do we..,41,Capital Leaves New South Wales
178,Mr Gabb,"I do not question theto express their honest opinions, even though, in doing so, they may be obliged to criticize measures introduced by the Government which they support. should not be party hacks, but should exercise our rights and privileges. listened with interest to the comments of the honourable member for Martin in respect of clauses 6 and 14, and I trust that the Government will give careful consideration to the statements which the honourable member has made in respect of the validity of those provisions. I hope that the arguments of the honourable member will be effectively rebutted, or that the Government will withdraw or recast these clavises, which are not essential to the effective administration measure. The honourable member for Martin left no doubt in my mind that there is grave danger of these two clauses being declared invalid. Unless my convictions in respect of these clauses are altered by subsequent speeches, I shall, while giving strong support to the other parts of the bill, vote against them. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. intend to take notice of the statements made by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), the honourable member for Barton( Mr the party led by the late Government lost Lane), and the honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby), who indulged against Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, beyond saying that I have known Mr Lang for many years, and those who are best acquainted with his record believe that the accusations hurled against him are unfounded. I am disappointed with the Government for bringing down this bill at the outset of the session. Having regard to their election speeches, and the posters they exhibited throughout Australia, I had hoped that they would endeavour to do something of a practical nature to alleviate the evil of unemployment which is so rampant in the community. When I noticed that amongst the visitors to Canberra on the occasion of the opening of this Parliament were Mr Sydney, be consulted with the 55 memWeaver, who is known throughout New South Wales as the rajah of Rothbury, Mr Stevens, and Mr Sammy Walder, who, like Clancy of the Overflow, ""came down to lend a hand "", I anticipated that there was trouble brewing for the Government of New South Wales. This bill was conceived in haste, born We in spleen, and is being fondled in vindictiveness, and will go out of life I unhonoured and unsung. The Prime Minister, in introducing it, spoke all round the measure, and when he saw that be had not created a good impression, he departed from the custom which, I understand, has always been followed in this Parliament, and instead of allowing the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) to follow him in the debate, asked the permission of the House for the Attorney General( Mr Latham) to explain the legal aspects of the measure. But the of the exposition given by that honourable member made the position "" as clear as mud "". Then the right honourable member for. Yarra( Mr Scullin). attacked the bill. He was in agreement with-its principles, but was opposed to some of the clauses. He proceeded to say that he had cause to regret the Lang plan, and he added that it had shattered his party. We of the Labour party of New South Wales contend that the Premiers plan shattered the very fundamental principles on which the Labour party was based, when it attacked old-age, invalid and soldier pensions. Owing to its support of that plan, all right to call itself a Labour party. in ' personal recriminations When the Premiers plan was formulated, its main object was to bring about a reduction of 22£ per cent, in governmental iexpenditure throughout the Commonwealth. Mr Lang consented to that reduction, but with a proviso. He agreed that when the Premiers returned to their respective States, they should bring about the 22^ per cent, reduction in whatever manner they thought fit. Mr Lang tried to effect that reduction, and he would have succeeded if he had had the assistattce of the Nationalists in the Legislative Council of New South Wales and of the Eederal Labour party led by Mr Coates in the New South Wales Legislative Council. Immediately on his return to bers of his party, and I speak authoritatively when I say not one of them will break away from his leadership. Mr Lang told the caucus what he had agreed to in Melbourne, and they decided that",41,Capital Leaves New South Wales
179,Mr Gander (Reid) [8.0],"I do notthey would introduce a measure in the Legislative Assembly to reduce the salaries of public servants, including the judges, the members of the Cabinet, and the members of the State Parliament to a level of £500 per annum. That measure was passed by the Legislative Assembly; but the cohorts of Nationalism in the Legislative Council mutilated the bill, described it as preposterous, and threw it out. They also said that it would be unfair to attack one section of the community in New South Wales. Then Mr Lang framed another measure providing for a tax of 5s. in the £1 on East Sydney by-election when the present the wages of every parson earning over £500 a year, and that met with a similar fate.

It is the highest wage paid in the Commonwealth, and it is give2i for a working week of 44 hours, as against 48 hours in the other States. The Labour party is proud of that achievement.

Those honourable members remain silent. When Mr the occupants of the Opposition benches; Lang refused to interfere with that payment, his opponents turned to what we of the Labour party of New South Wales regard as the most humanitarian piece of legislation ever placed on a statute book in any part of the world; I refer to the widows' pension. It has-been said that a prophet is not without honour save in his own country; but I venture to say that the time will come when the widowed mothers in New South Wales Mr Gander. will erect a monument in memory of J. T. Lang for that piece of legislation. I again ask the honourable member for Bartoni f he is in favour of cutting out the widows' pension. Mr Lang has refused to interfere with those benefits to deserving sections of the people in his State, and that is the reason why he is now unable to meet his commitments. The statement has been bandied round this chamber that the Lang plan involves repudiation. I may say that I know that plan thoroughly. It was first published to the people of New South Wales at the member for that electorate ( Mr Ward) was elected to succeed the late Mr John The Nationalists in the Upper West; yet not one word of the plan enunciated by the Premier of New South Wales can be quoted to prove that my party stands for repudiation. All it asks for is that the interest rate should be scaled down, and the repayment of debts should stand over for two years. I have no hesitation in saying that within the next two or three years, federal politicians will have to confess that the overseas interest bill of the Commonwealth cannot be met, no matter what action is taken. If Mr Lang had followed the Under the family endowdictates of the capitalistic press, and of all the powers that have fought Labour from time immemorialI refer particularly to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Sun, the-Daily Teleendowment, and cut graph and the Melbourne Age-h e Mr Lang's reply was, would have been hailed as a hero; but owing to his refusal to accept the direction of the capitalistic press, lie has ment throughout New South Wales. Every member who has spoken against this bill has talked of Mr Lang. No reference has been made to all the blame has been laid ""at the door of the little band of stalwarts who comprise the Lang group. What we may lack in numbers we make up for in sincerity, and we shall fight to see that the people of New South Wales retain what they now have, even if they cannot advance a little further. I have no intention to discuss this bill at great length. In my opinion it would be impossible to put the measure into operation. I have heard the analyses aud criticisms offered by legal men such as the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom), and the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman), who have shown the impracticability' of the measure; it would almost require the Commonwealth to install a ticket collector on every tram car. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has also pointed out that in operation the measure would be found unworkable. The Government may proceed with the bill if it wishes to do it ; but Mr Lang is not perturbed over the matter. While I am here, I will fight to retain the living conditions enjoyed by the people of New South Wales, and I trust that, after this measure has been fully debated, the Prime Minister will do the right thing, and throw it into the waste-paper basket. promise of the Prime Minister that the life of this measure will be limited to two years satisfies one of the principal objections I entertain towards it. As soon as I read the bill I wired the Premier of Western Australia, and communicated by telephone with the Acting Premier of Victoria, urging them to use all their influence to induce the Government to set a short term to the life of this legislation. It is an emergency measure dealing with the Financial Agreement. I was one of those who opposed the Financial Agreement, because I knew that the legislation of the Government of that day was tending towards unification. I am a great believer in bringing legislation and administration as near to the people as possible; it is always better and always cleaner. I am a great believer in .upholding the Constitutions, Federal and State, but I desire to ensure that no undue power is granted to the Commonwealth. It is obvious that the Government must that the Commonwealth should take take some action to recover the money action without waiting to consult the concerning which New South Wales has States, I believe ttiat, some time during defaulted. We cannot allow the matter the next two years, the representatives of to drift. I have tried to see just How this the Commonwealth and the States should bill is going to work out-wha t its result meet for the purpose of agreeing upon will be-bu t have been unable to do so. legislation which will ensure that the The Government of New South Wales agreement is carried out, yet will has repudiated its obligations, and aftersafeguard the rights of the States. In wards has had the impertinence to ask for the past we have had Commonwealth Gofurther loans, so that it«might again revernments which were only too glad to use pudiate. There is no doubt that members every power the Constitution gave them of that Government are associated politically with persons who are desirous of destroying society. Some of Mr Lang's advisers are a menace, not only to the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth, hut to the Empire itself. At the Premiers Conference Mr Lang made promises to the representatives of the other States, and one would expect a man holding his high position to do his best to honour those promises. Instead of that he has disgraced the parent State of the Commonwealth, and injured the good name of Australia. It seems difficult to believe that the man is not ""mental"". One is at a loss to assign reasons for his extraordinary conduct, and can only assume that he is being led by those whose aim it is to destroy all those ideals we love and cherish. The first part of this bill is designed, I believe, to save"" the face of the Government. No one has really auy doubt that ihe Commonwealth Government took over the debts of the States, and is responsible for them. I will not support clause 6 of this bill. In regard to it I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), because it is not right that in a matter with which it is concerned this Parliament should be both accuser and judge. The issue between a State and the Commonwealth must be determined by the High Court. I urge, however, that every action possible within the law should be taken to bring Mr Lang to heel, and compel him to honour his obligations. We must, restore fair dealing between governments within the Commonwealth. The Financial Agreement is a document signed by six sovereign States and the Commonwealth, but to the Commonwealth alone is given power to make laws to carry out the agreement. While the emergency of the present case requires",42,Capital Leaves New South Wales
180,Mr Gregory (Swan) [8.16],"TheIn dominate the States. I do not wish to see anything done to bring us nearer to unification than we are now. It should be possible to frame legislation which would not threaten a State which might find itself in temporary financial difficulty, but could be used against a recalcitrant State, such as New South Wales is to-day, for the purpose of forcing it to honour its obligations under the Financial Agreement. Clause 18 is somewhat arrogantly drawn. It provides that the Commonwealth may take possession of moneys belonging to a State, and then, if the High Court finds that such moneys are not due by the State to the Commonwealth, all the Commonwealth is compelled to do is to hand them back. It should, of course, have to pay compensation to the State for the indignity put upon it. I am glad that the Government proposes to treat this legislation as an emergency measure, and I trust that when it reaches the committee stage the Government will approve of certain amendments which I have in mind. bill is concerned with the fundamental principles of the Constitution, and for that reason is one of the most important, if not the most important, measure which has been considered by the Federal Parliament since the federation of the States'. It is liable, moreover, to have far-reaching effects. It is regrettable, however, that many speakers on the Government side have concerned themselves only with the sins of omission and commission of the Lang Government, and have contented themselves with airing their personal opinions of the present Premier of 'New South Wale's. What we have to declare now is, not our opinion of individuals, but whether we are for or . against the repudiation of debts, and, if we are opposed to repudiation, the method to he adopted to give effect to our opinions. The Government, in bringing in this bill, is making a pretence of carrying out its election promise to deal with Mr Lang. The action of the Scullin Government was not sufficiently spectacular, so the present Commonwealth Government has hit upon the present proposals. The Labour party's attitude towards repudiation has been definitelv laid down. At a conference of the Federal Labour party, held some months aero, serious consideration was given to what is known as the Lang policy. The executive decided that the platform and policy of the Australian Labour party did not include, and never had included, repudiation . of debts. The conference declared against the Lang policy, which is to refuse deliberately to pay interest on loans raised from the general public in Australia, and Great Britain. That was the considered pronouncement of the Australian Labour Party at a conference representative of every State in Australia. It may, therefore, be taken for granted that the Australian Labour Party is uncompromisingly opposed to anything in the nature of repudiation. There should not be any doubt upon the 1 matter, because the Australian Labour Party proved in unmistakable fashion during the last election that it was opposed to repudiation, when many of its members were sacrificed politically because they would not subscribe to the so called Lang plan. No portion of the overseas debt of New South Wales represents war expenditure. The Labour party believes that it is immoral to borrow money for the construction of bridges, the erection of buildings, and the building of railways, roads, and the like, and then to repudiate our obligations in respect of those debts. The railways and roads in particular represent a valuable asset belonging to the Government and to the people. They haveopened up vast areas of land, and have increased the value of the land to the primary producers and to the nation. Even if we do not pay attention to the moral aspect of the matter, and confine our consideration to what will pay us best, it will bo seen that nothing is to be gained by adopting the Lang plan. All that has resulted so far from the Lang plan has been a change of government in the federal sphere. No doubt to honourable members opposite that is satisfactory enough, but from the point of view of the Australian Labour Partyi t is not a result which would induce it? to favour the Lang plan. This plan has split the Labour party,",44,Capital Leaves New South Wales
181,Mr Baker (Oxley) [8.25],"Thisand has put into power a government opposed to all the doctrines for which the Labour party has stood. It must be obvious that if we desire to obtain concessions in regard to our overseas debts, the best way is, not to say that we will not pay, but to point out that we are in serious financial difficulties, and are deserving of some consideration at the hands of our creditors. Largely as a result of the activities of Mr Scullin when he was overseas last year, payments to the English Government amounting to £1,600,000 a year for two years have been suspended. That, sum, plus exchange amounts to a saving of over £2,000,000 for the financial year ending 30th June next, and a similar sum for the following financial year. Also as a result of the Hoover moratorium, a payment of £3,920,000, which was due by Australia during this financial year, was suspended, but at the same time' we lost aii amount of £830,000 due to us in respect of German reparations. This nation, therefore, benefited to the net extent of £3,090,000. arrangements were come to by agreement, not by holding a pistol to the heads of nations whose population is ten or twenty times as much as ours. Let me quote the words of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) in his book Money Power, written over ten years ago. Referring to our interest obligations overseas, then approximately £40,000,000 per annum, which sum is considerably less than our present commitments, he saidWhile that exists even the Socialist State would he a mere collecting agent for the holders of the £800,000,000 blister on Australian industry, and so iong as Great Britain stands upon her legs and her navies float upon the seas, so long must Australia's obligations to British financiers be met, irrespective of the character of Australian Governments or the composition of her industries. Repudiation, so easy to say, would impose upon the country economic difficulties and boycotts as burdensome as the load of interest from which it was sought, to escape. If any proof is needed that GreatB r it a in and the TJnited States of America would have taken action either by economic boycott or by military measures to enforce the interest payments due to them, let me remind honourable members that questions have recently been asked in the legislatures of both those countries respecting the non-payment of interest by the Government of New South Wales, and subsequently by the -Eederal Government. Eveni f armed force were not resorted to, reprisals of any kind would prejudice Australia, because this is a primary producing nation. We have, therefore, to realize that the Premier of New South Walesi n challenging all the forces of capitalism is merely making a theatrical gesture unworthy of much attention. Money power knows no boundaries, and tbe bondholders overseas w ill make sure that they get their pound of flesh. I am convinced that before long all nations will have to come to an arrangement with regard to the cancellation, or at least H substantial reduction of debts. That is tbe attitude of the members of the Australian Labour Party, and it has frequently been advocated in this House by Mr Theodore, an ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth. The action of the Federal Government in repudiating the debt due to overseas bondholders was foolish and unfortunate for this nation. These Professing that it would never repudiate, it repudiated. It. has been contended that this Government was not legally liable. But though, technically, it may not have been legally liable, there is no doubt that it was morally at faul t in not meeting the debt which the Premier of New South Wales refused to pay on behalf of that State. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) stated in reply to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Scullin:If the right honourable gentleman says that we owe it to the States to meet these payments, I entirely agree with him. There is no doubt whatever, that the good name of tha Commonwealth was at stake. Whatever may have been the exact legal position, there is no doubt that the Commonwealth has led every one to believe that it was liable to meet these payments. Yet the right honourable gentleman is the Assistant Treasurer in the very Government which did not meet these interest payments when they were due. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham), referring to the previous default saidNo very real or permanent impression was produced on the public mind. It is important in .the interests of Australia as a whole, tliat such an imprcssiion should be produced upon the public mind in relation to the significance of deliberate default by a government. Undoubtedly, and unfortunately, a very real and permanent impression has been produced upon the public mind, not only bere, but also overseas, by the action of the Federal Government, which, beyond all governments, said that it could not even consider under the Constitution. It may be conthe possibility of default. The attitude of members of the Country party and of certain supporters of the Government is interesting, and can be best described in the words of Pope, when he spoke of those whoDamn witli faint praise, Assent with civil leer, And, without sneering, Teach the rest to sneer. They have criticized aud condemned'the bill, and have suggested amendments. Then they have said that they will support the bill whether the suggested amendto prevent them from appearing before ments are inserted in it or not. would ne'er consent, consented. though opposed to any refusal to pay debts, does not agree with the action of this Government. The Commonwealth Constitution is nn act of the Britisli Parliament, and our powers under it are clearly defined. The British Parliament has absolute power by legislation to do anything that is humanly possible, but the Federal Parliament is in a different position. We are tied hand and foot by the Constitution; the powers which the various State Governments of Australia possess arc not clearly defined; and are similar to those conferred upon any independent nation under its constitution. In that respect we differ from Canada, the Dominion Government of which has power to overrule the provincial governments regarding their laws. Therefore, this Parliament has to be particularly circumspect when dealing with matters affecting the Constitution. The powers of this Parliament are limited in another regard. Our Constitution is founded to a large extent upon tlie Constitution of the United States of America, and similarly Commonwealth powers are divided into three classes-legislative , executive, and judiciary. which is defined as ""judicial "" cannot be exercised by this Parliament. That is another handicap to the Federal Government. The High Court, as the guardian of the Constitution, has absolute power to upset any act of this Parliament which is in any way beyond the powers given to us in black and white tended that federal legislation is not often upset in the High Court, but that is for two reasons: first, the Federal Parliament, in considering legislation, endeavours, or should endeavour, to keep within its limitations; and, secondly, any legislation of this Parliament cannot be upset uutil proved, to be unconstitutional by an action in the High Court. That, of course, means much expense. In the great majority of cases in which individuals are concerned, the expense of litigation would be sufficient the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of any particular measure. Another aspect which I do not think has been stressed in this Parliament is that any act of the Federal Parliament which is upset by the High Court becomes null and void ab initio On page 24 of the text book, The Law of the Australian Constitution, written by Mr Kerr, paragraph 41 statesThe result of tlie declaration by the Court that a statute is unconstitutional is that the statute is "" as if it had never been "". No rights can be acquired nor liabilities imposed under it, at any time, either as between the Commonwealth and the individual, or as between individuals, and whether before or after the declaration of constitutionality, lt is void ab initio. Paragraph 42 statesWhen the court declares a statute to be unconstitutional, it does not annul, or repeal the unconstitutional statute, it simply refuses to recognize it . aud determines the rights oi parties just as if such statute had no existence. I have quoted those two paragraphs to emphasize the fact that if at any time this legislation is upset by the High Court, the Commonwealth Government may be met with a considerable number of claims for compensation during the time that the measure was in force. Honourable members will recollect the attempt to deport Any power Messrs. Walsh and Johnson. The High Court decided that the Commonwealth had no power to deport those men; thereupon they sued the Federal Government aud were awarded substantial compensation. The Commonwealth had also to pay",45,Capital Leaves New South Wales

Clause 10 of this bill jreadsA person shall not, from and after the date fixed hy Proclamation, and during the currency of the Proclamation,' pay to any person, other than tlie Treasurer or an authorized person, auy moneys owing by the person to the State, which, if received by oi on behalf of the State, would have formed part of the specified revenue of that State. and Clause 12 providesAny Minister of, or officer or person employed by, a State, who(u.) receives, directs or permits the receipt of any moneys by or on behalf of a State the payment of which would be a contravention of the provisions of this Act; or (b) gives, or offers to give to any person any indemnity in respect of the payment to or on behalf of the State of any moneys the payment of which to the State would he a contravention of those provisions, shall he guilty of an offence. TheH i g h Court may declare that those who have been penalized under this legislation have suffered through bad law, and thereupon the Federal Government will have to pay compensation. There is a legal maxim that every man is presumed to know the law, but that is based on the assumption that the legislature has made the law clear so that no person may be in doubt as to its meaning Possibly many taxpayers who may be instructed under this legislation to pay their taxes to the Federal Government will dotibt the validity of the federal law; they w ill not know whether to obey it or the State law, and whatever they do they may eventually be liable to a penalty.

If a Commonwealth Government so chooses, it can. act under clause 6 only, and disregard entirely clause 5. The Commonwealth is claiming the right to be both plaintiff and judge, and that attitude is not likely to increase the popular estimation ot the law. This legislation would enable a government with a majority in both chambers of this Parliament, to discriminate against a particular State. The Senate was intended by the framers of tht Constitution to be the defender ot State rights, but history has shown that on important matters the Senate is as much a party chamber as is the House of Bepresentatives. There is no reason to doubt that senators will vote on this h ill according to their party adherence, and regardless of the welfare of the-States they are supposed to represent. The promise of tbe Prime Minister that the duration of the bill would be limited to two years suggests that it is intended to operate only while Mr Lang's Government is in power in New South Wales, but on that point the honourable gentleman differs from his colleague, the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), who said I hope that the House will regard this bill as a non-party measure, designed not merely 5 for a passing emergency, but for all time.

Their direct remedies remained against the States to whom they respectively originally lent. Surely that raises the doubt as to the liability of the Commonwealth. That opinion was given long before this Government raised the doubt. obligation of the Government. The honourable gentleman misinterprets the language. phasizing that from the beginning there was a doubt, and that this Government was not the first to raise it .

' of that power, but I point out that it differs vitally from other agreements. In ordinary circumstances default by a party to an agreement may determine the contract, but the Commonwealth Government could not adopt that attitude with regard to the Financial Agreement. The failure on the part of a State to carry out its obligation would not enable the Commonwealth to terminate that agreement as between itself and the States, as the other parties have to be considered. The Goverument that a wide interpretation of the powers to which I have referred is necessary in order to give it authority to insist that the States shall carry out their part of the bargain. The Government has no doubt that, taking section J05A (3) in conjunction with section 51 (xxxix) of the Constitution, it has definite legal sanction to provide the power that it is now taking. Apart from the validity of the legislation, the Leader of the Opposition asks whether it is a proper use of that power, and he definitely said that it offends the principle that no man may be both judge and accuser in his own cause. I believe that he has clause 6 in his mind, and I find his reasoning difficult to follow. I can only assume that he is confusing the various arms of the Commonwealth authority; the Parliament, the Executive, and the Auditor-General. Eveni f it were provided in clause 6, as it is in clause 5, that application must be made to the High Court, we should merely bring in one other arm of the Commonwealth authority, the judiciary, and the same objection would still lie. ing. the honourable gentleman's reasoning a step further. The Auditor-General, who occupies an independent position, gives the necessary certificate, and the two Houses of Parliament are called upon to pass the resolution. approval is obtained no further action can be taken. The Government recognizes that there may be some objection to the course that is proposed under clause 6. Honourable The agreement may seem a wide exercise members have made suggestions whereby that clause may be improved, and, in an endeavour to safeguard the interests of the States, the Government proposes to amend the clause when the committee stage is reached, and make it mandatory for the Commonwealth to make an application to the court within a reasonable time. The whole object of the provision was to save time. It, is recognized that the Commonwealth cannot wait months in order to recover sums it has paid on behalf of a defaulting State. There may be_ special is advised, therefore, reasons which make it essential for the Commonwealth to take prompt action for the recovery of the amounts involved. Tho Commonwealth Government has no desire to inflict an injustice on any State, and the amendment that I have forecast, in addition to making it mandatory for the Commonwealth to make application within a reasonable time after the certificate has been granted and the necessary resolutions carried, makes it possible for the State concerned to apply to the court. In those circumstances there can surely be no objection to the clause. the court for a stay of proceedings? its application to the court, and that will be dealt with on its merits, exactly as though, the Commonwealth Government had made the application. That should meet the objection that was raised by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) in connection with clause 6. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country party, both suggested that we should provide remedies for the States against Commonwealth default. To do so in this bill would have no real effect, for if a Commonwealth Government defaulted it could promptly repeal any legislation which might adversely affect its position. Only a constitutional provision would be of any value in the case of Commonwealth default; the States would not be safeguarded by any legislative provision. But. according to the advice which we have Until their joint received, the States are already in a positionto take action to protect themselves in ' the case of Commonwealth default.",50,Capital Leaves New South Wales

198,Mr Lyons,"The State may makecorporated in the agreement the States would be in a better position.. gentleman can suggest any provision which would really safeguard the States against Commonwealth default, the Government will consider it ; but legislative provision manifestly would be of little value, because a defaulting Commonwealth Government could repeal it. apply to the whole of Part II . of the bill ? be held to be a law imposing taxation, Commonwealth Government is not prepared to accept liability it could cause that part of the bill to be repealed; but it would have to do so in the face of the opposition of the people of Australia. Whatever legal construction may be put upon the provisions of the Einancial Agreement, there is no doubt that the peojrte regard the Commonwealth as being liable. Notwithstanding what has been said during this debate, the States are in no real clanger, for the Senate may be trusted to look after State interests. The Leader of the Country party suggested that the bill should be subdivided, and that the provisions for the acceptance of liability by the Commonwealth should be included in a separate measure. There are some advantages in making in one measure a declaration of our acceptance of the liability, and, in another, providing in the event of the States failing in their payments for the recovery by the Commonwealth of the amounts due. We recognize too that there is the possibility that this legislation may be attacked from one stand-point or another. It might be confusing and misleading if in the case of an attack upon the provision authorizing the Commonwealth to recover, an impression were created overseas as well as in Australia, that the power of the Commonwealth to accept liability was being attacked. Such a misunderstanding might damage the credit of Australia. The Government is, therefore, accepting the suggestion that the provisions of the present bill be dealt with in two separate measures. We propose to ask, in the committee stage, that clause 4, which is Part II . of the bill, be struck-out with a view to its re-introduction as a separate bill. Our first procedure in committee, ^herefore, will be to strike out Part II . and re-introduce, in a separate bill, provisions for the acceptance of liability by the Commonwealth. That having been done, we shall proceed with our consideration of the other portions of the bill. The Government does not think that there is any real substance iu the other argument used by the Leader of the Country party in favour of the subdivision of the bill, to the effect that the whole measure might and that such a decision might invalidate it. We aro advised that the power which is being sought is derived wholly from section 105A (3), and is entirely separate from any. taxing power of the Commonwealth. This measure could not therefore be invalidated on'that ground. Another suggestion made by the Leader of the Country party had relation to the attaching of revenue in the hands of taxpayers. The right honourable gentleman expressed a doubt whether the taking of that action, rather than the attaching of revenue at the central point of collection, might not cause injustice to be done to individuals who were ignorant of the existence of any default on the part of a State, or of any action taken by the Commonwealth to recover. The Government gave full consideration to this matter during the preparation of the bill, and felt that the course it proposes to take was safer and more desirable than that suggested by the Leader of the Country party. Bu.t in order to avoid any possibility of an injustice being done to individual taxpayers through their ignorance, it is proposed, in committee, to introduce an amendment to meet that objection. clause be inserted? the Commonwealth Treasurer a discretionary power. He will be able to satisfy himself before any action is taken against an individual that the person concerned acted in ignorance, and not in spite of knowledge. Such discretion must be reposed in some authority, and it is felt that the Commonwealth Treasurer is the proper person in whom to repose it.",51,Capital Leaves New South Wales

204,Mr Lyons,"It is proposed to giveAnother fear that has been expressed is that the Commonwealth Government, in the exercise of its power, might attach funds deposited with banking or financial institutions by government contractors who retained the right to collect such funds under certain conditions, and at certain times. Provision will also be made in committee to meet that objection. Still another suggestion made by the Leader of the Country party was that before any action was taken in Parliament, pursuant to this legislation, a resolution should be passed by the Loan Council that action should be taken. I have no doubt that the right honourable member desires such a provision in order to safef uard the interests of the States. The tates need have no fear whatever that the Commonwealth will act against any State which is honouring its obligations. I am satisfied that when the representatives of the States thoroughly understand this legislation, any fear that they may have in that regard will be dissipated. The interests of the States are already thoroughly safeguarded. But while the Government feels that it is not right to bring the Loan Council into an action against a defaulting State, it is prepared to consult the States with a view to providing safeguards. I take it that no Oommonwealth Government would act against a State unless it was satisfied that the States loan moneys raised by the the default was deliberate. We shall introduce an amendment with the object of limiting the duration of this measure for two years, and in the meantime we shall confer with the representatives of the States on the Loan Council with the object of ascertaining whether there are any satisfactory safeguards which could be inserted in this legislation, reserving to the Commonwealth full and complete power to enforce compliance with the terms of'the Financial Agreement. That does not mean that it will be two years before any proposals which the States may make can be incorporated in this legislation. I am sure that it will be generally realized that the relations between the Commonwealth and State representatives not only in respect of this Government, but in respect of previous governments in recent years, have heen most friendly. There has been no antagonism whatever. The States Mr Tjj/ons. recognize that so long as they are fairly complying with their undertakings they have no need to fear any Commonwealth action. After all, the Commonwealth and the States represent exactly the same taxpayers, and there is no reason why there should be any conflict of interests. A provision limiting the life of the measure to two years will ensure that within that period this legislation will be re-submitted to Parliament' in the light of practical experience. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) expressed concern lest the proposed notice of three days should be insufficient. Clause5 provides that after the gazettal of a certificate from the Auditor-General application may be made to the High Court upon not less than three days' notice. From the time when a certificate of the Auditor-General is gazetted, a great deal of publicity will doubtless be given to any proceedings that are contemplated. But in any case, there is nothing to prevent the High Court, if it feels that insufficient notice has been given, granting an adjournment in order that any injustice in that respect may be remedied. The honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) and another honourable member raised a doubt as to the power of the Commonwealth to withhold from Commonwealth for them for the purposes of public works. The Government has taken special care to investigate the validity of the measure from every angle. It has been considered by the law officers of the Crown, and the advice of eminent outside counsel has also been obtained. The Government has been advised by three constitutional authorities, in turn, that the validity of this clause would be upheld. I can say no more than that the Government has gone to the highest constitutional authorities in order to obtain advice before bringing down this bill, and the Government is supported by those authorities in the action it has taken On the merits of the case, I would point out that the various Governments of New South Wales have borrowed large sums of money for carrying out public works, and the present State Government now finds that it is unable to pay the interest on the sums so borrowed. In recent years the Commonwealth Government has been the channel through which these borrowings have taken place. Is it reason^ able that a government that admits that it cannot and will not pay the interest due on the sums already borrowed, should now ask the Commonwealth Government to borrow on its behalf further millions on which it would surely be unable to pay interest? In private transactions, would a citizen_have any hope of borrowing even the smallest sum under such circumstances ? If tlie Financial Agreement were not in existence to-day, and each State were compelled to do its own borrowing, how would the Government of New South Wales fare in seeking further large sums from those from whom millions have been borrowed in the past, should it declare its inability to pay the interest due? It is against common sense to suggest that the Commonwealth Government^ as the borrowing agency, should raise further millions for a State that will not pay its interest. ter suggest closing down the State of New South Wales? Government of that State should carry Out the promise made to the last Commonwealth Government and to the Loan Council, to accept responsibility for payment of the interest due on its debts. knows full well that the Government of New South Wales undertook, in common with the other States, to reduce its expenLane, A. diture; but it has not done so. When it carries out that undertaking, it will be in a position to meet its obligations, and when it has paid the interest now due, it will be justified in asking for further loans to be raised on its giving an undertaking to pay the interest. There is no escape from the fact that the Government of New South Wales says to the Commonwealth Government, as the borrower, "" We will not pay interest on the sums which we have already borrowed, ancl which you have raised for us; yet we desire you to raise more money for us"". Therefore, there is one straightforward thing for the New South Wales Government to do, and when it has done that, it will be in a position to pay flip interest ou the money that has been borrowed already on its behalf, and to claim further amounts. In view of all the circumstances, it is only fair to the people of the Oommonwealth generally that some brake should be put on the borrowing powers of New South Wales. By doing that, the Commonwealth Government is acting in the interests of the Government and of the people of that State. Question-That the bill be now read a second time-put .

It can be argued successfully, I think, that that portion of the bill covered by clause 4 is not necessary. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has said as much and with that opinion I also agree. In my opinion, the method proposed by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) tends to confuse honourable members rather than to assist them.

The speech with which His Excellency the Governor General opened the present session stated that the Government looked to private enterprise to absorb a large number of the unemployed. In the Premiers plan provision was made for allotting £10,000,000 annually for the purwhich vitally affects one of the SLtates, pose of paying the dole; but that expenditure has now reached £12,000,000, ancl it will not be long before £13,00.0,000 will be needed. How long will it be before private enterprise will shoulder the responsibility which this Government has placed upon it? The unfortunate men in the Federal Capital Territory, whom the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr fidence? When the present Minister Parkhill) having been forced to come here because they cannot obtain work elsewhere, are now to be hunted out of the Territory into New South Wales. The Minister says that it is the responsibility of the Government of New South Wales to feed them. Some of these men have come from such distant places as Bourketown, on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Surely men who walk from one end of Australia to the other are entitled to assistance from any government, particularly when the people along the road have supplied them with food. Is the feeding of our unemployed to be done hy private citizens? If it is not the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to feed men who are temporary residents in this Territory, whose duty is it? What are the prospects of the youths of this country? What encouragement has been given to them? We were told that if the party opposed to the Labour party were returned at the last general election confidence would be restored. Since this Government was elected, it has not done anything. The Minister for Home Affairs said, shortly after the election, that prompt action would be taken to deport Communists. That was what the [10.11] -The point Bruce-Page Government said it would do with Walsh and Johnson; but I understand that the former is now the organizing secretary of the TJnited Australia Party, and that Mrs. Walsh is also associated with that party.

It is the responsibility of the Government to announce its policy with respect to unemployment.

What is the attitude of the National Government to our workless youths? I notice that the Auditor General in his latest report states that the reductions of old-age and invalid pensions have not been sufficient; that further sacrifices should be required of the aged and helpless, and that the maternity allowance should be discontinued. What right has any public servant to dictate to Parliament? Although the Government has had ample time to evolve a policy for the relief of the unemployed, it has concentrated its attention on a bill to compel New South Wales to pay interest on its debts, and on another measure to collect deposits from insurance companies in that .

Tho Government may say that the relief of the travelling unemployed is not a federal responsibility, but the Oommonwealth Government should strain all its resources to give relief to all Australian citizens.

AfterI became a MinisterI was presented weekly with the request that the issue of rations to these unemployed be extended, and I consented for several weeks. At last, however, in fairness to the general community, and particularly the residents of the Eederal Capital Territory, I took certain definite steps. I found that, by some means, a number of these men had become enrolled for the last election for the Eederal Capital Territory Advisory Council. I placed those men on the citizens' relief list; but the remainder of those who are in this camp Many of them are of'the same age as the honourable member. 21 years of age. was at the camp yesterday and saw the men who were there; consequently I speak with a knowledge of the subject. I doubt whether the honourable member has ever been to the camp. able member has had an opportunity to make his complaint with reference to the unemployed in the Federal Capital Territory. The Minister is replying to his statements, and must be heard in silence. was pointing out that a number of these men were placed on the roll for relief, them while the remainder were notified that ment? they should proceed on their way. That is the arrangement which is adopted in all the States. true. They were told that, if they refor Hunter( Mr James) that the telemained at the camp, they did so on their phone matters to which he has drawn own responsibility. The honourable mem: attention will be investigated. ber for East Sydney( Mr Ward) asked me if they would be allowed to stay there so long as they obtained their livelihood in the district. I say to him quite frankly that the Government is not pre.pared to maintain in this Territory a permanent camp for unemployed, so that anybody who came along, whether from New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania or any other State, might demand the right to remain in it, and expect the Government to feed him. Once that principle was accepted there would be in the Federal Capital Territory an army of unemployed whose wants it would he beyond the ability of this Government to attend. The men in this camp have placed one of their number, in charge of it, and have adopted rules governing its conduct, without consideration for anybody else. They attempt to dictate as to who shall go there and who shall not. In a sense, they have made of it a little township of their own. That was not the .desire even of the last Government. The question is merely one of enforcing a reasonable arrangement, such as is enforced in all the States. Week after week rations have been issued to these men, on the understanding that they I would move on. They have declined to do so, because they have in this House advocates who are constantly urging additional expenditure on their behalf. I have done all that any reasonable man could do. I have treated these men with the utmost generosity-wit h a great deal more generosity than they would have received from any State Government. This Government will not be recreant to the duty that has been entrusted to it, to deal fairly and squarely with all sections of the community. These people have been treated generously as well as justly. to remain under the same conditions that were observed by the last Governand Treasurer) [10.40] -On behalf of the Postmaster-General( Mr Fenton) I Question resolved in the affirmative.
