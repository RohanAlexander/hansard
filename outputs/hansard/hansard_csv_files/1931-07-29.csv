Any action recommended by the conference will, if necessary, be referred to this Parliament. -GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OP NEW .SOUTH WALES.. Minister whether the Goyernmefnt endorses the demands made by Sir Robert Gibson upon the Government of New South Wales, in regard to the taking over of the State savings bank by the Commonwealth Bank? Commonwealth Bank is in charge of that institution, and has the responsibility of negotiating an agreement with the commissioners of the Government Sayings Bank of New South Wales. In these negotiations the Government does not interfere, but an amalgamation of the two institutions cannot be effected without the consent of the Commonwealth Treasurer, which means the consent of the Commonwealth Government. business transaction, and the intricate banking arrangements involved, and the consideration of assets to be taken over and liabilities to be assumed, are not the responsibility of the Government. able to state the terms submitted by the Commonwealth Bank Board to the Government of New South Wales, with respect to the taking over by the Commonwealth Bank of the State Savings Bank? By way of explanation, let me state that, according to the newspaper reports, the terms seem to be rather harsh -Order! An honourable member cannot be permitted to make observations when asking a question. submit to the House the actual proposals of the Commonwealth Bank Board for the absorption of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales?

State savings banks with the Commonwealth Bank' is a matter for arrangement between the respective governments concerned. The terms of the suggested agreement must -be submitted first to the State Government controlling the savings bank which it is proposed shall be amalgamated.

Regarding the second part of the This is wholly a honourable member's question, we cannot lay down any fixed rules for amalgamation, or say that the same conditions.shall apply in all cases. I absolutely deny that, in regard to the negotiations between the bank authorities, I have taken any but an impartial attitude. I point out that the financial advisers and experts of the Commonwealth Bank would have to treat every proposal for amalgamation on its merits. answer to a question, the Prime Minister stated that he would invite the various State departments to submit to the Premiers Conference a list of works for the absorption of the unemployed.

When it was set down, it was thought that f500,000 would be the total expenditure of the year; but it is now suggested that the expenditure could be reduced. The whole matter must come up for discussion by the Loan Council before a conclusion is arrived at, but eventually the item may be reduced to a much greater extent than is suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker). be taken out of loan funds? Government proposes to provide its quota for this work out of revenue, but the State governments concerned require money from the Loan Council in order to pay their quota. The whole matter must be determined by the Loan Council. I assure honourable members that the Commonwealth Government will not pay more than its quota, and, if the amount provided in this item is more than sufficient, only what is necessary will be expended. If the other governments are in favour of £500,000 being expended, the Commonwealth Government will require the amount set out in this item. hope that the Government will not favourably consider any proposal to whittle down this vote. Although the sum of £380,000 Avas mentioned recently at a conference of representatives of the States concerned, many other works are associated with the river Murray water scheme. There are, for example, isolated locks, upon which money must be expended. I am rather surprised that a representasacrifice in order to balance government tive from South Australia, who has shown such a keen interest in the development of the Murray Valley, should have brought forward a proposal to reduce this amount. If any proposal is submitted to the Premiers Conference in connection with expenditure on works of a constructional nature along the river Murray, it should be for the increasing of the amount. Such work is of a developmental nature, and will provide employment. item contemplates that the economies effected in Commonwealth expenditure shall be used during this financial year for the discharge of the Commonwealth's obligations in connection with this work, although in previous years the Commonwealth Government has met this and other such obligations out of loan funds. It seems to me to be quite wrong that the capital cost of important national works should be financed out of what are really wage reductions and economies effected at the expense of those who are entitled to a normal income. viding work. the money being provided out of the f.anital resources of the country, the work is to be paid for by the diminution of the earnings of the public servants. It is important that this Parliament should realize that that practice represents an entire change on the part of this Government in the method of financing important public works. Previous governments have discharged the cost of the river Murray development scheme out of loan funds. This Government is faced with the obligation of continuing that work, otherwise the whole of the investment will be lost, and it is providing its share of this year's obligations, not out of loan funds, as hitherto, but practically out of economies effected at the expense of pensioners and of the servants of the Crown. I rose to point out this fact, so that the country may recognize that not only are the workers required to make an absolute budgets, but their sacrifice is also being used as a contribution to the capital of the country. They should be entitled to draw interest on the amount involved just as any ordinary capitalist who financed a loan for the purpose of carrying out the work would be entitled to do so.

Honourable members opposite have no scruplo about taking 2s. 6d. from the weekly earnings of old-age and invalid pensioners, in order to build the Hume Weir, and this Parliament, and this country, ought to recognize at last that the pensioners and public servants have had their incomes reduced in order to provide the means whereby this and other important ' national works shall be financed. That is the truth. This money is being found out of revenue, and has been provided by effecting a reduction of public expenditure. However much honourable members opposite would like to evade the fact, the truth is that this department will now cost the nation £90,000 a year less for administration. a very good thing. vernment is spending £120,000 out of revenue to meet the capital cost of this Important work, not for the purpose of balancing the budget. When honourable members opposite were in power, they would have borrowed that £120,000, and paid 0 per cent, interest on it in perpetuity. That is the programme and policy which they put into effect. This Government is not following that procedure. It has reduced the wages of public servants and the allowances of invalid and old-age pensioners, and is using the money so saved to carry out this work.

The honourable member said that the last Government would have borrowed money at 6 per cent., but surely he does not suggest that the present Government should do the same. At any rate, it would not be possible for us to borrow money for this purpose. money should be borrowed. I approved of the emergency currency proposal, of which the Prime Minister also approved. proposal was introduced in the form of a bill, it was rejected in another place. The honourable member has no right to say that we are unnecessarily cutting down wages and pensions, when he knows that our proposal for obtaining credits by a fiduciary issue was defeated in the Senate. If he wishes to give expression to his opinions, he should at least stick to facts.

I do not know whether the statements of the honourable member are based on information supplied to him by an employee of the dockyard; but his remarks are diametrically opposed to the best interests of the country, and of the men engaged at the dockyard. If all public works were regarded as involving a waste of money, the workers employed in connection with them would have to be placed on the dole. Are we to stop all government works throughout Australia because of the cry that . money is scarce? That would mean placing Australia at the mercy of overseas countries, because it would be necessary to import almost everything we need from countries that have no Consideration for Australia. Eeference has been made to a vessel purchased by the New Zealand Government, but no shipbuilding organization in any part of the world can do better work than that turned out in Australia. Vessels built at Cockatoo Island challenge comparison with any constructed elsewhere. home to the Old Country won the admiration of the British Navy. public man, particularly members of the National Parliament, should take a pride in shipbuilding activity in Australia, and do everything to encourage it, so that this skilled work may be-available to the rising generations. Owing to our geographical position, we should bend all our energies to the development, to its fullest extent, of the shipbuilding industry. I admit that ship construction is of vital importance to Australia, and every member favours the building of vessels in this country, the cost of the work has to be considered, and, in my opinion, tenders should be called for. The Government has adopted the policy of giving Cockatoo Island Dockyard all the work that it can do at whatever price it likes to charge. It is well known in New South Wales, and particularly in Sydney, that this dockyard charges more for its work than any other shipbuilding yard in New South Wales. agree that the work put into the cruiser referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) compared more than favourably with that in any other unit of the British fleet. But, as a member of the royal commission that inquired into the operations at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard-the honourable member for Wentworth was also a member of the commissionI have no hesitation in saying that the charges made at that yard are altogether excessive. AlthoughI do not approve of importing ships from overseas, because I believe that we can build them locally, I claim that tenders should be called to give private enterprise a chance to compete. Such a policy would meet the objection raised by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) to the throwing of workmen out of employment, because no less employment would be available if the work were carried out by private firms. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard enjoys many advantages that are denied to private companies; it pays no rates or taxes. I could give the Minister specific instances in which excessive charges have been made by that dockyard. The highest price tendered by a private firm for the overhauling of launches for the Quarantine Department was about £200, but, under instructions from the Government, the vessels were sent to Cockatoo Island, and the charge amounted to over £S00. If an industry can live only Hy unsound bolstering of this character, it should be closed. I believe in giving to our workmen all the jobs they can do, but as a check on extravagance, private engineering yards should have an opportunity to tender for the construction of ships. The Government should not continue to pay to Cockatoo Island dockyard prices far in excess of those at which private enterprise-could do the work. ringah) [3.31] I did not suggest that anything should be done to jeopardize the lives of those engaged in the lighthouse service.

If Australian workmen are as competent as the honourable member Beasley) has stated, why should a vessel produced by them cost £50,000 more than ; the price at which a similar ship could be manufactured abroad and brought to Australia? I refer to the quotations of Harland and Wolff, of Belfast, and other shipbuilders iu the United Kingdom. Had the order for the ship been placed abroad, £50,000 would have been saved to provide reproductive work for the unemployed. I regard the dole as a pernicious system which, if continued long enough, will undermine the stamina of our people. ceives a dole. honourable member for East Sydney( Mr for this work. The need for such a light Ward) should know all about the dole, because he was receiving it before he enhouses; but we are told that no money tered this Parliament. The reckless waste of public money that is incidental to the construction of vessels at exorbitant costs is of no advantage to the Commonwealth, and in the last resort does riot benefit the workers, although it provides temporary employment for a limited number of them. When the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) speaks of the price at which vessels could be bought overseas, does he take into account the fact that light cost? in buying abroad we part with the purchase money for all time, whereas, when expense would not be very great.

I remind the honourable member for Warringah that a previous government induced artisans to leave their ordiCockatoo and Walsh Islands, it was generally admitted that five of the warships built in those yards were constructed better and more quickly than they could have been produced elsewhere. Unfortunately, the workers who were infor West Sydney( Mr duced to give up their half-paid-for homes in other parts in order to take work at Walsh Island have been thrown out of employment through the closing down of the shipbuilding yards. The statement that ships cannot be built as well in Australia as elsewhere is so much humthat. ence to be drawn from some of the remarks made this afternoon.

Only a few weeks ago I again urged the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) to provide money for this work, but my representations were not successful.

The adequate lighting of the coast for the protection of shipping is a Commonwealth responsibility; but, because only those who are concerned in the navigation of ships realize the danger of a long stretch of unlighted coast, the proposed, work has never been sanctioned. I honestly fear that a serious disaster may occur through the absence of a light on the east coast of King Island, and the various governments which have refused to provide it will have to share the responsibility. am not surprised at the disloyal utterances of tlie honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill). He stated that, before I entered this House, I was receiving the dole. Many honourable and worthy people are forced, by circumstances over which they have no control, to accept the dole. able member for Warringah, who attacks the recipients of the dole, forgets the more fortunate circumstances of bis own career. Not everybody is afforded the opportunity to accept a large sum of money, as a reward for staying out of public life temporarily I should like from the Minister for Ts the honourable member for East Sydney in order in discussing a matter that has no relation to the Estimates now before the committee? The honourable member for East Sydney is quite in order in replying should not have been made;, but I ask him to dispose of it briefly. pursue the matter further. 'The remarks of honourable members opposite regarding ship-building in Australia are in keeping with their past utterances and actions. They say that they believe in Australian workmen being given the work that they are capable of doing; but we know that that is on the condition that our workers shall accept the low standards of living of the Chinese coolies, or of the workers of other cheap labour countries. They are not prepared to allow the Australian workmen to enjoy at least a decent standard of living. yard is the only dock in Australia capable of docking the largest naval vessels on the Australian station. Many of the employees at that dockyard are highly skilled, some of them having had special training overseas. These patriots on the other side of the chamber, who are so greatly concerned about the finances of the country, are anxious to have work sent overseas to be done under cheap labour conditions, irrespective of the fact that we should thus deprive many of our highly skilled and other workers of their means of employment. Honourable members opposite did not hesitate to call upon these men to defend Australia and the Empire during the war, but now that this country is not in danger of invasion, they are asking them to bear more than their fair share of sacrifice in the general plan of rehabilitation, by depriving them of work, and giving it to the workmen of low-wage countries.

If that is true, 1 consider that the treatment of the returned soldier occupant was altogether too harsh. The Government, as a landlord, can afford to be lenient. I am informed that a private landlord, to meet the altered financial circumstances of his tenant who was purchasing his home on instalments, reduced not only the payments per fortnight, but also the interest rate.

Moreover, it should be remembered that a saving of £19,000 odd will be effected in exchange by keeping the money here. It is essential that we should maintain a naval dockyard in good order in Australia, not only for effecting repairs to our own ships of war, but also for giving attention to visithibit foreign built ships from engaging ing naval ships. It is quite possible that the maintenance of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard is a matter that might come within the purview of the League of Nations underthe special category of British Empire Naval Forces. At any rate, so long as we maintain a navy in these waters we must also maintain a dockyard. In my opinion, the expenditure of this money in Australia is justified. If the question arose again whether we should build a ship here or abroad, I would vote for it to be built here. port this item. I am hot surprised that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) and his colleagues arc opposed to it, for they have shown a callous indifference to the welfare of the men who go down to the sea in ships. The honourable member would doubtless like to see all the money that we have for shipbuilding spent abroad. Perhaps he would like to see it spent in the shipbuilding yards of Hong Kong, where Chinese coolie labour is employed. orable member knows very well that that is not correct. Mf. JAMES -It is regrettable that the shipbuilding industry of Australia has been allowed to languish. The Government should do everything in its power to stimulate this industry. Work should be provided for the Walsh Island Dockyard, as well as the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Many of my constituents work there in normal times. Hundreds of skilled mechanics, iron workers, and men trained in ship-building are on the dole, because of the lack of encouragement to this industry. I believe that all the ships which trade on our coast should be built in Australia. The expenditure of the £36,000 necessary to complete the vessel under discussion is justifiable in every respect. The Government should prohibit vessels built overseas from trading on the Australian coast. I understand that this policy is -enforced by the Government of the United States of America. We have placed a prohibitive duty on iron, steel, and certain other products, and there is no real reason why we should not proin our coastal trade. The building of the cruiser Adelaide proved conclusively that Australian workmen can build' ships equal to those built in any other part of the world. The workmen of Walsh Island are just as efficient as those of other dockyards in Australia. I do not place the workmen in one part of Australia on a higher plane than the workmen in other parts of it. We should encourage shipbuilding in Australia wherever it can be carried on. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has referred to the administration of the War Service Homes Department. I believe that a comprehensive inquiry should be made into that subject. Money has been wasted, and many returned soldiers have been carelessly treated by the department. Many returned soldiers have got into serious arrears in their payments, because of intermittent work or unemployment. These men received very little consideration from the previous administration, in fact many of them were callously treated by it. The Minister at present controlling the department bas shown more consideration for these men than was shown to them by his predecessors. The capital value of the war service homes should be -reduced. Although the value of house property has fallen, the men who are purchasing war service homes are still being called upon to pay at the old high rates. I understand that a proposal has been made that their interest should be reduced by \ per cent. Such a reduction would be quite inadequate. service homes have always enjoyed a concession of 1 per cent, in interest charges. r1",24,Department Of Transport

Although this gentleman has paid more than £300 off bis home only approximately £110 has been allocated to the reduction of the principal; the remainder has gone in interest, sinking fund, insurance, &c. This gentleman, like many others in Cessnock, and on the coal-fields generally, -uffered sixteen months unemployment, due to the lockout in the industry, which obliged him to fall behind in his payments. The men who enlisted for. active service were promised all sorts of things; but to-day they are being treated more harshly by the War Service Homes Department than they would be treated if they were in occupation of privately owned houses. Many returned men were elected from their homes by the previous Government. were ejected in my own electorate. I am glad that the Minister at present in charge of the department allowed these men to return to their homes. thrown out of his home by the previous Government. the honourable member. Those who are aying rent for war service homes are eing called upon to pay more than those who are paying rent for similar houses owned by private individuals. In the circumstances, I hope that the Government will take steps to have a comprehensive inquiry made into the administration of the department. Jame3) has made some statements in respect of the administration of the previous government which are inaccurate. For instance, he said that the previous government had treated returned soldiers in occupation of war service homes with callous indifference. I emphatically deny that statement. The honourable gentleman also made some reference to the policy ef the previous government in regard to dockyards. I point out that the Government which I had the honour to support, wrote down the capital cost of Cockatoo Island Dockyard from £12,000,000 to £4,000,000 with the object of assisting it .to maintain its operations. It has been said that we should not allow any ships built overseas, to trade on the Australian coast. I point out to honourable members that even if we buy ships overseas, we can pay for them with our wheat and wool. It is not necessary for us to send money overseas in payment for them. We expect overseas countries to buy our primary products, and we must therefore be willing to buy other goods abroad. Reference has been made to the successful building in Australia of the cruisers Brisbane, and Adelaide, but honourable members know very well that we could not roll a single plate required for those ships. We have also had to buy abroad the plates and many other parts required for the lighthouse ship now being built in Australia. We must realize that freedom in international trade is a big factor in the maintenance of world peace. We cannot expect people overseas to continue to buy our primary products if we flatly refuse to buy anything from them in return. The honourable member for Wentworth one was callously ( Mr Marks) referred to the exchange aspect in regard to the lighthouse ship which we are now building, but that was not a factor when this order was placed. has no time for Australian workmen. inaccurate.

They have had to go to Mort's dockyard for attention. Why should not. those private concerns, which provide the sinews of war, be given an opportunity to compete with government-owned institutions? I make no objection to the Government calling tenders for the construction of a vessel, or for any other purpose. Tho honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) said that if it were within his power, he would pass a law prohibiting vessels coming to Australia which were not constructed here. Carrying that argument to its logical conclusion, our British kinsmen might very well say to us, "" We will allow no wheat to be marketed in the United Kingdom except that grown here "". I desire to ask the Minister in charge of war service homes whether the £42,000 provided under item No. 1, division No. 15, sub-division No. 1, is for the purpose of the maintenance of existing homes, or to construct new war service homes. The development of Australia has been retarded considerably through the nation being cursed with public men of the type of the honourable members for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) and Parkes( Mr Marr), who are always crying "" stinking fish"" with regard to Australian enterprise. They contend that everything that comes from overseas is perfect, while whatever is produced in Australia must be worthless. It was a government which they supported which commissioned Messrs. Kidman and Mayo to build wooden ships which, when reported on by the marine expert, were declared to be so unseaworthy that if they were to venture outside of Sydney heads they would go to the bottom like a stone. Order! The honourable member must confine himself to the item before the committee. combating statements that were made by honourable members opposite about a vessel that is being constructed by this Government. The claim is that Cockatoo Island Dockyard charges too much for the work that it turns out. Honourable members opposite overlook the high quality of that work, and its durability. They omitted to refer lo the fact' that a previous government let a contract for many thousands of pounds for the construction of ships to men who should have been gaoled for criminally defrauding the nation. I remind them of a vessel which was recently completed by private enterprise, and intended for the New Guinea service. When it put to sea it was proved to be thoroughly unsatisfactory, and it had to be taken to Cockatoo Island Dockyard in order to be made seaworthy. Had that dockyard not been in existence, the money expended on that vessel would have been wasted. When this new lighthouse ship iB put into commission, the Government proposes to sell the Kyogle. The Kyogle is being withdrawn from the Western Australian lighthouse service because of it6 inability to stand much longer the stress of service in those waters. It is dangerous to continue it in commission. Yet that vessel will be purchased by private persons, and manned by foolhardy men, who will be forced to earn a living in that way. That should not be countenanced. Honourable members opposite have said hew much better it would be for the nation df the vessels which we require were constructed overseasThat policy was put into operation by the Bruce-Page Government, when it sent nearly £6,000,000 to Great Britain to buy cruisers, at a time when ""patriotic"" British shipping companies were having the vessels that they needed built in Germany, by cheap labour, whilst British artisans were walking the streets unemployed. That is the kind of "" national"" spirit that animates honourable members opposite and those whom they champion. The Bruce-Page Government also purchased submarines that were constructed overseas, which could hardly make the journey to Australia, and which had to be reconditioned on arrival here. Australia has learned to its cost the folly of building bridges by contract, and it is now realized that if satisfaction is to follow, it is advisable to have our vessels built at our own dockyard.

It is for those very definite reasons Australia, and he answered about £96,626. that I and my colleagues support work being given to our own dockyards. hope that we shall no longer hear anti-Australian sentiments such as those expressed by honourable members opposite, when items of this nature come up for discussion. -In reply to a question that was asked a week or two ago, the Minister informed the House that at the 31st May last, 531 war service homes had reverted to the commission, 294 of which were occupied by tenants. told us that those homes had been vacated for various reasons. In some cases their former occupants had moved to cheaper homes; in others they had decided that, to meet changed economic circumstances, it was desirable to share a home with another family, or to live with their parents, and so save rent. ister drew attention to the splendid record of the occupants of war service homes in continuity of their payments. these troublous times the arrears, I understand, are less than 2 per cent. WhatI wish to know now is exactly how those persons stand who for years occupied war service homes, paid their instalments regularly, but finally had to abandon them for any of the reasons detailed above. In the event of the commission finding other occupants for the houses they have left, or selling them, will they be reimbursed the instalments that they have paid? desire to delay the business of the House, I should not have participated in the debate had it not been for the remarks of certain honourable members opposite, who allege that the construction of a lighthouse steamer in Australia involves a waste of public money. They complain that the cost of £120,000 for that vessel is excessive, and that it could have been built overseas for £64,000. Before hon* orahle members make such statements they should investigate the facts.. An exhaustive inquiry was conducted into It is the construction of this lighthouse examined, on oath, They included many practical men, well versed in shipbuilding. One naval expert was asked what this vessel should cost if constructed in A similar vessel constructed in EnglandI would cost £70,000, hut that would be the cost of the vessel at the dockyard, while £120,000 would be the cost of a vessel built here, and handed over to the Government. To the dockyard cost of a vessel built in Great Britain must be added the cost of exchange, which at the present rate, would work' out at between £20,000 and £22,000. It would cost another £6,000 or £7,000 to bring the vessel from England to Australia, and to repatriate its English crew. The committee which inquired into this matter had before it The honourable gentleman Mr Hastie, mechanical engineer in charge of ships in the Department of Public Works. In answer to a question by myself, he said that it would ordinarily cost between £6,000 and £7,000 to bring a vessel of this class from Great Britain to Australia. The difference of £50,000 between the cost of a vessel built overseas, The Minand that of a similar vessel built here, would be partly accounted for by the fact that wages are higher here than in Great Even in Britain. Taking British wages on a basis of 100, the index figure ""for Australian wages, he said, was 187. Iron could be obtained in Great Britain direct from the mills. Seeing that the ship-building industry had yet to be established in Australia, he said that, in his opinion, it would be a good thing to have the ship built in this country, thus keeping the money here. The Australian artisan was just as good a workman as the overseas artisan. Australian workmen would be quite competent to handle such a job. I ask honourable members opposite whether Australian artisans are never to be taken into consideration when we are dealing with the expenditure of public money? The difference between the cost of getting a vessel overseas, and of building it here, is not worth consideration when we remember that by building the vessel here we shall be keeping the money, la",27,Department Of Transport

119,Mr Long (Lang) [4.28],"I do notAustralia. There is not much evidence of Australian sentiment among honourable members opposite. when we are all asked to pull together for the benefit of the country, there should be no suggestion that Australian workmen should not benefit from the expenditure of Australian money on public undertakings. I support the proposal of the Government to spend Australian money in the employment of Australian workmen. should remember that Australia is a maritime nation. she is not. because of the conditions for which honourable members opposite stand, and which we have condemned this afternoon. Australia is an outpost of the British Empire, and of the white race in the Pacific. This continent which we occupy became ours largely as a result of the seamanship and courage of a very capable navigator, and I sometimes feel that the future possession by us of Australia will depend a great deal upon the capacity of our seamen. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard is the only one of its kind in this portion of the Pacific. I do not think that even on the American Pacific coast is there a dockyard to equal it. Proposals for the building of ships at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard should be considered, not wholly in the light of relative costs compared with dockyards overseas, but in the light of the desirability of maintaining such a valuable institution as this dockyard. If we are to consider shipbuilding and other industries only in the light of relative costs, why trouble about paying bounties and subsidies to private manufacturers to encourage Australian enterprise? If .'t costs more to build ships at Cockatcj Island Dockyard than we could buy them for overseas, we can at least regard th extra cost t as something in the nature of a bounty to ourselves to encourage ship-building in Australia. One honourable member stated that the Cockatoo Island Dockyard was not subject to taxation, and for that reason was not working on the same basis as private enterprise. We should not overlook the fact, however, that no privately owned dockyard in Australia is required to carry such high grade equipment, or such extensive, expensive plant, and During this time, this offsets any advantage which the institution might derive from the non-payment of taxes. Moreover, the government dockyard is not allowed to compete with private enterprise, although there are a hundred and one ways in which it might do useful national work. This dockyard should be regarded as a national institution of vital importance. Honourable members opposite, who have condemned the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, were strongly in favour of the construction by the British Government of a naval dockyard at Singapore; but it is characteristic of them that they should oppose anything of a similar character which is in the interests of Australian nationhood. Sufficient has been said by some members on this side of the House about the good work at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, but I am justified in touching upon it because I represent an electorate in which there reside, thousands of former employees of the yard now unfortunately unemployed, and some of the present employees. The-work done by this dockyard is of national importance, and since we have it and its valuable equipment, is it not sound policy for the Government to maintain it at full working capacity? Steps should be taken to enable the dockyard to compete with private enterprise. As a matter of fact, private yards very often turn to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard for assistance in their work which their plants are unable to haiidle. I understand that Cockatoo Island Dockyard is prohibited from doing private work because of an interpretation of the High Court involving a constitutional issue given in regard to the Bunnerong"" power house. Consideration of pounds, shillings, and pence should not be the determining factor, in matters of this kind. In regard to shipping, perhaps more than in any other form of commercial enterprise, callous trafficking in human life has, in the past, been practised. It is only necessary to recall the splendid work done by Plimsoll, and how it took him long years of noble public-spirited effort bpfore he could induce the House of Commons to safegard the lives of those who travel on the seas by requiring ship-owners",28,Department Of Transport

As a result of his work on behalf of humanity, in opposition to the grasping commercialism of the ship-owners, we are now all familiar with the Plimsoll mark which may be seen on every ship that sails the seas. I trust that the Government may be able to find more work for the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, so that, in addition to keeping the splencharged is excessive for the type of bouse did mechanical equipment in full operation, the services of the skilled workmen and ofiicers now and formerly attached to tlie yard may be fully availed. of. stances, went to the expense of sending officers to acquire skill in. special work, and it is a tragedy that men experience of the highest order, should be turned adrift merely because it costs a little more to build ships in Australia than abroad. I should like the Minister to supply honourable members with further details regarding the item of £42,000 in connection with war service homes. I have no objection to the money being voted; I am merely seeking information. I find myself in disagreement with one or two speakers who have castigated the ""War Service Homes Department for its administrative methods. I can only sayand I oiler this testimony with pleasure -that so far as my own experience goes, I have had nothing but satisfaction from the department. In many instances, families have been saved from calamity by the sympathetic and generous consideration extended to them by the Ministers in charge of the department, during the last few months, and their officers. Such action should be recognized, and, on behalf of my constituents and myself, I express deep gratitude to the department. desire certain particulars regarding the policy carried out generally by the department in connection with the insurance of war service homes. know the total amount that has been paid by occupants of war service homes in insurance premiums up to the present time, the amount paid out in connection with losses from fire and other causes, the amount now standing to the credit of the fund, and also the conditions under which the insurance premiums are paid. I am of the opinion that this fund is becoming large, and the experience of the last few years should have convinced the department that it is now in a position to reduce the premiums which the occupants are called upon to pay. Many ex-soldiers have told me that the amount they occupy, in view of the care exercised by them. Will the Minister inform me whether it is possible to reduce the premiums? budget proposals of the Treasurer contemplated a reduction of $ per cent, iu the interest on advances for war service possessing technical skill and homes, and I wish to know whether an amendment of the act is necessary to give effect to the reduction. If so, when will the amending bill be brought down, and will it be passed before Parliament rises? I assume that an amendment is necessary, because the War Service Homes Act prescribes the rate of interest as 5 per cent. I object, formally, to discrimination under the Government's policy with regard to the reduction of interest upon war service homes advances compared with advances to soldier settlers. In the latter case the reduction is to be 1 per cent. It has been contended that as the Government bears the cost of the administration of war service homes the -reduction in interest should be less in that instance; but I believe that this advantage is more than counterbalanced by the large amount that has been written off advances to soldier settlers. It seems to me that it would be equitable to reduce the rate charged to the occupants of war service homes by 1 per cent. When the rate was fixed at 5 per cent., the borrowing rate that the Government had to pay was considerably lower than it has been in recent years, and it would be equitable to make a similar reduction in both instances. I should like to know when the reduction will be effected, and how it is proposed to bring it about. IsI wish to ah amendment of the act necessary, and will the reduction take place from the beginning of this month, as in the case of other reductions? ant Minister) [4.50] -About some of the matters which have been mentioned by",29,Department Of Transport

125,Mr Cunningham (Gwydir,"Assisthonorable members, I cannot at present supply tlie information that has been asked for: but I shall obtain it and supply it either at a later stage, or subsehouse for a certain number of years, quently by letter. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) raised the subject of ejectments from war service homes. Since the present Government assumed office no ejectments have occurred in cases where the occupant is unemployed. When ejectment has bgen found necessary, this cause has been taken as the result of inquiries, and in the opinion of the department and the Minister the occupant has been in a position to make the payments required of him. The payments required for the purchase generally are lower thau those required as rental for similar houses anywhere in Australia. one of the reasons why the interest rate on these homes has not been reduced to the same extent as the rate charged by private lenders is expected to be reduced. The rate originally charged to ex-soldiers was very much lower than that for which private enterprise would look as a reasonable return from an investment of this character. It must be remembered, too, that during the recent boom period private landlords received very much higher rentals for similar houses than have been charged for war service homes, and consequently private rentals are subject to greater fluctuations than payments under contracts entered into for the purchase of war service homes. I am informed by my predecessor, the Hon. Parker Moloney, that arrangements have been made for the reduction of the payments on these homes in conformity with the reduction of wages, and, therefore, no hardship will be inflicted then. In all the cases that have come before me in which a purchaser is out of employment, not one has been ejected; but in certain cases occupants of these homes have been in receipt of from £4 4s. to £5 12s., and even £6 a week, and yet have been in arrears in their payments over a period of years. I submit that it is unfair to those occupants who meet their payments regularly to allow others to escape their liabilities. The rate of interest at which the money has been provided for the building of thesp homes is low, a long term of years is allowed for the completion of the purlin] chase, and the payments are in consequence relatively small. Thus, the occupier after he has lived in his will become its owner, although his payments will have been less than would have been required to rent a similar house from a private owner. In the latter case, at the end of the period, he would have no equity in the property. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) pay a tribute of appreciation to the department's administration generally in connection with the cases that have come under his notice. He said that the occupants of the houses had received sympaof war service homes thetic consideration. That is experience. the matter raised by the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron), I may say that no case of re-possession of the kind he referred to has come under my notice up to the present time. The usual arrangement in regard to the purchase of war service homes is a hire purchase agreement; the purchaser does not acquire an equity in his home until 3uch time as the property has been paid for. In the great majority of cases where the account is considered unsatisfactory the amount of arrears would exceed the purchaser's equity in the house. In making that statement. I am guided by the particulars that have been placed before me regarding the contracts, the amount in arrears and the amounts paid off the principal. probably cases in which there are ' no arrears. able member will bring such cases under my notice, I shall be pleased to look into them. I would point out that in the early years of the repayments most of the money represents interest on the capital; very little goes to the reduction of the principal. It is only in the later years of the contract, after 50 per cent, or more of the principal has been repaid, that the greater part, of the annual payment is applied to the reduction of the principal, a relatively small amount being required for the interest",30,Department Of Transport

129,Mr Cunningham,"If the honorpayments. If the purchaser of a war service home undertakes to buy on the rent purchase system he has no equity in the property until he has paid off the whole debt. If an occupant has a title to his home as a mortgagor to the department, he has the usual rights of a mortgagor, and in that case the usual mortgagor's equity. In the case of foreclosure, if there were a surplus when a house was re-sold, it would be paid over to him, but he would be liable for the payments due to the department up to the date on which the home was relinquished. We have had cases in. which the occupants have walked out of their houses, leaving the department to find out that the house had been vacated; but these, of course, are hopeless cases, and are not, I presume, of the kind the honourable member for Brisbane has in mind. In reply to the question raised by the man), as to the difference between the rate of interest charged by the Commonwealth in connection with war servicehomes, and that charged for advances for soldier settlement, the explanation is that the Commonwealth-has to pay the cost of administering the expenditure for Avar service homes, Avhereas the money for soldier settlement is advanced to the States, and they bear the expense of administration. It has cost the States a considerable sum for administration, and they have Avritten off large amounts for losses incurred in connection Avith soldiersettlement.

I pointed out that Tasmania is the only State in the Commonwealth which is not linked with the other States by telephonic communication.

Tasmania is prepared to bear its f a i r share of sacrifice, and it has tacitly agreed to the postponement of an improved steamship communication. But it does object to the manner in which this Government bas brushed aside its promise to provide telephonic communication between Tasmania and the mainland. That proposal was submitted to and recommended by the Public Works Committee.

I have no desire to raise the issue of city versus country; I do not believe that their interests are in opposiweight upon country residents. The Mintion. In my opinion, all sections of the community should pull together for the common good; but t protest against anything being spent on providing improved postal and telephonic facilities in city and suburban areas, while facilities which have been enjoyed in country areas for the past 50 or 60 years are being taken away. If it is necessary that men and women should go into the outer areas, and, iu the interests of national development, endure hardships of which city dwellers have no conception, the Government should at least help them to the extent of providing adequate postal and telephonic facilities. It should certainly for departing from the usual -practice ? not take away any of the facilities they now enjoy. An adequate telephone service is essential in the outback, where it is generally the only means. by which medical aid can be summoned in urgent cases. In the past the department followed the laudiWe policy of steadily improving country services; but it has now reversed that policy, and is whittling those services away. Where there was a mail service on three days a week, it is being reduced to two, aud bi-weekly services are being reduced to weekly services. Sometimes mail services are being cut out altogether. desire to join in the appeal to the Minister building for more sympathetic consideration for country districts, particularly in respect to telephone and postal services. I am inclined to think that the Minister and his department are expecting the country people to bear more than their share of the general sacrifice demanded at the prehas been done with that money < The sent time. Some honourable members have much more serious complaints to make' than I have, and, for my part, I desire to pay a tribute to the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs and the officers of his department in Queensland for the conthere is no sideration they have extended to representations 1 have made from time to time. 1 believe, however, that there is a general feeling throughout country districts in Queensland that the Government is not so sympathetic towards their interests as they have a right to expect. Telephone and mail services mean much to the people in the remote areas, and economies should not bear with undue ister should keep in mind the sacrifices which country residents are already making by virtue of their residence in isolated areas. I observe that in this year's Estimates the department has abandoned the usual practice of displaying side by side the votes for last year, and the amount actually expended ber looks at page 3.77 of the Estimates he will see that the amount expended was £1,288,114. shown in last year's Estimates was out of loan money,.while that shown in this year's Estimates is out of revenue. The two are not comparable. ture is out of loan moneys or revenue, it should appear in the Estimates. This document is difficult enough to follow as it is, and if the system is to be altered at the will of the department, it is time that the whole thing was reviewed. Last year, the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), who .was then Acting Treasurer, informed me that a definite sum of money had been set aside for a new for an automatic telephone exchange at the post office at Ipswich. 1 ask the Minister what has been done with that money? A sum of £2,500,000 was appropriated for work of this kind, and if definite amounts were allocated for specific undertakings, what Minister has stated that, of the sum of £2,500,000 appropriated, only £1,288,114 has been spent, which leaves over",35,Postmaster General S Department

If it has been diverted to other uses, by whose authority was that done? able members representing country electorates have, of late, been besieged with protests from their constituents against the reduction of postal and telephone services. Departmental economies have been effected in the country to a greater extent than in the cities. I join with those who have already protested against this policy. The district which I represent has been well treated by the Postal Department in the past. That, perhaps, was because, when the big scheme for improving postal facilities was inaugurated, the member representing my electorate happened to be also Postmaster General, and, no doubt, be was impressed with the need for increased facilithe proposal of the honourable gentleman, ties in country areas. Though my electorate benefited then, it is now suffering from the reversal of that policy, and country residents are being asked to make more than their fair share of tliR sacrifices required. Many suburban districts are still enjoying daily mail deliveries, while residents of country districts have to be content with a delivery once every fortnight. The' TEMPOEAEY CHAIEM AN (Hon. a. A. Crouch) -Order! Although postal matters may be referred to under tliis item, the remarks of honourable members must be associated with the telephone service. tricts are paying more than their fair share for the inadequate service that they receive. Where previously they had weekly mail deliveries, they now have a delivery only once a fortnight, while those who had two mails a week now receive a weekly mail. Before the department expends a large amount on new works, it should consider reinstating the facilities that previously existed in country districts. not propose to allow to pass unchallenged the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) about the honourable member for Bass( Mr concern metropolitan areas. Additions Guy) and myself. The honourable member for Werriwa declared that we were largely responsible for Tasmania not having adequate shipping communication with the mainland, because we opposed financial plans that would -Honor have made that possible. At the time there was no money available to enable the Government to inaugurate that service. The honourable member and those associated with him who demand that everything should be built in Australia endeavoured to force upon the Government, an expenditure of at least £1,500,000 to provide the necessary shipping service. Naturally, I opposed that, and all the other stupid monetary propositions that have emanated from the honourable member. The Commonwealth Treasurer placed that scheme before the Tasmanian people at the last State election, and the very persons who desired the service rejected so that I am in line with the people of Tasmania when I refuse to accept the project. I hope that, in the near future, the Government will endeavour to help Tasmania in that regard. When a member of the Government I did all that I could in the matter, and I give the Government credit for helping me along reasonable and sound lines. However, I know the financial position of the Government, and realize that it cannot do the impossible. able member for Bass crying about? thing to which Tasmania is entitled. As a result of the establishment of telephonic communication between Australia and other countries, every State in the Commonwealth can now communicate with practically every other part of the world, with the exception of Tasmania. Every city and town in the Commonwealth is linked up by telephone, with the exception of those in the island State of Tasmania. I join the honourable member for Bass in urging that it is not too much to ask that that State should be brought into line with the rest of the Commonwealth in this matter. that practically all of the items for the extension of telephonic commiinieation and alterations are to be effected at",36,Postmaster General S Department

It is most unfair to do that at the expense of country residents. Both my predecessor, Mr Charlton, and I have urged that an offic al post office : should be erected at Cardiff, but our representations have always met with a refusal. My request that a public telephone should be established at Pelton was also rejected.

The postman goes along one side of the street, but will not deliver letters on the other side because it is out of the 1-mile radius. Since this Government assumed office it has spent a considerable amount of money in advertising, urging the people "" to do it by 'phone "". Yet, when requests are made for the installation of a public telephone which would produce revenue, they have been refused, "" financial stringency "" being urged as an excuse. I specifically cite the case of Mr Burden, Coal Point, Toronto, who is .agreeable to pay a reasonable charge for the installation of a telephone which could be used for business purposes. The department indicated that they would install the instrument if Mr Burton paid for the erection of the necessary telephone posts. also need a telephone installed at the golfPostmaster-General( Mr A.

The department has refused application after application for the establishment of a post office at the new settlement of Chewko, in Queensland, where 150 people are engaged in tobacco cultivation. The same is true of other places. People are encouraged to go out into the unsettled areas with the object of doing developmental work, but are denied the ordinary facilities of civilized life. Many people in my electorate are living seven or eight miles away from n post office. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has complained because the department requires a golf club in his electorate to erect a couple of poles before it will grant telephonic facilities. In Queensland, many poles and miles of telephone wire have been erected at the cost of the applicants for telephonic facilities. It appears to me that while the officials of the Postmaster-General's Department are expert in regard to automatic telephones and city postal facilities, they know very little about the needs of country districts. Not only is the department refusing to grant animations for new post offices, but it is closing up offices already in existence. At Mein, in the division of Herbert, the mania and the mainland.

I have been told by honourable members who represent other districts that I was lucky to get even a hurricane lamp. In these circumstances I cannot feel any enthusiasm about a proposal to spend a lot of money on a new post office at Wynyard Square, and other city centres, in expectation of the completion of the underground railway system. Half of this money should be spent in country centres.

As the questions asked by Mr James were not put until the 2nd July, it is hard to understand what the Speaker means to convey when he says that the last price quoted by the Department of Works was too high, when, as a matter of actual fact, the prices paid to the Department of Works during June was in the case of coke 6s. per ton less than that, paid to the contractor from the 1st July, and with coal, although on paper the price is the same, as you can see above tlie department supplies best Maitland coal against the contractor's inferior Happy Valley coal, which the department would supply at £2 7s. 3d., or is. fld. less than the contractor's price.

Yet by correspondence, this officer advised the Controller -oi Stores that ho had made an arrangement highly satisfactory to the Joint House Department. With regard to the assistance to unload Government lorries stressed by the Speaker, it ' is necessary to point out that this is not always given, and neither is it required, and even when given it certainly involves the Joint House ""Department in no extra expense, because the employees of the Joint House Department are there in any case, and to use it as a lever to justif y the giving of an order at Cs. per ton mprq (and on present figures 8s. por ton more) is from the point of view of economy, beyond my comprehension, and would seem to point to the fact that some hidden influence, in this particular instance, has been brought to bear on the Secretary of tlie Joint House Committee, .compelling hinj to ignore the instructions as laid down by the Auditor-General in connection with the expenditure of public moneys. On a basis of a supply of twelve tons of coke, and one ton of coal per week average to the Joint House Committee, they aro paying in the case of coke £4 16s. more, and for coal 4s. 9d. more, or a grand total of £5 Os. 9d. per week more for fuel to the contractor than they would be paying to the department at current rates. Further, if added to this is the loss of revenue to the Government's own lorries of £3 per week, it w ill be seen what a highly satisfactory arrangement this must bo from the point of view of the Commonwealth Treasury, particularly as the plant and staff of the transport must remain tlie same in order ts carry out efficiently transport services to the other departments. In my previous communication to you under the above subject, I omitted to state that the contractor in question is not only an undischarged bankrupt, but is at the same time Nationalist. If we allow this business to be taken away from the Transport Department, we shall possibly bring about the retrenchment of some of the employees in that section. It is tragic to think that Parliament should make a present of from 4s. to 6s. a ton for this coal to an individual who is a Mr James.

Until a week or two ago, the classification covering these oflicers had not been approved or gazetted, and it was not possible to make, any alteration in staffing arrangements until this had been done. House Committee could only effect what economics were possible without interfering with the staff. Honourable members will agree that considerable savings have been effected without reducing efficiency. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) suggested that the statement of the President of the Joint House Committee regarding the supply of fuel to Parliament House was inaccurate. I can assure him that everything in the President's statement was entirely correct. I have the official file before me, and if honpatronage he could, and he put in a tender orable members desire, will lay it on the table of the House. No evidence in the possession of the honourable member could possibly refute the statements in the documents I havo before me. I have a communication from the Controller of Stores( Mr Francis.) giving the price at which coal was supplied, and I have another from Mr Sweetnam, setting out the position in full. The honourable member asked for particulars of negotiations up to 2nd July, and the communication from Mr Francis is the latest that was received up to that date. It was written on the 13th May, 1931, and is as follows:Further to our price for the supply of Muswcllbrook coal in bags, it will be noted that this has been further reduced since the 5thi instant to £2 1(>3. per ton delivered, less 2s. per dozen for bags, which is approximately £2 13s. per ton net. The letter from Mr Sweetnam is dated! the 13th June, 1931, and is as follows:My quotation for best coal, as per specification, supplied and delivered in bags, is twopounds, twelve shillings per ton (£2 12B.).

It is possible that the information in possession of the honourable member The for Hunter is based on a letter forwarded to the Joint House Committee by Mr Francis, and bearing the date the 3rd July, the day after the honourable member asked his question.

The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) is to bo congratulated upon his reference to the two Parliamentary Standing Committees. Having been a member of the Public Works Committee for about nine years, I can vouch for the excellent services that it has performed, and for the thoroughness of its staff. While I was a member of the committee, I advocated that the number of its members should be reduced. On looking through the Estimates I find that the Public Works Committee has an office staff of a secretary, a clerk, and a messenger. The total sum set down for salaries is £1,224, while £485 is provided for contingencies, of which £400 is for travelling expenses, making a total of £1,709. In addition to that, £1,600 is provided for fees for members of the committee. In the vote for the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, provision is made for the salaries of a secretary and If the honourable mema clerk, totalling £891, which, with contingencies, £570, makes a total of £1,461, and in addition, £1,600 is provided for members' fees. I have the greatest respect for the members of both those committees, and I . believe that they do conscientious work. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) was slightly mistaken, because, if members of the committee do not attend the meetings, they do not draw fees. make is that those committees involve an expenditure of £6,370 per annum, and I think that, in these times of financial depression, the number of members on the committees should be reduced. The Works Committee now comprises nine members, and that is an unwieldy number. It is true that all the members do not regularly attend the meetings; but, if the number were reduced to five, the work would be done more expeditiously, and a considerable saving would be made.

At the present time, members are supplied with bed and breakfast at the hotels, and the country is put to considerable expense in providing the other two meals at Parliament House. T favour closing the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms as a dining establishment, but making them available to members for morning and afternoon tea. It is absurd for the Government to provide meals at Parliament House and at tbe hotels as well. It involves a duplication of staff which is unwarranted. I am glad that the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) has referred to the coal contract with Mr are most useful. AlthoughI was a memSweetnam. As a member of the House Committee, I know something of the circumstances under which that contract was let, and I commend that committee for accepting it as that has compelled the department to reduce its price. however, when practically no Common1 understand that the difference between the price formerly charged by the departpensions have been reduced, we should ment and that now quoted, amounts to 18s. a ton, owing to the huge overhead .expenses that had to be allowed for under commission control. The cost could be reduced by letting a contract for the coal required for government hotels and other public buildings, as well as for Parliament House. It has been said that Mr Sweetnam is employing non-union labour, but I know that that statement is not correct. I know nothing of the quality of the coal. If it is inferior I would not attempt to defend the contract, but I believe that the article supplied is committees for the present year, and for giving f u l l satisfaction. Apparently some honourable members desire that the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms should be kept open for the supply of afternoon tea and liquor, because they do not patronize the refreshment rooms for lunch and dinner; but, if the services are to be reduced at all, I would advocate closing the rooms altogether. If the bar is to be kept open, and membership of both the Works Commitif tea is to be provided mornings and afternoons, as well as during all-night sittings, it would be more expensive than if the present arrangement were conten. tinued. Why should we cease providing luncheon and dinner because certain members do not take those meals at the House, and force the staff to injure their health by being in attendance during all night sittings? So long as it is understood that the proposed reduction of expenditure on the two Parliamentary Standing Committees is to be confined to the fees and travelling expenses of members of those committees, and that the present oflicers of those committees will not be jeopardized in their employment, I am prepared to accept tbe proposal for the present year. In normal times, when Commonwealth works are under construction in the different States, and, perhaps, also in the Mandated Territory, the services of these committees ber of one of the committees for a couple of months only, I am of the opinion that, they do good work, and that a considerable sum has been saved as the result of their investigations. At the present time, wealth works are in progress, and wheD not provide £1,600 for each of these committees, so that their members may get a little extra pocket money to compensate them for the reduction of their ordinary allowance. I believe that these committees are often used for "" buying of f "" the opposition of members to certain proposals, and that they were appointed originally for that purpose. I am well aware of the fact that, when the committees do not sit, the members do not draw fees. I am prepared to vote for a reduction of the expenditure on these next year, if the depression continues, as it certainly will if the present Government remains in office, and pursues it? present policy. On this matter I find myself in the extraordinary position of being in entire agreement with the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill). many years I have considered that thf tee and the Accounts Committee is too large.

238,Mr Lacey,"Members of the commitmember for Swan( Mr Gregory) was chairman of the Public Works Committee, and when I was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, we suggested the reduction of both those committees. I do not belittle the work done by these committees. The scope of the inquiries of the Works Committee is limited; that committee can undertake only such inquiries as may be referred to it by the House; but the Accounts Committee may inquire into any matters that it thinks should be investigated. fees that the members may draw? to the annual appropriation. I have no hesitation in saying that the saving in public expenditure that has resulted from the recommendations of these committees has amounted to many times more than the cost involved. ber anticipate that the Works Committee will be able to make savings this year ? or no work for the committee to do; but there is much scope for the Accounts Committee, which is empowered to initiate any inquiry which it deems fit. If the membership of these committees were limited to seven, or even five each, their work would be more efficiently and economically performed. The Accounts Committee has initiated many investigations. I see in. this chamber several honourable members who were associated with me on that body, and I feel sure that none of us has any apology to offer for the work we did. But the conditions at the present time are exceptional, and as we have found it necessary to reduce even old age, invalid, and war pensions, we have an obligation to curtail, wherever possible, the expenditure connected with this Parliament. When the Works Committee was first established, accommodation was not available at Parliament House, Melbourne, and it 4eased offices in Collinsstreet. As the committee was divorced from the' services and conveniences of Parliament House, the appointment of a special staff to assist it became necessary. of that is taking place now. Now, however, the committee is housed in this building, and as the services of the ordinary messengers are available, the retention of its own special messenger is not necessary. The Accounts Committee has never felt the need to appoint a messenger ; it has conducted its work with the aid of the secretary and a clerk, and if other services are required, the parliamentary messengers are called upon. We cannot dispense with the services of the officers of the Public Works Committee, hut surely other employment can be found for them. I urge honourable members to vote for the reduction of the expenditure on these committees as an intimation to the Government that their membership should be reduced. I reiterate that these committees are necessary. Undoubtedly, the Public Works Committee has saved to the public Treasury many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and a similar claim might be made on behalf of the Public Accounts Committee. Nevertheless, the committees are unnecessarily large. Nineteen of the 111 members of this Parliament are appointed to the two committees. out; they represent a bad system introduced by a previous government. should be wiped out, but I hope that the Government will decide to move that their membership be reduced. Such a motion will have my support. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) criticized the parliamentary refreshment rooms. I would not like to see them closed, but when the Government hotels in Canberra are unable to pay their way there is no need for the refreshment rooms to provide heavy meals. Afternoon teas and suppers might be continued, but as all honourable members live at the hotels, they should take their regular meals there. Such a change might deprive a few men on tbe Joint House staff of their positions, but at a time when we have to cut down the essential services of the community why should we retain to ourselves privileges which are not necessary, and are not availed of by very many honourable members? members camping in this building altogether ? portion of honourable members avail themselves of the refreshment rooms, but the expenditure upon them is almost as",48,Honourable Members Hear Hear

One would think, also, that the critics had never been candidates for appointment to the committees. been. did not criticize the committees, but many of those who did have been candidates in the party rooms for election to them. There is no need for a definite motion to suspend the activities of the Public Works Committee. That body cannot 'conduct any investigation until this Parliament has referred a proposed work to it.

267,Mr Lacey,"I shall explain that.supply which, until thou, had never been mentioned by Commonwealth or State engineers. This suggestion was adopted, and resulted in a direct saving to the Commonwealth of £61,000. By suggesting an alteration of the work proposed to be carried out in the remodelling of the Customs House, Sydney, a saving of £10,481 was made. By a modification of an elaborate air-conditioning plant suggested for the City West telephone exchange, Melbourne, a saving of a capital cost of £3,000, and an annual payment of £300 was effected. A similar saving was made in connection with the automatic telephone exchange, Hobart. The report of the committee had the effect of delaying the work proposed to be carried out at the Henderson ""Naval Base, Western Australia, at an estimated cost of £4,529,109, and subsequent events showed that such work was unnecessary; but that is not claimed as an actual saving. Other instances of more frequent occurrence in which suggestions for small ' alterations or modifications, effecting savings of from £300 to £400, help to swell the total savings in fifteen years to £5,000,000. Apart from actual savings, the committee has been able at times to give valuable advice to the Government of the day. Eor instance, it insisted on the disposal of the sewage of Canberra at a point three miles outside the city when the designer of the Federal Capital was strongly in favour of the establishment of a number of septic tanks at various points within the city. On another occasion the inquiry of the committee into a contract for the construction of wooden ships for the Commonwealth led to the discovery of certain structural defects, which would have made the vessels unseaworthy, and endangered the lives of the crews. At the same time it relieved the Commonwealth from a liability of £135,200. Sometimes the advice of the committee has not been sought, and at other times its advice when sought has been unheeded, and perhaps the finances of the Commonwealth have suffered in consequence. Within the former category are the alterations to Yarralumla House to fit it for a residence for the Governorwork until after the 1st of July of that General, and also the erection of the Prime Minister's house. Within the latter category is the erection of the ,Hotel Canberra, which establishment is so seldom fully occupied. Had the advice of the Public Works Committee with respect to many of the establishments in Canberra been followed, the cost of'this city would not have been so great. greater. whose report is the honourable member quoting? report which has been drawn up at tlie direction of the Public Works Committee. report of the secretary of that committee ? inquired into the cost of roads recently constructed in Canberra and found that it was too high.

Only recently a proposal to link Tasmania with the mainland by telephone connection was referred to the committee, and, in the interests of economy, a sectional committee consisting of a senator who represents Tasmania, the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Holloway), in whose district it was proposed that one terminal of the telephonic link should be established, and myself, as chairman of the committee, was appointed to make the investigation. We inquired into the project and reported to the full committee. As a result of economies, there was an unexpended balance of special appropriation for the year of approximately £1,100. It is true that last year the committee held fifteen meetings in the final month of the financial year, but let me point out that had the committee postponed its year it would have been able, because of the new appropriation, to draw additional fees.

The Commonwealth Analyst had reported that certain crude petroleums at present being obtained in the United States of America were practically ready-made petrol, as they had a petrol content of OS per cent. The March resolution fixed the limit of petrol content of crude petroleum at 35 per cent, for distillation purposes; but my departmental officers, after further inquiry, found that this percentage was too low, and recommended that the limit ilr.

I decided, however, to refer this and other phases of the duties on petrol to the Tariff Board, which in due course endorsed the department's recommendation that the petrol limit be fixed at 70 per cent. This motion which I am moving gives effect to that recommendation. The other amendments made to the March resolution by this motion are as follow:Crude petroleum for use as fuel-Petro l content limited to 15 per cent, instead of 35 per cent.

Amendment of method of ascertaining petrol content of crude petroleum. As will have been observed, these amendments will operate as on and from the 27th March, 1931, and will therefore be substituted for the relevant items in the Afarch, .1931, tariff proposals. The object is to remove the disabilities under which the local distilleries-the Commonwealth Oil Refineries and the Shell Refineries-hav e been operating since xhe 27th March.

I have been advised that the rates suggested by the Tariff Board and imposed by this resolution will not afford protection, but can only be regarded as revenue duties. The Government has, however, given effect to the Tariff Board's recommendation, and proposes holding a further investigation into the subject between now and the time when the item will come up for discussion by honourable members.

In quiries made into the reason for these abnormal importations elicited the information that large quantities were being imported by a certain proprietor of a number of service stations in Sydney, and as he could not give any sufficient reason as to the uses to which turpentine substitutes imported by him were being put, the inference is that he is selling them in admixture with petrol to unsuspecting motorists. This trade has developed by reason of the fact that the duty on turpentine substitutes is only Id. per gallon, while the duty on petrol is 7d. per gallon.

I freely admit that the committees have done good work; but, under present conditions, it is cerproposed legislation, and give Parliament tainly unnecessary that the Works Committee should continue to operate. It can only work, as a matter of fact, if Parliament, not as a reflection on the Government gives it work to do. The position of the Public Accounts Committee is somewhat different. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) has pointed out that last year the Works Committee spent only £900 of the £2,000 voted to it, and returned £1,100 to the Treasury. He also referred to the good work that the committee had done. I admit this; but, on the other hand, if one desired to be critical, he could point to mistakes which the committee has made. To do so he would not need to go further than this House, some of the appointments of which are not nearly as convenient as they might be.

I believe that the Government is just as keen on saving the country's money as is any individual honourable member. These committees have given of their best from time to time, but I hold that their members should make their services available free. I am of the opinion that committees could be appointed with advantage to investigate the benefit of their views when the bills were presented.

I ask the committee not to accept the amendment of the honourable member for honourable member should withdraw his amendment on my assurance that the Government will investigate this matter.

If the amendment of the honourable member for Angas is not withdrawn, I ask the committee to reject it, on my assurance that the subject will have the attention of the Government. view of what has been said on this subject, I feel that I should say a word or two in relation to the activities of the Accounts Committee. First, let me say that I approve of its membership being reduced. At the same time, I point out that when the Public Accounts Committee Act became law in 1913 it provided for a committee of nine members, but the Hughes Administration increased the number to ten in order to give the Country party representation. orable member for Hunter, was put on the committee as its tenth member. the number was increased in order to give the new party representation. I remind honourable members that the members of the committee consist of representatives of both chambers. One reason for the present number of members is to ensure a quorum. I give the lie to the suggestion that the members of the Accounts Committee attend meetings simply to collect fees. Last year the special appropriation for the committee was £2,000, of which £1,300, in round figures, was expended, the balance being returned to Consolidated Revenue. That conclusively proves that the committee docs not sit just for the sake of making fees. honourable member explain why the committee expended £725 in travelling last year when its vote was only £4S0? that later. The Accounts Committee undertakes investigations which have the approval of the Government. To that extent its activities can be safely limited. Its secretary is at present engaged upon ling in South Australia last year, followed a government inquiry which is apart an itinerary, provided for it by the South altogether from the activities of the comAustralian Government. It went only mittee. That proves that the experience where is was asked to go. Further, all of that he has gained in connection with the the members of the committee did not committee is of considerable value to the visit that State, and no unnecessary Government and transport charges in the Federal Territory. Under its act, the committee has power to initiate its own inquiries; but during this Parliament its time has been spent on government references. The inquiry into the finances of South Australia was instituted by a resolution carried at the Premiers Conference iD August of last year. The South Australian Government asked for a grant of £1,950,000, but having made its investigations the committee recommended a grant of £1,000,000. The Government accepted that recommendation, and provided for that amount in the Estimates, thereby proving that it thought the recommendations of the committee of value. The members of the committees inform their minds in the process of their investigations upon subjects concerning government finance, and to that extent become useful critics in this . chamber. The activities. of both committees have an educative influence upon their members, and give them a greater sense of their political responsibilities. These committees are the investigators of Parliament, and it Js from that stand-point that they should be regarded. The suggestion that the committees should be abolished leaves my withers unwrung; but I believe that to abolish them would be a serious blow to Parliament. The Public Account* Committee was inaugurated as the result of a demand by honourable members for the examination of public expenditure. Another important inquiry which engaged the attention of the Accounts Committee was made into the finances of Tasmania. Recommendations were submitted to Parliament last year, which were welcomed by Tasmania, but, because of the financial difficulties that confront the Commonwealth, the Government was unable to give effect to them.

I merely point out that in Great Britain a public accounts committee has existed since 1861, and has earned the tributes of such great parliamentarians as Gladstone, Disraeli, Asquith, Lloyd George and others, who recognized the necessity for such a body to exercise some control over the nation's finances. It would be a retrograde step to abolish sit on these committees without fee or these committees at this stage. I agree that their scope could be restricted, and their membership reduced. There are often, however, times when there is need for a standing committee to deal with government references. It is a much more economical form of investigation than that by royal commission. If cost is the only consideration, I direct attention to the fact that during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, twenty-one royal commissions were appointed in the period beginning on the 1st January, 1923, and ending on the 30th June, 1929, at a cost of no less than £107,765, the average cost of each inquiry being £5,132. During the same period the Public Accounts Committee conducted sixteen inquiries at a cost of £19,556, the average cost of each inquiry being £1,222. The inquiry by a royal commission into the finances of Western Australia cost £5,681, compared with the £1,682 incurred by the Accounts Committee when making its inquiry into the finances of South Australia. The investigation by the Development and Migration Commission into the economic position of Tasmania cost £14,973, compared with that made by the Accounts Committee for £1,524. Those figures indicate that the committee's investigations have been conducted with due regard to economy and savings have been effected, as a result of its close scrutiny of the matters to which I have referred. to persist in my amendment, in an endeavour to prevent fees being paid to honourable members who sit on these committees. It is not my purpose on this occasion to bring about a reduction of the vote for the refreshment rooms. The purpose of my amendment is to abolish the payment of allowances and fees to members of Parliament sitting on the Public Works Committee and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and the amendment is confined to that alone. The chairmen of those committees have said that they and their fellow members are anything but avaricious. Well, let us assume that they are actuated only by a desire to render public service. That being so, and seeing that they have been able to render such valuable service in the past, they should be only too willing to allowance. I do not propose to be deceived by the window-dressing which has gone on here to-night. It may go down with the public, but if honourable members were courageous enough to say here what they say freely' in the party room and in the corridors regarding the Works Committee and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the public would learn something very different from what it has been told to-night. able member mean? ( Mr Brennan) should know very well what I mean. Members of this Parliament are supposed to be paid for doing a full-time job. It has been claimed that the members of these committees are not avaricious; that considerations of pounds, shillings and pence do not weigh with them; that they are immolating themselves on the altar of duty. No doubt members of the Cabinet will claim the same, despite recent revelations regarding expenses, and the use of motor cars, matters, concerning which Ministers have consistently tried to dodge the issue. It has been claimed that the committees have been instrumental in saving a great deal of public money. A great many matters relating to the building of Canberra were referred to-these committees, but I doubt whether the work could have been characterized by greater waste and inefficiency if the committees had never functioned at all.

295,Mr Gabb,"The Attorney-Generalinto. As one honourable member suggested, whatever economies the committees may be responsible for are more than offset by the extravagant expenditure which they have recommended at different times. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) said that certain honourable members had not told their party that they were not candidates for positions on these committees. I do not know whether he was referring to me, but I may state that from the day when I voted against the salary grab away back in 1920, I knew that I was a marked man, and that I had no chance of getting on any committee. There was no need for me to say that I was not a candidate. If honourable members wish me to give details of the canvassing which has been done for positions on committees, I shall do so. Why all this hypocrisy? Everybody knows of the underground manoeuvring which goes on in the Labour party, and, I have no doubt, in other parties also, and yet it is said that honourable members are not avaricious. The honourable member for Grey threv^ out his chest and said, "" Our committee sat four times in one day, and we only took one fee."" I should think so. They were very lucky to get that. They did very well to get 25s. for sitting a few hours at a committee meeting, when all the time their parliamentary allowance was going on. The time is rotten ripe for Parliament to take action in regard to this matter. It is all very well for the honourable member for Grey to say that his committee has not met for so long and has handed back so much of its vote. If there had been.any excuse for the committee to meet, it would have done so. sat this morning if it had liked. was done last financial year.

I am in agreement with the present chairman of the Works Committee, the honourable member for Grey( Mr ing those who, while agreeing to the Lacey), and the chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman), that the number of members on these committees should be reduced. The Prime Minister has said that he is not in a position to accept the suggestion of the honourable -member for Grey that the number should be reduced, but he has promised that the Government will give the matter its earnest consideration. With that promise I am content. I trust that the amendment of the honourable member for Angas will not be agreed to. port the amendment moved by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb). Unlike some honourable members who have spoken, I do not approach this matter with any heat. suspend the operations of the committee for twelve months is to be commended; but, in my opinion, the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) should have gone a step further. I notice among the votes for the Prime Minister's Department. £3.000 for travelling expenses of Ministers despite the fact that they are all Green, K. provided with gold passes. That item also should be disallowed. Despite the 20 per cent, reduction in all salaries, a full-time Minister will receive £1,520 per annum, and assistant Ministers £1,200, and surely it is not necessary to provide an additional £3,000 to be cut up among Ministers by way of travelling expenses. There is no justification for voting £2,000 There are, happily, some as travelling expenses for the members of the two Parliamentary Standing Committees. Since the Government has de; cided to reduce the pensions of invalid and aged persons to 17s. 6d. a week, and to cut down by 2s. 6d. a week even those pensions which amount to only 5s. a week, we should not become heated over a proposal to prevent members already in receipt of £800 a year from recouping themselves of part of the loss due to the 20 per cent, reduction by collecting travelling expenses. If these members had any sense of decency they would forgo these perks. The honourable member for Angas is to be complimented on his matter. I would have difficulty in finding words to express my feeling concernreduction of invalid and old-age pensions, and the reduction of the mato-xuty allowance from £5 to £4, complain that members receiving £800 a year .should be prevented from cutting up a few extra thousands a year in travelling expenses.

310,17 Mr Lazzarini,"In the discussionth'e existing depression Continues much longer, depositors in other States will be forced to make such heavy withdrawals from government savings banks and private banks, that it will not be long before those institutions will have to close their doors. If such a situation is threatened, will this financial dictator demand of other State Governments the conditions which he has imposed upon the Government of New South Wales? I realize, of course, the limitations of this Parliament in this matter. I am aware that the Commonwealth Bank Board, which is the creation of a Nationalist Government, is in absolute control of our monetary policy; but the position may develop and become so intolerable that -this Government and Parliament will be forced to take action. In many respects, the present crisis is much more serious than that which occurred in the 'nineties, because then the Government of New South Wales had absolute power over the currency and was able to take action to ease the situation. endowed with the vinced that the savings bank would not have been forced to suspend operations. To that extent, the Commonwealth must accept some responsibility in this crisis, because the instrumentality which could have averted it is the creation of this Parliament. thread of faith is the only thing upon which government or private banking institutions depend for their solvency. If depositors or the people generally lose faith in the present banking system, we shall see a crisis of great magnitude, because the volume of banking business has grown to enormous dimensions in recent years. The private banking institutions are in an exceedingly serious situation, because they have on current account nearly £100,000,000, and the currency available to meet sudden demands does not exceed £30,000,000. I should add that current accounts in private banks are in a totally different category, from current accounts in a government savings bank. former return to depositors nothing in the way of interest. On the contrary, the banks charge a certain amount per annum for the keeping of these accounts, and, Mr Lazzarini. in return, they are supposed to be able to meet every call demand immediately.. On the other hand, current accounts in savings banks return to depositors a certain amount per annum by way of interest, to earn which the bank authorities are obliged to invest the deposit sums in approved securities, which will return to the bank an amount sufficient to pay the agreed upon interest to depositors, and also provide for the working expenses of the institution. So serious is the position of the private banks that if a panic were created, disaster would overtake the Commonwealth in a very short space of time. If the Commonwealth Bank will not come to the aid of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales on terms'more acceptable to the Government of that State, how will it be possible for -the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) to justify assistance from the Commonwealth Bank to the associated banks, should that be necessary to avert a financial crisis? And yet apparently that is to If it had been be done, because, when I spoke upon this similar powers in subject some time ago, the right honorpresent crisis, I am conable gentleman intimated that, if a crisis should occur, the Commonwealth Bank would have to be empowered to print a sufficient number of notes to meet any abnormal demand. If such action is contemplated to buttress private banking institutions, a similar course should be The slender adopted to save an important institution like the Government Savings Bank in New South Wales. My views on banking are well known to honourable members. If it were possible, I should have no hesitation in supporting a scheme to absorb compulsorily the government savings banks in all the States, for I am convinced that Commonwealth control of banking is the only sound policy. The Commonwealth Bank should either take over the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales or render it a reasonable measure of financial assistance on terms that will permit it to funetiou again on the scale obtaining prior to its suspension. The whole of the resources of the Commonwealth should be utilized to The avoid a banking crisis. I assume thai honourable members are conversant with the terms submitted by the Commonwealth Bank to the Government of New South Wales, and that it is not necessary for me to refer to them in detail. All I need say is that, in my opinion, they are unnecessarily harsh. the present parlous condition of our rural industries the position of the people on the land will be rendered desperate if the Eural Bank is compelled' to foreclose, and force off their holdings people who have received advances from it. A little while ago it was stated in this chamber that the wealth of Australia is £4,000,000,000. ""With all this wealth as a guarantee for the stability of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, surely an effort should be made to rehabilitate the Government Savings Bank of New South ""Wales. Whatever honourable members may think of the political events of the last few months, there should be on the part of all a definite desire to see that bank rehabilitated, knowing that if its existence is endangered other savings banks and private banks may also be affected. On other occasions I have expressed views hostile to private financial institutions, but I would devote all my energy, and all my time, to prevent an upheaval approaching in its intensity that of the 'nineties. History is valuable only for the lessons it teaches us. The history of the 'nineties must teach us plainly the lesson that we are now playing with gun-powder, and if we are not careful an explosion is not far off. It is the bounden duty of the Prime Minister and the Government to do all in their power to impress on the Commonwealth Bank Board the necessity for modifying the conditions it has laid down for the absorption of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, or at any rate for making them sufficiently reasonable that the State may still find it possible to accept them. desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister, and particularly of the Minister for Home Affairs, the tardiness of the Commonwealth in dealing with the buffalo fly pest. During a recent visit to Queensland, I discussed this matter with the Minister for Agriculture and Stock, the Honourable H . P. Walker, M.X.A., who complained of the scant courtesy he and his Government had received from the Commonwealth Government and the Minister for Home Affairs. I regret that the Commonwealth Government has not seen its way In to give financial assistance to the Queensland Government to enable it to prepare a buffer area by means of which the prevention of the spread of the pest may be attempted. 'Seeing that the buffalo fly first came into Queensland from the Northern Territory) which is Commonwealth territory,' a direct responsibility rests on the Commonwealth Government. At any rate, whatever expenditure is involved in trying to check the furtherspread of the fly may justly be regarded as national expenditure. If the buffalo fly is allowed to spread without hindrance, it will reach down to the east coast, and many millions of pounds will ultimately have to be spent in trying to prevent its further spread and its ultimate eradication. The Minister for Agriculture and Stock in Queensland and the senior officers of his department have made an exhaustive examination of the problem on the spot. They have travelled for many thousands of miles through the affected area. Mr Walker and his officers are cattlemen of life-long association with the cattle industry. They are, therefore, competent to give a judgment upon this particular problem, and after the thorough in vestigation they have made they are emphatically of the belief that a buffer area similar to that recommended in the report to the Minister for Home Affairs will be 100 per cent, effective in preventing the spread of this pest. I quote the following from the report of the Minister for Agriculture and Stock to the Minister for Home Affairs, to whom I am indebted for the copy which I am usingThe main consideration now is to devise a means whereby the further spread of the fly may be effectually arrested, and the fly prevented from infesting cattle in areas where the conditions of climate are more congenial to it than is the case in the Gulf country. In this connoxion, four methods of control have been suggested, viz (n) The establishment of a buffer area to the east and south of the infested area. (6) The control of stock movements by directing stock .along certain routes where the* climatic conditions are inimical to the existence of the fly. (c) The spraying of stock prior to entry into clean country. (d) The placing of the fly under biological control.",63,Mcgrath Fittingly Be Discussed Under The Depart
311,' Mr Francis (Moreton) [11.18],"ITho main consideration was the creation of a buffer area, the cost of creating which, although considerable, is in no way comparable with the loss of cattle, which is estimated will shortly be in the vicinity of £2,000,000 a year. land Government get busy? Minister for Home Affairs( Mr parasitic insects to be introduced would at Blakeley) the Queensland Government has indicated what it has already done and what it is further prepared to do, but the Commonwealth Government proposes practically to leave it to play a lone hand. If the problem is not tackled by putting into operation the proposal of the Minister for Agriculture and Stock, I am afraid that the ny will spread down the south coast of Queensland into the dairy-' ing country in the north and south coast areas and before long reach into New South Wales. In that case, the loss of stock and the consequential decrease of our national income would be colossal. The probable ruin of many of our producers in the pastoral and dairying industries is undoubtedly a matter of national concern. The Government of Queensland has given every facility to the officer appointed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to investigate the problem on the spot, and has offered its full co-operation with the Commonwealth Government, pointing out tlie urgeucy of the matter; but so far as I can ascertain, there has not yet been any consultation between the Minister for Home Affairs and any State Minister on this subject. All that the Commonwealth Government has done on its own initiative has been to propose, to treat the matter by biological control. This is only in the experimnetal stage. No definite result has yet been achieved from this method, although it is certainly full of possibilities, and on that ground the Commonwealth Government proposes to resort to apply it in dealing with the buffalo fly problem. It may be years before a satisfactory conclusion is reached. I quote the following report of the Minister for Agriculture and Stock upon this method:W it h reference to proposal d, the placing ward march of this pest. This point is of the fly under biological control presents considerable difficulty. A great deal of work in the nature of research and investigation has been carried out by the Council for Scientific arid Industrial Research, hut, to date the information obtained is not sufficient to allow ""bf the design oi a plan of biological control for this particular insect, although tbe results at this stage offer some promise of success being achieved later. Under the most favorable circumstances, it cannot be expected that the eradication of the fly wiii he possible by this means. Nothing more than a measure of control of the fly can be hoped for. The most be capable of keeping the numbers of buffalo flics within restriction, and preventing the fly from occasioning any seveae injur y to stock. My opinion is that to adopt this unsatisfactory method of dealing with a matter which may ultimately become a great national problem, is only baulking at the question, and that if prompt, and effective action is not taken to establish a buffer area it may later on be useless to do so. A buffer area would at least ensure that the fly is prevented from spreading. The biological test, according to a statement of the Minister made available to the press, is as yet only in the experimental stage. No complete scheme has been worked out, aud no possible relief can be expected for a number of years. Yet it was the only proposal put forward by the Commonwealth; the Queensland Government has practically been asked to play a lone hand in dealing with this big national problem. That Government and the pastoral and cattle men of Queensland are prepare/1 to make their contribution towards the cost of a buffer area, and they urge co-operation and ask for th* co-operation of the Commonwealth Government. I ask the Commonwealth Government to reconsider its attitude on this question, and to give a more satisfactory reply to the representation* put forward by the Queensland Government. I am satisfiedthat that Government would welcome an opportunity to discuss the whole problem with the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and the ley)/ But a buffer area should be declared immediately, while the biological tests are being pushed forwnrd, or, at any rate, until they prove to be successful.

315,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [11.31],"for Home Aifairs) [11.41J -live r since this Government ca'me into office it has displayed a keen interest in the important problem of the eradication of the bufi'aloiiy, for it has recognized that if the f l y gets a footing in our settled areas the results will be disastrous to our dairying herds, particularly on the coastal belts. Immediately after the Government came into office it arranged a conference w it h representatives of the Queensland government and other interested paints at Brisbane with the object of formulating a plan of campaign against the f l y ; but the conference was abortive. Reports were obtained later from the oflicers of the Councilf or Scienfrom the mainland, and there are also tific and Industrial Research, the Health Department, and the Home Affairs Department, which showed that the f ly was spreading in an alarming way. Subsequently 1 arranged for the Premier of Queensland to meet me in Canberra while he was here attending a Premiers Conference, and we discussed the matter with the Director-General of Health, D r . Cunipston, the Director of Veterinary Hygiene, D r . W. A . N . Robertson, D r . Tiliyard, D r . Mackerras, and an officer of my department. We went into the matter very f u l l y . The Commonwealth Government indicated that it was anxious to assist the Queensland Government to do everything possible to resist the invasion of the fly. A f t e r the Premier returned to Queensland, he wrote a letter to me to the effect that the Queensland Government considered the eradication of the pest was the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. W it h that contention this Government could not agree. However, it was arranged later that certain officers of the Councilf or Scientific and Industrial Research should visit Queensland and report upon the conditions. which D r . Mackerras then made showed that the fly was spreading very rapidly. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr. Francis) has advocated the proclamation of a buffer area, but neither D r . Mackerras nor Mr Walker, the Queensland Minister for Agriculture, considered that that action would be effective. In this connection, Mr Walker makes the following remarks i u a report to the Premier of Queensland:The creating of a buffer area would necessitate prompt action being taken by the Governments, in respect to the evacuation of branded stoat. Tlie matter ul uuuipuusution of owners fur the evacuation of their holdings is one that must be considered by both the Commonwealth and State Governments, and iu the event of the existing legislation being found inadequate to satisfactorily cope with this matter the introduction of special legislation would be necessary this session of Parliament. Provision should be made for. exceptionally heavy penalties in cases of infringement on the buffer, area. In considering the proposal to establish a buffer area, curtain obstacles would be encountered and the matters enumerated below must be considered 1. The length of the flight of which the fly is capable when assisted by favorable air currents. As stated by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), Mornington Island is situated about nineteen miles twelve miles of salty marshlands which are of no value for agistment purposes. There is, therefore, a total distance of nearly 32 miles between Mornington Island and the nearest point of agistment. The only stock introduced on to that Island since A p r i l , 1929, was one calf; but it was not unti l last December that the buffalo fly made its appearance there and caused such havoc among the dairy herds. Mr Walker's report continues2. The construction of boundary fences around the buffer area definitely proof to cattle and horses (the latter including a iarge number of brumbies that would be difficult to muster). It is estimated that there are 10,000 brumbies inside the proposed buffer area, and a similar number outside the area adjacent to the boundary fences. I have_also learnt that it should be an easy matter to destroy 76 per cent, of these animals, but the remaining 25 per cent, would be almost impossible to get rid of in a short space of time. It is also understood that there are large numbers of wild cattle in the proposed area which have not been mustered for some considerable time, if they have ever been mustered. 3. The effectual prevention of horsemen from traversing into or across the proposed buffer The survey area. 4. The almost insurmountable task of effecting a clean muster of cattle and horses within a short space of time. Other factors have been brought under the notice of his Government by the M in ister for Agriculture in Queensland, a perusal of. whose report will show the impossibility of establishing an effective buffer area. In view of the facts quoted, I cannot understand why the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) should quote only certain portions of the report.",67,Mcgrath Fittingly Be Discussed Under The Depart

The Government, however, made a generous offer to the Queensland Government to make available the services of certain scientists in the employ of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Health Department, and the Department of Home Affairs, and to advise upon methods of spraying. The Government also stated that it was prep°ared to extend its activities in the matter of biological control, and Professor Hansen, an overseas professor, who is at present working in Java, will, in the near future, proceed to Timor in an endeavour to secure a suitable parasite. At present a parasite known as "" B.Z."", as well as twelve others, are being tested. Entomological stations are to be established on Mornington Island, at Arrnraynald, in Queensland, and at Burnside and Brock's Creek in the Northern Territory, each of which will be under the control of entomologists capable of studying the breeding and distribution of parasites. It is likely to be a costly undertaking and the work will take some time, but we hope that science will, eventually, be able to eradicate the D buffalo fly. The Government, which feels that it has done everything humanly possible, cannot be reproached by the Queensland Government for auy lack of activity. I can appreciate the extraordinary difficulty with which governments have been confronted in dealing with the buffalo fly pest.

I insist that I am within my rights in discussing this matter under the "" administrative "" vote for the Prime Minister's Department, because it is clearly a matter of government policy. That was the ruling of the Chairman of Committees. I submit that neither the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) nor any other membeiis entitled to challenge my right to do this. They heard the matter discussed for half an hour by a member of the committee, and no point of order was taken. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN What the Prime Minister might, or might not do, is irrelevant to my ruling. have ruled that the honourable member may not discuss a matter which is not relevant to the Estimates under consideration. My duty is to see that the proceedings of this committee are conducted in accordance with the Standing Orders. Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) has moved to dissent from your ruling.

We of order, because the honourable member now have to decide whether the ruling for Werriwa dealt exclusively with the of the Temporary Chairman is correct. Government Savings Bank of New South May saysWales. If auy matter concerns the administration of the Government, surely ing in the committee a general discussion upon its banking policy and the taking over of savings banks by the Commonwealth is such a matter. The Prime Minister alone can speak for the Government on a matter of this kind. For that reason, and the others that I have advanced, I am, I submit, entitled to discuss this matter. Chairman of Committees ruled that the subject raised by the honourable member for Werriwa' was a matter of general policy which could be discussed when the Estimates of the Prime Minister's Department were under consideration, and it is equally true that neither I nor any other honourable member raised a I point of order when the honourable member was speaking. I did not interrupt the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa, although I did not agree with the Chairman's ruling. I saw no justification for it. If the subject referred to could properly be discussed as a matter of general policy in connection with the estimates of my department, any matter could be so discussed in connection with these estimates. But I was willing that the honourable member should be allowed to speak on the subject raised, and I was prepared to listen also to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill). The Temporary Chairman is within his rights in ruling that the honourable member for Warringah is now out of order, and-1 at this stage.

335,Mr Scullin,"It is true that thethe administration of the expenditure sanctioned by the Civil Service estimates, and debate must be kept to the specific object of strict sense of fairness applied to the the grant which is placed before the committee. There is no item in the Estimates covering either the Commonwealth Bank or the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. The fact that I have answered questions dealing with a matter of general policy does not permit honerable members to discuss the Government's administration in considering the estimates of the Prime Minister's Department. I answer questions of general policy that may relate to all departments, but it would not he permissible, in dealing with the Prime Minister's departmental estimates, to discuss every subject that relates to other departments. Strictly speaking, I do not believe that honourable members may discuss the position relating to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales under any division of the Estimates. Honourable members have many opportunities of discussing matters of government policy, but they cannot do so on the Estimates. They may do it during the budget debate, on specific motions, or on motions for the adjournment of the House. I submit that honourable members must now confine their remarks to the items contained in the Estimates. not the right honourable gentleman take that that point when the honourable member for Werriwa was speaking? mit a certain degree of indulgence in reable member for Calare( Mr Gibbons) gard to the discussion of an important endeavouring to obtain the call following matter, and I was ready to extend that the honourable member for Werriwa, and indulgence to the honourable member for I , too, hoped for an opportunity later to Warringah. AlthoughI could have taken speak on the matter also. If the ruling of that point at the time, I did not do so. the Chairman of Committees is upset, I think, however, that the ruling of the no opportunity will be given to discuss Chairman was wrong. HadI taken such the matter further. Therefore, I supa point of order after allowing the honorport the honourable member for Warable member for Werriwa to proceed with ringah. his speech, the honourable member for Warringah would have had a genuine grievance against me.

When this matter was raised by the honourable member for Werriwa, and a point of order was taken by an honourable member on the Opposition side, the feeling of the Prime Minister appeared to be that it was as well to dispose of the subject during the consideration of the estimates of the Prime Minister's Department. does not prove the ruling of the Temporary Chairman to be wrong. treated fairly in this chamber, whether honourable members agree with me or not, and to be fair to others. I suppose no honourable member of the committee disagrees with the honourable member for Warringah more than I do; but in this case it seems to me that he has not received the same treatment as was.extended to my colleague, the honourable member for Werriwa. Apparently, if you, Mr Crouch, remain in the Chair until we reach the Department of the Treasury, you may then repeat your present ruling, and no opportunity will be given further to discuss the matter. x No doubt you have the right to rule as you think fit, but when the Chairman of Committees has declared a certain form of procedure will be followed, those who subsequently take the chair should, I think, follow the preMotion-by leave-withdrawn .",72,Parkhill The Point Was Then Taken That This

341,Mr Archdale Parkhill,"I havedirect attention to the representation of Australia in the United States of America and ask the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) if he considers that we are getting an effective return for the expenditure incurred. I have no fault to find with the officers concerned, but I doubt that our representation is of any value to the Commonwealth. The officers who are employed there might be able to serve Australia more effectively if they were transsome time, vessels other than those tradferred to the sister dominion of Canada, and carried out duties on behalf of the Markets Department. Another matter about which I am concerned has to do with the administration in New Guinea. About twelve months ago, the Government, realizing the serious position that was developing in connection with the price of copra, came to the assistance of the planters by declaring a moratorium for twelve months. That moratorium has been renewed recently. When it was declared, the price of copra was £14 a ton. To-day, the price is £11 15s., and if one subtracts from that amount expenditure on account of insurance, freight and other charges, amounting to . about £7 a ton, the net'return to planters is not sufficient to cover c03t of production. Consequently, the planters arc in a desperate plight. They appreciate very highly the efforts of the Government on their behalf, but they wish me to remind the Prime Minister that they are carrying the whole burden of taxation in New Guinea, professional officers, business people and public servants not being taxed in any shape or form. They suggest that, in order to give relief, the very high export duty on copra should be removed. The TEMPOEARY CHAIRMAN (Hon. R. A. Crouch) --The honourable member's remarks are out of order. The Prime Minister's Department is charged with the administration of New Guinea, but it has nothing whatever to do with the export duty on copra. Prime Minister's Department controls the administration of New Guinea my remarks are in order, because we cannot discuss the administration under any other department. I am aware that the Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley) has been dealing with this question, and has given it his sympathetic consideration, but I hope that the Prime Minister will realize the seriousness of the position confronting the administration of New Guinea, and if possible give some relief to the planters. Another question to which I direct attention has relation to the shipping services under item 16, "" Shipping and mail services to the Pacific Islands"". For ing to Australian ports, have been visiting outports, picking up copra for transhipment at the main ports. Several German ships have come into the trade recently, and as these are manned by coolie labour, they are in unfair competition with vessels of the Burns, Philp line which observe Australian conditions, although not obliged to do so. These foreign vessels take copra from outports free to the mainports, and, at the same time, they carry German agents whose business it is to push the sale of German commodities as against Australian products. It has been suggested that a duty of 10s. per ton on all cargo picked up at outports. would clear up the position and enable us to maintain an Australian shipping service under Australian conditions in the islands. associate myself with the remarks made by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) concerning our representation in the United States of America, and I suggest, apart from trade and customs representation, and perhaps Treasury representation in connexon with loan operations, the Government should consider whether it is necessary to maintain the New York office on its present basis. official now doing the work formerly done by the High Commissioner? administration has been substantially reduced during the last twelve months, but my point is that, as our trade with the United States of America shows an adverse balance, there is no particular reason why we should maintain the office on an elaborate scale. We should concentrate upon Canada, where there is a reasonable prospect of building up increased trade. I also wish to know what",73,Parkhill The Point Was Then Taken That This

346,Mr Coleman,"Yes. The cost offurther savings in our London representation, if any, have been effected. I direct attention to the misleading manner in which the Estimates of the Commonwealth have been presented for some years. , The need for uniformity between the practices of the States and the Commonwealth in the presentation of Estimates is urgent, both from a financial and from an economic standpoint, and I suggest that a conference be Jmld between Treasury officials with a view to ensuring uniformity in future. Because of the application of different methods, considerable difficulty was experienced at the recent Melbourne conference in arriving at a satisfactory basis for the purpose of a comparison between the respective estimates of the Commonwealth and the States Our estimates do not disclose the true cost of departmental activities. I cite as one example the presentation of accounts in connection with the High Commissioner's office. According to the Treasury estimates, the cost for 1931-32 will be £49,000. but when I conducted an inquiry last year in London, I discovered that the cost, in round figures, was £62,000, but associated activities cost another £61,000, so tbe total cost of London representation in that year was £124,000. Presumably, a similar result would be shown in these estimates if the cost of associated activities were added in an explanatory footnote, or in some other form, so that honourable members would know what is the real cost of our representation in London. In 1929-30 the cost, excluding the agencies-general and other non-Commonwealth activities, was £200,000. Somewhere iu the neighborhood of that total would be shown in these estimates if all the revelant items were included under the High Commissioner's Office. Por example, the estimates for the High Commissioner's Office do not include the cost of the liaison officer, whose salary is provided under the Department of the Prime Minister. officer in London? the salary of the trade and customs officer is shown under the Trade and Customs Department, and that of the veterinary officer under the Markets Department, while the High Commissioner's salary i& provided under a special appropriation in the commencement of the Estimates. There are various other items which I do not wish to elaborate, but which all go to make up a further total of £60,000. veterinary officer in London? work in connection with our export trade in meat. But there is also a dairy officer there, and a number of other Commonwealth activities. The point I wish to make is that, although these Estimates show the cost of the High Commissioner's Office to be about £49,000, the real cost, including the associated activities, is-in the neighbourhood of £200,000. In 1929-30, the cost of our London office, including the representations of the States, was £312,000, or, if we deduct £69,000 for the Agencies-General, a total of £243,000. I think I am right in saying that the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) has in the past criticized the manner in which these estimates are submitted; but time and matters of more importance have prevented him from taking the necessary action to have them presented in a way that would readily disclose the true position. In my report, I"" directed attention to the manner in which the salaries of 93 clerks, typists, storemen, messengers, telephonists, and assistants were shown, and suggested that it would be more helpful if the Estimates gave more details in the case of officers in receipt of salaries of £800 a year or thereabouts. Parliament is entitled to know how much these activities are costing Australia. The Auditor General has, on more than one occasion, directed attention to the manner in which the accounts are presented, and has emphasized that the information should be shown in a way that could be readily understood by the general public. for Defence) [1.13 a.m.] -The suggested removal of the export duty on copra, mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) has already received Similarly, attention.

Ooonplaints have been made of this unfair competition,and recently it was suggested that, to meet the situation that had arisen, we should impose a tonnage duty on all cargo shipped from outports in foreign vessels which are trading in competition with the vessels of the Burns, Philp line. The whole question is now under review. It has been brought, under my notice that restrictions of the character suggested have been applied,in relation to"" the same matter in other Pacific islands* and I am having inquiries made as to their result. -Of the £52,000 provided for Pacific mail services £8,000 is paid to Burns, Philp and Company fofc supplying a service to the Solomon Islands. The prin cipal trade done by the steamers which. , maintain this service is the carrying of logs to Sydney 'and Melbourne, where they are sawn into ""planks-. But on the 20th June of last year the"" Minister for Trade and Customs placed a prohibitive duty on these logs, although similar timber from North Borneo was still allowed to come in at a 10 per cent, tariff. The company which is importing these logs from the Solom'on Islands, which, for 'some ihexA pli'cable reason,. have been subjected to this prohibitive duty, is registered in Victoria. It is purely Australian ; all its shareholders are Australian; its 'capital is approximately £100,000, and it spends at least £8,000 a year in wages. It buys Australian goods only for its white staff and native labourers. Yet it is denied an opportunity to import its timber except at a prohibitive rate of duty. On several occasions the Minister has been asked t'o rectify this anomaly, but all that he can promise is that when the item is under consideration in this chamber attention will be given to any representations that may be made to him. At present the company is importing logs and sawing them in bond under special permission, in the hope that the excessive duty will ultimately be removed. I trust that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Cust6ms will give immediate attention to this matter,and not wait until the tariff ite'rh. is reached, which may not be' until Christmas, or possibly Mafdh next before then'. meantime, the' company may' have to wind up. The Minister for Markets has made ah arrangement with Canada. Let hini collaborate with the Minister for Trade and Customs td have the duty on timber from the Sdloihoii Islands, which is also a British possession, brought into line with the duty on timber from North Borneo; or cut out the subsidy to the shipping company. Mi\ JASiES (Hunter) [1.19 a.m..] -On page 23 of the Estimates is the item, "" Travelling expenses of Commonwealth Ministers, £3,000"".

I , therefore, move^ That 'tlie item "" Travelling expenses erf Commonwealth Ministers-£3,00 0 "" be omitted. There are under the Prime Minister's Department several items for travelling expenses totalling in all £13,300, and nt a time like this I think we should show our sincerity, or, at any rate, practice what we preach to the invalid and old-age pensioners, by asking Ministers to do without this extra £3,000. Despite the recent cut, Ministers with portfolios are still in receipt of £1,520 a year each, an'fl Assistant Ministers refceive '£1,200. The £3,000 provided for their travelling 'expenses could be devoted to 'a better use. It could be used to advantage by subsidizing the research that is now going on in an endeavour to extract oils from coal. If Lyon Brothers, who at their own expense are experimenting in that direction at Wallsend, were given some encouragement, I think 'they could do good work for this country.

The coal industry is certainly deserving of assistance. Provision is made in these Estimates for assistance to mining and metallurgy, but there is no item for the coal industry which, as the Prime Minister knows, is in a languishing state today. It has been proved in other countries that oil can be extracted from coal on a commercial basis, and we are now importing oil to the value of nearly £16,000,000 per annum. I admit that £100,000 was set aside for the coal industry, but that money has now been transferred to the shale oil industry. for the repatriation of coal-miners, but at the special request of the coal-miners' organizations, it was transferred to the shale industry. miners approved of its transfer to the shale industry, but at the same time. I contend that it has been proved that the present methods of using coal are wasteful, arid that we should encourage th? establishment of research plants such a? that which has been installed by the Lyon Brothers-a t Wallsend. The money provided for the travelling expenses of Commonwealth Ministers could well be devoted to that deserving establishment, tlie purpose of which is to GOiiduet researches into the extraction of oil from coal. ter) [1.29 a.m.] -The expenditure on the representation of Australia iu the United States of America has been reduced from £11,000 to £6,000 a year.

The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) and otjaer honourable mem bers have referred to the amounts pro posed to be voted for travelling expenses. which 1 intended to refer, namely, £2,500 as travelling allowance and salaiy for the secretaries to the Leaders of the Opposition. ber will see that certain amounts are provided in the proposed votes for every department for travelling allowances for Ministers and departmental officers engaged in public business away from their homes. If Ministers and public servants were paid salaries covering travelling allowances, clearly those salaries would be too large for normal needs. On the other hand, if the salaries were equitable for the work ordinarily performed, they would not allow ,any margin to meet additional expenditure incurred when travelling ou public business. The amount spent in travelling allowances includes transport by motor car, and other means. This expenditure has greatly decreased in the last few years. The amount spent in the Prime Minister's Department under this heading in 1928-29 was £7,078; in 1929-30 it was £4,593, and last year it was £2,564.

My main reason for speaking at the moment is to draw attention to another matter. In the report on Australia House, which the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) presented to the Government, I find the following introductory paragraph:Under date 9th May, 1930, I received from the Right Honourable J. H . Scullin, P.C., M.P., Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, the following letter:The Government would be glad if , whilst in London, you would, in your capacity of chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Public Accounts, inquire into and report upon the organization of the Higli Commissioners Office and the activities associated therewith. I submit that the Prime Minister was not . entitled to ask the honourable member for Reid to make his inquiry in his capacity as chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Public Accounts Committee Act provides that the committee may only function when a quorum is present, and it cannot be contended that the chairman alone constitutes a quorum of the committee.

In my opinion this expenditure is extravagant and entirely unwarranted at present. Australia has not derived any material advantage from the maintenance of this office in the United States of America at a cost of anything up to £2,000 per annum. sents the rent of a property leased by the Government of which the honourable member was a supporter. cannot understand why £10,000 should be provided when, at present, we have no Commissioner-General in the United .States of America.

During recent week.3, the attention of this Parliament has been devoted almost entirely to reducing pensions of invalids, the aged, the salaries of public servants, and the maternity allowance. From time to time we have been informed of the necessity for equality of sacrifice, but in this instance Ministers of the Crown who are in receipt of a substantial allowance, and. them to travel free of cost on the railare also provided with free transport, will not make any real sacrifice. We have been informed that the finances of this country are in a precarious condition, and the banks are threatening the Government that unless economies are effected no further accommodation will be made available. While the Government has exerted its energies in reducing the payments in some instances almost to the last penny of those who can ill afford to make any sacrifice, its members who enjoy privileges which have never been experienced by these unfortunate people are to nar-ticipate in an expenditure of £3,000 which is wholly unwarranted. Is it nottime that Ministers who have many facilities at their disposal, should make some sacrifice? Members of this Parliament, particularly those age and invalid pensions have been representing extensive electorates in Queensland and Western Australia, incur considerable expense out of their own pockets, and it is time that Ministers met their expenditure in the same way. One could give Ministers credit for some sincerity if they made some sacrifice; but it appears that, while.they are anxious to extract, the last penny from the unforbe treating him quite as fairly as it hat tunate pensioners, they intend to fight to the last ditch any interference with the rights and privileges which they now enjoy. port the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) to delete the item of £3,000 for the travelling expenses of Commonwealth Ministers. The right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) said that, if I wished to be logical, I should move for the deletion of all travelling allowances. If every member of the Commonwealth Public Service received a travelling allowance of 30s. a day the position would be different. The Prime Minister must realize that there are many public servants, such as messengers, who receive a comparatively small salary, who could not be expected to meet their own travelling expenses. and others receive higher travelling allowances than Ministers. plied with a gold pass, which enable* ways. of public servants travelling on official business is also"" met by tbe Government. draw higher travelling allowances than Ministers. was opposed to any public servant in receipt of £750 a year or over drawing any travelling allowance. public servants, each drawing £750 or £800 a year, one of whom may have to travel on official business, while the other may not.

Another sentence isWhilst governments and the nation as a whole have their own role to play in the reduction of costs of production and in increasing efficiency, science can take an equally important part. But the report does not indicate the extent to which the activities of the council will promote that end. Its work is related exclusively to material factors. Its operations are devoted chiefly to plant industries, animal nutrition-not human beings; animal health-not that of human beings; and so forth. On the whole, without reflecting in any way upon the good work that the council may be, and probably is, doing, it may be said that there is evidence of extraordinary inconsistency in the expenditure of the vast sum that is involved, without any attempt being made apparently to consider even the overlapping with, for example, the Health Department, that a previous speaker referred to. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are being spent, and will continue to .be spent, without any attempt at reconstruction, either financial ""or to achieve the general objectives of the organization as an agency of genuine science. This, I think, has been brought about chiefly by the fact that it is an organization which was based upon the reports of Sir Frank Heath, who was brought from England to this country by the previous Federal Government,doubtless at a considerable fee. by that gentleman bristled with such words as "" scientific"", and so forth; but a sinister silence was maintained in regard to the human and social factor of existence, without which such words are barren of intelligent meaning, viewing larger aspects of life, aud especially in the light of existing A-rmarently the basic principle was that this organization should secure the confidence of every one in Australia and abroad, except the workers in industry, and their trade union and parliamentary representatives. defence of that gentleman, that this was not his business; but even if we concede this, it was certainly the business of those who were in office and in power at that time. To-day we have to consider Mr El-dridge. whether, in view of the drastic cuts that have been imposed on the most defenceless section of the community, expenditure of this kind is justified. We are entitled to ask whether this is not another example of riotous extravagance that calls for immediate attention. It seems strange to me that while the Government has surrendered those principles which brought it into power, it apparently is either blind or indifferent to the equity of effectthat of ing economies in expenditure of this nature. Other honourable members have spoken of the necessity for a revision of items of this type, and I endorse their views. It would be idle to say that this country is not in need of some council of a scientific nature, and I should not like my'remarks to convey the impression that I do not believe iu the application of scientific principles to the affairs of this country. But apart from the economies that might be effected directly, the time has surely arrived for insisting that the work of this council shall include social science activities bearing on the human factor in industry and society in general. I consider that a very good case can be made out for the establishment of consumer economics and home welfare organizations, such as have been established in the TJnited States of America, and in several parts of Europe. One of the greatest of the controlling forces in the economic situation to-day is the purchasing power of the home-maker. The initial report furnished Is not that something which is entitled to be given some semblance of scientific "" industrial"", consideration? The true conception of Australia is, not merely that of a nation of 6,500,000 persons, but of a community of about 2,000,000 homes. About four-fifths of the nation's retail spending is in the hands of women, who are thus the ultimate controlling force in every circumstances. avenue of production and distribution. The welfare of the child is inextricably bound up with a home life, which is satisfactory psychologically, materially, and spiritually, and is conserved and promoted only to the extent It may be urged in that its interests are fostered and directed with the fullest advantages of modern science iu the most wise application of the laws of nature. The womanhood and motherhood of Australia would strongly support activities such as these. It surely is a tragic commentary on Australian civilization that there is no Federal Government agency to deal with these problems. Although Australian scientists have visited the United States of America, I have found no record of reports having been submitted to the Commonwealth Government of the activities in that country in the direction of the establishment of women's and children's bureaux, and the consideration of human and home economics. In that country problems concerning the welfare of the child are regarded as of paramount importance, as is shown by the conferences held there periodically. Some of these, including the ""White House conference on child welfare, and motherhood problems, aro of an international character, and have been conducted under the personal presidency .of the President of the United States of America. I suggest that, instead of passing estimates involving great expenditure on activities that are comparatively inconsequential, some attention, should be paid to more constructive and socially urgent work, such as I have outlined, on which the exf enditure would be better justified, t is difficult to find any information regarding tbe sessions of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Besearoh. Apparently, only two meetings «f the full council are held annually. In view of the general desire for economy, the Government would be well advised fco give careful attention to the activities of this body, with a view to effecting savings of a real character and its entire reorganization. In its investigations, it sliould pay due regard to social science and the human factor in industry. [2.20 a.m.] -It is due to the members of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research that I should say that their work has proved of real value to. Australia. The expenditure contemplated for this year represents a decrease compared with last year. There will be no expenditure from revenue this financial year, because£71,000 is being provided from the trust fund, and £32,643 has been contributed from outside sources. Another £14,000 has been received from outside aources since the Estimates have been prepared. ing on a grant of £500,000? trust fund is almost exhausted. To show that the work of this body is of practical value to the country, I may mention thai the Empire Marketing Board has provided £5,071 for the investigation of animal health, the Australian Pastoral Research Trust £2,071, the Queensland Government £1,000, the United Graziers Association of Queensland £1,000, and the meat export industry £1,000. In addition to those sums, the Empire Marketing Board contributes £9,700 for the investigation of plant diseases, and £7,351 for entomological research. Other important items are-Rura l Credits Development Fund, £1,000; Empire Marketing Board, £1,475; and Australian Pastoral Research Trust, £1,475, for the investigation of animal nutrition: and the ""Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales, £1,500 for horiticultural investigation. organization, under the control of the Commonwealth Government, devote its activities exclusively to those subjects? tlie discovery of improved methods of production is of assistance to the human family.

The work of the council could be extended to other activities, but all that it accomplishes will be of assistance to the community in increasing production. The discovery of the cactoblastis, for the eradication of the prickly pear was of immeasurable importance. I believe from reports that the council is meeting with success in its efforts to cope with that noxious weed know as St. John's Wort, which is prevalent in Victoria, and if the success is as great as is promised, it will he of worldwide importance.

I have mentioned but a few of the investigations that have been undertaken by the council. When we find that organizations like the United Graziers Association of Queensland is contributing its cash to the work, it shows that great faith is placed in the labours of the council. It is true that many years may be spent before practical results are achieved in particular directions. But the results likely to be obtained are of such far-reaching importance that they will more than justify the expenditure involved. The suggestions of the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) are worthy of consideration, and the Government regrets that owing to the financial position the activities of this the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) body have been restricted. a.m.] I am delighted to hear the statements of the Prime Minister concerning the valuable work accomplished already by the council. He mentioned that years may elapse before practical results are obtained in certain directions; but the members of the council are a most enthusiastic body, and they are giving their besi services to Australia. I regret that the Government has found it necessary to restrict the expenditure on this work for the present year. Every new discovery made by the council will result in an enormous increase in Australia's productivity. Such investigations as those into animal health and plant diseases are of the utmost value to this country, and I hope that the Government will do its utmost to keep the personnel of this organization at its full strength. Too much importance cannot be attached to the work of this body. I point out that we have a staff of men in Canberra who are giving attention at the present time to the very matter that has been raised by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge). MacKenzie and his staff are particularly interested in human muscular development. Scientists throughout the world have drawn attention to the failure of the nervous system of man to maintain a standard of strength sufficient to cope with the demands of modern life. I would like to see a greatly increased vote given to. the scientists, who are engaged by the council. I cannot allow the statement to go unchallenged that Australia is not paying proper attention to the physical development of the human race. We should give f u ll credit to those who are doing valuable work for the community under unfavorable circumstances. I be; lieve that some of these officers have voluntarily surrendered a considerable percentage of their salaries, and, in view of the importance of the branch, I consider that they should not have been included in the retrenchment scheme even, at such a critical time as the present. I was pleased to hear the criticism of of the remarks made by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) who displayed a lamentable lack of knowledge concerning the functions of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Other honourable members were similarly in the dark, one speaker even confusing the council with the Health Department, If honourable members had studied the bulletins issued by the council they would know that already it has saved Australia many millions of pounds in connection with prickly pear and other pests, and would have realized also that, in the fulfilment of its functions, it will bring material benefit to wage-earners also. The staff is a comnaratively small one for tlie immense amount of research work that is being carried out. I also remind the honourable member for Martin that the other members of the council's personnel he was worried about were scientists attached to our various universities. Their services ane co-opted, and they meet twice a year to further the work of the council. Reference has also been made to the representation of the Commonwealth in the United States of America. Last year the CommissionerSir Colin General voluntarily retired from his position, because, in view of the difficult financial position that 'was then developing, he believed Australia could not afford to continue the expenditure, and in his report he admitted that Australia could not expect to derive much",83,Parkhill The Point Was Then Taken That This

Considerable expenditure on travelling allowances must, I assume, be incurred by the Governor General, the Public Service Board, and the Auditor-General, but I believe it is possible to make further savings in allowances to the various departments. I do not intend to vote for the amendment, because I feel sure that the Government will do what is possible to improve the position in this respect. The cost of our representation in the United States of America has been reduced from £11,228 in 1930-31 to an estimated expenditure for this year of £6,518, or a saving of £4,700. I wish to pay my tribute to the patriotic action of bert Brookes, who resigned last year. He and Mrs. Brookes rendered sisrual service to the Commonwealth during the period of his appointment.

Seeing that Australia is already practically disarmed the Government can do no more than it has done to encourage international disarmament. Actions are better than precepts, and deeds are better than words in a matter of this kind. If this money is spent it will only provide another picnic trip overseas for a Minister. Four Ministers of this Government expense of the taxpayers, and there is no justification -whatever for sending another Minister abroad. I look upon these visits as holiday trips in the main, although I know that the Prime Minister will dispute this view. If the sending of another Minister abroad would do anything to encourage disarmament, something might be said in favour of the voting of this money; but Australia has already set an example to the world, and that is the best thing that she can do. It is remarkable how quickly the members of tbe Government took advantage of their office to take picnic jaunts abroad. I know that I have been making some pertinent-som e honourable members called them impertinent-inquirie s into certain matters, and perhaps Ministers are quite willing to get away from me; but I shall continue to object to the expenditure of public funds on travelling allowances, overseas picnic jaunts, and the like while the country is in its present deplorable economic condition. support the amendment of the honourable I may be member for Angas( Mr Gabb). The visits of Ministers overseas are neither expense of the taxpayers. The expenditure of money in this way cannot be justified while we have so many unemployed in our midst.

Towards maintenance of Cockatoo Island Dockyard on nucleus basis, £42,000. Repairs to plant and buildings at Cockatoo Island Dockvard, £10,000. What is done with the £250 voted for the Empire Parliamentary Association ? I understand that the Shipping Board has control of certain funds of its own for operations at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Is the amount of £52,000 provided iu these Estimates an additional sum to be spent in maintenance and repairs to plant and buildings at the dockyard? If it is, it will be very acceptable at the present time. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) for the deletion of the item, "" World conference on reduction and limitation of armaments, £2,000."" The Government cannot possibly justify this expenditure at present. About two years ago the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Penton), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, attended a Disarmament Conference in London as the representative of the Commonwealth Government; but I have yet to learn that anything useful was accomplished at that conference. It would be useless for the Government to send a representative to another Disarmament Conference. Australia, as has already been pointed out, is already practically disarmed. In view of the attacks that have been made upon pensions, wages and social services in this country, we should insist that the expenditure of £2,000 in providing what would amount to a holiday overseas for a Minister, is entirely unwarranted. There has already been a good deal of criticism concerning the expenditure involved in connection with the recent tripe abroal by Ministers. Public attention has already been focussed on the fact that the Prime Minister, who attended the recent Imperial Conference, had an opportunity to discuss, from an Australian view-point, the question of disarmament with other delegates at that conference. The Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) was also in London at the same time to discuss with other delegates at that conference certain trade matters affecting Australia and the dominions. The Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) was Australia's representative at the Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations,, and the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) was Australia's delegate at the International Labour Conference of the League of Nations. Sir Robert Garran, the Solicitor-General, and other Commonwealth officials were also members of the delegation. I bring these facts under the notice of the Prime Minister in view o.f the criticism which, undoubtedly, will be levelled against the action of the Government in proposing to send a representative to the forthcoming Disarmament Conference In view of the fact that quite a number of Ministers have recently visited Great Britain, the Government's proposed action in this instance cannot",88,Miscellaneous Services

This amount is provided to supplement the earnings of the dockyard, and to keep the staff employed on a nucleus basis. An additional sum of £10,000 is also provided for the maintenance of plant and equipment. used for repairs and maintenance? supplement the earnings of the dockyard and the £10,000 is to be used for the maintenance of the plant. present under construction at the dockyard. it is a valuable asset which cannot bo allowed to go to disrepair. As a large amount of capital has been expended at Cockatoo Island, the Government cannot allow what is, perhaps, the most valuable plant of its kind in Australia, to get into a state of disrepair. I regret that a further sum cannot be made available for this purpose. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) also referred to criticisms which will be levelled against the Government for providing £2,000 for a representative .of the Commonwealth to attend the forthcoming Disarmament Conference. It is quite true that there may be some criticism, but it will not be well-founded. Proposed expenditure is usually criticized, but that criticism becomes more acute during periods of depression. The honourable member has said that at least four Ministers have visited Great Britain on official business during the last twenty months, but he should realize that the circumstances have been exceptional. In connection with the Naval Disarmament Conference the Government hesitated for some time before sending a delegate, but I was very pleased with the way in which the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, represented Australia at that most important gathering. Imperial Conferences are held once in every three years, and our representation at the last of such gatherings was the tralia has ever sent. The honourable member also referred to the presence in London of the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) who performed excellent work, not only in London, but also in Canada. orable gentleman does not think I was criticizing the work of the Minister for Markets. able member referred to the outside criticism which will be levelled against the Government, which^ I am now endeavouring to meet. I know that it is easy to refer to such vessels are at trips as picnics, but as one who has had some experience in attending such gatherings, I have no hesitation in saying that the work imposed upon Ministers on such occasions is of a most arduous nature, and cannot be regarded as in any sense a picnic. . The experience which Ministers gain abroad is of great advantage, but it' is belittling the services which publie men render to their country to refer to the trips which they make as picnics. The Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) represented Australia at the last Assembly of the League of Nations, where Australia has, up to the present, always been , represented. This will be the first occasion on which the Commonwealth has not sent a representative from Australia to the League. Although a Minister is not being sent, we shall be well represented. In view of our present financial position, it is the desire of the Government to effect economies wherever possible. The forthcoming assembly will be comparatively unimportant as compared with the conference to be held in February. This is the first attempt which the League has made to convene a general disarmament conference, and, if this Government stands for anything, it is for general disarmament. I hope that we shall soon see the day when we shall be able to adopt a policy of complete disarmament. As efforts are",89,Miscellaneous Services

I do not propose to attend tbe conference on disarmament, nor has the Government decided who shall represent Australia. It may not be possible for a Minister to attend. I agree with the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) that this is an important international gathering, and, as the party which I have the honour to lead favours world peace, the Government should be represented at the first international conference on general disarmament. Where there are armaments there is always the danger of war. would feed all the hungry people in the world, and by assisting to secure world peace we shall be helping those who are in need. There is an item of £250 for repatriating distressed Australians abroad, upon which I should like some information from the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin). During the three years I was in London, I came in contact with many Australians who wished to be repatriated. I should like to know how the proposed vote is expended. [3.27 a.m.] -This money is expended in assisting Australians who, being stranded in London, wish to return io Australia. In most cases money is available, after investigation, in the form of a loan, which is repaid by the friends or relatives of those receiving it . When those wishing to he repatriated have no friends to repay the-money advanced, it is paid in the form of a grant. Instances have occurred in which girls have left Australia to go to London to try their fortunes, and have eventually become stranded. When the parents of such persons are unable to pay their return fare, a thorough investigation is made, and, if the case is genuine, assistance is rendered. The money is usually repaid, sometimes over a period of years. I hope that the proposed disarmament conference, at which I understand Australia is to be represented, will not be held. It may be most dangerous if the nations are brought together when Europe is in such an unsettled state. If Germany is to meet rival nations, who will be voicing their claims and ambitions, it would not take much to bring about another international conflict. already been decided upon. through. certain claims which are refused by the other nations, she may withdraw from the League of Nations and claim the.right to arm herself, which may precipitate another war involving practically every other The money spent on armaments nation. Great Britain's armaments have been steadily reduced until the personnel of the British Navy is now 20,000 below that of the United States of America. Great Britain is ths only nation which is in a weaker position than at the termination of the Great War. I suggest that this amount be not allocated, and that, if the conference does eventuate, the Prime Minister should delegate an Australian naval expert in the Royal Navy, or some other authority who is at present in Great Britain, to represent Australia at it . That would be. much better than having the Attorney-General posturing as he did at Geneva, and with no knowledge of the subject, informing the nations of the world that Australia had already disarmed. I support the deletion of this amount. I am not. so confident as some speakers of the benefits that might accrue as a result of our being represented at a so-called disarmament conference. There is no disguising the fact that some nations, particularly those who participated in the last Great War, desire a holiday in the matter of armaments, because they feel that they cannot help themselves; they have either to reduce their armaments to a minimum, or face national bankruptcy and internal disruption, such as Germany is experiencing to-day. But' in every country the scientists are devoting the whole of their time, not in the interests of humanity, to the preservation of peace, but to devising the most dreadful means by which human life may be destroyed. That proves conclusively that the nations are desirous not of preserving",90,Miscellaneous Services

So long as the competitive system operates, and the capitalists of different countries compete with each other for spheres of influence, economic conflict eventually will lead to armed conflict. The only way in which we can move towards peace is by altering the social order under which we live So long as there is competition for markets we shall ' be faced with the possibility of war; and it will be on a larger and more destructive scale than the last conflict. The Government's solicitude for the welfare of humanity, and the preservation of peace, can be gauged by turning to page 271 of the Estimates, where it will be found that only £500 is provided for subsidies and expenses in connection with maternal and infantile hygiene, while the subsidy for cattle tick control in Queensland and New South Wales amounts to £44,450. That is a striking illustration of the attitude of the Government towards the preservation of human life. To-day human life is the cheapest commodity procurable. Conference after conference has been held for the purpose of bringing about dis-. armament. share of the expenses of the secretariat of the League of Nations amounts to £30,000. I have not yet seen any advantage accrue to this country because of its participation in these conferences. Some speakers have said that this will be a pleasure trip, or a holiday, for a Minister or some other person who is regarded favourably by the Government. I agree that that is exactly what it will be. I have DO doubt of what the result will be, and I shall vote for the amendment with a view to saving this country £2,000. ringah) [3.35 a.m.] -It will be observed that the sum of £52,000 is to be spent on Cockatoo Island dockyard this year. In addition, the dockyard is being given a preference amounting to £50,000 in connection with the lighthouse steamer that is being built there. Therefore, in effect it is being subsidized to the extent of practically £2,000 a week at the expense of the Commonwealth revenues. I consider that the public should be supplied with information as to the benefits that are conferred by the dockyard which warrant that contribution being made to keep it in existence. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) argues that the expenditure is justified, because a large quantity of valuable machinery would otherwise lie idle. I contend, however, that an expenditure of £100,000 per annum for the purpose is not economic, and cannot be alforded. Another aspect of the matter is that this subsidy, which is made with the taxpayers' money, enables the dockyard to compete with Morts Dock, and the enterprise of the State Government at Walsh Island, in which large sums that have also been contributed by the taxpayers are invested. almost leased Cockatoo Island Dockyard. made a determined and vigorous effort to rid itself of this expenditure. gentleman concerned did not come forward. fortunately for this country. It should be shown that there is justification for such a vast sum being taken out of the public revenues for this purpose. It ia I notice that Australia's true that the dockyard is in the electorate of the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore); but that is merely a coincidence. for this amount being placed on the Estimates.. he will not be responsible for anything connected with the dockyard after the next election. 6i6ct0r£lt6 is on the border of the Dalley electorate, and a merciful providence, or a wise discrimination, provides that every man who is employed there lives in that electorate. I strongly protest against £100,000 being taken from the public purse and dumped into this sieve at the present period of financial stress. No justification has been given for it.

505,Mr Archdale Parkhill,"I tam not satisfied with the explanation that has been given by the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) in relation to the reduction of the amount provided under this item. Although the desirability of preserving peace is everywhere proclaimed, all the European nations that sit in conference to consider the question of disarmament are preparing for future wars by building armaments as fast as circumstances will allow. At the present time, Germany is appealing for assistance to establish herself economically, but concurrently is building a number of new battleships. France, on the other hand, refuses to grant her assistance so long as she continues that policy. Tho Prime Minister claims that the expenditure on the repatriation of distressed Australians abroad is justifiable. I say that it is also justifiable to give some assistance to good Australian citizens who are starving in this country, and whose cases have been brought under his notice from time to time. He has absolutely refused to grant such requests, the pretext being that it is a matter for the States. If it is logical to say that those who are hungry and who desire medical attention are the responsibility of the States, it is equally logical to say that the relief of distressed Australians abroad is also a matter for the States, because those persons come from some State or another; or that they should be the responsibility of the country in which they are domiciled. An amount of £100 is provided for this year for the entertainment of visitors. Last year, the sum of £200 was appropriated, of which £182 was spent I do not suppose that these visitors are on the dole, or that they are hungry and footsore. fed. spent the £100 provided for their entertainment in feeding some of the hungry members of our community. The sum of £3,000 is set down to defray the expenses of an investigation into the tobacco-growing industry. I should like the Prime Minister to explain how that amount will be expended, and who the recipients will be. I notice that £343 was spent last year, and £150 is voted this year in connection with the Premiers Conferences. How is this money expended) AmI to understand that the salaries of the State Premiers cease when they attend these conferences? ter) [3.40 a.m.] -The vote for £150 is not for meeting expenses of Ministers, but it covers the travelling expenses of officers for the whole year. Last year the conferences were fairly frequent, and one lasted for three weeks. It is anticipated that the expenditure under this heading in the coming year will not be so heavy as it was last year. There is an item of £3,000 in connection with the British, Australian, ""and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition; I would like the Prime Minister to inform the committee why that expenditure is necessary. While I strongly advocate world disarmament, I suggest that the proposed expenditure of £2,000 for the representation of the Commonwealth at the. forthcoming disarmament conference is unwarranted, in view of the fact that the Government has been compelled to adopt a cheeseparing policy. I understand that the Government contemplates sending a Minister or an officer abroad to attend this conference. ter) [3.50 a.m.] -The item of £3,000 referred to by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) relates to the Mawson Expedition which was undertaken before the present Government assumed office, when £10,000 was placed on the Estimates for the purpose. scription received? It would be more fitting if we son donated u large sum, and £3,000 is now required to make a final adjustment of the expenditure that has already beeD incurred. No new expenditure is involved. The Government expects that £2,000 of this sum will be contributed from outside sources, which will reduce the actual government expenditure to one-third of the proposed vote. It is also anticipated that a considerable revenue will be derived when the film dealing with the expedition is released.",92,Miscellaneous Services

Last year, the same amount was provided, but the actual expenditure was £1,018. If last year's estimate was exceeded by nearly £300, the logical thing to do this year would be to place on the Estimates, not £750, but the higher amount expended last year, unless the Attorney-General( Mr of the books submitted to them, with the Brennan) can show that the actual expenditure will be kept within the sum estimated. I am not clear whether the item refei'3 to the Minister's private secretary, or to the secretary of the department.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN It is not in order for the honourable gentletion, whereas an Australian publication man, at this stage, to refer to the Jacob Johnson case. The item upon which the honourable member is speaking has no relation whatever to Jacob Johnson or any other individual, but the honourable member will be in order in asking the names and number of officers in the investigation branch. more is still in the employ of the depart[158] ment. I should also like some information with reference to the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, to which there is reference on page 83. Usually provision is made for the coal tribunal, but that has been omitted this year, and in view of the possibility of a dispute occurring in the industry, it may be necessary to call upon the tribunal to function. I direct attention, under the item "" Copyright Office,"" to the present system of censoring books. Imported books are censored by the Customs Department, and without disparaging the officers concerned, I say that as they are not literary men they arc not competent judges of literature. Moreover, it is apparent that they make merely a cursory examination result that publications of a kind that would not be printed in Australia are admitted and go into circulation. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I remind the honourable member that the censoring of books does not come under the department of the Attorney-General. partly right, because the Registrar of Copyrights censors books printed in Australia. definitely the function of the Registrar of Copyrights. Australian books intended for publication are submitted to him, and if, in his opinion, they are not fit for publication, the copyright is withheld. In this way, Australian authors are placed at a disadvantage compared with American authors, because, as I have stated, imported books of questionable taste, for the most part American, are admitted through the customs, and are allowed to go into circulahas to survive a much stricter censorship, [f the Registrar of Copyrights were authorized to censor imported, as well as Australian books, the position of Australian authors would be much more satisfactory, and we should have a better class of literature in circulation.

But it must not be assumed for a moment that the allegations made against him have been established, or even that there is, in the possession of the office, any evidence whatbe in a position to vouchsafe us some ever in substantiation of those allegations. If the honourable member will turn to page 86 of the Estimates, he will find there information relating to the number of investigating officers employed by the branch, but I should add that two of the officers mentioned are no longer on the list. inquiries were made. Some, of course, were of minor importance, but others were of considerable importance. Of these 304 were inquiries for missing friends asked for from Australia House; 220 were made for the Department of Trade and Customs; 195 for the Crown Solicitor; 3,648 for the Department of Home Affairs in regard to naturalization, admissions, and deportations, and 253 for miscellaneous reasons. I do not know whether in the political addresses made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr living are compiled from the cost Beasley), any other specific matters were mentioned about which information is desired. The subject referred to by both honourable members has been used repeatedly in this chamber, as it has been employed outside, for attacks upon my department; and answers have been given at the appropriate time and place. At the moment I have nothing to add to what has already been said in that regard. With regard to the question put by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), the honourable member seemed to express some regret that the estimate for travelling expenses this year is far short of the previous year's expenditure I can only assure him that it is an honest estimate.

In this respect the people of Port Augusta, in which town a large number of railway employees are located, are of the opinion that they have been unfairly treated, but the reply of the department has been that they are not. Therefore, the Minister in his reply need not deal with the position at Port Augusta. There are, however, many other large towns in South Australia, particularly in Eyre's Peninsula, whose citizens think themselves unfairly treated by the way in which the average cost of living figures are compiled, and I should like the Minister to indicate whether any consideration has been given to their request that more towns should be included among those upon whose cost of living figures the average cost is compiled.",95,Refunds Of Revenue

Up to date there has been no good reason for adding to the number, but I am constantly investigating various phases of the cost of living figures and shall continue to do so, and if I see that there is a definite need for increasing the number of towns used as a basis for compiling the average I shall certainly recommend an increase. Proposed vote agreed to. Proposed vote, £3,210,000. I want to mention a discrepancy between the pay of officers of high rank in the Navy and ratings in the lower ranks. One item which shows a total expenditure of £830,000 for various rates, no details being given, is followed by an item under which the Rear-Admiral is paid £5 a day. I want honourable members to keep that in mind while 1 read the following letter from a member of the forces on the lower deck:Dear Sir, 1 desire to express my regret that, owing to tlie two following articles, I am unable to append my signature to this letter:King's Rules and Admiralty Instructions, Article 18 -Politica l meetings or speeches are not allowed on board H.M. Ships or Establishments, and no parliamentary candidates or canvassers or political agents are to be allowed to visit H.M. Ships or Establishments. Any form of political activity on board H.M. Ships or in any Naval Establishments is prohibited. Consolidated Orders and Regulations for the Government of the Permanent Naval Forces of the Commonwealth, Article 179 (3) -Members of the Permanent Naval Forces are prohibited from making any statement to or for the press, or commenting publicly by speaking or in writing upon matters of public policy-Naval, Military, or Civil-withou t the written permission of the Minister for Defence. The lower deck as a whole are very sore and discontented at their inability, because of the foregoing articles, to voice any opinion whatsoever, and this discontent is intensified when un erroneous statement creates a false impression. The Minister for Defence stated that an able seaman's pay was £4 5s. 2d. per week. In direct contradiction to this the Naval Board in 1024 published a booklet entitled "" How to join the R.A.N."", and therein gave the rate of pay for an able seaman as £2 9s. per week"", plus 12s. 3d. per week deferred pay. This booklet also states that deferred pay can be forfeited for misconduct or if a man is discharged at his own request before expiration of his time; therefore deferred pay is really a bonus for good conduct and long service, and was instituted in lieu of the pension system of the Royal Navy. An able seaman's pay is 7s. por diem, plus 7d. clothing allowance; this clothing allowance entails the upkeep of a comprehensive k it , including bed and bedding. The Honourable Minister in his computation of our pay allows 2s. 3d. per diem lodging and living allowance, which we cannot understand, as the victualling allowance was Is. Sd. per man, and has recently been reduced to Is. 5d. (the press states Is. 7d., which is incorrect), so we presume the balance of the aforementioned 2s. 3d. is represented in our "" Quarters"" (bedding being already covered by clothing allowance). A t any rate, this 2s. 3d. lodging and living allowance is not credited to us when we are ashore, week-ends, &c.; except when on annual leave we are paid the. victualling allowance of Is. 5d. per day, Which w ill not pay for one meal, let alone three and a bed. After three years good conduct man's time, an able seaman receives a good conduct badge worth 3d. and a progressive of 2d. per day. If an A.B. is married he receives 2s. per day marriage allowance and 6d. for each child, which makes his pay as follows:Able seaman, married, one child7s -Activ e pay. 7d -Clothing allowance. 2s -Marriag e allowance. 6d -Child allowance. Total-£ 3 10s. 7d. per seven-day week. Able seaman, single78 -Activ e pay. 7d -Clothing allowance. Total-£ 2 13s. I d . per week. Further, I would like to state that a man serving in the Fleet whose home is in Melbourne travels home on leave twice a year, the return fare being £5 Os., making a total of £10 12s., which is equivalent to about 7d. per day for the whole j'ear. Roughly, 40 per cent, of the personnel of the R.A.N, are domiciled in Melbourne. Ratings from other States are in a far worse position. Understanding the financial emergency, we quite realize we should bear our share of the burden thrust on the community, but do not consider we should be cut any more than any other branch of the Federal Public Service.

529,Mr Wabd (East Sydney) [4.28 A.m.].,"I have no doubt that the Minister will be able to give me some information in reply to the statements in that letter, but the discrepancy between the payment of the men on the lower deck, such'as the able-bodied seaman, married, with one child, £3 10s. 7d. per seven-day week, and the rear-admiral at £5 per day, needs some explanation. More consideration should be given to the men on the lower deck. ranks from top to bottom should certainly beequalized to some extent. On page 134, certain particulars are given of the expenditure at the naval depot and dockyard at Garden Island. I ask the Minister to tell us how the administration expenses on the island compare with the amount spent on wages to employees. It is well known that the conditions of the employees of the dockyard are not entirely satisfactory. Not much work is being done there just now, and a good deal of that which is available is being doue by naval ratings, which is unfair to the skilled workers on the island. A very severe scheme of rationing is in operation there; for instance boiler makers and electricians are rationed one week in eight, moulders and coppersmiths, one week in two; engineeers, one week in four; pattern makers, one week in two; painters, one week in two; riggers, one week in eight; storemen, one week in ten; and iron workers' assistants, one week in six. In these circumstances it is desirable specific information. that some comparison should be made between the administrative costs and the actual working expenses. a.m.] -I , too, would like some information about the expenditure of this departis grouped in one sum. One item which is ment, which I regard as the most extravagant of all our departments. Unfortunately, the manner in which the Defence Estimates are prepared makes it difficult if not impossible, for honourable members to obtain reliable detailed information. A system of grouping is practised which may be satisfactory to the department, but is certainly unsatisfactory to honourable members. I direct attention to the fact that the secretary to the department draws a salary of £2,000 per annum. Other high salaries are:-Defenc e Liaison officer in London, £2,000 per annum; Assistant secretary, £1,012 per annum; Finance secretary, £1,112 per annum; and Director of Works, £864 per annum. We all know that some extensive pruning has been done in this department in the last two years, with the result that its activities have been very greatly curtailed. Consequently, even though the secretary may have been entitled to a salary of £2,000 per annum two years ago, he cannot claim that The pay of the different amount at present owing to the extensive curtailment of tbe activities of his department. In any case, it seems to me that the payment of this salary to one man cannot be justified in view of the fact that the lower branches of the service are paid at the very inadequate rates mentioned by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). When we refer to other pages of the Estimates for this department, we see that the policy of grouping has been carried out to a greater extent than in any other department. I have had some experience of this department, for when the present Postmaster-General( Mr A. Green) was Minister for Defence he had to visit Western Australia on one occasion, and I had to deal with certain of the business of his department. It was a common thing for the officers to produce files for signature without any satisfactory detailed explanation. In fact, one had to demand details if he wanted any I shall now proceed to refer to particular items on the Estimates in respect of which I desire information. On page 139, expenditure amounting to £S30,000 specified is "" Rear-Admiral, £5 per day "". On the next page, which covers permanent naval forces, seagoing, I find the following rates of pay specified:"" Engineer captain, £3 15s. per day; engineer commanders, £2 17s. per day; engineer lieutenant-commanders, £1 18s. per day"", 1 and so on. Does the Government intend to maintain these high rates of pay to these officers in view of the fact that the men on lower rungs are paid such miserable rates? On page 121, provision is made for paymaster commanders at £2 12s. per day; paymaster lieutenantcommanders at £1 14s. per day, and so on. On page 123, an amount of £250",97,Department Of Defence
530,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [4.37,"is provided for recruiting expenses. I . am not aware that any recruiting is being done afc present for tlie naval service. On page 125, medical services are dealt with, but no details are given. On page 126 provision is made for the expenditure of £3,952 on the Royal Australian Naval College. 1 should like an explanation of how this money is to be spent. The details various officers should be given. It is not fair that votes should be bunched together in this way. ""We have a right to know exactly what emoluments the officers of this department are enjoying. On page 128 an amount of £3,842 is provided for commanders, and £1,250 for lieutenant-commanders of the Royal Australian Naval Eeserve. What is the pay which each of these individuals draws? On page 130 provision is made for captains, commanders, surgeon commanders, surgeon lieutenant-commanders, surgeon lieutenants, and so on, of the Royal Australian Naval Eeserve, and the following note appears at the bottom of the page:"" Paid for services rendered at rates pre179 provision is made for the payment scribed in regulations.""

On page 142, provision is made for the payment of well over £100,000 to brigadiers, colonels, will enable civil aviation to function lieutenant-colonels, majors, cantains, and lieutenants. I object to thegrouping of thisamount, and ask the Minister to give me the details of the payments to each individual officer. Provision is made on page 153 for the expenditure of £2,010 to meet the cost of certain professors engaged at the Royal Military College. Will the Minister state the amount which each professor receives ? Again, on page. 157, the salaries of ordnance mechanical engineers are grouped. On page 165 there is an item of £20,500 for the "" maintenance and replacement of arms, armament, equipment and general stores."" Can the Minister say what equipment will be required under this heading, and whether it will be manufactured in this country, perhaps in the electorate represented by the Minister, or is it to be of the payment to the imported ? porary Chairman, whether a quorum is present when only thirteen of the total number of members at present in the chamber are awake.

Is there any need for such a board at the moment? -As I have on previous occasions spoken at length on defence generally, I do not propose to detain the committee at this juncture. There are, however, several matters in connection with civil aviation upon which I should like to obtain some information from the Minister( Mr Although the proposed vote for civil aviation has been reduced, I am pleased to find that it has not been cut too drastically. The amount provided fairly effectively, without which Australia would drop back in the race with other nations. In a country such as Australia, with its vast open spaces, it is .absolutely essential to encourage the development of civil aviation in order to assist the transport of mails and passengers to the remote parts of the Commonwealth, and by that means bring those who live in a state of comparative isolation in closer contact with those in the more populous centres.

[Quorum formed.] I agree with the view expressed by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) that more detailed information should be made available in the Estimates. I have, however, been able to obtain certain data in regard to which I desire some information from the Minister. I am pleased to find that the contributions to aero clubs, which are carrying out such useful work in training pilots, and will be of considerable assistance in the matter of defence, are to be maintained. I notice that there is a disparity between the contributions paid to such clubs. In one instance £40 is paid for each pilot who qualifies, while to other schools only £20 is paid. I should like to know why private schools do not receive the same assistance from the Government as is received by aero clubs. In different parts of the Commonwealth, there are schools in which aviation is taught which have to meet their own overhead, and whose pupils have to pass the same tests; yet they are not receiving any assistance from the Government. As they are performing work similar to that of aero clubs, it is only reasonable that they should benefit by a subsidy such as is granted to such clubs. I notice that the amount of £80 is provided to meet the cost of certain club accommodation in Western Australia. The aero clubs with which I was associated, always paid for their own accommodation, and perhaps the Minister can say why the Western Australian ferent basis. I am aware that the Government was unable to grant a subsidy to Australian National ways, which I am sure the Minister Mr White. regretted. I realize that that company was rather ambitious in endeavouring to conduct an unsubsidized service from Brisbane to Hobart. The only two sections of that route which were a comsubsidy were those between Brisbane and Sydney, and Melbourne and Hobart. Unfortunately, it was impossible for this service to operate without a subsidy. Germany is the most striking example of As the Dominions grow and what can be done with the assistance of a substantial subsidy, and as that country is not now manufacturing aircraft for The people of Australia are war purposes, it has concentrated upon civil aviation, in which she is leading the world. In Australia, flying can be undertaken almost any day in the year, and in a country 'of such distances, where there is in many cases an absence of railway or other means of communication, civil aviation should receive the greatest encouragement. It would have been a graceful act on the part of the Government to have assisted Australian National Airways, the founder of which, AirCommodore Kingsford Smith, is the greatest aviator the world has ever known. With a little assistance from the Government at the proper time, that company may have been able to carry on without suffering any loss by conducting a service over portions of the route on which it was operating. To afford the utmost assistance to aviation I suggest that, instead of civil aviation being under the direction of a controller of civil aviation, it should be under an air board, such as the A ir Board, which looks after the defence side of aviation. A good deal of justifiable criticism has been levelled against the Health Department, because of the way in which its . activities overlap those of State Health Departments. I put forward the suggestion that the Health Department should be placed under the control of the Minister for Home Affairs, and the Department of Eepatriation under the control of the Treasury. If that club is on a difwere done, a Minister would then be available to give proper attention to aviation. The Minister for Defence has Airsufficient to do in controlling the military and naval sections of his department. But civil aviation is not receiving the attention which such a modern science warrants. The Government should seriously consider the necessity of giving further attention to commercial aviation which, if linked up, an Australian service with Imperial Airways or with a Dutch company, would bring us in closer touch with the old world. An Assistant Minister could seriously tackle the problems on both the civil and military side of aviation, the line of demarcation between which is not great. The appointment of an Assistant Minister would not involve any additional expense, and a civil aviation board consisting of the present controller of civil aviation, tlie deputy controller, the superintendent of civil flying and the superintendent of aircraft should be appointed. Such a board would encourage aviation, and develop and give consideration to every aspect of its usefulness to the fullest extent. for Defence) [4.5S a.m.] -The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr detail without involving the department Beasley) raised quite a number of questions regarding amounts which aro grouped in the Estimates. He mentioned an amount of £S30,000 which appears on page 119 in respect of which it is impracticable to set out details required. One amount is for the payment of interest under regulations to the credit of a trust, fund. It is unnecessary to supply details of expenditure of this nature, which are not specifying the amount of certain items always checked by the Auditor-General's under ""Medical services"" on page 125?

Without going into details, the position is that the pay and allowances are not to be reduced below £182 per annum. quoted the other night were furnished to me by the accountant, and can therefore be regarded as reliable. The subject of rationing has been referred to. The position is that we have only a certain amount of money to spend. When it was proposed to reduce the staff at Garden Island, it was suggested to me by one or two unions that we ought to adopt rationing rather than dismissals. I gave sympathetic consideration to that, for the particular reason that men with many years of service who had only a couple of years to go would lose all the benefits of their furlough rights if they were dismissed. It is claimed, however, that the rationing has been too severe; and my officers in Sydney are meeting the unions with a view to seeing if some satisexpenses-if I may so term them-ar e factory arrangement can be come to. severe it would naturally follow that the dismissals would have been more severe. degree of rationing varies from one in four in the case of coppersmiths to one in nine in the case of electricians. cases. that if only two men were employed on certain work, and one was put off, the percentage would be high. In some callings, like that of coppersmiths, we employ only two or three men. But whatever has been done in the direction of rationing has had as its object the avoidance of dismissals. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) . also referred to certain high salaries that are paid. It cannot be argued that this Government is responsible for that. These men are permanent officers. In the case of salaries of £2,000 the reduction amounts to £450, which is very substantial. Reference has been made to the salary that is paid to Mr Trumble in London. Balaclava ( Mr White) has said that this officer is not a naval or military man and that, therefore, he is unsuitable for that particular position, which .ought to be filled by a member of one of the services. I have heard the honourable member say on another occasion that only a man who The figures that I was familiar with the Defence organization could make proper contact with members of the naval and military forces with whom Mr Trumble has to confer in regard to different matters. The Prime Minister has explained previously that Mr Trumble was surplus iu Australia and that a position had to be found for him because, being a permanent officer, he could not be dismissed. Probably in other circumstances a member of one of the forces would have been appointed. The honourable member for West Sydney' directed attention to overhead expenses in connection with the navy. I have had returns prepared showing the overhead expenses in Australia and elsewhere. It is true that the administrative fairly high compared with the total amount spent. I do not admit that they are tremendously high; but they are somewhat higher than in the British Admiralty. This matter is continually under review; but after all, when there is .a certain number of men for an equal number of permanent positions, what opportunity is there for retrenchment? the others are ? nent officers have been rationed, that practice having been confined to the temporary hands. Having had ministerial experience, the honourable member must know that permanent men are in a different category. rationed. during last year to a certain extent; but, owing to the substantial cuts that have been made in every direction, rationing has not been adopted this year. not rationed. matter of overhead expenses is closely inThe honourable member for vestigated whenever the opportunity",101,Department Of Defence

Steps are now being taken to review the administrative expenses of Garden Island. The honourable member also referred to recruiting. A very small sum is involved in that item. cepted only to make up any shortage below the strength of 3,300 in the permanent naval forces. I do not anticipate that very much expense will be incurred. I am unable to state the exact expenditure involved in the importation of materials from abroad, but nothing is being imported that can be made here, or done without. The high exchange rate alone does much to check imports. About £227,000 will cover the total amount, excluding exchange, that has to be sent abroad for various purposes, but there are certain naval requirements that cannot be met in Australia. applied, so far as possible, to aeroplanes? will encourage to the utmost the manufacture of all its requirements in this country. to payments in lieu of furlough? made for such payments to employees reaching the retiring age, or invalided from the Service, or retired under the reduction scheme, who have not been granted furlough. regard to the Munitions Supply Board? that board have been continued, chiefly because it has been doing much outside work. The Maribyrnong factory has extended its activities to the commercial arena, and so has the Lithgow factory. The latter has produced 300 ""talkie'"" machines for the Western Electric Company. These are not made in Australia by any private firm, and an opportunity was thus afforded to keep the Lithgow men employed. Shearing-machine combs and cutters, which previously had to be obtained from abroad, are now being manufactured at Lithgow. The manager of a munitions factory now has highly responsible work to do, because, in addition to supplying naval and military requirements, he must be able to deal with orders placed by commercial firms. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has made reference to the fact that Noyes Brothers receive a 2-J per cent, commission as agents for the deEnlistments will be acpartment for the sale of the brass sheets that are rolled at Maribyrnong. It is claimed by the honourable member that other firms should have the right to buy direct from the factory; but it must be remembered that the 2$ per cent, paid to Noyes Brothers relieves the department of all responsibility with regard to the collection of the sales tax, bad debts and advertising. Since the honourable member raised this matter, price-lists have been supplied to private firms. Since the selling agency has been given to Noyes Brothers, brass sheets are obtainable at a uniform price throughout the various States. Nearly all big companies appoint selling agents, and the department has merely followed the practice adopted in the commercial world. save that 2^ per cent. any firm in Victoria to take over the distribution of the output if other firms could buy direct from the factory. It was contended by the honourable member that other firms should have been offered the agency, but Noyes Brothers applied for it, and they were considered to be admirably suited for the work. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) has remarked that the general defence vote has been cut down to such an extent that all services have been considerably weakened. I confess at once that the heavy reductions made in all directions have certainly brought the force to a point at which no further reduction of expenditure can be made, unless there is a general survey of the position to ascertain whether the skeleton force that we have can be better controlled by consolidating our strength on particular lines, rather than spreading our activities over a wide field.

In the third division, for instance, there are a senior medical officer at £1,020 and two medical officers who are paid £1,656. In the division of Marine Hygiene a divisional director draws a salary of £1,400. In the division of Industrial Hygiene another divisional director is paid £1,296. The director of Veterintary Hygiene draws £1,000. The Director of the division of Tuberculosis and Venereal Disease has a salary of £1,396; the Director of the division of Maternal and Infant Welfare a salary of £1,200; and the Director of the division of Epidemiology a salary of £1,396. Under the heading of School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, the Deputy Director of Tropical Medicine is paid £1,030; and the Deputy Director of Bacteriology £1,100. Extraordinary expenditure is here incurred, but I venture to say that an examination of the work done by the recipients of these salaries will show that the Commonwealth is not getting a commensurate benefit. A tremendous organization has been built up in Canberra to do work which is being done in many of the States. This duplication has been going on for years, and no effort has been made to co-ordinate the activities of this department with those of State departments by means of which a considerable portion of this expenditure could be avoided.

At a time when economy is supposed to be the order of the day and retrenchments are necessary, and when this Parliament is being subjected to all sorts of criticism because of reductions already made, it is certainly wrong to allow this particular department to proceed blithely on its way building up an enormous expenditure and duplicating work which has for many years been undertaken with equal efficiency by the' various State departments. Apparently everybody's business is nobody's business. No effort has been made to prevent the duplication and overlapping of the health administrations of the Commonwealth and the States. The expenditure of the Commonwealth in this direction is continually increasing. I do not exonerate the Bruce-Page Government from blame in this connection, but that is no justification for continuing our expenditure on the old scale.

Tho health of the people should engage the attention of the Commonwealth Government, but everything possible should be done to ensure close collaboration between the Pederal and State Health Departments. In view of the fact that we have even reduced pensions in an effort to balance our budget, we should try to eliminate all unnecessary overlapping. If the Minister first opportunity, call a conference of the interested parties, I feel sure that some arrangement could be made to reduce' overlapping in this activity. Health) [6.4 a.m.] -Apparentl y some honourable members have not realized that the proposed vote for this department is £25,500 less than the vote for last year. Economies have been made in every possible direction, and though it may be practicable to reduce expenditure to a slight extent, no great savings can be made. In spite of the remarks of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill), I can say with every confidence that the Commonwealth Health Department has thoroughly justified itself. Its officers in Canberra have done, and are doing, excellent work. This department set an example to the world in the use of radium for the treatment of cancer. It was the first to undertake this treatment on an extensive scale. Although its activities in this respect were undertaken against' the weight of medical opinion elsewhere, they have been thoroughly justified, for 41 per cent, of the patients treated have been cured. Everything possible is being done to reduce the overlapping of the Commonwealth and the State activities. The Central Health Council meets every year, and apportions certain work to the different States. Last year the Premiers Conference appointed' a committee to inquire into the subject of overlapping, and its report snould be available very shortly. I assure honourable members that the Government will do everything possible to eliminate duplication and overlapping. Proposed vote agreed to. Proposed vote, £99,000.

It should be worth our while to do something to develop our trade with eastern countries. -The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has touched on an important subject. I have never been in the East, but I do not know what the Australian wheat-growers would have done this year but for the sales of Australian wheat to China. We have always been told that the eastern market has great potentialities for Australia. Seeing that we sold such a large parcel of our wheat to China this year, we ought to be able to continue our trade there. It is unfortunate, of course, that the price of wheat was so deplorably low this year. enabled us to sell the wheat to China. doubtedly, some truth in that statement. Geographically we are favourably situated for trade"" with the East. for us. I urge the Government to take steps to discover and adopt the best method of representing Australia in the East. Countries like Canada and the United States of America have had"" to seek foreign markets, and we shall have to do so. The people of other countries will not come to us and ask us for our products; we shall have to develop markets for ourselves. It certainly seems strange, in all the circumstances, that nothing is. being voted for the representation of Australia in the East. The Department of Markets is undoubtedly our Cinderella department; but I hope that our Cinderella will discover a prince in the East. If it had not been for the sale of our wool to Japan and of our wheat to China this year our producers would have been in a very unhappy position. Every country which has an exportable surplus of production, is. trying to develop trade with eastern countries, and we certainly should not neglect our opportunities Tn this direction. I do not suppose that there is a single person in Australia who knows what Japan's wool requirements will be next year. Mr Devereux has already furnished us with advice from London as to the needs of Germany and Belgium; but we know nothing about the needs of Japan. I should like the Minister to tell us definitely ""what he proposes to do with the object of developing a larger trade with Canada. in Canada now. we are expecting to increase our trade with this dominion. Should we not be taking steps to increase our expenditure in that country with the object of enlarging our market? Will the Minister inform me whether the trade agreement with Canada has been finalized in every respect? I hope that the Government will pay some attention to the possibility of extending the activities of this department so that we may open up markets abroad forour surplus^ primary production. It is a natural market a.m.] I notice that an amount of £150 was spent last year on the representation of Australia in the East. What was done with that money? in connection with a conference which I called during the year; but I shall-explain the matter further in my reply. Australian outlook. The potential markets to which reference has been made are not in the East, as some suggest, but in the North-west. There are also potential markets across the Pacific, as was disclosed by the information given by certain visitors from Chile who were in Canberra a few days ago. The position of Australia in having to find markets for its exportable surplus of primary products is so serious that every attempt should be made to improve our present marketing arrangements. After listening to the Minister( Mr Parker Moloney) early last year, when he introduced a scheme for a commercial intelligence service, I hoped that something of a practical nature would be done.

It is true that to Canada to carry out essential work, and so far as one can judge from reports, he has rendered excellent service. But Canada is not our only market. Last year, Parliament voted £4,000 for general representation and this year an amount of only £1,000 has been provided. Although £4,000 was voted last year, not one penny was dpent in finding new markets, and this year the Government is content to provide £1,000. Five or six weeks ago I read in one of the publications supplied to honourable members that Mr Maynard, an advertising expert in Sydney, had said that many manufacturing firms in and around Sydney were confronted with the difficulty of disposing of their product and generally in making ends meet. They were not making sufficient to cover their out-of-pocket expenses, quite apart from their overhead. Mr Maynard advised them to advertise, and despite the fact that their profits were decreasing, they increased their advertising bill by from 100 to 200 per cent., with the result that their businesses were soon in a flourishing condition. We must advertise our products, but in a more satis-factory manner than is provided for by representation of the nature covered by this vote. much to advertise Australian products in the East and in other countries; but governments can do a great deal, because they have nothing to gain by furthering the interests of any particular firm or brand of goods. Only within the last few days, Professor G. L. Wood, Associate Professor of Commerce and senior lecturer in economics at the University of Melbourne, in a lecture on "" The function of administration in economic development,"" according to a report in the Melbourne Argus of the 17th July, said:With exchange at 30 per cent, and the probability that it would remain there for a long period, Australian industries had an unprecedented opportunity to lay the foundations of a very valuable trade to the Bast. The exchange bounty represented for secondary industry almost the whole cost of the labour added in manufacture, but the Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures in Australia were slow to embrace the opportunities presented. Some may hold the opinion that the governments should do some of those things which the chambers of manufactures and others have failed to do. The only expenditure out of the vote of £4,000 last financial year was to cover the expense of a conference convened at Canberra. It is useless to vote money to serve the trade interests of Australia unless it is spent. to throw about. to use it in some of the directions suggested by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) than to appropriate it and not spend it. I trust that the Minister will give the committee information with respect to the commercial intelligence service which he propounded in the early part of last year, and also tell us what the Government proposes in the matter of finding markets not only in the East, but in other countries. I agree to a certain extent with the opinions expressed . by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley); but a better method for those anxious to exploit overseas markets would be to encourage the pooling of the resources of those interested, and to send abroad direct trade representatives whose business it would be to sell their commodities in Individual firms can do much the same way as the primary producers have done in connection with the export of dried fruits. The exporters of that commodity after pooling their resources have made a determined attack upon overseas market, which has resulted in a tremendous increase in the sales of our dried fruits in Great Britain. That system places a responsibility upon thoBe who have the goods to sell, and is better than to have the Government establishing elaborate overseas representation. Under such a system there would be collective representation in which the Government could participate in order to organize and encourage export in every possible way. "" That system has the advantage of creating joint responsibility, and of the assistance of a vigilant body operating in the interests of our export trade.

The onus must not be thrown upon the Government to create a demand overseas for goods which ' it is not in a position to supply. The gap can be bridged only in the way I have suggested. A marketing bureau should be established whose responsibility should be to study the possibilities of overseas trade, and to bring the data collected under the notice of local producers. being done. ordination of our ' representation in London.

It is tbe responsibility of the Government to assist in every possible way to find new markets, particularly in the East, for many of our primary products. It is, however, useless for the Government to send representatives to large consuming centres in other countries unless they can lized by German manufacturers, who supply the goods they are endeavouring to sell. tives are not commercial travellers. There should be some connection between the Government representative and those who have commodities to market A l though, unfortunately, wheat-growers have been compelled to accept low prices for their wheat this year, its low price may be a blessing in disguise. Owing to the low price, Japan and China0 have been able to buy large quantities of Australian wheat, and in future years they may continue to do so. The money expended in procuring representation in the TJnited States of America, which is of little benefit, should be spent tive was sent to Java and other eastern in establishing markets in the East. master-General) [6.29 a.m.] A few years ago, before leaving Australia on a visit to China, I communicated with several Australian manufacturers with the object of bringing their products under the notice of the consumers of that country. I wrote to a number of prominent biscuit and jam manufacturers in Australia, but the response I received was anything but gratifying, principally because Australia's exports at that time were in a fairly satisfactory position. When I made inquiries in Hong Kong, which is a British possession, which, ouglit to give us some advantage in the matter of trade, I found that the Australian manufacturers were at fault, as is usually the case in connection with British manufacturers developing new markets. In a sense, our prejudices manufacture what is undoubtedly a good take pains to adapt it to the use of those to whom we gell it abroad. No amount of government representation will do anything to rectify that. At the time of which I speak, Germany, which had not then been beaten to her knees as she has been since, sent her own trade agents to China. Instead of being content to allow the work to be done by Chinese compradores, as the British manufacturers were, those agents learned the different Chinese dialects and sold the goods themselves in the various provinces. Practically the whole of the market for cutlery was monopoput up the different articles in fanOur present trade representatastically designed cases to suit the requirements and tastes of the market. Very valuable work has been done in Canada by means of agreements, and that is the method that we shall have to adopt to obtain European markets so long as we continue the policy of protection. The opening up of new markets would provide an excellent means of removing some of our, financial difficulties.

At that time we succeeded in placing quite a lot of South Australian flour in Java, and in addition did a substantial business in canned fruits. difficulties that were encountered arose out of the fact that inappropriate labels wore placed on the tins. The people in the East want to learn from the wrapping what the tin contains. These and similar difficulties, I believe, are gradually being the East, with a view to forwarding our overcome. It must be realized, however, that there is only a limited market in the East, because the people there are so poorly paid. I hope that the Minister will succeed in regaining the market that wo had for flour. The honourable member for ""Wimmera( Mr Stewart) has stated that quite a lot of our wheat is now being purchased; but it would be better if we were able to send that commodity in the form of flour, because the milling of it would provide employment for many of our people. I consider that we are not doing sufficient to develop the London market. The Minister should have appointed a live man as trade commissioner for Australia in England. I have written and spoken to the honourable gentleman in regard to this matter, and I mention it now merely in order that he may not overlook it. An effort should be made also to develop the Argentine market, where I believe there are available opportunities for the sale of our apples and oranges. RecentlyI have received letters from the Argentine making inquiries in this direction, and have spoken to the Minister in regard to the matter. I regret that no provision is made for is not so. There are as many wealthy improving markets in the East that we people there as in Europe. The number have endeavoured to .exploit for years by fewer than in the United States of the export of fruits, butter, meat and America. The market is available, if we other products. The great drawback can develop it. I hope that an endeavour formerly was that there were no cool will be made during the coming year to stores; but at the present time a number of obtain that trade, which would be of great those are available for the storage of our benefit to the whole of Australia. At the products. There has been a good deal of present time the market is practically criticism of the Minister's trip abroad, monopolized by American products. Even but I regard it as one of the most profitin the mandated territory of Papua, able of the whole delegation. I feel sure which I visited some years ago, nearly that a trade agreement with Canada all the tinned products come from the could not have been secured by other than United States of America, yet that terripersonal interviews with ministers take some of Tasmania's hops. One of the the Tasmanian papers say that that was only a "" deal"". But for the wires that I sent away on the day when it became known that the "" deal"" was oh, the hopgrowers would not have benefited. I should like the Minister to take a trip to interests there. I am a director of a cooperative concern in Tasmania, which this year sent to the East a number of samples of fruit juices and canned fruits, and I can say that there is a likely market there for a large quantity of our products. I cannot agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) that we should send a trade agent to the Argentine, with a view to shipping our apples to that country. We have been misled in the past by persons who did not understand the potentialities of different markets. At the present time, the Argentine competes with Australia, because its season is the same as ours. It would be disastrous were we to encourage our fruit growers to send their product over there. We have been baulked in this way in the past in our endeavours to open up new markets. A few years ago, fruit was sent to tlie East, but because there were no cool stores to hold it, it had to be placed on the market immediately, with the result that those who consigned it lost heavily. Now, fruit is sent by every ship that sails, because it can be held in cool stores and distributed as the market requires it.

The Minister would be quite justified in placing a considerable sum on the Estimates to open up these markets. disagree with the statement of the last speaker that the placing of trade agents in the East will help Australian producers. It will be necessary.for the producers and manufacturers to combine for the purpose of maintaining their own representative in the East. The honourable member said that there were no cool stores in which goods could be placed; yet, Batavia, one can purchase any foodstuffs that money can buy. The TJnited States of America, of course, supplies most of the market at the present time. As has been pointed out, the Australian methods of marketing are unsuitable. American canned fruits are packed in 12 oz. tins, which can be sold at a cheaper rate than the 16 oz. tins sent from this country. in containers of the wrong size. In the East, butter has to be used as soon as the container is opened, because it rapidly deteriorates. manufacturers would have a good chance of developing a most profitable trade with the East if they would go about the business in a proper way. It is useless to send white travellers into the Eastern bazaars. The Chineses krani are in close touch with the Chinese bazaars. Fruit sent from Adelaide to the East, and costing 5-^d. per lb. f.o.b. Port Adelaide, was retailed at 2s. 4d. per lb.; but the growers on the Murray were debited with a loss of 16s. lOd. per ton, because incorrect trading methods were adopted.

The firm with which' I was connected years ago sent a man to Hong Kong and Shanghai, and he obtained sufficient orders for leather goods to keep the whole of the tanneries in Australia busy for at least twelve months. But the necessary hides for the manufacture of the leather were not available. Although the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) did good work for Australia in Canada, I do not suggest that he should visit the East, because that is a big market that needs special attention by men who know, in Singapore, Sourabaya and how to place goods on that market. We must pack our goods, not as we' may imagine they ought to be put up, but as they will appeal to the consumers in the East.

Owing to the deplorable financial situation, this vote, in common with others, has had to be greatly reduced. As the honorAustralian producers and able member for Parkes( Mr Marr) has said, if we had a dozen trade representatives in the East, and had not the full co-operation of the business community, success would not attend our efforts. Since the middle of last year a big improvement has occurred in the volume of our eastern trade, and it is ever increasing. The conference that I called recently in Sydney of business men interested in this trade was one of the most representative that has ever been held in this country. There were nearly 100 persons present, all the interests concerned being represented. The departBiscuits are sold in the East, the conference with all the available information relating to the East.

Australia ought to have a trade representative, not only in the East, but in all other important countries with which we have a chance of trading.

There is one matter to which I wish to refer now for the information of honourable members. During the negotiations that I had with the Canadian authorities; it was suggested that there might be some disagreement among the consumers concerning the concessions with regard to currants and raisins. It will be remembered that on these items I secured an extension of the preference from £14 per ton to £18 13s. 4d. per ton, and endeavoured to resist any time limit. The Canadian Government suggested that it might be necessary to place a two years' limitation upon the preference granted with respect to those items; but no definite decision was made until the agreement came before the Canadian Parliament, when the two years' limitation was inserted. I had not that information before me when putting the agreement through this chamber. I have been in touch with the Prime Minister of Canada regarding those two items, and he has promised me that the matter will be reviewed next session. The Dried Fruits Board in Australia, however, is of the opinion that in the next two years the'Australian growers Will secure the remainder of the Canadian market for those commodities. In reply to the honourable member for Parkes, I admit that the commodities sent out of Australia some years ago were to Great Britain recently, I learned that we lost the Ceylon market because of our ineffective packing and grading. I have seen 50 or 60 big stores in London, and in cities like Oxford, where Australian commodities are displayed for sale, and are meeting with a most favorable reception. Particularly owing to the service of Mr Hyland, our publicity officer in the benefit of the closest co-operation of the business ""community of Great Britain. When attending an exhibition of our commodities, and when speaking from the I may mention that the act platforms of picture theatres in Great Britain, for the purpose of stimulating interest in Australian trade, I found that there was a strong tendency to buy dominion goods. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) will agree with, me that, as regards grading and packing, Australian goods are now well up to the Californian standard. I agree with the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) that there is room for a trade representative in Great Britain and also in the East. Excellent publicity work is being done in Great Britain, but we could well do with a trade representative also. These are matters to which I have given a good deal of consideration, and, but for financial difficulties, I should have no hesitation in proceeding further along these lines. But we are using the resources of the department to procure and collate information desired by business people, and we now urgently need their hearty co-operation. partmental officers are not in a position to give business people information which is not already in their possession. people are availing themselves largely of the information which is in the department, and we are keeping in touch with British representatives in all countries where development in trade relations is likely to occur, with a view to passing the information on to our business people.

This matter was discussed at a meeting of* the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney five or six weeks ago, when it was decided to equip a good-will trade ship on lines similar to the "" Beso"" train scheme, which has had such an important influence in introducing articles of Australian manufacture to people in the various States. financed by a number of merchants and others interested in the development of Australian trade, and they have approached the Minister for assistance. I should like to know what stage has been reached in the negotiations. I also suggest that a number of officers of the Markets Department should accompany the trade delegations that will visit the East on this good-will trade ship so as to be thoroughly conversant with trade developments. 1 that about 150 persons will make the trip, and while the Government will furnish all the information in the possession of the department, I am afraid that we shall not be able to give any financial assistance. trade ship will visit Burma, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, China, and Japan, there should be important trade developments in the near future. Good work along these lines is also being done in Canada. I understand that the Dried Fruits Board is contributing a considerable proportion of the expenditure incurred in commercial representation in that Dominion, and it may be possible to have similar organizations in Eastern countries. British consuls always render valuable aid in this direction. About three years ago, when I was. at Weltevreden, I met a number of importers and wholesalers from Batavia^nd other parts of Java. They had come to the western end of the island from Sourabaya to discuss trade matters, and gave me a considerable amount of information concerning faults in packing of Australian products. I passed this information on to the department. Some of our manufacturers make an excellent display, and put up their products in a most attractive form; but if only 5 per cent, fail to reach what is regarded as a reasonable standard, it is sufficient to seriously endanger the trade of the remaining 95 per cent. I suggest, therefore, that stricter supervision should be exercised by the Customs Department, and that it would be a good plan if our trade agents also acted as liaison officers between vendors in Australia and buyers in Eastern countries. Any complaints could he 'brought to their The venture is being notice, and representations made in the right quarter. In this way we could hope to reach and maintain a high standard, as regards not only the quality of our products, but also the manner of their presentation to Eastern customers. a.m.] -It has been represented to me, in connection with our export trade in frozen products, that we are at a disadvantage because freight charges from Australia to Great Britain are higher than those paid by New Zealand exporters. the exchange position. I should like the Minister to ascertain the facts and see if this handicap upon our primary producers can be removed. It is alleged that New Zealand exporters of frozen mutton and lamb always have ample shipping space available, and that on many occasions Australian exporters are unable to secure the necessary space. This is a matter of considerable /importance to our primary producers, because, owing to low prices for wheat and wool, many of our farmers are giving attention to fat-lamb raising, in which business there is still some semblance of profit. An endeavour is now being made to develop this trade, and it is probable that next season will see a substantial improvement in the export figures. Thi3 development will tend to steady prices in Australia. charges may be lower than from Australia to London because the distance through the Panama Canal is slightly less. distance should not be sufficient to account for the higher freight charges from Australia to London, because New Zealand exporters have to pay the Panama Canal dues.

I recognize that it is inconsistent with economy plans for honourable members to demand extra services; but there is a very bitter complaint, particularly in the sparsely populated areas in my electorate, about the drastic curtailment that has been made in their postal services. In many cases these curtailments have been made because of curtailments in the railway services due to the general depression; but I feel that a good deal more could have been done than has been done to meet the situation.

664,Mr Stewart (Wimmera) [7.38,"cases tliis decision is decidedly unfair to the people who are living outback. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that in cases where the services have been curtailed because of the curtailment in the passenger train services, the mail bags should be placed on convenient goods trains that may be running. I know that it is not the policy of the department to despatch mail bags on goods trains in normal times, but these are not normal times, and the department should cut through some of the red tape which is binding it to the practices of normal times. Arrangements could surely be made with the railway departments in the various States for the proper and careful handling of mail bags on goods trains going outback. A serious source of complaint in regard to the curtailment of our mail services is that the economy axe has fallen heavily on the people in the rural areas, but has not fallen on the people in the city and suburban areas. The environment of the people outback is very different from that of the people in the cities. City people enjoy two postal deliveries daily; and they have a post-office in every convenient place, and a pillar-box on practically every street corner. They are waited on hand and foot. If the economy axe must fall, it should fall on city and country people alike. If there is to be any discrimination it should be in favour of outback people. ""When I made a complaint of this nature last year, the present Directors of Posts and Telegraphs into Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), who was then Postmaster-General, said that if the city people were receiving better treatment than the country people, it was because the staff was available in the cities to render the ordinary service, and might just as well be working as sitting down doing nothing. That sounds plausible, but I suggest that instead of making two deliveries a day in all the suburbs, a delivery should be made in the morning in one suburb and in the afternoon in another suburb. It would not hurt city people if they had to go to the post-office for their mail matter like many country people have to do. I have no desire to make a personal attack upon the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, but' I feel certain that if be had any personal knowledge of outback conditions he would deal much more sympathetically with the applications made to his department in their behalf. I make the strongest possible protest against the infliction of economies on the country people alone. If justice were considered, the city people would be called upon to suffer before the country people. have not been left alone by any means. that the same economies have been made in the metropolitan areas as have been made in the outback districts, otherwise we should have heard a great deal more about it than we have heard. I could give instance after instance of most unfair treatment of the outback people. honourable members on both sides of the committee who represent rural areas could make most serious complaints about the treatment of their constituents. In some country districts the postal services were better 50 years ago than they are to-day, while in the newer districts it is impossible for the people to get any adequate service whatever. In many cases the departmental oflicers admit the -justice of the applications made to them, but they say that they cannot grant them because of the financial stringency. I suggest to the Postmaster-General that he should call the Director and the Deputy conference and have a heart-to-heart talk with them on this subject. I cannot think that any of these gentlemen have ever lived in the outback areas, or they would be more sympathetic than they are. lived in the outback, but a number of the Deputy Directors have done so. so they have forgotten their experiences. They should bo sent outback for a month or two to find out just what the country people have to put up with. The present policy of the Postmaster General's Department in this respect is causing the utmost resentment in the country districts and demands immediate revision.

Green) in the curtailing of the mail services of settlers in the rural affect the country people with greater areas requires immediate reconsideration. In spite of the interjection made a few minutes ago by the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley), I do not think that many of the Deputy Directors of Posts and Telegraphs have lived outback, and I am sure that the Director has never done so. The Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Queensland ( Mr tricts, but it is time it dropped on some Little) has told me that he has never been farther north than Brisbane. I urge the Postmaster-General to regard these complaints as of the utmost importance. It is unreasonable that every application for a new service should be refused simply because the financial position is difficult. In Thornborough, a settlement in Northern Queensland, in a district in which there arc 200 or 300 residents, the work of the Postal Department was undertaken by a youth who was receiving only 15s. a week. The business in that office was not extensive, but owing to the department's policy of economy it was decided to close the office without any departmental pronouncement to that effect. Had the people in that locality been notified that it was the intention to close the office, they would have willingly contributed out of their own pockets the amount necessary to pay the wages of the postal and telephone attendant. At the Batavia diggings, which boasts of a population of about 75 persons, and which is about 75 miles distant from any other post-office, the office was closed, but the department eventually said that it proposed to reopen in a residence which it owned. The inspectors made certain inquiries, and ascertained that the residence had been sold, and consequently nothing further was done. pack services costing in the vicinity of £130 a year, but many of these have been reduced or entirely withdrawn. Surely the residents in the outback portions of the Commonwealth, who do not enjoy any of the facilities of those in the more populous centres, should receive more consideration. under the influence of those who have a "" Brown"" or at least a very dark outlook, and until drastic alterations are made in the control of this department our complaints will not cease. Increases in postal and telephonic rates always severity than those in the cities. In many country districts group telephone services are in use. Subscribers are compelled to use the same wire, which results in cross talk and endless inconvenience. It is easy for the Government to use the economy axe to the extent it has been used in country disof those fortunate city dwellers who receive a mail twice daily, and are compelled to walk a few yards to their front gate in order to collect it. If they had to cover that distance only once a day they would have sufficient exercise. When travelling to Brisbane on Saturday last I saw the head of the Postal Department making his way to Brisbane to confer with the Deputy Postmaster General, who will doubtless make recommendations for further reductions in country services, and in the name of economy will further smash the already inadequate facilities now provided. Besidents in country districts have not representation in this Parliament comparable with those who live in metropolitan districts. During the last few years economies have been effected to such an extent that many of our country mail services have been seriously reduced, if not entirely dispensed with. coming worse. this chamber of a metropolitan constituency told me that some of his electors had to walk a mile or two to a post office, but in some of the districts in my electorate the people consider that they are exceedingly fortunate if there is a post There are also office within five or ten miles of their home.

At Chewko, in the vicinity of Mareeba, where land has recently been opened up for the cultivation of tobacco, additional mail facilities have been sought. There is the usual delay, and eventually a letter will be received to the effect that the inspector will visit this locality, and after such an inspection has been made, a further intimation will be given, that owing to the financial position it is impossible to grant the request. I strongly resent the treatment now being meted out to residents in country districts, who in the matter of mail services are entitled to more consideration than city dwellers. Some of these people in the out-back, who receive only a weekly or semi-weekly paper, do not complain of the conditions under which they are living. If the Government does not take immediate action in this matter it is my intention, on the motion for the adjournment each evening, to read every letter I "" have received. I want Mr Brown and his satellites to face up to the position, and to cease dents are bearing more than their fair slashing the mail services in country districts. If people are to develop the back country they must be provided with reasonable postal facilities. As they contribute large sums in the form of taxation to keep a vast army of politicians and public servants in employment, they are entitled to the privileges enjoyed by others. Only last night I referred to the erection of new post offices at Chatswood, Killara, Sydenham and Wynyard Square. Money is being expended in these localities, because those seeking additional facilities are able to get the ear of Mr Brown, whom they may entertain from time to time at functions in Sydney. The unfortunate people in the outback districts who do not meet Mr Brown, Mr stantial curtailment of services although Little, or other departmental heads, have no means of bringing under their notice the conditions under which they are living. Some part of the amount of £500,000 which is to be spent erection of new post offices should be used to enable Mr Brown and his deputy to visit the outback country. I should be willing to take them through my electorate, and after seeing the conditions under which the people are living, I am sure that they would show more sympathy towards them. I trust that honourable members representing country constituencies will voice their protest in this matter. have waited for some hours for an opportunity to discuss the subject raised by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), and supported by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan). I am as mindful as is any other honourable member of the need for economy in the administration of government departments, and I know that the people in country districts realize the need for reduced expenditure. But it is the country which keeps the cities going, and has to bear the bulk of the disabilities resulting from financial stringency. We have heard a good deal about the equality of sacrifice. These words fall very easily from the lips of Ministers, but in this instance there is no equality of sacrifice. Every Minister realizes that in the reduction of mail services and postal facilities generally, country resishare of the burden. It is true that when the ex-Postmaster-General. ( Mr Gibson) was controlling the department the financial position of the Commonwealth was such that he was able to do what cannot possibly be done at the present juncture. In regard to extensions of telephones and mail services the country districts were then reasonably provided for. But now, when members write urging the need for a telephone line or mail service we are frequently told that the need for such service is realized, but owing to the financial position they cannot be provided. curtailment of existing services. it has not affected my district very much, except where trains run less frequently than formerly.

I do not blame the men administering the department. The Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Tasmania is sympathetic and understands the position, but he has not the funds to provide the services that are required, and he is governed by instructions from head-quarters. This is wholly a matter of Government policy. If the Government chooses to decide that real economies shall be effected in the urban areas, in order to allow reasonable services to be provided in the country, that can be done. That the Director and Deputy Directors haye not lived out-back is immaterial; in the main these men know their jobs; but they are restricted by considerations of finance and Government policy. Some years ago the Postmaster-General issued a pamphlet stating the conditions under which telephone services would be provided in country districts, but that is of no guidance to-day to honourable members or to applicants for services. I want to be able to help the department as well as my constituents, and I should have definite information regarding the conditions under which telephone lines will be provided, and what will be expected of an applicant living a few miles off the main road or beyond the terminus of an existing line. I have always contended that it is not fair to require the applicant to bear the capital cost of his own line. At one period that was recognized and the department paid for the material and labour. Now, it is discouraging the extension of telephone lines, but if an individual is desperately in need of a service'and cares to put his hands into his pockets, to pay for the erection. I hope the Postmaster-General will tion of posts and miles of wire, the department will install a line. If the department insists that it cannot provide the same facilities as were given years ago, I want to know what the revised conditions are. If the Postmaster-General cannot make a complete statement on these Estimates, he should, in the interests of his department, have one printed, and circulated to members. I hope that the Prime Minister will take up this matter at an early date with the Postmaster-General, and the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, with a view to evolving a more sympathetic policy. The only policy that will satisfy this Parliament is one which gives reasonable treatment to those in the country districts, even if it involves some curtailment of the privileges of the urban population. Por years the Postmaster-General's Department has paid a subsidy to Tasmanian Steamships Proprietary for the carriage of mails between the mainland and the island. The amount paid by the Government is about £31,000, exclusive of an extra £6,000 or £7,000 for putting the Nairana into service for a few extra weeks. One condition of the contract is that during its currency the company may not increase the freights or fares without the permission of the Postmaster-General. This condition should have been a valuable safeguard. The company has been well treated by various governments, and because of the agitation of Tasmanian members, .it has been paid a substantial subsidy to carry mails and provide a better passenger service. But I believe that every application by the company for permission to increase freights and fares has been granted. Eecently the shipping companies have had relief from the Arbitration Court; the -wages of seamen, officers, and waterside workers have been reduced. I am told that the amount of the reduction, including the cost of living adjustment, is approximately 22 per cent. But freights and fares remain high, except for some slight reduction between certain mainland ports. This matter is of great importance to the Tasmanian primary producers. Has the Postmaster General power to bring about a downward revision of freights and fares? If not, I shall seek to create an atmosphere which will compel the company to make a reducgo into this matter; he has had power to prevent increased charges, and has nor done so, no doubt because the company claimed that costs had increased. Now, costs have been reduced, and the Postmaster-General should be able to influence the company to adjust its charges accordingly. If he has power to insist upon a reduction of freights and fares, he should do so.",119,Postmaster General S Department
678,Mr Bell,"I have no desire to inI join in the protest by rural members against the curtailment of postal services. In justice to the Minister, I admit that some of the grievances of my constituents have been rectified during the last few days, but only after much correspondence and many personal interviews. It will be generally admitted that the man in the country is in serious difficulties. Bural members have twice as much responsibility and worry as city representatives have; after all, urban residents have all the conveniences and many of the comforts of life. If a curtailment of postal services is necessitated by the state of the people in the cities they would immefinances, first consideration should be given to the rural areas, to which the mail services are of prime importance. ber goes too far something will have to be said in defence of the city folk. have loyally supported city representatives in the past, and there should be reciprocal good feeling towards the man on the land,-whose job is undoubtedly the hardest. In my electorate mail services have been reduced. trains have been discontinued, mails could be carried by goods train. I suggest that the Minister should look into that possibility. An instance of the small economies being effected by the department is the discontinuance of the lighting of the Castlemaine post office. For many years people have been accustomed to look for that light, and the loss of it is an inconvenience which is not warranted by the small amount of money saved. I admit that economy must be practised, but the Minister should see that it is so spread as not to place an undue hardship on the people outback. The man in the city enjoys a mail delivery twice a day, and if he desires to send a telegram he can do so at probably twenty offices between his home and his office. Rural populations, on the contrary, suffer many natural disadvantages, and are further handicapped by only limited postal and telephonic services even in prosperous times. a.m.] -The reduction of postal services in my electorate has been so serious that I cannot allow this occasion to pass without making a protest. I emphasize the statement of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) that where train services have been reduced from four and six weekly to two weekly, the mail services have been curtailed accordingly. I am speaking now of towns of from 2,000 to 3,000 inhabitants. The municipalities, when they have protested, have been informed that it is impossible to give a better service, and that if they are prepared to carry out an additional mail service without expense to the department they can do so. The people will soon revolt against such a position. If the same disabilities were placed upon the diately be up in arms. In my electorate small post offices, which have been in existence for nearly 50 years, have been closed down, despite the fact that protest after protest has been made against such action. We know perfectly well that the department is not doing this with the desire to place additional burdens upon the people in the rural districts, but i i should at least endeavour to formulate a policy under which the mail services generally will be equalized as much as Where passenger possible. I trust that the Postmaster General, in collaboration with his departmental oflicers, will give this matter favorable consideration. A matter which closely affects my electorate is the uncertainty of the Government's attitude with respect to the installation of dictaphones in country newspaper offices. Recently the Government gave this matter consideration and postponed its decision to abolish the use of these machines, and I enter my protest against its attitude. The dictaphone was introduced in the. country newspaper offices at the request of the Postal Department, but now that the use of that facility has enabled the country people to obtain news with a rapidity, which, to some extent, has interfered with the circulation of great metropolitan newspapers, influence has been brought to bear upon the department to compel the country newspaper proprietors to abandon the use of this machine.

It is just as reasonable to instruct the country press to revert to the telegraph system, and abandon the dictaphone as it would be to instruct the Railway Department to abandon the train service and to revert to the bullock dray. If the country newspaper proprietors have to revert to the primitive telegraph system, it will be a departure that should not be tolerated by us. I have heard the case made out by the representatives of the country press, and I say that it is absolutely unanswerable. They showed that the dictaphone was of greater advantage to them than any other 3ystem. In many instances, the country newspapers were obtaining the latest news in the evening and distributing it among the people the next morning. The country newspaper proprietors are business men, and they wish to know the final decision of the Government, so that if it is favorable they may develop their business to meet the requirements of modern society. should be given to the country press.

I shall do my utmost-and from now the fight is on-to prevent any further curtailment of country postal facilities. mail services of the people in the large centres of population could be considerably curtailed before they would suffer the disadvantages which the country people are now experiencing. The actual curtailment of services has not been fairly distributed among the community generally, and I protest against the inequality of sacrifice in respect of postal facilities that has been forced upon the country dweller. ia many years since so many members have risen to complain about the treatment meted out to the people by the Postal Department. Parliament twenty years, and have never known the position to be different. the Bruce-Page Government made available large sums of money to the Postal Department, members have, until recently, been absolutely satisfied with the treatment given to both the country and city people. The ofiicials of the Postal Department are the same to-day as they were then. The policy laid down is the same to-day as it was then; but the financial position bas changed. The Postal Department is a business department, and is expected to pay its way. It has its own sinking fund, and is responsible for the provision of money for that fund so that loans made to it may be repaid within a certain number of years. This Parliament has never been unsympathetic towards the people resident in the country, and neither has the Postal Department. Many of the districts to which the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) and other honourable members have referred, are, from the postal standpoint, most expensive to operate.

Por years a sum has been on the Estimates for the erection of a post office at South Brisbane. The hotioraible member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) referred to the post office at Hughenden, where people fall through the verandah flooring because of its decrepitude. I should like to show honourable members the post office at South Brisbane. It is a disgrace to the department. I have 57,000 electors in my constituency, and only .three official post offices in the whole area. The honourable member for Kennedy has fewer electors than I have, but he has a far greater number of official post offices. tive areas? business undertakings of the department and not of areas. I want honourable members who represent country constituencies to recognize that other people besides their constituents are affected by these economies. When, it becomes necessary to economize, the department naturally has to cut out those services that have resulted in the greatest loss. be realized by all that the department is not making these reductions willingly. The sacrifice is general. There is not one member from a metropolitan constituency who has not received letter after letter from the department intimating that no money is available to effect alterations or improvements. a.m.] -It is too early in the morning for the honourable member for Oxley( MrI am not suggesting Bayley) to indulge in joking. This is a matter of such great importance that I know that the PostmasteHS-eneral ( Mr A. Green) would regret it if the estimates for his department were passed without my drawing attention to the needs gamite. I have no desire to raise the issue of town, versus country, but if country postal facilities are being curtailed .because of financial depression, I should like to know why the cities are not similarly treated. I asked a question on have, during the notice as to how many postal services had been reduced in Sydney during the past two years. I was informed that there have honourable members has been no curtailment of such services in Sydney, and that only two centres have been affected in Melbourne-Glenroy and Blackburn-whic h are practically country areas. It is all very well for the honourable member for Oxley to talk about . the Bruce-Page Government, and the alleged generosity of its Postmaster-General. I point out that during its regime there was a loss on the whole of the Postal Department activities of from £100,000 to £300,000 pef annum, with the exception of one year. Now that we are experiencing bad times, why should the country centres be the only \ ones to suffer? It cannot be denied that discrimination has been shown. References have been made to the Castlemaine post office clock. I draw attention to that at Maryborough, which costs £9 10s. a year to light. I understand that it would not cost more than £4,000 per annum to light the whole of the post office clocks in the Commonwealth. I know that if I moved that the item covering the salary of the Director of Post and Telegraphs 'be eliminated, it would have the approval of honourable It must members. It should also gladden the heart of the Postmaster-General as it would enable him to get rid of the incubus. If I do so, will the honourable gentleman give me an assurance that the money so saved will be devoted to the lighting of post office clocks as before? The Postmaster-General remains silent.

703,To Some Country Centres By Mr Jones,"I shall show the honorrepeatedly in rural districts. the Government's policy is to suspend or curtail the contracts for the carriage of mails from the railway line to towns some distance on either side. For the sake of an infinitesimal saving the Government has caused considerable inconvenience to outback settlers. Seeing that the newspaper companies made arrangements for the conveyance of newspapers the Government should have been prepared to utilize the facilities provided by them, and have arranged for the mails to be carried also. The policy adopted by the department in connection with telephone services is also inexplicable. Recently a man in my electorate desiring telephone connection entered into a contract with the department to supply and erect the necessary poles and to pay his first year's rental. He fulfilled his part of the contract, but, on the ground of economy, the department said that it could not carry out its portion of the contract. It stated that there was no money available to pay for the wiring of the poles, and that linesmen who would have been employed to do the work were being put off. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) said that he desired the Postmaster-Generalto reply to the cases that had been brought before his notice. I want him to do more than speak; I want him to acthave done my best to pacify those persons in my electorate who have suffered because of the Government's policy of curtailing country mail services. brought this matter up before, although I could have done so on motions for the adjournment of the House; but now that the appropriate occasion has arrived, nothing but the application of the "" gag "" will prevent me from urging the claims of country settlers in respect of postal services. It cannot be said that I am urging the claims of country settlers merely because Angas is a country district, because one-third of the Angas electorate is in the metropolitan district of Adelaide. I can, therefore, speak on behalf of both metropolitan and country electors. Excepting to the extent that has happened they have been refused official post office buildings, the metropolitan areas have had no curtailment of postal services, whereas in country districts there has been considerable curtailment. Where previously there were two mails a week, there is now only one; where, until recently, there were three mails a week, there are now only two; and where there was a daily mail there are now only three mails a week. It cannot be gainsaid that the country districts have had to bear the brunt of the economy measures adopted by the Postmaster-General's Department. I realize that the Government must practise economy, and with some success I have represented that viewpoint to the people in the country portions of my electorate. IfI were asked where economies could be made in connection with postal services in metropolitan areas, I should take the risk of offending some of my constituents by saying that economies could be effected by having a morning delivery in one portion of a district and an afternoon delivery in the rest of it. Unfortunately, that might mean dispensing with the services of some men; but it would be better that metropolitan areas should have only one delivery a day than that the department should reduce the already infrequent mail services in country districts. Perhapsi f I were to go through the department I could suggest other ways of effecting economies. I think, however, that the suggestion I have made is a fair one. The honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) suggested that the people in country districts were getting postal facilities beyond what they paid I have not for. The honourable member does not need mo to tell him that the prosperity of this country is based on its agricultural, pastoral, mineral, and viticultural industries. The 58 per cent, of the population of South Australia resident in the Adelaide metropolitan district, and the similarly large proportions of the population of other States living in the other capital cities, depend for their livelihood on the scattered settlers in outback areas. It is not right that those who enjoy the greater comforts of the cities should be given every postal facility, while those on whom they depend have their already inedaquate services seriously curtailed.",124,Postmaster General S Department

706,Mr Gabb (Angas) [8.50 A.m.],"IThe statement of the honourable member -for Oxley is unfair; it is one of the reasons which have led me to make this protest. I hope that something will be done for these country settlers, otherwise there will be no alternative to raising the matter night after night on the adjournment in order to bring home the facts to the Government. that. done to see that the sacrifice made necessary by the state of our finances shall be shared more equitably between the city and country than is now the case. a.m.] I agree entirely with all that country members have said regarding the curtailment of postal facilities. made to the cost of delivering mails in outback districts, and it has been inferred that country mail services should, in consequence, be reduced. One honourable member mentioned that it sometimes costs as much as 16s. to deliver one letter. There are portions of my electorate in which it would probably cost several pounds to deliver one letter. In the area beyond Thargominda, and in the region beyond Birdsville, it would probably cost between £2Q and £30 to deliver a letter by special messenger. It is not fair to take the cost of delivering a particular mail and to divide that cost by the number of letters, and then to say that the cost of country mail services is too great vices shall not be curtailed at the In the same way that the mountain, streams feed the rivers on which large cities are built, so the country perhaps, only a few dozen letters, help to swell the volume of postal traffic which, eventually, reaches the big cities aud is essential to the proper conduct of business. If there is to be any curtailment of postal services, it should not be in the country alone. there has been one curtailment after another. The latest proposal of the Government is to eliminate the travelling post office on the western railway line of Queensland, which delivers letters to sidings. One honourable member said that postal services in country districts are worse now than they were 50 years ago. The travelling post office to which 1 refer has been in existence for 40 years. If it is removed, we shall go back to conditions which existed nearly half a century ago. A few days ago I received a letter stating that the Postal Department had effected a saving in a certain district by arranging with a dairyman to convey the mails in the vehicle in which he carted his cream to the railway. Unfortunately, there was a falling off in his cream supply, with the result that there was a curtailment of the mail service. The mail services of a country should not be dependent on such things. I ask the Postmaster-General to see that (Maranoa) [8.56 country mail services are not curtailed. I realize that economies are necessary; but they should not be effected by interfering with country mail services. Reference has been I heard some honourable members speak of the hardships of their constituents who had a mail service only once a day. There are very few places in my electorate where there is a mail service every day. The services are mostly once a week, and, in rare cases, twice a week. Even then, settlers have to travel 30, 40, and as many as 50 miles for their mail. I know one man on the South Australian border who runs a private car 40 miles to the station homestead with the mail. It is then taken up, and carried another 60 miles to the head of the government mail route, and carried from thence into the town. The Minister should issue instructions that mail serexpense of settlers in the outback. If it is necessary to save money, it should he saved somewhere else. a.m.] I trust that the Minister, in his reply, may be able to give full information regarding the effect of the latest economies on the staff of his department. That is an all-important matter to me.

Dennis wag an experienced pig-farmer, and was chosen from a number of applicants (advertised for ) to conduct the Canberra pig farm. The site was chosen by Brackcnreg on Woolshed Creek (which runs into the Molonglo River) and is between DuntroonM i l i tary College and the Kingston power house, and the area was about 125 acres. I am unable to recall what was the rent, but the definite inducement to Dennis was that he was to use (and to have for the mere carrying away) the kitchen edible refuse from the Commission establishments, and the piggery was to be erected and built on ""the most modern, hygienic, and scientific lines, so that it would be a model "". The buildings, & c , were erected (not without material delays, but I have not the details), and the cost was about £2,500, and Dennis went into occupation and was carrying on though he had not signed any lease (nor for very many months, was a lease submitted for his signature), and, ultimately, when a lease was submitted for his signature would he accept or sign it as he said it differed very greatly from the conditions offered to him. As Dennis refused to sign the lease, the matter dragged on, because Brackenreg would not consent to Dennis having the conditions agreed on in the first instance, and, ultimately, Dennis was told he could sign that lease or get out. He refused a. visit from McKay) who not feed his [150] it might breed disease, and he must grow food for them. Dennis protested and said that the very special inducement held out to him was the abundant supply of cheap pig feed which the kitchen edible refuse afforded, but the authorities insisted, and so Dennis fenced off more than half the area and put in a crop of maize. When the maize was a few inches above the ground-and his cultivation had been done very soon after he was told he must grow feeda peremptory demand was made to know why he was not feeding his pigs on fodder grown for them. Brackenreg, and that he replied, "" Don't be a fool-it s only a few weeks ago that have time to grow"". Brackenreg was very insulted, and claimed to be the great pig expert and a very scientific farmer, &c, and Dennis finally said that he was growing food I a m in possession of m u c h as fast as he could ""and he must feed on the kitchen refuse until the feed had grown. Brackenreg said he could not possibly allow it, and it must be stopped at once. Dennis had saved a large quantity of stale bread from the refuse, and thereupon he stopped gathering the kitchen refuse, sold most of his pigs, and fed the remainder on the stale bread. The kitchen refuse began to accumulate as no one was carrying it away. Brackenreg asked Dennis, with much surprise, T h a t is a n excellent why he was not taking the refuse away, and Dennis replied, "" Because you won't allow The in for m a t i o n is me to use it , it has no value to me, and I don't want it "" . After some barneying, it was agreed that Dennis should cart the refuse to a destructor over near the Black Mountain, and should be paid £3 3s. per day for so doing, whilst a man was put on at £4 10B. per week to burn it with firewood bought and delivered at that site for the purpose. Dennis, by reason of the uncertainty of hU tenure, never felt free to f u l ly stock the farm, and when he had further reduced the nurtibcr of hi3 pigs (as above-mentioned) Brackenreg complained that he was not stocking the farm as he should, and that if he did not do so he must get out. Meantime, he continued to cart the kitchen refuse, and to draw £3 3s. per day, or 21 guineas per week, but he did not pay any rent. Next, he had another visit from the veteriBrackenreg, and McKay straight out condemned the site, as it would be dangerous to public health, and would contaminate the waters of Woolshed Creek and the Molonglo River. Dennis said the pig farm had been granted to him on that Bite, the buildings had been erected, and the pig conveniences also erected, but as they were very deficient and not of practicable value as they were delivered over to him, he had spent a good deal of his own money in making them serviceable, and ho would not get out unless he got a better to do either,and then he had site, and at least equal conveniences.

Brackenreg, he says, promised that he need not grow pig feed on the new site, but could use the kitchen refuse and slaughter-house refuse, that the water would be supplied in sufficient quantities, and that everything would be suitable, but Dennis must at once get off the farm he was occupying. Dennis said he would, stay where he was t ill he saw the new pig farm ready and f it for use and occupation, and an argument about this continued for many weeks -'indeed , months, a l l highly profitable to Dennis who had virtually ceased to be a pigfarmer, and had become a well-paid carter of refuse.

Anyway, bring the veterinary surgeon along and see what he saj's "". Brackenreg insisted, and declined to send the veterinary surgeon along, saying it was not necessary for that ho had condemned them himself, and that was sufficient. A few days after this, Dennis was put off carting the refuse, so as he had no income, had not grown more feed, nor stocked more pigs in consequence of the uncertainty of his position, he decided to get out, and sold his pigs to the local butchers, who slaughtered them, and the meat was duly passed, it being perfectly healthy, and Dennis departed leaving some "" Rosemary for Remembrance"" in the shape of a large unpaid rent account, and an -aery lands officer.

In March, 1028, Mr Coles received a telegram from Mr Brackenreg, Lands Officer to the Commission, advising that he was the selected applicant for the proposed and requesting his presence in Canberra for the purpose of establishing his bona fides, as well as to have a general conference in regard to the proposal. MT. Beasley. In A p r i l Mr Coles arrived in Canberra, and Mr Brackenreg explained that the Commission wished him to continue, on Dennis' farm unti l a new piggery was established. Mr Coles had, however, heard that swine fever had broken out on Dennis' farm, and he refused to have anything to do with that area. It was then agreed that a new farm site should be chosen outside the city area, and after inspecting several places, the present one was chosen. The reasons which decided Mr Coles on selecting the present site were assurances given by Mr Brackenreg and Colonel P. Owen ap follow:1. That the proposed new city abattoirs would be established immediately on the adjoining lot, and town water supply would be extended to it . 2. The new sale yards would adjoin the abattoirs. The only objection pointed out by Mr Colei to the proposed area was the absence of an adequate and permanent water supply, the visible supply of water being, in his opinion, inadequate for the needs of 500 hogs such as Those pigs are as healthy the Commission stated they would make provision to accommodate there. This objection was, however, definitely met by the gentlemen named with the assurance that the abattoirs would be erected forthwith, adequately supplied with town water and from which the piggery could secure connection should local water prove unsuitable or inadequate. Upon this assurance Mr Coles decided to go on with the proposition. Before returning to Sydney, on his first visit reg and the Colonel at the Commission offices, when he was shown a memorandum which had been furnished the Chief Commissioner, setting out the whole proposal, together with an estimate of cost. Copy of which is as under"" The Development Committee has for some time had under consideration the establishment of a hog farm with the dual objective advertiseof disposing of wet garbage from Canberra, times:and the establishment of a source of supply of swine to the abattoirs for the marketing of good pork in the Territory. The earlier deliberations were directed to the selection of a site, bearing in mind location within the proper zone, shelter from winter winds, water supply, suitable soil for raising crops, and proximity to the proposed abattoirs. In these deliberations the number of swine which it was thought would be on the farm was 500, and it was thought that the number might eventually extend to 1,500. During the deliberations of the committee given their view, for instanceThe Commonwealth Department of Health (Dr. Robertson, Director of Veterinary Hygiene).

The site finally concurred in by the committee is shown on the accompanying blue print, is to the northward of the industrial zone, and six hundred yards north of the site of the proposed abattoirs. One of the difficulties to overcome was the supply of water in sufficient volume at a location necessarily remote from the city services. Water supply w ill eventually be carried to the abattoirs, but in the meantime, to avoid heavy capital outlay, the site selected is not far from a good Bpring, which w ill afford sufficient water for the purpose. That, however, involves a capital outlay, part of which is for water reticulation, inherent to the establishment of a pic farm on any site anywhere. The site, although having a westerly aspect is fairly well protected by the natural growth of trees. There is area of arable soil sufficient for the disposal of any effluents, and for the raising of some crops suitable for pig feeding. All the authorities consulted concurred in the site being a good one. The actual layout of the farm was the subject of discussion with Mr Grey, Dr. Robertson and Mr Coles. Certain general principles have been observed as to drainage and orientation, and subject to some recent comments by Dr. materially affect the estimate of cost. Flans of the structures and a layout of the building, sties, paddocks, & c , have been prepared on the basis of the farm starting with S00 hogs.

The erection of a cottage on the site vraa the subject .of discussion by the committee, and the view held was that that matter should be finalized with the lessee, it being thought that the lessee might prefer a cottage in the most northern extension of the residential area, distant over two miles. There would be an advantage for a household in obtaining food supplies, and schooling""""for children, and in general environment, in living in this area, instead of right on the spot. Under such circumstances the lessee would require living accommodation alongside* the farm premises for such labour as he might employ. If the cottage is omitted from the total estimate, the farm premises, accessory structures, water supply, fencing, Ac, would cost £3,528. The committee is supported in its recommendation that the farm should be established forthwith by all the governmental authorities consulted, and it was gathered that Mr Coles would be willing to take a -lease, although the committee was not, at the time of interview with him, in a position to state what capital outlay would be involved.

After perusal, Mr Coles agreed to the suggestions therein contained, and Mr Brackenreg assured him that in order to ensure expedition, day labour would be employed, and the cost would be about £4,000 as mentioned in the memorandum Further, that when the piggery was complete, it would represent one of the most modern, hygienic piggeries in the Commonwealth.

718,"By Arrangement, Mr Coles Met Mr Bracken","Everything is proceeding satisfactorily; it is a very line turn-out, and I hope you w i ll be very successful and happy there. Mr Coles promptly visited Canberra to verify Mr Brackenreg's statements, but found there wus not a single water or feed trough on the farm, many vital essentials were lacking, including no floors or backs to pig shelters, no workmen's quarters, no farrowing rails, that the digester boiler was second hand; II umber of coppers inadequate for sterilization of food and pump at the alleged spring, or water hole, was damaged, and would not work. On his reporting this to Sydney, Mr Johnson brought under the Commission's notice the inaccurate nature of Mr Brackenreg's written representation's. As a result of this letter Colonel Owen interviewed Mr Johnson (accountant), in Sydney, and requested patience. The Commissioners were doing their best, and it would only be a few days when the farm would be ready for occupation. DuringJ u l j ' the stock master in Victoria advised Mr Coles that he coidd no longer hold the pigs (No. 3 l o t ) , and unless delivery was immediately taken they would have to be disposed of by public auction. Mr Coles inspected the farm a fortnight after Colonel Owen's visit to Sydney, and found that although the troughs had been delivered to the farm they were not in position, but that there was a limited supply of water on the farm, and that a start could be made in a limited way. He accordingly saw Mr Brackenreg, who, apparently believing that the eighteen months delay and expense imposed on Mr Coles had crippled him, demanded a bank reference, or guarantee, that he was in a position then to carry on the farm. This resulted in another visit by Mr Coles to Canberra, this time accompanied by his solicitor ( Mr Maund), when the Commission withdrew its demand for a guarantee, and promised to send a draft lease to Sydney for completion, subject to certain special conditions-on e asked for being a guaranteed supply of at least 1,000 gallons of water per day from the farm spring. This guarantee was not given, but a clause added setting out that if the local water supply failed, water could be supplied to the farm, providing, lessee paid 50 per cent, of cost incurred. This lease was executed by Mr Colc3 during August. When Mr Coles was certain that delivery of the farm could take on a definite date, he requested the Melbourne stock master to defer delivery of No. 3 lot of pigs, but was informed that his consignment had been catalogued for public auction at the Melbourne show sales on 29th September, 1929, and if he wanted any he would have to be present and bid to secure them. This Mr Coles did, paying as much as £40 for sows he had originally contracted to purchase for £8. The consignment purchased by Mr Coles comprised 25 brood sows in Mr Coles officially took over the farm on 1st October, 1929, and the stock arrived early in November. In November he purchased from Victoria a further lot of store pigs for fattening purpsass. They were consigned with a clean bill of health from both the Victorian and New South Wales authorities. On arrival they were placed in the outdoor shelters of the farm, which, at that date, were still in complete. Heavy rain fell a day or two after their arrival, and, having no adequate shelter, they contracted pneumonic enteritis, and a majority had to be destroyed, only 20 per cent, surviving. In this connection, it is interesting to note that on 19th June, 1929, Mr Coles informed Mr Brackenreg in writing, in reply to an inquiry of his of 17th June, 1929, "" t h a t it was essential to have the pens floored and ends boarded."" Moreover, owing to faulty construction, rain water ran into the pens off the semi-circular roof instead of outside& defect that was not remedied unti l twelve months after occupation. When Mr Coles was discussing terms ol the lease, he learned that improvements carried out by contract had cost £6,700, instead of £4,300 as originally estimated, while the farm was still incomplete. Under the lease he undertook to collect daily the edible garbage from all government institutions according to schedule attached to the lease. These comprised over 30 houses and institutions, of which less than half nv -* ; to-day. Tho Commisison had been pavi'V £2,000 to contractors to have this garbage removed. Thus Mr Coles relieved, and still is relieving, the Administration of that cost. The supply of garbage when the lease commenced approximated 3 tons per day, and was worth the cost of removal for pig feed. To-day, and under existing conditions, the quantity does not average half a ton per day, but the same removal charges have to be born© by Mr Coles, while the value of the garbage as pig feed is much less than the cost of collection. From a source of profit it has become a source of loss, and therefore a dir«»t charge against the farm. The water supply, originally intended to provide for 500 pigs, has never warranted the keeping of 50 pigs, while on occasions it has totally failed. This has taken place in the slimmer months of 1930 and 1931. In 1930 several pedigreed sows in pig died from thirst, and when Mr Coles applied to the Commission for town water, as provided for in his lease, he was informed, "" It has nothing to do with the Commission; it is your pigeon."" Ho had to consult the police, who in turn had to threaten the Commission with proceedings under cruelty to dumb animals before the Commission moved in the direction of re-adjusting the pump to obtain a* small supply still in the water hole. In 1931, water was supplied from town mains, and the Administration charged Mr Coles £6 per week for 1,000 gallons per day over four weeksor a total amount of £25 6s. 7d., being 50 per cent, of the total charges. If the farm had been fully stocked the water supply would have cost Mr Coles £30 per week during the dry period. On 18th December, 1930, regulations under the Public Health (Piggery) Regulations were gazetted. These provide that the proprietor of any registered piggery in the Territory "" shall provide a sufficient and constant supply of fresh water,"" for drinking and cleansing purposes. Penalty, £100. It also provides for suitable drainage being attached to each feeding trough. Although Mr Coles paid his registration fee, a' certificate has not been granted to him, nor can it be under existing conditions. Nor, at times, can the edible garbage supplied from the hotels be sterilized, aB provided for in the lease, because of shortness of water. In order that there should be no doubt but that the Commission was fully acquainted with Mr Coles's opinion that the water supply would prove inadequate, it is interesting to quote the following letter sent by him to the Commission on 18th July, 1929, paragraph "" There are also doubts as to whether the water supply, completed at a cost of £500, will be adequate, as on my inspection last week there were only 3 feet of water in the spring (about 250 gallons) notwithstanding the fact that I had been assured that it never failed, and was quite sufficient to provide the water to meet all my demands. I respectfully state my opinion that tliis spring will not at any time be sufficient to meet my requirements."" In view of (1) the incomplete state of the farm when taken over; (2) inadequacy of water supply to stock up -sufficiently to balance commitments; (3) shrinkage of edible garbage, and, therefore, pig feed; (4) losses sustained through inadequate shelter for pigs; (5) general uneconomic conditions imposed by the lease, as well as those prevailing on fhe f a r m ; (6) high rent; and (7) the staggering losses sustained by the lessee as a result of eighteen months' enforced idleness and travelling expenses, Mr Coles was compelled to ask for an inquiry during March, 1930, with a view to his being awarded compensation and redress. A general inquiry was allowed in March, 1930, and was conducted by the Commissioners, and as a result a drainage system was placed in operation on the f a r m ; shelters were floored and boarded, and certain of the pig troughs were cemented in. alleged spring had been proved to be a dud, several hundreds of pounds were wasted in trying to increase the flow of water. A rebate on the first twelve months rent was also granted, but no reduction in future rent. As the inquiry failed to give the lessee the relief and compensation he desired (a f u l l statement of which was supplied to, and at the request of, the Chief Commissioner, by Mr Johnson, for and on Mr Coles's behalf), the Third Commissioner (Dr. Alcorn) sought the advice of two world experts in regard to the general conditions and possibilities of the farm. They were Mr W. H . Potts, late principal of Hawkesbury College, and Mr David Stead. These reports are in the hands of the Minister, and copies are being procured. As the inquiry afforded the lessee no real relief he found it necessary to execute a deed of arrangement result that the farm bos been carried on for the past twelve months under that deed. The trustee of the estate has been Mr Beasley. impressing upon the Minister and the administration generally, the urgent need for a review of the rental and provision for an adequate supply of water. Finally the administration was advised three months ago that unless clemency and help was shown towards the lessee, Mr Coles' estate must be wound up. Four letters sent to the administration during that period remain unanswered, while a fifth has been acknowledged with an intimation that the rent would be reduced from'£500 to £250 during the next six months -the next year to revert to the f u l l rent charged. (See letter.) This offer is totally inadequate. Over £4,000 have been lost to date by the lessee and his supporters as a result of what the lessee claims to be unadulterated misrepresentation. Over £10,000 of public money has been spent on the farm and it is still incomplete. The object of the farm, viz., to supply Canberra residents with an adequate supply of edible pork at reasonable rates has not been realized and that through no fault of the lessee. As all appeals for a fair deal have been sidetracked by the administration, a demand is now made for a public and independent inquiry into the whole matter. The fact is that Mr Coles has given proof both of his bona fides and ability to make good if given a fair chance. He has held on tenaciously to his job of winning through to success and can be relied on to make good if only given a fair deal. In March of this year a world's record and two Australian records were made upon the farm in regard to pork production when a litter of eleven pigs from one sow attained the phenomenal weight of 2,506 lb. within six months, while the second record was created this week, with another litter of eleven pigs attaining the record weight of over half a ton in fifteen weeks. The results of these records have brought forth favorable comment from world-wide authorities with innumerable inquiries for stud Although the stock of the same breed from pig farmers all over the Commonwealth. If Mr Coles should f a i l through official mismanagement and apathy then it must react against the public in many ways. First, the capital cost will have to be written off; second, the Commissariat Department will have to find at least £1,500 per annum, now saved it on the collection of garbage by Mr Coles; third, the public w i ll have to continue to pay high prices for pork, when, if given proper water facilities, Mr Coles could provide all Canberra's requirements in pork at 8d. per lb. as against Is. 3d. at the present time, and fourth, a necessary local industry w ill be destroyed capable of giving permanent employment to four men. What is required is a scheme for conserving surplus water now running to waste. This could be done for an outlay of less than with his creditors with the £500. A further £500 would complete the farm in a way that would enable the original estimate of accommodating 500 pigs on the continuously farm being realised. In any case and under all circumstances the rent charged should be set oil against the known cost of garbage collection. The Government should not seek to have it both ways. The Public Accounts Committee would be the best tribune to submit the whole question to, and if that be done it does not require the mind of a seer to foresee that the result must be a damning indictment against the past and present administrations, and, perhaps, the discharge of some incompetent oflicers employed by them.

Surely, therefore, it is right, and, indeed, a mere not the Parliament, is in supreme control act of courtesy, that the Government should recognize that, with the exception of one small faction, fhe House is acting as one party in connection with this plan.

We are anxious in the interests of the country, to see the plan carried to a successful conclusion. The Prime Minister( Mr we stand, and for which the Government Scullin) has stated that the Government will ask the House to adjourn merely for a few weeks. I accept that promise because I know that the right honourable gentleman will honour it, but we of the Ounosition are not so confident regarding the attitude of the ministerial party We know that it subscribes to a policy different from that which the Parliament has adopted, and the outside organizations, including the recent Labour Conference, determined that that policy should be pursued. The Opposition has supported the policy that emanated from the Premiers Conference, and I desire to make clear that we shall resist every attempt to substitute for it the policy of inflation to which the Government was committed a few months ago. Having helped the Government to place on the statute book a policy in accordance with the rehabilitation plan, we want to be in a position to check any attempts to vary it. I may be told that without refeusing Supply for a full year we could still prevent the Government from retracing its steps. But once the Government has been granted Supply for twelve months it, and of the destinies of the country. member announce his decision to refuse Supply before last Saturday's conference in Melbourne? Labour Conference merely as an additional reason for the precautions I am taking. The Labour organizations had announced their attitude earlier. I give to the Prime Minister credit for having resisted their efforts, but I do not know how long his resistance can continue. The Opposition has no confidence in a policy of inflation. Possibly, as on other occasions, the Government will delay action until this Parliament has no alternative but to agree to measures with which it does not agree. For instance, when the proposal to export £5,000,000 worth of gold to London was brought has the honourable forward, the financial position had become so acute that we had no alternative but to agree to an expedient to which we had previously signified our uncompromising hostility.

In moving this amendment, I am adopting no hostile attitude to the Government. The position is that the leaders of the united party in this chamber, and in the Senate, interviewed the Prime Minister, and appealed to him to accept their suggestion. There was no hostility shown at all. In the past crises the remainder of the financial year. The have occurred, and they will continue to occur. This Parliament is not the only trustee of the people. The State governments are equally responsible, and at least one of those States has not acted up to the promise that its representative gave at the last Premiers Conference in Melbourne. Another crisis may develop at any time, and in that event this Parliament as a whole should have the right to deal with it. I claim that right, as representing the Opposition for the reason that we have been parties to the present plan and are partners with the Government in its efforts to achieve it. Therefore if a State Government takes any action which jeopardizes the success of the plan, we claim an equal right with the Government to deal with it. We have, for the time being, given up'all opposition to the Government because of the plan. We are just as much concerned with it as is the Government, and we claim the same right to deal with it whatever the circumstances may be. The plan is practically complete so far as this Parliament is concerned. Within a few hours it will be disposed of, but only with the assistance of honourable members on this side of the chamber. I move this amendment on behalf of the united parties. holding up the business of this chamber. the time of the committee. I have done everything within my power to facilitate the plan of rehabilitation. I have done nothing to hinder the Government, and if it will accept the amendment it can sition in regard to the plan. Even if the amendment is not accepted by the Government, we shall still stand behind the plan. There is no necessity to pass the whole of the appropriation at the present juncture. Only on rare occasions has the within a few weeks of the beginning of the financial year. I admit that it is desirable in normal circumstances to pass the Appropriation Bill early in the financial year, but in the special circumstances existing to-day, we are compelled to watch the operation of the plan.

740,Mr Lewis,"The honourable member is[10.55 a.m.] I liave clearly indicated on a number of occasions that the Government will not accept an amendment of this description, and I repeat that statement now. I shall give to honourable members good reasons why the Government should not accept the amendment, which, despite all the camouflage with which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr nine or eleven months of the financial Lyons) surrounded it, is calculated to do one thing only, and that is to humiliate -the Government in the eyes of the people of Australia. The proposal is to reduce Supply after this committee has agreed to the Estimates. Such an action is unprecedented in the history of this Parliament. On numerous occasions the Estimates have been delayed, but in every instance, so soon as the committee has approved of the various items of expenditure as set out in the Estimates,..the House be held up. Honourable members has passed the Appropriation Bill. There is a sound reason why there .should be limits to the amount granted under a Supply Bill. Parliament has a perfect right to control the national purse. I agreed with that principle when I was in opposition, and I agree with it now as head of the Government. must limit the supply granted by it under Supply Bills, because those bills are brought down before the Estimates have been passed. When the Estimates are passed, however, the Appropriation Bill is introduced and passed. Any Government that desires money to meet expenditure which has not been submitted to Parliament mu3t be content with a limited Supply. Hence this Government recently asked for one month's Supply only to enable it to carry on until all the items of expenditure for the financial year had been agreed to by Parliament. agreed to, and the usual course is to pass the Appropriation Bill. There has never been a departure from that practice. We are living in a time of stress, but we have passed through other abnormal periods, and never before has the practice of passing the Appropriation Bill immediately after Parliament has agreed to the Estimates been departed from. The Leader of the Opposition has said that it is quite usual for the Estimates to be submitted to Parliament late in the year, but I remind him that, to some extent, it has been the practice to bring down the Estimates early in the financial year. I have before me a similar list to that which he read, showing the dates upon which previous appropriations have been passed. On some occasions the Appropriation Bill has been passed as early as in August, and on other occasions not until year have elapsed. Does the-Leader of the Opposition suggest that we should now have three months' Supply, and at the .end of that period another three months' Supply, and so on until the end of the financial year ? The Estimates can be considered in another place only in the form of an appropriation bill, and, if the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is agreed to, they cannot be passed by another place; they must opposite have talked a lot about restoring confidence in the people., but how can we restore confidence in this country unless we bring down the Estimates early and obtain the appropriation for the financial year? It is the boast of the right honourable member for Parliament Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) that' he was the first Treasurer in recent years to bring down the Estimates early in the financial year. Only in the most extraordinary circumstances should a government delay for more than a month the introduction of the Estimates and the Appropriation Bill. If , instead of obtaining appropriation for the financial year, the Government introduced Supply Bills at threemonthly periods, the departmental expenditure would hot be authorized until months after it had been incurred. Such a practice would not he sound finance, and would not tend to restore confidence The Estimates have now been in the people. At this critical time in the history of Australia, when we are asking the bondholders of Australia to agree to a conversion loan of £556,000,000, the Leader of the Opposition, in moving his amendment, has placed a stigma upon this Government. He has said, in effect, that it cannot be trusted, that if it gets twelve months' Supply it . will go into recess and play ducks and drakes with Commonwealth revenues. The Leader of the Opposition talks about his responsibility. I have acknowledged",135,Commonwealth
741,Mr Scullin (Yarra,"Prime Minister)the help that we have received from all sections in this chamber in giving effect to this plan. We have taken a course of action that has been most distasteful to us, but we have taken it honestly. I believe that there is no one in this country, whatever may be his view of the plan, who has any doubt about the bona fides of the Government with regard to it. It ill becomes the leader of a party which talks of being a partner in the plan, to throw mud at the Government, and to say, ""We cannot trust the Government "", the inference being that the people mu8t not trust us. What chance have we of converting loans amounting to £556,000,000 if that stigma is accepted by the Government, especially in the light of all the propaganda that has preceded it? As the head of the Government, I would not attempt, in such circumstances, to appeal to the people to support that conversion. the plan. events, and reading carefully the statements that have been made in the last two or three days. One that is typical of many, was made by Mr Bruce, who was the head of the Government that left us this problem to solve. Last Tuesday's press contains a report of an address that the right honourable gentleman delivered to the electors at Bunyip, in the Flinders electorate. He then said that "" it was unthinkable that the Senate should consider any proposal that the House should adjourn for twelve months."" Who has suggested an adjournment for twelve months? It is the suggestion of honourable members opposite, and of these gentlemen outside, that this Government wants to rush into recess for twelve months. I have made the definite statement that before this House rises I shall move for its adjournment to a date to be specified, the only qualification being that Mr Speaker may call us together at an earlier, not a later, date. Leader of the Opposition has said that he accepts that statement. Let him, then, do so. am prepared to adjourn to a date to be fixed. I believe that Parliament should retain control over its sittings. The Leader of the Opposition suggests that wo would be in complete and supreme control, and that the Parliament would have no say; that we might change our policy and introduce something that he does not like. How could we do that without meeting Parliament and passing the necessary legislation? All this talk to the contrary is mere piffle. Let us lookat the record of this Mr Bruce, who talks about this Parliament going into recess for twelve months. He was Prime Minister from the beginning of 1923 until the end of 1929. In 1923 Parliament sat for thirteen weeks, in 1924 for 25 weeks, in 1925 for thirteen weeks, in 1926 for 24 weeks, in 1927 for seventeen weeks, in 1928 for eighteen weeks, and in his last year for twelve weeks. Imperial conferences were held in only two of those years. During 1930. notwithstanding the fact that I attended an Imperial Conference in that year, we sat for 28 weeks; and in the seven months of this year that have passed, we have This is an attempt to wreck sat for twenty weeks. We intend to go I have been watching on sitting. All the recess 'that I am asking for at this stage is, at the most, five weeks. I shall not have one week's holiday myself, because I shall be attending the Premiers Conference and meetings of the Loan Council, or shall be engaged in formulating the legislation that will arise out of them. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) says that the plan is complete. I say that it is not complete, but that so far as the Government is concerned, it will be completed. There are others to come into it, in addition to those who have already been reduced;there shall be no mistake about that. If the plan is not completed we shall test the issue before the people of this country, and see that it is. We have put our hand to the plough, and are not going to turn back ; not because we like what we are doing, but because we have been forced into doing it. The Leader of the Opposition conThe tends that we have been forced to adopt the policy of the Opposition. I deny that that is so. The Opposition On the next occasion also I has never put forward a policy for a conversion loan embodying the general reduction of interest. All that the Opposition ever suggested was to reduce governmental expenditure, to restore confidence. It claimed that if that were done, interest would automatically fall. In terest could not automatically fall on the £556,000,000 worth of loan securities. purpose of this amendment, the Leader of the Opposition said, "" We want to watch 'the working of the plan week by week"". So, also, do we. He then went on to say, "" If we grant you too much Supply you will not meet Parliament; so we' shall grant you three months' Supply"". Thus, he is not going to watch the working of the plan week by week, but quarter by quarter. I tell the honourable gentleman that we do not want three months' respite. months under the amendment. You will have only two. not be in recess for two months. The honourable gentleman talks about co-operation. This is not co-joperation. Again and again"" the statement has been made, "" If we grant Supply Ave shall lose control, because Parliament will rise for twelve months. We want to watch the plan, and we wish to make sure that the budget does not slide "". The Government, surely, has shown unmistakably its earnestness in watching the budgetary position! We liave done much that is distasteful to us. We intend to see that the plan is completed; but we are not going to ask the people of this country to show confidence in us while this stigma rests upon us. After all, it is the Government that is responsible, although the Leader of the Opposition may claim all the responsibility that he cares to assume. I have been prepared to co-operate with him or with anybody else in this national crisis. I have sat quietly under the sneer of some of my erstwhile friends that I have joined forces with the Opposition. L have stood taunts of that nature for months. I would be prepared to co-operate with anybody to help this country through the crisis with which it is faced. But because we have done that, we are not going to have our noses rubbed in the dust; our opponents are not going to be allowed to keep the chains on us. This is an unworthy proposition, and it has emanated from persons outside of this Parliament, who do not want to see the plan completed, as it is likely to touch them. I have learnt more than the honourable member suspects. I have heard the When asked what was the stories that have been going the rounds. I know some of the influences that are behind certain members of another place. We shall resist those influences, as well as this attempt to humiliate the Government. If it were true that this is the policy of the Opposition, and that we have adopted it, why try to thwart us? That is what is being done. I am inclined to think that the Leader of the Opposition does not realize what he is doing, and that there are more astute minds than his behind this move. I invite honourable members to consider the consequences of this action iu the present vital period of Australia's history. We are embarking upon something that is unprecedented in our history. We are proposing to put through the greatest Debt Conversion Loan that the world has ever known. Nothing approaching it has ever'been attempted in Australia. I have joined with the Leader of the Opposition, and the head of our great financial institution in an appeal to the people to have confidence in the Government of Australia. It is the Government in which they must have confidence, whatever that Government may be. Yet, on the very eve of that appeal, the Leader of the Opposition, who is a member of the National Appeal Committee, makes the statement that he cannot trust the predominant partner in this scheme. I say to the honourable gentleman, that if this move is successful, the Conversion Loan is finished so far as we are concerned. He cannot have it both ways. An appeal to the people to trust the Government and to restore confidence cannot be made while a dagger is held behind the back of the Government, and the argument is used that we cannot be trusted. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that his party was entitled to take this stand. It is entitled to do so only if it can become the Government of this country. If it can command a majority in favour of this amendment, it can become the Government when it has obtained sufficient support in the country. This is one of the most vital amendments that has ever been moved in any Parliament. No more vital amend-",136,Commonwealth

No self-respecting government in any civilized country in the world would accept such an amendment as other than a motion of want of confidence. Leader of the Opposition says that it has been moved in a spirit of co-operation. Probably he believes that that is so. Such an idea has been pumped into him by cleverer people than he; and it is those people who are behind this move. The Government will treat the proposal as vital wherever it is put forward. It will not leave this Parliament until this stigma and humiliation have been wiped out. to the people with this hanging over us. Had it been suggested that we might adjourn the discussion of the Estimates with a view to meeting the views of honourable members, the atmosphere would have been different. There is now an atmosphere of suspicion and of criticism, the idea being that the Government cannot be trusted with twelve months' supply after its Estimates had been embodied in the Appropriation Bill. We refuse to be placed in such a position, and shall treat the matter as vital. a.m.] -The Country party does not see eye to eye with the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. gentleman the Appropriation Bill. mates having been passed through the Committee of Supply with the concurrence of the Opposition, it was apparently recognized that they were framed on what is known as the Melbourne plan, for the consummation of which the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate have accepted joint responsibility. action now unusual ment in regarding it as a challenge. must have realized before he moved his amendment that the Government would regard it as such. That being so, it is evident that he must have so intended it. A fortnight ago, I moved as an amendment that tbe first item on the Estimates be reduced by £1, in order to direct attention to the necessity that exists for removing customs sur-taxes and of reducing customs duties generally, with the object of lowering the cost of living and of production. When I moved that amendment TheI did not expect that it would be regarded as a censure motion, and I did not intend it as such. I took that step as the only way open to me, to focus attention upon certain things which members of the Country party felt must be done; otherwise, the plan, in our opinion, would be incomplete. How did our friends of the official Opposition regard my motion? Let me quote the following extract from tlie Melbourne Argus, of We shall not attempt to go out Monday last, under the headings "" Mr Paterson's Amendment. Why it was not supported-United Australia Party Explains "":The amendment was accepted by the Ministry as a motion of want of confidence. To have passed it would have put the Ministry out of office. Parliament was considering a plan to meet n national emergency. Members of tbe Opposition generally are pledged to assist the Ministry in putting into effect as soon as possible the substance of the plan that was agreed upon at the Premiers Con' fcrence in Melbourne. That plan is a first step in the work of national rehabilitation. Its success depends upon prompt action by the Commonwealth and State Governments. The result of defeating the Ministry, in cooperation with. Mr Paterson, would have been to wreck the plan. To support an amendment having that effect, even though many members The honourable of the United Australia party might have has moved to amend been prepared to accept the actual words of The Estithe amendment, would have been to run the riBk of national chaos, and would have involved taking an unfair advantage of the position of the Ministry. To abstain from voting would have shown lack of courage. The Opposition was prepared to accept the responsibility of voting against the amendment, not because it believed in the Ministry, but because it was not a proper occasion on which to defeat the Ministry and interfere with the national plan. To my mind, the since then. to warrant the Governthe amendment, which I submitted a fortnight ago, and which, I repeat, I did The Leader of the Opposition not regard as a motion of censure, put the realisation of the plan into such danger that the United party felt it to be its duty to rally behind the Government-no t because it loved the Government, but because it valued the plan, and feared that my motion, if carried, might",138,Commonwealth

Is it complete? It is true that we have passed legislation with respect to that plan, measures for the reduction of pensions, and the wages and salaries of public servants. That part of the plan is in actual operation. There is, however, that if they give them consideration they another part of it equally necessary and important, and that relates to interest reduction. It is true that this House has also passed that legislation; but it is not yet in operation. We are waiting for one State to pass the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill. All the States have signed the agreement, but all the Parliaments must ratify it before we can proclaim the Debt Conversion Act which is based upon the agreement. After we have proclaimed it, three weeks must elapse, during which time those who wish to dissent from conversion may do so. A great deal may happen in that three weeks to ensure either the success or the failure of the conversion loan. I recall that, at the Melbourne conference, a comorable member going to start mudmittee was appointed, consisting, of three gentlemen who were to work together to make the conversion loan a success. They were entrusted with the task of making ajoint appeal to the better nature of the bondholders. These were the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the plan which stressed the voluntary Lyons), and Sir Robert Gibson. What kind of co-operation are we likely to get if one member of the committee puts another member out of^ office before the co-operation is begun? of that. The honourable member will save the situation. Leader of the Opposition, for whom I have the greatest respect, that the party to which I belong cannot be accused of having any special liking for the present Government. We are taking this action merely because we believe it to be right at this particular juncture. If the Go* vernment were put out by this means at this time, it would put an end to any regard to the conversion loan, and the situation that would arise could be described only as Gilbertian. It appears to me--and I speak for the whole of my party on this occasion -that by turning the Government out at this juncture, the Opposition would Unwittingly forge a deadly weapon to be used by opponents of the plan. I would like to submit these suggestions to members of the Opposition. It appears to me must feel that this is not the right time to take the proposed step. Many things would be said by opponents of the plan if this were done. I do not suggest that these statements would be true, or that many of them would have foundation in fact. For my own part, I believe that the members of the official Opposition are as earnest in their desire to carry out this plan as are any other members of this Parliament. But things would be said, and when mud is thrown a certain amount of it sticks. It would be stated, for one thing, that the Opposition was only anxious--throwing ? said that the Opposition was only anxious about one side of the plan-the part already in operation. It would be pointed out by opponents of the plan that the. Opposition was the particular party to aspect of the conversion loan. Much would be made of that. It would be said that the Opposition was not keen about penalizing those who did not desire to convert. to show what those who desire to put the plan into operation would be up against, and what they would have to refute, if the Government were put out of office at this time, and I submit that I",139,Commonwealth

It might also be said that certain banks, which have not yet announced all-round reductions on advances, might be encouraged to delay longer in the same hope. the official Opposition with any of these things. honourable member is doing it.

The whole scheme would be in danger if a general election and the voluntary conversion loan happened simultaneously. If the Opposition is not prepared to accept my arguments, I appeal to it to accept its own arguments as published in last Monday's Argus which I have quoted. member would not accept. Opposition seems to suggest that there is a similarity between my motion and his own, but there is a fundamental difference. Mine was not intended as a challenge; his,apparently, is. the honourable member that he would accept it as such, and yet he refused to withdraw it. it as such, and having moved it, I determined to stick tp it. If we dismiss the Government by means of a motion of this kind to-day, each and all of these factors that I have mentioned must come into play to render' uncertain the prospects of a successful, nation-wide conversion. We are right in mid-stream at this very moment in putting the conference plan into effect; we have not yet completed the job. There is a wise old proverb to the effect that it is not a good thing to change horses while crossing a stream. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned in his speech the fear he had that the Government would perhaps re-introduce its former proposals for the inflation of the currency. I am as much opposed to that as he, and my reply is that there is still the same means of resisting that as there has been up to now, namely, the majority in another place. Nobody in this Parliament can accuse me of having exhibited any undue affection for the present Government. I told the Ministry eight months ago that Australia could not remain solvent as a nation, unless we reduced our expenditure by. 20 per cent. I was hotly criticized, and, indeed, condemned, by the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) for that statement. Then came the time when the Government realized that there was no escape from doing this very thing; it had to eat its own words, and it did so. It agreed with things, and, as the Prime Minister said, it had put its hand to the plough, and, so far, had not turned back, despite tremendous criticism. The official Opposition, as has been stated several times by its leader, was a partner to the arrangement. The views of the Country party when that plan was put into effect were not sought, and we, as a party, if we had wished, could have regarded ourselves as free to please ourselves in the matter; we were not pledged to the plan. But some months ago, before the plan was evolved, I told the Government, on behalf of my party as did also the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of his, that if",140,Commonwealth

I frankly admit that I did not expect the Government to do that. But it has done it, and the Country party is prepared to make good its promise to support the Prime Minister until he has completed his task. We do not regard the task as yet finished. I repeat that we do not do this because we have any special liking for the present Government. We disagree with it on fundamental matters, especially with its economics, and at another time we shall cheerfully assist to turn the present Government out. I tell the Prime Minister this quite frankly; but we shall not do it at this particular period when the Government has half finished a thankless task in which we are supporting it, and in doing which it has received more kicks than commendation. The Country party asks from the Prime Minister a definite assurance that, when Parliament resumes, so soon as any pressing legislation arising out of the plan has been disposed of, full opportunity will be given to discuss the tariff in both Houses. assurance, and I shall repeat it later. ance we are prepared to support the bill, and to houour our promise to help to make the conversion loan a success; but we are not prepared to take part in any move which might endanger the plan which emerged from the recent Premiers Conference. General) [11.31 a.m.] I do not know that the speeches delivered by the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) leave very much to be said by others; but I have to acknowledge that in this matter there is something more in the minds of individuals than is involved in government solidarity. There rests upon the Opposition, and upon every member of this chamber, a responsibility to hiB constituency, and I believe honestly that every well-wisher of the plan, and every well-wisher of his country, will regret profoundly that this amendment has been moved this morning by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons). I say this in all sincerity. The Deputy Leader of the Country party has, with becoming candour, pointed out that, in due season, he will renew the fight which he and the members of his party have carried on against the Government and its policy. We expect that. We expect so much also from the Nationalist party. And it is natural that it should be so, because of the many matters mentioned here which, from the point of view of each party are considered vital. There is a world of difference between the policy of the Opposition, the policy of the Government, and the policy of the Country party. I think we all realize that the success which has attended our efforts in connection with the colossal task to which we are committed has been due, so far mainly, if I may say so without offence to the Opposition, to the extraordinary efforts and skill of the Leaders of this Government-the right honourable the Prime Minister and the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore). But, having done that, we do not forget that it has also involved action on our part. Although the task is distasteful and, on the face of it, incongruous with the policy of the Labour party as a whole, we have acted throughout in the defence of those interests which, in a very special sense, we have always been called upon to defend, namely, the interests of the wage-earner, the pensioners and others who are least able to defend themselves. We were working in defence of those interests before this plan was adopted, and while inevitably we were driven back, we have not surrendered though we have given ground, and it is our proud boast to-day that, as a government, we are seeking to serve with determination and courage the best interests of those whose welfare is, in that special way, in our charge. In the fulfilment of this task we have been made the target for a bitter attack-som e of it sincere and honest, some of it poisoned and dishonest. We have been held up before the electors as a government that has deserted its friends nnd its principles, and has made dishonourable alliances.",141,Commonwealth

We realized the great responsibility that was involved when we accepted the obloquy of appearing to desert principles which we hold sacred, and which have been made to appear more so by the interested criticism of those who, outside, and, I fear to some extent inside, this Parliament, have valued more the passing applause of those to whom they look for applause than the interests of the country as a whole. .But I do not wish, on this occasion, to make an attack on anybody. We have reached a stage at which, I hope, the great majority of honourable members desire to make this monumental work a success, because we realize how critical is the position in which we find ourselves, but from which we hope to emerge triumphant. Accordingly, we have looked round, and have extended the hand of friendship and cooperation to those who, in the past, have not worked with us, and to some who will not work with us now. But that is not our fault. We believe that we are serving the best interests of those who have the fir3t claim upon us-the best interests of the majority of the people of Australia, and we hope to maintain to the limit the rights of our citizens. In from office when it considers the time doing this, we are prepared, for the time being, to lay aside all thoughts of party conflict, and to work with any one who is willing to co-operate with us in serving this high ideal. ringah [11.40 a.m.] I agree with the sentiment expressed by the honourable the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) that this matter can be discussed without any bitterness. The action by the Opposition is perfectly straightforward. We believe that we are doing the right thing, and are prepared to go right ahead. Unnecessary heat was imported into the discussion by the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), who talked so excitedly about humiliation, and the support which he has received from this party in a perfectly genuine way. He can afford to take this stand, so long as he can play off the Country party against the official Opposition. But were he now in that position which he occupied on so many occasions during the last few weeks when, outside his Cabinet, he had only seven of his own party supporting him, when he never knew where his own whip was, or where the members of his party were, he would accept the support of the Opposition with the utmost cheerfulness and avidity. risk. right honourable gentleman is taking no risk now, because he has had an assurance of support from the Deputy> Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson). Because of this feeling of security the the right honourable gentleman felt at liberty this morning to indulge in mock heroics. He spoke of humiliation! Was there ever a government, within your knowledge, Mr Chairman, that has suffered more public and parliamentary humiliation than has been imposed on this Government lately? Its vacillation regarding vital issues has been characteristic of its leader throughout this crisis. Although the Country party intends to support the Government upon this occasion, the Deputy Leader has definitely intimated that his party will do its utmost to eject the Government opportune to do so. The Prime Minister does not regard that as a humiliation. On the contrary, he sees in it some hope of continued existence as the Leader of this Government. The Attorney-General said just now that, in order to give effect to the economy plan, Ministers had eaten the leek. Of course they have, and they have had their noses well rubbed in the ground. Accordingly, it ill becomes the Prime Minister to talk about humiliation at this stage. He spoke of the need for confidence, and told us that this Government, trusting in the confidence of the people, was going forward with the conversion loan proposal, and that it would be successful, because the Government had the confidence of the public. This Government has not the confidence of anybody in Australia. Have honourable members of the corner party and the people they represent any confidence in this Government?

Its defeat at the hands of the majority of members in this House would be an incident that would induce an unmistakable display of confidence by the people of Australia in the soundness of this country. I have listened to the abject apologies tion of the of the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) for what he did last week, and to his explanation that he did not mean his amendment to be a vote of censure. Although he was told that it was so regarded by the Government, he was prepared to go on with it. He was ready then to put the Labour party out of office, and he will try again, he says, as soon as he feels inclined. Yet he has the cool effrontery and audacity to-day to blame the United Australia Party for doing exactly what he did. Is the honourable member's attitude logical ? Is it even fair? I submit that to every right thinking honourable member it is contemptible. Putting aside the apologies of the Deputy Leader of the Country party, and his declaration that he did not intend his amendment to be regarded as a vote of censure, and the fact that, although he was told by the Government that it was a vote of censure, he still persisted in going on with it, with the paltry support of five followers, what sincerity can be attributed particularly in view of' the assistance it to the honourable member's attitude, or that of his party at this particular juncout its programme. It has played the ture? I heard with surprise his statement that he intended to apply to honourable members of the United Australia Party certain epithets, or adverse criticism. He took great pains to explain that he did not mean them, and that they were not true, yet he went on with them. He actually said that they could not rightly be applied to this party, interests. but that mud would be thrown, and he then proceeded to dip down into the gutter to scoop up huge handfulls of mud and hurl it at this party, prefacing his action by hoping that none of the mud would stick. is thrown some of it always sticks. accept the honourable member's correction, £556,000,000 conversion loan. The step which is infinitely worse than the remark taken to-day by the Opposition is most I attributed to him. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) need not have introduced the name and utterances of the ex-Prime Minister, Mr Bruce. On countless occasions, in this House and on public platforms throughout the country, the Prime Minister has declared that no government can be held blameworthy for the present posiCommonwealth, and that we are suffering from a world-wide depression. He made that statement in his budget speeches and in the Ashfield fiasco. He has repeated it in every speech he has delivered throughout the country. Yet, because he has now some temporary support, he is prepared to swallow anything in order to retain office. The Government has asked for Supply -for twelve months, but the people would have held the Opposition in this Parliament to be absolutely recreant to its trust if it gave the Government twelve months' s Supply. The fact stands out as clear as the top of a mountain peak that the people do not trust the Government. Five out of six men chosen at random in Martinstreet, Sydney, or Collins-street, Melbourne, would say that the present Go^ vernment should not be trusted with twelve months' Supply. The attitude of the Opposition is, therefore, a reasonable one in the circumstances, and has given to the Government to carry game. Not for one instant has it ever considered the party aspect. First and last and all the time its consideration has been for the interests of this great country. Whether its action to-day be right or wrong, it is solely dictated by the interests of the Commonwealth.

There are certain men who are prepared to wreck the plan, a*nd even the conversion loan, to regain seats in Cabinet, and as the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr the intriguing that is now going on in Paterson) has said, there are some bondholders who believe that if they can overthrow this Government they can avoid making certain sacrifices under the plan. banks to escape. banks to escape their responsibility, and avoid the reduction of interest they are to be called upon to bear under the Premiers' plan. In yesterday morning's Age appeared the following sentences:In the existing circumstances, and after these months iu which the Government has abundantly demonstrated its courage and its earnestness, any effort to thwart it would be the acme of party churlishness. Those Senators who are known to have been most active will doubtless think better of it. Some of them, indeed, might exercise their memory and challenge their conscience. once members of Governments whose persistent indulgence in recess attained to the dimensions of a scandal. Rationalist Government had Farliament in session for little more than three months. In 1929 the Federal Parliament did not function during two-thirds of the working year. Men who were prominent Federal Ministers then are credited with being arch-conspirators in the plot designed to embarrass and humiliate a Government which is bravely struggling to cope with difficulties which the Qovernment of these former years did much to create. If the current rumours prove to any degree true, they will constitute a most discreditable display of party intrigue. Happily, some of those senators who arc widely believed to be involved have the grace td show themselves somewhat ashamed; and, though willing to wound, are to-day less disposed to exhibit the malevolence of last week. The Australian people will hope that there are senators sufficiently capable of. rising above the mean-temptation to pick a quarrel with the Government. It would be madness to precipitate a struggle, but, if the Senate were misguided, a struggle there would be. Government having so much good strenuous work to its credit could be expected to submit tamely to the futile indignity arrogant senators think to impose upon it. Most people are aware that some of these senators are secretly longing to enjoy power, are secretly fretting because they are not at the centre of tlie picture. They will be wise to keep their The Prime Minister ambitions in check a while longer. The Australian people are in no mood to be tolerant of intrigue while their country continues in financial danger. The Age is not a Labour newspaper; it has always been a Liberal newspaper, but in a national crisis it is prepared to rise above party intrigue, and, certainly, above another place to defeat the Government in order that certain persons may get back into power. We know that certain persons were for a long time in office, and that they are prepared even to wreck would enable the the whole plan in order to conceal the real motive behind the step taken by the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber to-day. As has been said by the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan), the present Government has been obliged to do things most obnoxious to it. It would never have done them if it had not been impressed by the fact that the country was passing through a grave national crisis, and that if the Premiers' plan was not adopted, ensuring the payment of pensions and Public Service salaries, a more substantial evil would have fallen They were upon both pensioners and public servants. We have taken our political lives in our In the"" year 1927 the hands in accepting this plan. We realize that by doing so we must inevitably encounter much misunderstanding and criticism. Certain honourable gentlemen opposite have told us that they were prepared to help us to put the plan into effect; but now that we are half-way across the stream, so to speak, they want to throw us overboard. They think that this is a good opportunity to defeat the Government, and are doing all they can to bring that about. Is this because they fear that they are not getting enough limelight? Do they think that they are not getting enough kudos for their action in supporting the rehabilitation plan? They are undoubtedly trying to stick a dagger into the Prime Minister, while pretending to be a party No to the plan. Perhaps they are doing this because they realize that the action the Government has taken is being acclaimed throughout the country as bold and courageous, and in the best interests of the Commonwealth in this hour of grave financial crisis.",144,Commonwealth

But we realize that the plan must be supported if the welfare of the people who sent us here is to be our prime consideration. The Labour party has not thrown overboard its policy, nor has it given up any cherished Labour principles; it has postponed them for the time being, realizing that under the existing circumstances they cannot be put into operation. we simply decided that in a time of national crisis, such as this is, it is better to pay 17s. 6d. per week to our old-age and invalid pensioners and a reasonable salary to the members of the Public Service than to court financial ruin and national bankruptcy, with the inevitable result that ten times more people will be thrown out of employment. I am astonished at the attitude adopted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr boundeu duty to support it . If we did Lyons), for I gave him credit for being sincere in his desire to see this plan put into operation; but he has not taken the high stand of the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson), who is not prepared at a time like this to sacrifice the interests of the community in order to stab the Government in the back, and thereby wreck the plan. member of the Government, and of the Labour party, intend to support the Prime Minister's attitude on this amendment. The Opposition will make a great blunder if it forces the issue to an elecand given me no quarter. I suppose that tion, for it will thereby undoubtedly seriously endanger the success of the conversion loan. I urge the committee to vote against the motion. I support all that the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) has said on this issue. The statement which he made was considered by the members of the Country party and endorsed in every respect. I regret that some heat has been imported into this debate, for there was no need for heat. I regret, also, that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) saw lit to cast aspersions on the motives of the Deputy Leader of this party. knows our Deputy Leader knows that he is incapable of doing anything that is mean or contemptible. Yet a fortnight ago when he moved a certain motion in this House, it was said that he was doing something mean, and now that he has taken action in the opposite direction it is being said that he is doing something contemptible. Such statements are not conducive to orderly debate and the peaceful settlement of a dispute. It has -also been said that the Prime Minister is trying to play off the Country We had to face facts and party against the official Opposition. That is a ridiculous statement. Everybody knows that we have practically nothing in common with the Labour party, except the policy involved in the financial rehabilitation plan, while we have very much in common with our friends who sit on the same side of the chamber as we do. Nevertheless, when the Government is acting in a way which we regard as sound and desirable, it is our not do so, we should be dishonest. 1 entirely repudiate the suggestion that the Country party is actuated on this occasion by ulterior motives. We are supporting the Government because we believe thai it is the right thing to do. To-day we must be above party, and act only for the good of the country. No one can I , and every truthfully say that either I or the Deputy Leader of the Country party have any love for this Government. I have opposed the Labour party throughout my political life, and it has invariably opposed me so long as I remain in politics I shall oppose the Labour party. There is, therefore, no reason why I should "" smoodge"" to the Government, or why it should "" smoodge"" to me. My reason for supporting it on this occasion is that I think that it is acting wisely in the best interests of the country. It was stated quite clearly by the Deputy Leader of the Country party that our action in supporting the Government on this occasion was not to be construed as an intention to support it on every occasion. We shall fight it whenever we think it proper to do so. The honourable member for Warringah used Everyone who a statement of the Deputy Leader of this",145,Commonwealth
776,Mr Hunter (Maranoa) [12.3].,"party to that effect as a reason for attacking him and his party; but he was quite unreasonable in doing so. It is proper that we should support the Government when it is doing what we think it ought to do; and it would be equally proper fbr us to fight it and do our best to turn It out of office when it is doing something that we are opposed to. When that time comes, as it must come sooner or later, because the policy of the Labour party is different from our policy, we snail certainly fight the Government and do our best to defeat it. But while it fa doing what we wish to have done, we must support it, if we are honest. We will fight the Government and attempt to put it out of office only when it is takdebate which they are afterwards sorry ing some action which we regard with disapproval. The honourable member for Warringah practically said that we would stab the Government in the back when an opportunity presented itself to us to do so. That is not the way the Country party fights its battles. We never stab people in the back, nor do we stand in ambush with a gun in our hands to shoot our enemies as they pass by; we fight fairly and openly. We shall not fight the Government at a time when it is doing its best to give effect to a policy which we have advocated for a long time, particularly as in doing so it has incurred the wrath and enmity of many of its own supporters and has torn its own party to tatters. The Government is acting courageously. We have no reason whateVer to question the purity of its motives, and we shall therefore, support it. There will be no stabbing in the back by the Country party. We aro sincere in our desire to see the rehabilitation plan brought to a successful issue. We also wish to see the conversion loan successfully floated. It must be apparent to everybody that the loan could not be stTcccssfully floated during an election campaign. Such a campaign would be inevitable if the Government were defeated on this amendment. In my opinion the official Opposition has chosen a wrong time and a wrong issue on which to attack the Government. We are prepared to grant the Government the supply desired. long will the Country party be willing to so, but they have shown that they will grant Supply? able member for Warringah should not provoke me too much for I have a lot of documents that I could read if I wished to do so. able member may read anything he likes about me; in fact, I challenge him to do so. that remark. spill the beans. what I did. Honourable members unfortunately do say things in the heat of for. I was led into making the remark about the honourable member for Warringah, because he attacked the motives of the Deputy Leader of my party, and abused him personally aud politically. As I have already said, my deputy leader is incapable of doing a mean thing, either politically or personally. I endorse all that he said in his speech, and I will oppose the amendment. -Anothe r sham fight is being staged. It might appear that this amendment was sprung on the committee, but the Deputy son) has shown that that is hot so, for he has just delivered what amounted to a written speech, and has admitted that his extended notes were submitted to the Country party and approved by it. This proves that it was well known by most honourable members opposite that this amendment was to be moved. I therefore liken this debate to a sham fight, in which the contestants dress up in military uniform, equip themselves with bayoneted rifles, but carefully put corks on the ends of the bayonets so that it will be quite certain that nobody will be hurt. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter), who has just spoken, and the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), and the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) are always asking 'the members of the group to which I belong why they do not throw the Government out of office.

He defined "" Patriotism"" last refuge of a scoundrel"". Attorney-General talked a lot about honourable members who criticized this Government because they desired to win the plaudits of the crowd; but no one plays to the gallery more than he does.

Only a person with the cold-blooded mentality of the honourable gentleman could do that kind of thing. I, and other honourable members of this group, may make unwarranted remarks during the heat of a debate, but no one is more ready than we are to withdraw them a moment later. What has the Prime Minister to worry about? The Opposition has compelled the Government to accept its policy. The Government has been so humiliated that I wonder it is not devoid of all sense of shame. It is acting the part of the cat which, in pulling the chestnuts out of the fire for the monkey, had its paws burnt. In this instance it is the Opposition that wants the chestnuts. No one is hungering more for office than' the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), who knows that he is playing with the Prime Minister as a cat plays witha mouse.

The( Mr Brennan) emphasis and emotion to those prinSfr. ciples which he says he holds so dear; but will the Minister tell me of one which he has not sacrificed for the sake of office? Not one shred of any of those principles which he once so readily espoused is left. They have all been completely shattered. The Attorney-General has bartered his principles for the sake of office. This Government has bartered I repeat a remark that I those principles which the Labour party has always cherished as sacred for a few months' occupance of the treasury bench.

We believe that this scheme, in the propounding of which the Opposition has played a part, should be policed throughout. In the light of certain decisions that have been come to outside, it is hard to tell what may happen to the Government that now occupies the treasury bench. More than one Labour conference has recently declared its unflinching opposition to its propositions. Therefore, the Opposition is right in taking this precautionary measure of refusing to grant twelve months' Supply. Supply for a quarter, or for even two months, will enable the government of the country to example of our co-operation in giving effect to the plan. about that. I believe that if the people of this country realized that there was a prospect of an election at an early date, that would be one of the greatest aids to the successful flotation of the conversion loan. Confidence would be restored, because the people would know that they would have an opportunity of replacing the present administration with one that they could trust. It can be said of the Leader of the Opposition that "" Joe Lyons can be trusted; he will stick to his word, and fight for it "" .

If that is the honourable member's belief, he should appeal to his leader to withdraw from the conversion campaign upon which he proposes to embark with the Leader of the Government. It would be interesting to know whether the Leader of the Opposition Warringah that the Government is not trusted by the people. If he does, the draw from the campaign. vernment of this country, and they have confidence in themselves whatever party happens to be in power. good to have the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition that he does not agree with the irresponsible utterances of the honourable member for Warringah. That honourable member jibed at the Prime Minister, and said that he was glad to have'the support of the Opposition while the Government was endeavouring to put the plan into operation. The Government stands to-day exactly where it has stood since the plan was first mooted; but where does the honourable member stand? The Government wants to see every part of the plan carried out. It has stood for The people of this things that are distasteful to every honourable member on this side. But we found ourselves in the position of having to implement the plan, and we did so willingly. We have shown our preparedness to take all the risks associated with of this country.

808,Mr Parker Moloney,"It is in the position of having to accept 12s. a week. Those who opposed that proposal could offer no alternative; and they cannot deny the accuracy of what I have stated. Public servants and others who have had to suffer a small cut would have been subjected to a much bigger one had the plan not been given effect. Therefore, I say to the honourable member for Warringah: we stand exactly where we stood when he supported us. But where does he stand? We are standing foursquare, not only for those things that were distasteful to us, but also for the principal portion of the plan, which is to secure relief from interest charges on behalf of the primary producers,fchebusiness community and the people as a whole. That measure of relief has been too long denied to them. It is remarkable that difficulties should arise when we have reached that portion of the plan. I say candidly to honourable members opposite that there is grave suspicion of collusion among themselves and certain outside parties to break down the plan at this very vital stage. No portion of the plan is more vital than that which pro-, vides for the reduction of interest, so as to give relief to the great mass of the people of this country. Why is it that, having reached that stage, unprecedented action is ttoken in this chamber ? Sitting suspended from 1.45 io 2.15 p.m. believe that the action taken by the Leader of the Opposition represents his own considered opinion. If it does, it shows a lack of judgment on his part. There is more than a suspicion that this attempt at a hold-up by the Nationalist party was planned by the Leader of the Opposition in another place. There is a suspicion that it was devised in collusion with certain outside interests, which are adopting an attitude at this stage that does them no credit. I think that the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber has been used as an instrument to implement this sinister scheme, the idea being that, if it succeeds, well and good, and, if not, the Leader of the Opposition must take the discredit of it. In not consulted about it. We were merelj my opinion, the hand behind it is that of the Opposition Leader in another place, who is in collusion with outside interests. Those of us who know him, realize that he is the most disgruntled and sour individual in politics, because he has been out of office during the last twenty months. He is prepared to go to any length to. use the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber to further his own ends. Perhaps the most pitiful argument advanced this morning was that of those honourable members who endeavoured to excuse their attitude by saying that somebody else, 8 week or so ago, had done fhe same thing as they were now doing. One is reminded of the school boy, who, when he has done wrong, endeavours to avoid punishment by saying that another boy has committed a similar act. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) sought to excuse themselves by remarking that the Deputy Leader of the Country party had submitted a similar amendment a week ago. was not consulted regarding the plan, and it did not commit itself to it. from that fact, members of the Nationar list party know that what was done by the Deputy Leader of the Country party was a common thing; he moved for the reduction of an item in order to draw attention to a particular matter; but this (Thursday). amendment is' unprecedented, and it is capable of only one interpretation. The Prime Minister told the Opposition that he did not intend to ask for a long recess. He has said time and again that the adjournment will not extend over more than five weeks. Whatever may be the reason for the tabling of the amendment, the action taken brands its sponsors as the would be destroyers of the plan, and there is more than a suspicion that the Nationalist party is acting on behalf of outside interests that desire to prevent its successful operation. [2.20] I much regret that the Lea<fer of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) saw fit to submit this amendment, especially since the members of the Country party were informed that the Opposition intended to -table it.",151,Moloney A Honest Course For Him Would Be To With

This amendment is of such grave importance, that the Nationalist party should, at least, have paid the members of the Country party the compliment of conferring with us, not to see how far we might embarrass the Government, but to determine the best course to pursue to promote the welfare of Australia. I cannot imagine at a time like the present any worse tactical move than that which has been taken by the direct Opposition when the rehabilitation plan, which is attract1 ing the attention of all sections, has just been launched, and when members on both sides have committed their political fortunes to it. The Leader of the Opposition appears to have committed a prodigious political blunder, and has not given the members of my party a chance of considering carefully the probable result of his action. With two points that the Leader of the Opposition insisted on I totally disagree. I do not wish to import any heat into this discussion, because it would be dangerous for us to-wrangle over this plan. It is a pity that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) did not continue his speech on the note with which he began it. The Leader of the Opposition based his case upon the definite statement that the plan was the plan of the Opposition. His other point was that it was the duty of tlie Opposition to police the plan, and he was strengthened in that contention by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Penton), the tenor of whose speech was that the sole motive of the Leader of the Opposition was to see that the plan was policed. I maintain that the Opposition never heard of the plan until it was formulated at tbe Premiers Conference. If the Opposition did know that it was being evolved, and that it was to embody the final scheme of reconstruction, its knowledge was kept a deep secret from members of the Country party. I venture to suggest that the majority of the members in the Nationalist party did not know what the details of the plan were until they were published at the Premiers Conference. 1 do not know why the members of that party wish to father this plan when they have no sound claim to having originated it. Everybody knows that the Country party was not represented at the Premiers Conference. We have often been accused of a desire to promote our party interests at the expense of the rest of Australia. My answer to that criticism is that, although we had every reason to feel that we had been practically ignored in regard to the gigantic task of financial reconstruction, we decided that, as the plan had been adopted by the Premiers Conference, and by all the great parties in Australia, we, too, would stand behind it. sistent in the matter. only party that has been consistent in our support of the plan. 1 think that the proceedings in this House in the last few weeks will show that the Country party has not receded from the patriotic position which it assumed when it committed itself to the plan. We do not claim to be responsible for it, and we do not desire to police it. The proper authority to do that is the present Government, which has assumed responsibility for it. All that the Opposition has been asked to do is to assist the Government to inaugurate the plan. While the present Government remains in power it is the only authority that has any right to police it ; therefore, I consider that the Leader of the Opposition has based his motion on utterly untenable premises. In the first place he claims that it was the plan of the Opposition. agreed to without the help of the United party? party, and the Country party, gave an undertaking that they would support it, and up to .the present stage' we have honorably carried out our promise.

818,Mr Thompson,"No; but thatfinancial collapse of this country. I accepted the Prime Minister's assurance that the only motive that actuated him was the desire to avert financial disaster, aud the Country party has not sought to make political capital over the matter. Certain honourable members on the Government side did not, at any time, support the reductions included in the plan for the restoration of financial stability. They may say that they could go to the country at any time and secure the endorsement of their constituents for their attitude. I admit, too, that they could put those honourable members who do support the general scheme in a difficult position so far as a portion of their electors are concerned. 1 am not under any delusion in regard to this matter. I believe that it will be extremely difficult for many honourable members to satisfy their electors in regard to all that has been done in connection with this plan. As I have said, the plan is the production, not of any particular party, but of this Parliament. Therefore, it is not fair that any one section of the House should endeavour to persuade the people that the plan is their particular scheme. Responsibility for it rests upon the whole Parliament. said. able gentleman has gone further; he has, in effect, declared that he is not prepared to trust this Government to give effect to it. frankly. the honourable gentleman, some time ago, give the Prime Minister a definite assurance that his party would loyally co-operate with the Government in giving effect to it? The motion before the House implies a lack of trust in the Government; a proclamation to the people that something has happened to make the members of the party which he is leading dissatisfied with the attitude which the Government is likely to take up. No member of this House can say truthfully that the Government is likely to default in the carrying out of the plan. In the absence of such evidence, it is impossible for fhe Leader of the Opposition to justify his declaration of lack of trust in the Government's bona fides. Although it is true that honourable members on this side brought pressure to bear upon the Government to reduce expenditure, nothing was ever said about the reduction of the interest burden until that proposal was dealt with at the recent Premiers Conference. so. The matter was mentioned by the honourable member for ""Wilmot in a number of speeches delivered before the holding of tlie conference. matter was mentioned in that way, and 1 believe that the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) was the first to foreshadow the plan which was adopted by the conference, because he was the first to declare definitely that nothing short of a 20 per cent, reduction in all governmental expenditure would meet the situation. But, as an Opposition, we did not at any time consider the practicability of a proposal to consolidate the whole of our internal debts into a new issue of securities bearing a lower rate of interest. That scheme emerged from the Premiers Conference, and was adopted by the party to which I belong, and other sections of the Opposition, as an inescapable part of the general scheme of reconstruction. We realized that it would not be possible for us to approve of and advocate a reduction of pensions, Public Service salaries, and other forms of governmental expenditure unless we were prepared to go a step further and approve also of that part of the scheme relating to the reduction of the interest burden. Accordingly, we have no right now, at this critical stage, to make a gesture which may be regarded as an invitation to the people to withdraw their confidence, not only from the Government, but also from the Parliament, because surely it is obvious to all that if now we withhold co-operation in giving effect to the plan, the public will believe that members of Parliament as well as the Government are not to be trusted. I -suggest, therefore, that the course adopted by the Leader of the Opposition is an extremely dangerous one. member heard that Senator Colebatch has",153,Moloney A Honest Course For Him Would Be To With

Buti t is now too late to retreat. Since the plan has been approved by both Houses, surely honourable members will not now discredit themselves by indulging in party warfare. Whatever we may lose by the surrender of political advantages, in our advocacy of the adoption of the plan, we will more than make up in the long run by the knowledge that we havo played the game, not only to the Government, but also to ourselves and the people whom we represent. If we allow party bitterness to intrude at this critical stage in our history, very few of us will survive an appeal to the people. Our places will be taken by others who will have no political sins to answer for, and who, for that reason, will make a wider appeal to the electors. I think it is necessary to utter this word of warning to those who approve of the dangerous course that has been adopted by the Leader of the Opposition. This morning the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) again twitted members of the Country party with being always ready to make a demonstration in a sham fight.

The honourable member did, however, say that we were now the allies of this Government. We are to .the extent that the Government adheres to its pledge to give effect to the rehabilitation plan, and I think we need offer no apology for our support under those conditions. We cannot, therefore, be accused of being the allies of the present Government, any more than honourable members on the other side can be accused of being allies of the Nationalist party. The object of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) was to make out that the Country party had changed its political tactics, and for the time being, was virtually part and parcel of the Labour party. That is not so. We believe that the present Government, with its knowledge of the situation, is best equipped to carry out the task of rehabilitating the finances of this country, which has been thrust upon this Parliament, and that a new Government, lacking in experience of the present situation, would not be similarly equipped. Indeed, we think it would be a disaster if the present Government left the treasury bench before this task is completed. It will take a long time to carry out that task, and although it will be the duty of this Parliament to see that the period is not unduly prolonged, it must give the Government a reasonable chance. In the meantime we do not expect the Government to introduce any measures likely to meet with violent antagonism from this side of the chamber. It is true that we opposed the Government's fiduciary notes policy, because we did not believe in it, and in fact regarded it as a much more dangerous method of solving our financial problems than any other method yet put forward. The Government realized that it had no chance of getting away with that policy, and dropped it. In doing so, I think it displayed courage. At any rate we should not ridicule it or humiliate it or, as some have suggested, "" rub its nose in the dirt"" , because it has done so. It takes some courage to admit that you are wrong. not admit that it was wrong on that occasion. in its policy the Government admitted that it was impracticable to carry it out. When a Government says that it does not propose to go on with certain bills, advancing no reason other than that it does not consider that it is practicable to do so in the present situation, I think we ought not to pursue the subject further. In any event the Government has intimated that it will not bring forward its fiduciary policy again during the life of the present Parliament. I take that to be the meaning of the assurance given by the Prime Minister. assurance ? tions, the Prime Minister has repeatedly said that the Government had no intention of again bringing that proposal forward.

The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) has been accused of moving his amendment in the interests of people who are outside this Parliament. I am not in a position to say whether that is correct or otherwise. the underlying motive of the Opposition is to demonstrate to the public that it will still retain a guiding hand in the application of the Premiers' plan. In the final stages of the Premiers Conference, when these decisions were being arrived at, leading members of the Opposition were called in, and, from what I can gather, were given a status equal to that of the Premiers and leaders of the Commonwealth Government. conference. had as much influence as anybody else at that conference. The point at issue to-day seems to be: To whom does the plan belong? I think we can dispose of any claim on the part of the Government very quickly. bulletins issued by it a few months ago shows conclusively that, at that time, its policy was entirely the opposite to this course, the Prime Minister in the plan. Ministers stated in fairly strong language that in no circumstances would they surrender to the ultimatum of the Commonwealth Bank Board that salaries, wages, and pensions of all kinds must be cut before the board would give any financial assistance to the Commonwealth Government. The declaration of the Government, in which it refused to accept that ultimatum, is conclusive evidence that, up to a few months ago, the Premiers' plan was not the Government's plan. Indeed, we can safely say that the Leader of the Opposition is responsible for a large portion of the plan, because, when he was Acting Treasurer of the Commonwealth in October last, his policy was on lines similar to what has been incorporated in the plan. He says himself that his proposals at that time were net so drastic as those which have been put before us by the Melbourne conference. ber for Wilmot did not make his proposals public. formed that the Ministers who were away at the time concurred in his proposals; but he met with such opposition that he was prevented from giving effect to them. Tracing events down to the present time, we can come to no other conclusion than that this plan is a'combination of the proposals .of the present Leader of the Opposition and those of the banking institutions. I believe that the purpose of the move by the Leader of the Opposition to-day is to demonstrate that his party is still desirous of maintaining the same grip upon the plan that it has had up to the present time. The Government cannot deny that effect could not have been given to the plan if it had not been for the support of tbe Opposition in this House. The Hansard division lists indicate how few were the supporters of the Government who voted for it. The Government depended entirely on honourable members opposite. Those honourable members, therefore, can rightly sustain their claim to maintain their hold upon something A perusal of the with which they have been associated prior to the Premiers Conference and from then to the present time. Of strongest language at his disposal has denounced the Opposition for its move to-day, saying that the purpose behind it is to wreck the plan, and we gather from the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) what is meant by the suggestion that the plan will be wrecked.

Tlie obligation rested on it before outside, as they are .called, who are reit gave effect to any part of the plan to see that all interests, particularly the banking interests, bore their equal responsibility. The people least able to defend themselves have been adversely affected; their remuneration has been arbitrarily reduced, whereas others have been allowed to work out their reductions in their own way and in their own time. As a matter of fact, there is considerable doubt whether they will ever give effect to their cuts, and according to the Government the move of the Leader of the Opposition to-day is to provide them with a loophole of escape. The Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Prime Minister attended a conference of Paterson) followed closely upon the Prime Minister, but, of course, the Prime Minister already knew the intentions of the Country party. He knew that the Government was safe. That is why I look upon this move with amusement. did not communicate with the Government in any way. communicated with the Country party. very much. The real test of the sincerity of the honourable members of the Opposition and the supporters of the Government will occur in the Senate, and we shall watch the proceedings in that chamber in the next twenty-four hours with a lively interest. I noticed that when the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) was speaking, some honourable members on this side of the committee accused him of treachery; but if those honourable members are to-day supporting the so-called rehabilitation plan they have no right to charge the honourable member for Maribyrnong with treachery unless they are willing to admit the justice of a similar charge against themselves, for the honourable member did in October last only what they are doing now. The Attorney-General( Mr Brennan), in the abusive speech which he delivered, accused certain honourable members of playing for the plaudits of the crowd outside. For my own part, I would far sponsible for my political position, than accept the plaudits of my political enemies, and the backing of a press which almost always is totally hostile to the Labour movement. I have no doubt that the Attorney-General was glad to accept the applause of the banking institution* when he agreed to advocate the adoption of this plan. But I remind him that the large industrial organizations of Australia, which are principally responsible for"" the existence of the political Labour party, have, during the last two months, made many declarations in condemnation of this plan. Only a few days ago the the Labour party in Melbourne, which, despite his defence of the plan, declared itself to be totally hostile to it. There is no doubt about the attitude of the rank and file of the Labour movement towards this plan. I am afraid that some honourable members consider that after they have been elected to this Parliament they can bring to bear a greater degree of intelligence upon the problems of national finance than when they were private citizens. For this reason, insufficient as it is, they are inclined to regard with scorn any opposition to their own views. I do not adopt that attitude.

As I have said, the test of the sincerity kind by the Opposition was probable, and of honourable members of the official Opposition and the so-called Labour supporters of this Government will be determined when the attitude of another place is known. The plan is being supported by the traditional enemies of the Labour party, and by a few honourable members who were elected as pledged Labour men. In these circumstances, it seems to me that the electors might well exclaim, like Mercutis, "" A plague o' both your houses."" am very sorry that the members of the Country party have intimated that they are not prepared to support the amendment.

It is a groat pity that intriguing interests outside of this House have been able to cause some degree of estrangement between the various parties which sit on this side of the committee in opposition to the Government, for I believe that we should be able to cooperate in a very large measure. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), in his speech, said that political tacticians outside of the chamber were bringing influences to bear upon the parties which sit on this side of the chamber. It will be very unfortunate if highly desirable financial and other reforms designed to improve the economic position of the country are delayed on this account. The Prime Minister made a tremendous lot about having his nose rubbed in the dirt, and so on. He said that had the Government been asked to delay the tlfiOJ consideration of the Estimates for some little time, he would have been prepared to consider the proposal; but that he could not submit to the humiliation of having the Appropriation Bill passed in sections, as it were. That, he said, was intolerable. But the right honourable gentleman had certain unofficial warnings some time ago that a move, of this he could then have intimated that he was prepared to consider meeting the Opposition in some way. The fact that he is now riding the high horse is no reason why we should give him a blank cheque for the next twelve months. member knows very well that a blank cheque will not be given if the Appropriation Bill is passed, for the Government would not be able to spend a penny outside of these Estimates. would be some restriction on the Government; but I remember that the Prime Minister signed an agreement in Melbourne about this time last year, in which he undertook that his Government would effect substantial reductions in expenditure. It is true that the expenditure of the Government has not exceeded the amount voted in last year's Estimates; but it has been guilty of wilful neglect ment. In consequence of the financial drift that has since occurred, additional treasury-bills have had to be issued, and a large amount of our gold has had to be shipped abroad. If the Government did not spend more than was voted on the Estimates last year, it certainly spent a great deal more than it was justified in spending in view of the changed conditions of the country. If the Prime Minister had given effect, to the agreement which he signed last year, it is possible that we could have overcome our difficulties by making a 10 per cent, cut in adjustable government expenditure, instead of the 20 per cent, cut which we have now been forced to make in order to prevent a total collapse. Not only did the Prime Minister fail to give effect to the August agreement of ""last year, but he has also failed to carry out the antiinflation policy which he advocated in certain cablegrams which he sent to hi» former colleagues while he wag ra.",158,Moloney A Honest Course For Him Would Be To With

Cabinet and allowed those who were' his firmsupporters' in his absence to be turned out of office in order that Certain inflationary schemes could' be subinittedi to Parliament. It is proposed that fiduciary notes should be issued. upon the finances of the country, and severely shook the confidence of the' people. The Sydney Morning Herald of the' 27th July, published a table detailing the Australian banking aggregates-. It Bhowed that the issue of Commonwealth notes increased from £33,464,328 at the 30th June, 1930, to £46,795,-724 at the 31st' March, 1931, and to £51,160,531 at the' 30th June, 1931. This serious increase in the note issue was necessary in order to meet the needsof the Commonwealth and State Governments. Although we hav'd not yet reached the statutory limit of our note issue, we are coming dangerously near it. This is revealed by figures published in to-day's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, which indicate that our note issue has been increased by another £500,000, and our gold holdings have been largely reduced duty of honourable members to do every-' thing, in their power to prevent a continuation of this financial drift, and that isone of the objects of the amendment. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) said that if the Government introduced another fiduciary notes bill the Country party would regard it as a breach of faith; but if we reach the statutory limit of our note issue it will be' extremely difficult to prevent the issuing of more notes. If this amendment is agreed to, it will make it ex' trernely difficult for the Government to give effect to any inflationary ideas that it may still desire to put into operation. The only way in which Parliament can prevent the continuance of the drift in Commonwealth finance is by retaining some control over appropriation. It was not until we were approaching the end of the financial year that the Government, realizing that it would need Supply, began to consider the plan proposed by certain State Premiers. The Government then dropped for a time its Fiduciary Notes Bill, Itfr. Hawker. and enteredi into negotiation with the State Premiers,and eventually ! adoptedwhat, is now known as theMelbourne' Agreement. The right honourable the Prime Minister said' that if Parliasnient keeps control over appropriation it will place such a' stigma upon the Government that the approaching Conversion Loani t not likely to be the success This had a serious effect which we allhope it will be. The right honor'aWe gentleman knows perfectly well that if the course proposed by the Opposition isadopted, the public will have much more confidence, as the Parliament will stillretain control over appropriar tion. The Government, which is being supported by some of our occasionalfriends, would be able to act as it desired,and may destroy the public confidence,, which is so essential to financial stability. Tie credit of the Common weal thy which has been seriously affected by the actions of One government, depends now upon the course to be followed by the States and the Commonwealth. If the right course is folloSved our position will be' assured. I believe that the Conversion' Loan will be a complete success, because the people of Australia,, realizing that Parliament is exercising its It is the proper authority, will convert their holdings. I emphatically deny that behind this amendment there, is the slightest attempt to evade the reduction of interest. made a similar remark in connection with the Wheat Bill. clared myself in favour of a compulsory pooling system; every one knows where 3 stand oii that subject. The reduction of interest is largely a matter for the State Parliaments. If the banks do not reduce interest in accordance with the undertakings they have given, the State Parliaments have sufficient power to deal with them effectively. The bill introduced by the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) earlier in the session, provided only for the reduction of interest on new holdings. I have not the slightest doubt that if the banks do not act fairly in this matter, the Sta.te Parliaments will take action to secure the interests of those whom it is their responsibility to protect. Buti f this Parliament does not retain control over the spending power of the Executive, the difficulties will become greater than they",159,Moloney A Honest Course For Him Would Be To With

A lengthy discussion on the amendment means that honourable members who havo to travel long distances in order to reach their constituencies will be considerably inconvenienced. No one can deny that the Leader of the Opposition has adopted what is a most extraordinary attitude at this particular juncture. He was a party to the agreement formulated at the Melbourne conference; he knows that the success of the Conversion Loan means a saving of £6,500,000 in the internal Government interest burdens of the taxpayers of Australia, and that the adoption of that plan and the reduction of interest rates by the private banks means the saving of millions of pounds to homepurchasers and men on the land. If the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is followed in another place a general election must follow. This would mean delaying for a considerable time the proposals now in hand, as a new government would not be bound by the decisions of the Melbourne Conference, and in any case could not function promptly on a matter of this nature immediately after a general election. In a leading article in the Sydney Morning Herald of yesterday, which is read so extensively by honourable members opposite, the following paragraph appears:A general election to-day would throw everybitter pill for them. It is well that the thing overboard and create chaos at a moment when Australia's new hope for prosperity has been brought into the foreground. Mr AncHn&LE PARKHILL -Why not read it all. read is a complete statemoni, and if further confirmation is required 1 refer the honourable member to an article which appears in the same newspaper, written by Senator Colebatch, who emphasizes the fact that the Opposition is pledged, so far as its leaders can pledge it, to support the Government in bringing the Melbourne plan into operation. Yet, at the most vital moment this act of treachery is taken by the Leader of the Opposition and those who oppose the Government. These are the gentlemen who will be responsible for vitally affecting the interests of business men, home purchasers, persons with overdrafts at the bank, landholders and the 400,000 unemployed in Australia to-day who are looking to this plan to relieve them from the unfortunate position in which they are placed by the general depression. I cannot understand the point of view bf the Leader of the Opposition, who is allowing himself to be led this way at a time when his name of ""Honest Joe"", if it stands for anything, should stand for honouring his undertakings in connection with the Melbourne Conference decisions. He cannot possibly reconcile his past actions with the amendment he has moved. I say emphatically that if honourable members search the history of this Parliament they will not find an instance in which similar action has been taken in connection with the appropriation resolutions. The Leader of the Opposition is attempting to defeat this party whose co-operation in this plan he sought and which he expressed a desire to assist. His attendance at the Melbourne Conference, his agreement with what was decided on, and his assistance in passing the measures based on the Melbourne plan, surely indicate that he wishes it to reach fruition. The recent statements of Victorian representatives of the great financial institutions in this country have indicated that the interest reduction proposals embodied in ths plan are a people of Australia should realize the position. Personally, I would not be affected by the breaking down of this nlan, so far as it proposes the reduction of",160,Moloney A Honest Course For Him Would Be To With

Bavin and Stevens from the charge of having commenced a run on that bank. That run, however, was not sustained, and confidence in the bank was restored; but a fresh run commenced immediately following the announcement by the Premier of New South Wales that he would not pay overseas interest.

That attitude is all very well for people who have no responsibility and who will not accept any. But this Government is charged with the responsibility of carrying on the affairs of the Commonwealth, and to do that it is necessary to make arrangements in this* Parliament for the meeting of statutory payments on the due dates, otherwise the country would be discredited. Under the financial agreement, for which we were not responsible, we have to assume responsibility for debts that have not been paid by the States. This Government, in its relations with the Commonwealth Bank, occupies the same position as any private individual, and in the face of reduced revenues it has had to cut its suit according to its cloth. It is ridiculous for honourable members who sit in the corner to say that the Government has gone on bended knees to the financial institutions, that it has sacrificed its principles, and that it has betrayed Labour, because it has been obliged to agree to terms that have been forced upon it by circumstances over which it has had no control. I ask those honourable members, where is the logic of their attitude in condemning us for doing what their champion, Mr Lang, is also doing to-day? I have no doubt that this action is just as distasteful to the Premier of New South Wales as it was to members of this party. But why should we be condemned and he be lauded as the champion of the people for doing exactly the same thing? That is the most illogical and ridiculous position that one could possibly imagine. What could be more farcical than the expulsion from the New South Wales State Labour party last week of eighteen men for not supporting the Lang plan, by a body that immediately afterwards carried a resolution directing Mr Lang to abandon that plan and to adopt the plan of the Premiers Conference? It is easy to imagine where this country would find itself in a very short space of time if we acknowledged rule of that description. To deal properly with the problems of Australia, the Commonwealth Government should be untrammelled and the States sliould be wiped out at the earliest possible moment. To-day the Commonwealth has to assume responsibility for expenditure in which it has no direct voice. Auy State to-day can carry on a wild orgy of spending. It need not make provision for its overseas interest payments, which thus automatically become the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The task of this Government has been made heavier because of the defaulting tactics of the Premier of New South Wales. We have had to shoulder the responsibilities of that State because, under the financial agreement, we have been tied up with the States, over whose policy we have no direct control. A considerable portion of the debt that we are carrying to-day was built up during a period in which there was semi-political control of the Commonwealth Bank. That semi-political control enabled Mr Watt and Mr Bruce, as Treasurers in the Hughe*",162,Moloney A Honest Course For Him Would Be To With

I regret that during the fourteen years of Nationalist misrule in this country, when there were bounding revenues and when the highest prices ever paid were received for our wool and wheat, adequate steps were not taken by means of taxation, the tariff and the control of exchange, to effect a reduction of our external and internal debt. This Government is endeavouring to-day to clean up the mess that was left to it by its predecessors. The fact that it has been prepared to co-operate with the States in an endeavour to obtain a solution of the difficulties confronting Australia, should prove to those honourable members who have a mind of their own that at least it is entitled to be given a fair run in the working out of the problems before it.

It was imposed reluctantly by the Government, and I was particularly loth Riley, C. to support it, because I have long recognized that heavy taxation confers no real benefit upon the community, but rather Holloway, J. hampers trade and industry, and checks Curtin, J. prosperity. Industry already has to carry heavy income tax, land tax, and the unemployment' taxes imposed by the various State parliaments, and however irksome these taxes may be, none is so burdensome as the sales tax. From its inception, it has created difficulties, and has operated in a vexatious way, because of the lack of understanding of it on the part of the Government and the people. The measure was rushed through, in the first instance, and it caused misunderstanding throughout the length and breadth of the country. From the day it was imposed, rulings had to be issued by the Commissioner of Taxation on the many points that were raised, which were not anticipated before tbe introduction of this legislation. As the -budget figures show, the amount of revenue yielded by the tax is not so great as was expected. Generally, the tax has proved most unsatisfactory, but I recognize that it is inevitable that we should not only continue to impose it , but should increase the rate from 2^ per cent, to 6 per cent. That alone is sufficient to indicate the unfortunate financial position of Australia. I had hoped, from the beginning, that the time might soon come when the whole matter could be reconsidered, and the taxpayers relieved of this additional burden, but that hope is not time. All that we can do is to endeavour [3.55] I to make its incidence as equitable as possible.

The Treasurer ( Mr strong representations have been made Theodore) and also the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) have declared that an undue increase in the number of exemptions will mean a reduction of revenue, and render necessary an increase in the rate. We should also consider the probable effect of this further taxation upon industry, and unemployment. Every section of the community has been asked to make some sacrifice, but I suggest that it would be extremely unwise to add to the burden already resting upon our primary producers. The expert committee of TJnderTreasurers, appointed by the Loan Council to report upon the possibility of restoring budget equilibrium, made a number of recommendations, and added this special comment with reference to the sales tax and primage dutyThe sales tax might be raised to ii per cent., and the primage duty to 10 per cent., with care that in both cases basic foods arc exempt, and possibly also the important goods which are direct instruments of production, such as machinery, fertilizers, cornsacks, &c. The Prime Minister has been urged to give some relief to our .primary producers in these taxation measures, and a special plea has been made for exemptions in connection with the jam and fruit canning industries, which are suffering severely from the present depression. investigation that has been made into taxation methods has pointed to the need to encourage the expansion of our primary industries, which will be severely handicapped by the imposition of extra primage and higher sales tax. Figures which have been prepared by those associated with these industries show that while fruit and sugar separately were exempt under the old rate of tax, the sugar content of jam and canned fruit, as well as the fruit content, were both subject to taxation, and in the case of jam the tax was greater than the actual amount paid to the primary producer for the fruit contained in the tin. Other products, including butter and condensed milk, which come into competition with jams and canned fruit, are exempt from the sales tax. Another primary industry, of major importance is mining. It has been established that costs in this industry must be reduced if it is to surMr Lyons. vive overseas competition. To this end that mining machinery shall be exempt. I trust that serious consideration will be given to this request so that steps may be taken to further expand the industry, and widen the area of employment. In considering the effect of these taxes upon industry generally, we are, I think, inclined sometimes to overlook the actual burden represented by certain definite rates. For example, the sales tax of 2\ per cent, under the present act is paid ou the total of value for duty, including the 10 per cent, statutory addition, plus the duty paid and primage 4 per cent., plus 20 per cent, of such total, aud represents 3.41 per cent, on free goods. An average has been taken out over a representative range of merchandise landed in Australia during the past six months, and it has been found that the average sales tax payments amounted to 5.02 per cent. The proposed sales tax increase from 2i to 6 per cent, actually means that free goods will be subjected to a sales tax of 8.71 per cent. There are very few items now free of duty. All cotton goods being subject to 5 per cent, duty would incur a sales tax duty of 9.11 per cent. Every additional 5 per cent, duty paid would mean .40 of 1 per cent, added to the sales Every tax. The following table shows how the sales tax at the new rate of 6 per cent, operates upon the cost of certain imported goods after giving effect to the provisions which require certain additions to he made to the invoice value of goods for duty purposes:Goods Goods Dutiable Duty Free. at 2:)%. £ *.

These figures are, to say tbe least, staggering. Dealing now with goods generally, the rate of duty of 5 per cent., and sales tax of 6 per cent, on invoice value, mean an actual tax of 11 per cent, on every £100 worth of goods. Because of the present difficult financial position, we are now obliged to adopt taxation schemes which, in ordinary circumstances, would not be entertained by any government. We should, however, remember that the purpose of the plan is to re-establish con£ t. d. fidence among all sections of the people . 100 .0 0 so as to ensure a release of credit for . 10 0 0 investment in industry, and the employ110 0 0 ment of our people. If the taxes im75 per cent. posed are of such a character as to be 37} per cent. a burden upon industry, we shall not attain our objective. AlthoughI do not see how it is possible to avoid this further 223 15 0 taxation at the present time, I consider 4 8 0 that the Government might have given 228 3 0 more consideration to the probable effect 45 12 7 of these increased rates upon industry generally. The estimates of revenue 273 15 7 from the original sales tax were not 6 16 10 realized. This was due partly to the depression, and partly because of the adverse effect of the tax upon industry. CENT. PRIMAGE The rates are now being substantially increased. I am afraid that the higher £ ». d. taxes will re-act unfavorably upon indus100 0 0 try, and that the revenue will fall short , 10 0 0 of the estimate. In the past the GovernI ID 0 0 ment has frequently been compelled to .. 75 per cent. revise its Estimates in order to achieve 37 J per cent. the financial equilibrium which it sought. Having had some experience of the officers in the department who are dealing 223 15 0 with this matter, and having no doubt 11 0 0 as to their ability, I realize that it is idle 234 15 0 for me to pit my estimate of the revenue 46 19 0 likely to be secured against theirs, but notwithstanding their knowledge of the 281 14 0 situation, and the facts at their disposal, 16 18 1 the present circumstances of the country have made it difficult for them to give an accurate forecast of the revenue likely to be derived from this source. I fear that from this tax we shall not get the revenue anticipated. In that case we shall have to come ""back to Parliament for a revision of this taxation. For the burden of taxation on industry will become so great that it will have a reactionary effect upon the revenue of the country. I had hoped that we could reach the stage at which we could do away with the sales tax altogether, but the object of this tax is to spread the burden, so that every section of the community will pay week by week throughout the year according to its ability to do so. With, the exemptions proposed we are possibly getting as near as we can to equity in that regard. According to the Prime Minister, the Government has already given very serious consideration to the representations made by various industries; but even now, if a sufficiently good case is made out, I hope that it will not be refused consideration. I hope the Prime Minister will not refuse to listen to suggestions made in committee. We must accept the bill, but I hope that the Government will not ask us to accept it in all its detail. This bill means an addition of 6 per cent, to strike out the words "" in an amount to the cost of living, and with the basic wage about £3 a week many people will find it difficult to live. If the revenue derived would be the means of providing additional employment, one could have no complaint against the measure; but an increase in the sales tax will not bring about that result. It is probable that no Commissioner. It is very difficult for industry in Australia has provided more employment than has the mining industry. To-day, however, with explosives, which can be bought for 30s. a case, in America, costing 70s. at Cairns, though the protective duty is not more than 15s. per cent., and with mining machinery which is absolutely necessary for producing gold from low grade ore bodies costing considerably more than it ought to, because of high rates of duty, I am afraid that there will be a decrease of employment in mining enterprises. The man who is willing to prospect a likely piece of country is hanwhat a few weeks ago he claimed to be dicapped at the outset if he has to pay 70s. a case for gelignite, and the mining companies are likewise handicapped by the fact that they have to pay exceedingly high customs duties on machinery which is not obtainable in Australia. Furthermore, the price of the metals they produce is exceedingly low. I am very much afraid that, so far as Queensland is concerned, the industry must practically cease. Construction work in every direction throughout the Commonwealth has come almost to a standstill. Government loan expenditure on works has dropped from many millions of pounds to nothing. What is to become of the workers? Under this bill the purchasing power of their earnings is seriously decreased. Australia's position will become worse instead of better. [Quorum formed.] Whether the sales tax will produce the £12,000,000 required to provide for unemployment and assistance to necessitous farmers or whether the money will be raised by a loan, I do not know. Up to date we have seen no move in the latter direction. This amount is required to balance the budget, but what has become of the £12,000,000 provided in the plan for the relief of the unemployed and necessitous settlers? In regard to the bill clause 2 proposes not less than £25, and not more than £1,000,"" and to replace them by the words "" in such an amount not exceeding £1,000 as the Commissioner considers reasonable."" The provision relates to owners of small businesses, and I am anxious to know if the amount to be charged for registration is to be left to the discretion of the people in small towns to get into touch with government officers, particularly Federal Government officers. When the sales tax of 1\ per cent, was first imposed» great irritation was caused to small business -people, because they could get no information regarding the tax. I think that persons who are required to register should be informed by circular what is expected of them under the new legislation. It is plain that the Leader of the Opposition is now inclined to run away from his own baby. There is now a lot of back pedalling on the part of many who formerly supported a sales tax. From reports to hand, I am inclined to agree with those who say that the Premiers' plan is doomed, to failure. The Leader of the Opposition hopes that we will not be obliged to come back to this House and pass legislation in order to secure further revenue. I can understand the anxiety' on the honourable member's part, because he has a very unpleasant recollection of the last occasion, when he had to come back to Parliament. It was when he and the honourable member for Maribyrnong began strutting the political stage, putting into operation a portion of this plan. The main thing the honourable",165,Scullin Likely To Be Realized For A Considerable
899,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [4.18],"member did not like was his inability to interest the members of his party in it. I recollect the night he left the caucus, with the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Fenton) hot-foot at his heels, calling, "" Joe, Joe; don't go."" To-day the Jjeader of the Opposition declares that he cannot accept the word of the Government in connection with this legislation, but, just before the close of last year, he was himself making strenuous efforts to put a portion of it into effect. The boys in caucus were too strong for him, and every time they looked like scoring a win over him he acted on the policy that "" he who fights and runs away may live to fight another day."" The object of this bill is to increase the sales ""tax by 6 per cent. Everyone agrees that this is a. form of taxation which is passed on, and, therefore, ultimately affects the cost of living. ' The figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) show that by the time the goods will reach the consumer the taxwill amount to considerably more tban 6 per cent., although the people will expect to pay only 6 per cent. It has been suggested that in order to avoid this, a turnover tax at a lower percentage should be charged by means of stamps. But there would be great difficulties in applying such a scheme. It would become most cumbersome in the case of small sales at Id., l^d., and 2d., and so on. tion. The suggestion of the taxation It would be almost impossible to get stamps to cover these small amounts. If this taxation is to be retained, and that seems unavoidable at present, the earlier in the process of trade in which it is put on, the better it will be for the Government from a collecting point of view, and for the taxpayer from the paying point of view. We have had twelve months' experience of the working of this tax, and it has been shown to be so easy to collect that I doubt whether any government will ever abandon it, It is much more easily collected than income taxation, because books have to be kept in such a way that they can be easily checked by a checker. The person who pays the tax compiles his own return, makes his own assessment, and pays the cheque. The percentage eaten up in collection must, therefore, be very much smaller than the percentage eaten up in the collection of income taxation. One of the greatest inconveniences of this taxation is caused by the provisions of the regulations and rulings with relation to the quoting of certificate numbers. It may be that a person telephones a manufacturer or wholesaler and quote* his certificate number in ordering goods, if he is the holder of a certificate under the Sales Tax Act. Certain regulations apply to him in this connection, but the onus is always on the seller to determine whether the person who quotes a certificate number is acting correctly.' When a person quotes his certificate number, he is not charged the sales tax. There are cases, of course, where the registered buyer may be forced under the act not to quote his certificate number, but in most cases he is not prevented from doing so; yet the onus is always on the seller. Taxation specialists have suggested a good way out of the difficulties created in this connection, although for some reason the Taxation Commissioner has hitherto shown no intention of adopting it, notwithstanding that the adoption of' it would probably mean a saving of several pounds a week in some businesses. I know of business men who are involved in extra expenditure of £7 or £8 per week in bookkeeping through the imposition of this taxaspecialists is that the registered person shall be required invariably to quote his certificate for all his purchases, whether for material to sell again or for expense purchases. If this were done, many difficulties could be avoided, for the commissioner could keep a list of registered. persons, and make it available to the general public. The result would be that in the course of. time the manufacturer would know who were registered persons, and who were not. If he did not know, he could easily find out. It is suggested that under this scheme the first seller or manufacturer should not be charged sales taxation, but that the registered buyer would be liable to pay it on all the materials used in his business, whether for re-sale, maintenance, or otherwise.",168,Proposed 10 Per

There is actually from the Taxation Commissioner on that no sale in the ordinary sense, although point, which cleared the matter up for there is a transfer of assets from private me. ownership to company ownership.

There is a further desirable proposal to reduce the security below £25. In many country towns there are bakers, soft drink manufacturers, and others who have been compelled to make fixed deposits for £25 with the bank as a security against the payment of the tax, when in many cases the total amount of sales taxation for the year would not amount to more than £6 or £7. I consider it desirable to dispense with the limitation of £25, with a maximum amounting to £1,000."" I heard the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr ing a certain amount of taxation has to Riordan) say that there are many persons in the business who are unaware of their liability to pay the sales sells £100-worth of goods and carries the tax. I am sure that there are many blacksmiths, soft drink manufacturers, and bakers in small country towns who, until they receive an intimation from the department, do not know that they are liable. I also know of persons who did not know that they were liable until a prosecution was lodged. To-day, there are many people who do not know that they are liable. There is another provision to which I wish to refer. Tho Income Tax Commissioner does not allow the amount paid in sales tax as a deduction from income, as he contends that the amount of tax can be added to the price of the goods. That may sound all right. If a tax of £6 is imposed on £100 worth of goods, the selling price would be £10C. A seller, in compiling his income tax return, would not show the value of the sale as £106 only, but as £106, less £6, leaving the net amount of the sale at £100. There may be a number of cases where, owing to special circumstances, such as keen trade competition, the seller is actually carrying a certain amount of the taxation. Eor instance, instead of charging £106, he may charge £103. In that case, the Commissioner of Taxation would say that he was only to deduct £3, thus making the sale price of his goods £100, with the result that £3 is being paid by the unfortunate seller, who is not allowed to make that deduction. That is entirely wrong. In selling £100 worth of goods, a person may have sold them for £103 to include, say, half the tax, but what would really happen would be that he had sold them for £97 with the whole tax, £6, included, making £103 in all. that way ? from the Commissioner of Taxation to the effect that the seller is not allowed to do that. If a seller is wise, he will say that he can show anything in writing. There is power to compel a seller to produce particulars in writing before a deduction is allowable. A person carryreduce the price of his goods by the amount of that tax. Supposing a person whole of the sales tax, he has to pay income taxation on the full amount as he is not allowed to deduct the tax. But in reality he has reduced the price, of the goods and sold them for £94 and charged a tax of £6 to make up the total. The ruling given on this should be amended. It cannot be denied that the price of goods has been reduced by the amount of the tax, which the seller is carrying. A person can, in certain circumstances, appeal with respect to the value placed upon goods; but that is the only instance in which he has the right of appeal. I contend that under this measure taxpayers should have the same right of appeal as they have under our Income Tax Act. This measure which, I understand, is a part of what is known as the Premiers plan, provides for an increase in the sales tax from 2^ per cent, to 6 per cent. I should not like to bo charged with the responsibility of checking 'the accuracy of the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), which resemble a Chinese puzzle, and show conclusively the extent to which the Government is drifting in its desperate and ineffective attempt to restore financial stability.

Although the trading community suffer from, and fin3 it very difficult to pay the tax, they are prepared to accept it. All that they ask is that it be made as simple as possible in its application. Some months ago I asked the Treasurer whether he would request the department to issue a compilation of the rulings in I'egard to the act. astonishing fact that there is scarcely"" a person in any business, or even in the department who is able to satisfy inquiries about this tax. The reply -f Argus ""-o r some other newspaper"" of such and such a date "". It is difficult euough to find the money to pay the tax, without having to search old newspaper files to ascertain how the Commissioner' has interpreted the regulations. It is high time that a complete compilation of rulings was made, so that no doubt Or uncertainty would re: main. As the honourable member for Maranoa has said, many traders have only just discovered that they are liable t& the 'tax and they are experiencing difficulty in paying the this has been done amount that they owe. this bill is a distinct improvement on the measure that was brought down last year. As it proThe 'tax poses -a higherrate of tax, it was necessary to insert certain provisions that were that it is to be made compulsory to show the plussage at the foot of the invoice. Previously that was optional. When the rate was 2-J per cent., many traders were prepared to pay rather than argue concerning it. In future there will be no possibility of hiding it. It is a very fortunate firm which earns 6 per cent, in these difficult times. After all, this is a tax on turnover, not on profit. Pirmg that are struggling along with big stocks, of which there are thousands, are anxious 'to liquidate those stocks even at cost price. The o"" per cent., however, will still have Therefore, we should be to be paid even if goods are sold at cosi price or less. Another alteration that is deemed necessary is that 30 days be allowed for payment. Originally it was intended t'o make traders pay the tax seven days after the month's transactions were completed, hut as the result of a protest by the Opposition the time has been extended to 21 days. Even that is far from satisfac 1 tory. Ordinary business practice, except in chain and cash stores, is on a monthly basis. In the case of some big firms, such as those that deal in oil and Sugar, it is Cash in 30 days. The usual monthly practice averages approximately It is ah 45 day3, for if goods are bought on the 1st or the 2nd June, the statement is issued on the 1st July,, and need not be paid until the end of that month.

Wholesale houses that have country storekeepers on their 4704 Sales Tax Assessment [ EEPBESE : tfTATIVES.J books experience tbe greatest difficulty in collecting their accounts. They may have to carry storekeepers for six months, or even longer. Yet the Government in sists upon the payment of the tax on these goods within 21 days. I have received from the Victorian Merchants Association a protest in the following terms:We strongly urge that a clause be included whereby this tax would be made payable at the end of the month following delivery of goods Our reasons for this are as follows:In the first place, we do not receive payment from our customers until the end of the month at the earliest, and, in many cases, in the country, we have to carry the tax on our books for many months. You will readily understand that this amount becomes, in course of time, a very considerable load for us to bear, and is costing us the bank rate of interest until paid. Under the present trade conditions, you are quite aware that we have an enormous amount of money stationary on our books, and this extra tax is something which we do not think is intended should be borne by us. Protests have been received also from the Chamber of Manufactures, the Hardware Association, and practically every other trading body, all of which agree that at least 30 days should be allowed for the payment of the tax. Seeing that the Government is increasing the tax so greatly, it should at least make it f a l l as lightly as possible on the people who have to pay it .

That is only fair. If they can pay at the old rate on houses that they are building, the sub-contractors and the merchants who supply the materials also should be allowed to do so. Otherwise, the additional 3£ per cent, may more than offset the profit likely to be made. Newspapers, which generally are the property of big companies, are not to be taxed; but periodicals, which, in many cases, are run by small publishing houses and printers, w ill be liable for not only the additional sales tax, but also the higher ""rimage rate, because the paper that they use is different from that used by newspapers. This matter, I suggest, might well be cleared up. As the Prime Minister has stated, this is essentially a committee bill .

The application of the act has not only been irritating, but has forced a, number of small people out of business. I do not think k is right that, in giving effect to any plan, we should carry on as we are doing under this particular legislation. We have reduced wages, and thus lessened the purchasing power of the people; yet, under this measure we sliall increase the prices that they, w ill haye to pay for the articles of food and clothing that they require. The Government should have policed this legislation, as originally promised, and should have prevented the tax from being passed on to the poorer classes of the community. I hope that the sales of sandwiches for midday lunches w ill be exempt from the tax. The employees of large firms now club together and purchase their sandwiches in large quantities. It was never contemplated that a tax of this nature should be part of the rehabilitation plan. -When this measure was introduced last House, you were good enough to take up the year, I think we all anticipated that, matter of the anomaly which exists in arrivwith its complications and anomalies, it ing at the basis of value for sales tax on goods would prove a veritable nightmare to imported by a retailer and similar goods imordinary business people, and it has ceramending act is shortly to be introduced, tainly proved so to most honourable memwe are asking your kind assistance in dealing bers.

This could he done without putting one man out of employment, or inflicting hardship upon a single manufacturer. Last year I submitted an amendment in a sincere effort to do away with an anomaly which the Brisbane Merchants Association had pointed out to me was created under the present sales tax legislation, in arriving at the basis of the value, for the purpose of tax, of goods imported by a retailer, and similar goods imported by a wholesale merchant. The amendment that I then submitted was supported by the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and other honourable members, and on the Prime Minister giving me an assurance that this anomaly, which the Commissioner of Taxation admitted, would be removed, if possible, in another place, I withdrew my amendment. But the anomaly was not removed, and I would like the Prime Minister to take some steps to deal with the matter even at this stage. I have received the following communication from the Brisbane Merchants Association, dated 6th July last:Re Sales Tax -You will recall that last year, when the above bill was before the ported by a wholesale merchant, and, as an information a concrete case furnished by one of our members which shows that the only an injustice to the merchant, but, as their warehouses, some of which had paid An amendment which is sugin the attached memorandum, namely, that the basis upon which the retail importer one.",174,Proposed 10 Per

At the committee stage, I intend to submit a number of amendments, which I hope will be accepted by the Prime Minister, who will be in charge of the proposals. When the original sales tax measures were before this House, there was considerable argument about the desirableness or otherwise of entering the sales tax at the foot of the invoices. I endeavoured to persuade the Government to agree to this proposal, but was unsuccessful. It was contended that there might be certain constitutional objections, and, following the Government's decision not to sanction this procedure, a number of wholesale and retail firms introduced altered business systems, under which they were able to include the tax in their price-lists. Now that the Government has decided to insist upon the amount of the tax being added to the invoice, those firms will be obliged to scrap all their price-lists, and attach to the foot of their invoices the amount of tax chargeable. They regard the alteration as unfair, and point out that it will inflict upon them a great deal of business inconvenience and expense. contended, further, that it will operate unfairly in the case of a considerable keepers in the suburbs of our capital cities, and in country towns, because the majority of these business people sell low-priced articles at fixed retail prices, and it will be impossible for them to recover the tax by charging increased prices for their goods. This will apply particularly to haberdashery, ribbons, confectionery, small grocery lines, household hardware, and chemical goods. It is also argued that those firms which adopted special business systems under which the price-lists included the 2\ per cent, sales tax, will now merely add the additional 6 per cent, to their present prices. These views are being canvassed generally in business circles in connection with these measures. It is stated that the proposed change will give further protection to manufacturers at the expense of retailers, and that if merchants' profits are further reduced, many may be placed in a difficult position. As the Government insisted on the amount of the sales tax being included in the purchase price, it should now consider the position of those traders who obeyed its instructions. In committee, I propose to submit an amendment, the purpose of which will be to make the procedure optional. I cannot see how any great hardship _will be inflicted on traders generally, and as the Government originally insisted that the tax should not be placed at the foot of the invoice, traders should not now be put to the additional expense of introducing new systems and of revising their price-lists to comply with this later decision of the Government. Another amendment which I propose to submit when the bill is in committee, is to deduct from income tax assessments the amount paid as sales tax. This proposal has been considered by various taxpayers' associations, but as it is a matter for the committee stages of. the bills, I shall not say more about it at present. inclined to oppose the whole of these measures unless the Government is prepared to give some relief to coal-minera by exempting explosives. The miners purchase their explosives from the comI t is pany, which will now add the increased sales tax of 6 per cent, to the price charged. Representations have been made number of small storeto me by the combined miners' organizations that explosives should be placed on the list of exempted goods. Metalliferous miners are in a more favorable position. Miners, except those working on tribute, are provided with explosives by the company, which does not pass on the tax. In the case of coal-miners, however, the explosives are sold to the employees by the company, and each fortnight the amount of the sales tax, which, at the higher rate will be approximately 8s. 4d. a fortnight extra is deducted from the miners' pay. member say how much the tax will be per head? pairs, and each pair of men use about 10 lb. of explosives per day in hard sections of the mine.

Sales tax of 6 per cent, on 14s a day equals lOd. The fortnightly pay of two men is thus reduced by 8s. 4d. or 4s. 2d., for each man. That is an additional hardship on meu who undoniably have suffered greater hardship than the average citizen of the Commonwealth. through a long, drawn-out struggle. They were locked out. Their only sin, if it were a sin, was a desire to obey an award of the Federal Arbitration Court. Eventually, they were starved into submission, and had to submit to a 12£ per cent, reduction of their earnings. Wheni t was suggested to the Prime Minister that the explosives used by men working in mines on contracts or tributes should be exempted from the payment of sales tax, his reply was that the tax does not amount to more than 5d. a day per man, and is, therefore, only a small matter. It represents, however, the price of a loaf of bread, and it is a penalty which is imposed upon the miners iind upon no other class of worker. They cannot deduct from their income tax this sales tax payment because their.earnings are from personal exertion. They are called upon to pay sales tax before they receive their earnings. When I approached the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) on the matter, he suggested, that it should be brought up in committee, and that, in all probability, provision would be made for the exemption claimed. Although the Prime Minister does not feel disposed to give any consideration to their request, I hope that he w ill view the matter in a different light when he learns of the additional hardship these miners w ill be called upon to endure under the provisions of this bill .

We have had many applications for exemptions which are far more justifiable than this one. We have been asked to exempt books for libraries and for educational purposes, but if we did so, the revenue would suffer to the extent of £60,000. 1 have every sympathy with those who wish books to be exempt from sales taxation; but the granting of exemptions must inevitably have the effect of substantially increasing the rate of tax. tli at the Government will give some consideration to the advisableness of exempting from sales taxation books for educational purposes. We have always prided ourselves upon the fact that education in Australia is free; but in these days the burden involved in the purchase of books which is placed on parents of children who are attending schools, from the primary grade upwards, is extremely heavy. Surely the revenue would not or of an suffer very seriously if educational books were exempt. The parents of children attending our schools are the best citizens that we have, and we should not place any burdens upon them which can be avoided. As one who has had experience as a school teacher, and as a Minister in has been charge of a State education department, I know that the cost of school books has increased very greatly in recent years. I therefore hope that the Government will give further consideration to my proposal to exempt books for educational purposes. While I am quite ready to admit that the importation and sale of certain classes of books could be entirely prohibited with advantage to the public, I believe that something should be done to make books needed for educational purposes available to the people at the lowest possible price.",178,Wholesale Merchant Pays On The Following Basis

At the end of a pay period the return per pair of miners is consequently reduced by 8s. 4d. That is a hardship which should be removed by the Government. Exemptions are provided on firewood, coal, crude and fuel oil for the production of power, which means that the owners of industry who use these products do not have to pay the tax, while the miners whose duty it is to win the coal from the bowels of the earth, have to pay the tax on the explosives they use. Explosives are absolutely essential in the production of coal or other minerals, and should be treated in the same way as fuel used by the owners of industry in the production of other power which is exempted. It is grossly unfair that this Government should exempt commodities used by the owners, and at the same time impose a tax ou commodities used by the miners. Wine, which I suppose, is consumed chiefly by the employing class, is also included in the list of exemptions. imposed on wine. have recently suffered a reduction in wages should receive the same consideration in the matter of the sales tax as the able member figured out that the cost to coal-mine proprietors. It may be said that explosives are a big item, as they are lOd. a day. He estimated that two men used extensively in the mining industry; but other mining operations are not in the same position as the coal-mining industry. ""With the exception of metalliferous mining on tribute, the men employed in most of the metalliferous mines are paid a daily wage. In such cases the owners purchase the explosives, and consequently pay the tax, while in coal-mining the coal-owner purchases the explosives, and when charging them up to the coalminers, includes the sales tax. The sum of £50,000 has been provided to assist the coal-owners to obtain additional export trade, £25,000 of which has been placed in a trust fund to be allocated at the rate of Is. per ton on the actual quantity of coal exported. The Government's proposal savours of assistance to him that hath, while the poor unfortunate coal-miner who has suffered a reduction in wages, is to be compelled to pay the sales tax. Por sixteen months they had to submit to a lock-out, and in addition have had a reduction of 12i per cent, in their wage. The action of the Government in reducing the salaries of public servants by 20 per cent, will in all probability result in private employers adopting the same attitude. I have no desire to ridicule the idea of assisting the mine-owners by the payment of a bounty of Is. a ton to capture the overseas coal trade as I recognize the export trade in coal requires building up; but it is only-reasonable that miners, who have to use power in the shape of explosives to obtain minerals from the earth, should be given this exemption. [8.16] I point out to the honourable member that it is not possible to distinguish between explosives that.are used for mining purposes and those that are used for other purposes, nor between explosives that are sold to a miner, and those which the owner does not ask the miner to buy. The whole field of explosives has to be surveyed. It has been worked out that the cost of the sales tax which is added to the price of explosives used in hewing coal, amounts to about i d . a ton. On the honourable member's figures it is more than that, but still is less than i d . a ton. The honortwo men who worked together would be would hew with machines approximately 25 tons a day. On the basis of 2s. 6d. a ton, their earnings would be £3 2s. 6d., while on the honourable member's figures, the tax would come to 8s. 4d. reduction was 2s. 5d. ll/16ths.

On that basiseach man would earn £15 a fortnight. There are cases of equal, if not greater, hardship under the sales tax as well as under other taxation.

944,"Mr Scullin""","That would bring itfeather duster on the people of this country. We are dealing with a very grave emergency. We have endeavoured to exempt from the tax basic foods that effect the cost of living of the mass of the people, and to a very large extent we have succeeded. ' The exemption of this item would mean a loss of revenue amounting to over £15,000; and if the whole of the exemptions sought were granted, the loss would be well over £750,000 per annum. I am not lacking in sympathy towards the miners, but there are stronger claims that we have had to reject. I intend to support the amendment to exempt explosives used in mining. The £15,000 which the Prime Minister says would be lost, is an over-statement. 1 presume that that figure relates to explosives that are used for every purpose. I consider that the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has made out an unanswerable case. I could quote figures to show the right honourable gentleman that the treasury could obtain perhaps £200,000 if the timber, coal and fuel that are exempt, were made subject to the tax, although I will not support the sales tax on such items. There is a question of abstract justice that has to be considered, from £6 to £10 as the Prime Minquite apart from the amount of revenue involved. If the Government is working on the assumption that coal, fuel and oil are basic commodities, because they enter primarily into the manufacture of the goods .on which the tax will be levied, I cannot see how those things which are used by the miners could be exempt. The mine owners buy the explosives in the first place. They hold them in secure places, and supply them to the miner, deducting the cost from his wages. A record of the transaction has to be kept. Only a distinguishing mark would be necessary to indicate the explosives that were sold to miners, and that should be exempt from the tax. No difficulty would be experienced in tracing every such transaction. Possibly, only a couple of thousand pounds at the most would be lost if the amendment were agreed to. not limit the exemption to the explosives used in coal-mining. member for Hunter drafted the amendment hurriedly. tions could not be policed. It is estimated that £12,000 of the £15,000, to which I have referred, applies to explosives that are used for mining purposes. It could not be limited to coal-mining. limit it to coal-mining. But there is a difference between explosives that are used in coal-mining, and those that are used in metalliferous mining. When other articles that are used in the production of coal are exempt, it is only reasonable and just that the explosives used by the miner also should be exempt. Miners are obtaining so little work at the present time that a deduction of 6d. from their wages means depriving their wives and children, not of some luxury that they could do without, but actually of something that they should have. Within the last twelve months, coalminers have been getting only two or three days' work a fortnight, and sometimes even less than that. If the industry were flourishing, and the miners were working ten days a fortnight and drawing ister says, I would not worry about this impost. There is not a miner on the south coast who has worked full time since I have been the representative of that district. That dates back to long before the commencement of the depression. Within the last couple of years, not a miner has averaged four days a fortnight, and some of them have averaged only one day reckoned from the weeks when the mines actually worked. In those circumstances, the loss of even 5d. or 6d. is a real hardship. A couple of shillings a fortnight may not seem much to honourable members, but its loss causes real concern to these men. The Prime Minister ought to meet us in this matter. I feel sure that the loss of the small amount involved would not cause the plan to break down; but it would be a small concession to men who have had a very hard row to hoe. During the last four years, no man in any industry in the Commonwealth has had such a rough spin as the",182,Wholesale Merchant Pays On The Following Basis

Por some considerable time, I have made representations to the Treasurer in regard to the price of explosives in Australia. Last May, I asked a question on the subject, and the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan), who was acting for the Prime Minister, promised that certain inquiries would be made, and that I would be furnished with a reply Up to date that reply has not arrived. In the intervening period, however, I have been in touch with the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Holloway), who at the time had charge of labour and industry. That honourable gentleman wrote me a letter saying that he would request Mr orable member that we have exempted the John Gunn to make inquiries respecting the substantial difference that exists beindustry, and that is a tremendous contween the prices of Australian and American explosives. I believe that Nobels are the only manufacturers of explosives in Australia; yet the price charged for the local explosive is altogether too high committed by the honourable member for pared with that charged for the American. The price of metals is abnormally low, and the mining industry has been at a low ebb since 1920. Yet, it provides employment for a considerable number of men. With the aid of explosives, miners can prospect rich patches in old "" shows "". explosives required for mining operations. Even with tin, copper, silver and lead at their present prices, a considerable amount of employment isprovided at places like Mount Isa, but an extra 1,500 men will probably be reduced to the dole in Western Queensland, as a result of putting the Government's financial plan into operation. If the mining industry is burdened with additional taxation, as surely as night follows day, disaster will overtake it. A bounty of Is. per ton is given to the coal-owners on export coal, and if £10,000 were deducted from the £50,000 now received by them by way of bounty, the Government would be able to remove the sales tax of 6 per cent, to be imposed on explosives for industries other than coal-mining. I notice that a number of exemptions are provided for under the bill, such as road metal, furnace commodities used by the contracting dag, gravel and sand. municipalities. ing the quarries that produce those commodities practically live on the ratepayers; but tbe miners, under great difficulties are carrying on a valuable producing industry, and they are not able to meet the proposed increased sales tax. If the mining industry received as much encouragement from governments as has been given to the butter and sugar industries, it would soon become equally valuable to the community. Timber, boxes, bibles, cheese, coal, kerosene, cream, crude and fuel oil, crude tar and a hundred and one other articles are on the exempt list. Yet an industry which is at a low ebb is to be called upon to pay an unjust tax of 6 per cent. whole of the output of the coal-mining cession. with the mining industry generally. I cordially support the amendment subHunter( Mr James) to afford relief to the Cinderella industry of Australia. I support the amendment, because it would be unfair to apply the sales tax to Much of the expense incurred in coal mining in New South Wales is caused by the provisions of the State Mining Act, which requires the owners to provide brattice for the ventilation of the mines. Reference has been made to the quantity of explosives used in mining a ton of coal; but I point out that that cost is but a fraction of the total expenditure incurred by miners. Coal-miners in 95 cases in 100 are contractors. They have to provide their own light, and, in most cases, their own explosives. They must also supply tools, and these articles are subject to the sales tax. We exempt mining timber which the mine-owners are compelled to provide in order to keep their properties safe. Yet the Government is unwilling to exempt one of the miners in the production of the coal. Australian timber used in mining operations is exempt from the sales tax, particularly in coal-mining.

I have every symRiordan) in urging that explosives for gold-mining should be placed on the exempted list, because this will be a direct I know that the men earn all they get. incentive to those who are engaged in the search for gold. The Victorian Year Book for 1930-31 states that the revenue obtained from miners'' rights in Victoria for that year amounted to £2,062, and as miners' rights cost 2s. 6d.' each there were last year in Victoria 16,496 holders of miners? rights searching for gold in the back blocks and among the hills.

I hope that the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) will give the request further consideration, and agree to place this commodity on the exempted list, at all events as far as the gold-mining industry is concerned. Commonwealth Government shipped overseas gold to the value of £27,000,000, and as the average annual yield in Australia is under £2,000,000, that year we sent away thirteen years' gold production estimated on the present average yield. Recently, we exported an. additional £5,000,000 worth, and if two similar shipminei-3 who are compelled to buy their ments of a like amount have to be made in the near future practically the whole of our currency will be on a fiduciary basis. I am not sure that our position then will be any the worse. I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will give sympathetic consideration to this appeal. request from various members interested in the mining industry is interesting, but not very convincing. If explosives used in, say, the coal-mining industry arc placed on the exempted list, the case for the inclusion of explosives of gold-mining will be strengthened, and the Government might as well lift the tax off all explosives for mining purposes, because explosives are largely used by men working in metal quarries, and even by our primary producers for 'the clearing of pathy for the miners. I worked for some considerable time in a mine myself, and But I remind the House that the same urgent appeal can be made, and has been made, in respect of other industries, but the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) has told us plainly that if our requests were granted the loss of revenue would be too great. tries ? tions to the Prime Minister for the exemption of the canned fruit and jammaking industries. Sugar and fruit, separately, are on the exempted list; but fruit is liable to be taxed.

That remark was not quite correct, because the mine-owner, in his reWithin twelve months, the turns for taxation purposes, is expected to show expenditure incurred for explosives used by the company and by contract miners. The right honourable gentleman also urged that if the request were granted the resultant loss of revenue would be too serious.

One cannot but admire »he robust philosophy and whole-hearted efforts of both the honourable member for Hunter and the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) to voice the olaim they are making on behalf of the large body of industrial workers they represent.

The suggestions put forward by the honourable member for Hunter to overcome the difficulties mentioned by the Prime Minister justify the granting of this concession. We always understood that King Cole was a merry old soul, but for a long time King Coal has been a very sad old soul. The approval of the Prime Minister to this amendment might transform him into the merry old soul King Cole has always supposed to be. If that should happen, I have no doubt he would call for his pipe and other comfort3, and for his fiddlers five-the members of this group, who are only too glad to put in a word for him on this occasion. I support the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) in his plea on behalf of the people he represents, and with whom he has worked for many years. No one knows the coal industry better than does the honourable member. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) has mentioned that there would be difficulty in administering the concession asked for. The right honourable gentleman is guided by the knowledge of departmental officers, who are, no doubt, efficient in their particular spheres, but cannot be expected to possess & practical knowledge of the application of a concession of this kind upon all 'industries likely to be affected. Their very competence in their departmental work connotes a limited practical experience. Any advice that they can give a Minister upon the difficulty of administration of any matter must bepurely speculative. Particularly is this Plenty of evidence could be adduced to prove that it is almost humanly impossible to police this sales tax, even in its present form, and I claim, therefore, that the Prime Minister has not answered the arguments advanced by the mover of the amendment by raising an objection it. No difficulty is anticipated in policing the exemption of crude oils and such like lubricant's, and there should likewise be no difficulty in policing the exemption of explosives used by contract miners. In any case, why should the difficulties of The man who hews coal administration be raised only in respeet to the articles which the honourable member for Hunter is seeking to have exempted?

We know, however, that the effort of Labour has always been to secure for the worker a greater share in the distribution of the profits made by industry. If we carried the Prime Minister's argument to the fullest extent, all efforts on the part of Labour to improve the lot of people engaged in industry by bettering the conditions or increasing wages would be contrary to the interests of the industry concerned.

Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) said just now that he had been busily engaged in adding various items to the list of exemptions; and he gave reasons for their addition. I should like to help him to add one or two more, and to give reasons why they should be added. I therefore move!That the item "" Canned fruit, j a m "" hi inserted. I wish to illustrate the operation of the sales tax on canned fruits, based on the average Australian retail prices per dozen, less cash discount. The basis of the tax on apricots, based on a price of 8s. a dozen, less a cash discount of 2-J per cent., would be 7s. 9£d. The old sales tax of 2-J per cent, represented 2-Jd. a dozen, equal to £1 6s. 3d. a ton of fresh fruit. Under the new tax of 6 per cent., the amount per dozen will be 5^d., equal to £3 3s. a ton of fresh fruit. The basis for sales tax in the case of peaches, based on a price of 8s. a dozen, less a cash discount of 2-J rjer cent., would be 7s. 9-Jd. The old sales tax would amount to 2^d. a dozen, equal to £1 Is. a ton of fresh fruit. Under the new tax, the amount will be 5-Jd. a dozen, equal to £2 103. 6d. a ton of fresh fruit. The basis for sales tax on pears, based on a price of 9s. a dozen, less a cash discount of 2£ per cent., would be 8s. 9^d. The old sales tax would amount to 24, d. a dozen, equal to 19s. a ton of fresh fruit. in each standard case sold in Australia. Under the new tax, the amount would be 6d. a dozen, or £2 5s. 6d. a ton of fresh fruit. Last year, the suppliers to two of the largest canneries in Australia, excluding Shepparton, received only £5 a ton for peaches, pears, and apricots. That was probably the finest fruit in the world, and was picked specially for processing purposes. On jams, the 2\ per cent, tax averaged about lOd. a case of 1-i-lb. jams, equal to 45s. a ton on the fresh fruit used. If the increase of 6 per cent, applies, it will mean 2s. a case of four dozen tins, or £5 8s. a ton on the fresh fruit used. Compare this with the £3 a ton paid for plums, and the £4 paid for peaches, apricots, and quinces, and it will be seen that the increased rate will inflict a tax of more than the original price per ton payable to the grower of jam fruits. The Prime Minister said, earlier, that it was not proposed to tax basic foods. I believe it can be said that jam is a basic food to-day. It has become an absolute necessity on the daily menu. As a matter of fact, the list of articles obtainable on dole tickets, in some States, includes jams. We can see the effect if the 6 per cent, tax is passed on to the public. It appears to be an impossibility to obtain an extra price for jam from people who to-day are depending on dole tickets for their existence. To my mind, the whole thing seems to be an atrocious injustice. Definitely, if the tax on canned fruits is passed on, the demand for these products will be decreased immediately. No jam manufacturer or canner to-day can stand extra taxation, and in all probability an attempt will be made to pass on the tax. I am exceedingly doubtful whether the purchasing power of the people will enable sales of canned fruits and jams to continue at anything like the rate required to keep in employment tlie workers who are now engaged in our factories. I sliould like to quote a few statistics in regard to jams. In the case of the cheaner varieties that are used in every -home, such as apricot, peach, plnm, and quince, each ton of .fresh fruit delivered from the orchard produces, on the average, 212 dozen tins, each containing \ \ lb. of jam. There are 4 dozen tins Therefore 53 cases, each of 4 dozen 1^-lb. tins, are produced when one ton of fresh fruit is added to one ton of cane-sugasr and made up into jam. An extract of",189,Hawker S Amendment Put The Com

990,Mr Hill (Echuca) [9.45],"Thethe average selling prices of jams on which sales tax has to be paid at 6 per cent, shows that 6.lid. a dozen will be collected on the 212 dozen tins of jam which are the out-turn from one ton of fresh fruit. This means a sales tax of £5 8s. on each ton of fresh fruit used in jam-making. In most cases, fruits which are used for jam, such as .plums and apricots, are sold for about £3 or £4 a ton. The taxation on the more expensive jams, such as raspberry and black currant, is slightly heavier per ton of fresh fruit, because of the higher sales value. The average tax on these varieties ia about 7d. a dozen on the 212 dozen tins to each ton, which is equal to £6 3s. 8d. a ton of fresh f r u it ; consequently, the berry fruit-grower is also very badly hit. I have no berry fruit-growers in my electorate; but in the southern parts of Victoria and in Tasmania hundreds of tons of berry fruits are grown. A fair overall sales value for each ton of jam in the usual l£-lb. cans would be £90 a ton. Reliable statistics give the annual consumption of canned fruits as 18,250,000 cans for the six years up to 1929. In 1930 the consumption fell tn 15.750,000 cans. In 1929, about 22,000,000 cans were distributed; so that there was a decrease in 1930 of 6,250,000 cans, which was equal to 28 per cent. Unquestionably the attempt which was made to pas3 on even the 2-J per cent, sales tax last year, made a great difference to the housewives, many of whom erased canned fruits from their buying lists. The effect will be even more serious under the 6 per cent. tax. I do not believe that the Australian consumption of fruits in 1931 will exceed 12,000,000 cans. Unfortunately, I have not the statistics for .1930 and 1931-in relation to jams; but the evidence contained in the report of the sugar inquiry committee discloses a very serious decline in the consumption, equal to 6J lb. per head of the population, or a total of 41,000,000 lb. less than would have been consumed had jams been available to the housewife at a fair value. To add 6 per cent, to the sales value of jams, in view of the decreased spending capacity, is to invite a still further decline in the consumption. Yet, if the additional tiw id persisted in, the manu[101] facturers will not be able to bear it, and will endeavour to pass it ou, with serious consequences to the fruit-growers. I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to another primary product. There is no tax, and rightly so, on the products of milk, such as cream, butter, cheese, whole milk, preserved milk, powdered milk, &c. Nor is there a tax on dried, fruits. In one of the large factories in the Goulburn Valley, on the'one side apricots, peaches and pears are processed and canned; while on the other side, the same fruits, but not of as fine a quality, are put through dehydrating machines and turned out as processed dried fruits. Because they are dried, they aro not liable to be taxed; but in the case of the prime fruit, which is processed and canned, this-heavy impost has to be borne. Canning fruit is in a special class. It is grown almost exclusively for canning purposes. It is perishable; but so that the consumer may have the equivalent of fresh fruit all the year round it must pass through a preserving process. Because it is preserved, it is taxed; although other processed articles are allowed to go free. I hope that the Prime Minister will give this matter his earnest and serious consideration, because it affects a very large and deserving body of primary producers. ter) [9.5S] -This item has given me more concern than any other request that I have received. Tho honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) has approached me in regard to the matter, and in addition a number of requests have been made and letters received urging that it be considered. It would have been considered more than favourably but that the loss of revenue would amount to £145,000. That is too serious a loss to contemplate.

Commodities such as preserved milk are exempt from the tax. Presh fruit and sugar also escape it, but when these two commodities are combined in the form of jam, the tax is applied. The demand for jam is decreasing each year, because the price of sugar has been raised of late years, owing to the special protection received by the sugar industry of Queensland.

998,Mr Guy (Bass) [10.12],"I appreexemption of a certain commodity. The granting of this request would not seriously reduce the revenue, because only a couple of hundred pounds are involved. The commodity which I desire to have exempted is mutton birds, which are captured on Flinders Island, in Bass Strait. These birds are collected by half castes, who earn their living chiefly in this industry. Calculated on a yearly basis, the incomes of these individuals would not exceed £1 per week. The present sales tax of 2-^ per cent, has made their living a particularly precarious one; but, if the tax were increased to 6 per cent., they would be ruined, and the industry would pass out of existence. Undoubtedly, the men now engaged in it would be reduced to the dole. amount of revenue collected in sales tax on the 2^ per cent, basis is about £100, and if the tax were increased to 6 per cent., it would be about £240. Basic food stuffs and primary products are on the exempted list, and although the mutton bird may not, strictly speaking, be regarded as a basic food, the business of mutton birding is a primary industry on Flinders Island, and the only process they go through is that of being salted, which evidently brings them within the scope of the tax. Mutton birding, so far as the islanders are concerned, is their primary industry, and numbers of them are absolutely dependent upon it for a livelihood, just as much as is the man engaged upon the land in the production of cereals or meat. Prime Minister will give sympathetic consideration to my request. ter) [10.17] I have a letter dealing with the subject referred to by the honourable member, but I have not the figures showing the amount involved or to what extent the granting of the application, may affect a similar application for poultry. I shall look into the matter before the bill goes to another place and see what can be done. Before the committee disposes of this clause, I should like the Prime Minister to indicate whether any decision has been reached with regard to the exemption of metal, blast furnace slag, gravel and sand for road-making, sold to a public authority changed with responsibility foT the formation and maintenance of public roads. During the second-reading debate I inquired of the Prime Minister, by interjection, if these commodities would be placed on the exempted list, and he said he could not give a ruling off-hand. I raise the question now in the hope that the right honourable gentleman has had time to examine the position and, if road making material is not on the exempted .list, I suggest that the necessary amendment be made to the bill. Representations have been made on this subject to me by the Municipal Tramways Trust of Adelaide, which is a public body. ter) [10.21] -The exemption will apply to public bodies that are really carrying The out Government work, but will not apply to trusts or boards running tramways for profit.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act, sales tax shall not be payable under the said act in respect of a sale other than in the ordinary course of business or trading, either by way of reconstruction, merger,' amalgamation, or walk-in-walk-out sale by any .person, firm or company, to any other person, firm or company, of plant or machinery which is acquired by such last named .person, firm or company, for use as plant or machinery and not for re-sale.""

The departmental view is that plant and machinery purchased by a manufacturer is subject to sales tax, which is payable by the vendor. When a company reconstructs and a new company buys its plant and machinery from the old company, the new company is not permitted to quote its certificate of registration for the purchase, so that the selling company, being a registered person under the Sales Tax Act, is taxable on the sale. If the new company were to purchase new plant and machinery from as amended, agreed to. some other source, the vendor would be taxable on the sale, and would pass on the tax to the purchasing company. When ter) a reconstructing company sells plant and machinery, on which sales tax has been passed on to it, it receives a rebate of that tax from the tax payable on the sale by it of the plant and machinery; but not exceeding the latter amount of tax. I think that, to a large extent, meets the position which has been stated by the honourable member.

The object of this amendment is to give traders the option of stating the amount of sales taxation at the foot of the in voice, or of including it in the price of the goods. Aft e r the passage of the sales tax legislation last year many traders were put to considerable expense in altering all their prices to comply with the law, and unless they are given the option which I am now proposing to provide they will be obliged to again alter all their prices. The present system is giving comparative satisfaction. If the traders are allowed the option that I desire them to have, business w ill be facilitated. The activities of small storekeepers, particularly those who sell haberdashery and small drapery lines, w ill be helped. Moreover, if the option is granted there will be more competition among the shopkeepers, and this may have the eifect of causing some firms to pay a portion, if not all,'of the taxation, which would, of course, result in the public being charged lower prices for their good's. ister ( Mr Scullin) propose to accept this amendment? -The president of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia has recently written to the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) with the object of ascertaining whether sales tax may be deducted the following paragraph from their letter:The Commissioner of Taxation has recently certain circumstances, to deduct the tax from his financial figures, but in other cases proofs will be required before its deduction will be admitted. It would be inequitable were busisales tax. 1 would therefore strongly urge that it be made clear by legislation that sales tax is a deductible item in trading and/or profit and loss accounts before the ascertainment of taxable income. I understand from the officials of the Taxation Department in this connection that the Commissioner of Taxation has ruled that while sale3 tax is not a permissible deduction in an income tax assessment under the Income Assessment Act, the majority of persons who are liable to pay taxation w ill not be required to pay income tax on the amount of sales tax paid by them. I quote the following statement of the position as set out. in the commissioner's ruling: Persons liable to pay sales tax may be classified as follows:-(1 ) Those who add the full amount of tax to the sale price; (2) those who add portion of the tax to the sale price, and bear the balance themselves; (.'1) those who do not add the-tax to the sale price, but bear it wholly themselves. In the first class of case the tax does not form part of the sale value of the goods, which is to be shown in income taxreturns. In the second class, the actual amount of sales tax passed on is to be excluded from the income tax returns, which should include only the actual amount for which the goods would have been sold but for the sales tax actually passed on. Any person who falls within either of these two classes must submit with his income tax return a certificate .that the prices at which' he sold the goods upon which he was required to pay sales tax included that tax.
