The statement is certainly incorrect. sor, with a view to having the rolls in readiness for the general election, had a collection) of names made by the police in Victoria, and, speaking from memory, the work was completed about the end of March, 1905. the rolls had been so recently collected, no fresh collection was ordered; but instructions were given to the officers of the Department to take advantage of the State's rolls, or any other sources of information, with a view to bringing the Federal rolls up to date. viz.. in New South Wales-is there an annual collection of the names' of electors, and we take advantage of that in order to supplement our rolls.

Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether the Government intend to take over ihe control of navigation, as well as of the -light-houses? My reason for asking the -question is that on Tuesday last the Fremier of South Australia stated that the Government did not desire the Commonwealth to take over one part of the service, and not -the whole.

40,Sir Langdon Bonython Asked The,"orable member's question is as follows: For some years New South Wales carried on the work of'searching for and transcribing the original official records concerning the early history of Australia, which are to be found in manuscript in the Public Record Offices in London and elsewhere, with a view to making them available in Australia for local historians, students, and others. That work is now suspended. The subject is dealt with by MrF . M . Bladen, of the New South Wales Public Library, in a report prepared for this Government, and printed in Parliamentary Papers 1903, volume a, page 001It is now proposed that the Commonwealth should continue the work from the point at which it was left by New South Wales. An officer to be intrusted with the duties has not yet been selected, but it is intended to appoint some one with the necessary special knowledge and qualifications for the work. It will be seen that the collection is not similar to that being undertaken by the Parliamentary Library, but it will form a valuable supplement thereto. following papers:Memorandum by the Minister of Defence on placed upon the Statute-book a law calling the Defence Estimates 1906-7.

I do not think it is necessary for me to speak at any considerable length upon the present occasion, because I believe that public opinion is unanimous that some action should be taken upon the lines indicated in this motion. Although the vested interests of the proprietors of patent medicines are considerable, I think that the people have come to the conclusion that a great deal of fraud is perpetrated in connection with the sale of such medicaments, and that much misery is produced by their consumption. I believe that honourable members are extremely anxious that everything possible shall be done to maintain the health of the community. I recognise that we cannot cover the whole of the ground in this connection, because the Commonwealth cannot prevent the sale of any article which is manufactured locally. In other words, we can deal only with imfew months the Victorian Parliament has upon all persons engaoed in the vending of graph of the honourable member's motion is complied with to the f u l l nowadays. far as imports are concerned? of "" bile beans "" or Beecham's pills the virtues of those articles are clearlv set out. not declared, and that is what we wish to States Governments will practically follow Outside of other countries which have enacted similar legislation.

46,Mr Thomas,"But their contents aremember does not suggest that they are all harmful ? that. I say that some are exceedingly harmful. In this connection I propose to read a few extracts from letters which have been forwarded to the Government by Mr Beale. I think that we are indebted to that gentleman-who , I understand, is a citizen of Sydney-and who, during his recent trip to England, exhibited a great deal of interest in this matter, and collated some very valuable information. In answer to a communication which he sent to a very prominent physician at Home, he received the following letter :Dear Sir, In reply to your questions re the effect of poisonous drugs sold under secret formula, I beg to give the following emphatic and decisive answers :1. From general, ancl, I may say, universal, constant, and persistent knowledge, there can be no shadow of doubt that the wholesale prescribing of drugs of this class does lead to an enormous sale of the same, with a proportionate consumption. 2. There most distinctly is a debasement of morals as a direct consequence; of this I have personally seen and known many examples. 3. To my certain knowledge and belief, there is such a debasement as can only be described by the word debauchery, especially among women, resulting from the use of these articles. evil therefrom is of very grave national importance. It has increased of late years, and is still increasing. 4 and 5. There is a widespread and probably lasting injury done to infants and young children by the indiscriminate use of narcotics, though I personally hold a very strong opinion that it is not so much injury as death which is inflicted upon them, a death which is invariably ascribed to some other cause. 6. Under no heading at all can I approve of nurses and mothers administering such drugs to nurselings and children. It is a wicked and bad practice from any and every point of view. 7. There is a very large increase in the use of synthetic remedies as so-called headache powders, &c. These are dangerous to the heart, and cause many fatal accidents. They should never be administered except under strict medical supervision. 8. I am quite convinced that the amount of suffering and the number of deaths are grossly out of proportion to the publicly recorded cases. Not a tithe of the cases ever get into print as such. I should be prettv certain that not even 1 per cent, of the mischief is recorded, or even suspected, by the average layman. I have not the slightest objection to these opinions being made as public as necessary. (Signed) Physician to thc London Hospital, Editor of Taylor's Medical ]uris-prvd<ence. Pathologist for fifteen years to the London Hospital. COOK -The honourable In a letter which he sent to the Right Hon. Herbert J. Gladstone, Mr Beale wroteTo add to this, recently I received a report from a friend in Washington, showing that thousands of children died every year through these medicines, and the tragedy of it is all the more intensified because the stuff is administered by mothers who' do rot know the effects of the mixtures they are giving their children. I am of the opinion that laws should be made that it would be required to show what patent medicines contained. It should be set clown that all drugs containing alcohol and narcotics, and other patent drugs, should have the percentages of these drugs printed on the labels of bottles. If not, the shadow of the undertaker will mingle with that of the medical profession. I propose to read one or two other extracts from some of Mr Beale's communications to the Prime Minister. For instance, in one of these he saysI t is an inflexible rule of the British Medical Association that no remedy shall be secret. Plainly that is to the public interest. More than that, it is an urgent demand on humanity. No such maxim could be upheld, still less enforced by a public body, through generations, unless it were an actuating principle in the common life of its members. He goes on to state thatLast evening I received information in a private note from the Governor General of Canada relating to other matters, that the Dominion Parliament has appointed a Committee from both sides of the House to prepare legislation to The remedy the evil of uncontrolled sale of secret drugs. He himself has addressed a medical society in strong denunciation of the homicidal traffic. The following resolutions were passed at the semi-annual meeting of the Board of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Province of Quebec in July, 1904: That the attention of the Federal Government be called upon the mis-uses, serious accidents, and numerous losses of life resulting from the present trade of patent medicines and pharmaceutical preparations, and that the Government be requested to have Parliament pass the required legislation, so as to exercise an effective control on the sale of these medicines and preparations. That, in the opinion of the College of Physicians, the sale of any such preparations should not be allowed unless each package or each bottle bears the name of the remedy, the quantity of each dose, as well as the name of the manufacturer, the seller, and the price. It would be an easy matter to read further quotations from reports of commissions, which have dealt with this question, and also from the writings of medical men; FRED. J. SMITH, M . D . , F.R.C.P., but I do not think it is necessary to do so. It would certainly be highly advantageous to the public if these articles were plainly marked, so as to indicate of what'",18,Patent Medicines Artificial Foods And Medical Appliances
47,Mr Joseph,,19,Patent Medicines Artificial Foods And Medical Appliances
48,Mr Thomas,"I do not go so far as they were composed. In the case of a sound preparation no difficulty would be placed in the way of the carrying out of this proposal, whilst no one should be permitted to publish "" puff "" advertisements calculated to foist on the public that which is valueless. When I was in SydneyI think it was in January lastI received a letter from a man in the Cobar district, with whom I was not acquainted, inquiring as to the efficacy off a certain patent medicine. It seems that my name had been associated with an advertisement relating to Pink Pills. Some one in BrokenH ill had stated that he was a life-long friend of mine, and that he had signed before me a statement that he had been cured by taking Finjk Pills.. An advertisement to that effect appeared in the Evening News, and this resident of the Cobar district, who was, unfortunately, suffering from consumption, wrote to me inquiring whether the statement was true, saying that if it were he would test the efficacy of the pills. I at once replied that I had never met a man who had been cured of consumption by taking Pink Pills. It is simply scandalous that vendors of pills should be permitted to advertise that persons have been cured of consumption by using them. on the public. tamount to the selling of goods under false pretences. I trust that the day will come when punishment will be meted out to those who send such advertisements to tbe newspapers for publication, and also to those who actually publish them, for they must know that they cannot be true. If a man sells milk containing a certain percentage of water, he is liable to a penalty. It is only reasonable that he should be punished, for the lives of children given adulterated milk are undoubtedly endangered. But we need to do something more. If we allow infantile and artificial foods to be imported and used when they really contain no nourishment, the result must be very serious. given to children in good faith by their mothers and nurses, with the result that, in some cases, the little ones are practically starved. I have no definite figures as to infantile mortality in Australia, but a few days ago I read a very interesting speech delivered by the Right Honourable John Bums, before a National Conference which met in England to deal with the question of infantile mortality, and in that speech some remarkable figures were given. Mr Burns stated that no less than 100,000 children die in England every year from neglect, carelessness, or thoughtlessness. He pointed out that the details of children less than twelve months old were more numerous than those occurring between the ages of one year and eighteen years, and that from 30 per cent, to 40 p r cent, died in the first five years, so that, in the words of Mr Burns, the weakest, smallest, and dearest carried the burden of death. I have no figures it is necessary to quote figures bearing on this subject. the infantile mortality in Australia is, perhaps, not so great as in England, I have no doubt that it is still very serious. I am not one of those who would lav at the door of patent medicines and infantile foods the deaths of all our children. There are other contributing causes; but, at the same time, I think I am correct in stating that these foods play a very serious part in the massacre of the little ones. We hear in Australia a great deal about the need for encouraging emigrants from the old counI t is a villainous fraud try to settle on our lands. That may be very desirable, but we can do a great deal in the direction of increasing our population by taking steps to save the lives of our children, many of whom die soon after birth. It may not be possible to give f u l l effect to some of my proposals; there may be a difficulty in ascertaining the exact value of some infantile and artificial foods, or the value of certain patent medicines as remedial agents. If that be so, it would be idle to press those niatters. Doubtless, however, the medical men who are members of the House will be able to throw some light on that phase of the question. In any event, it is possible for us to see that all imported articles of the kind described in the motion shall have clearly set out on their labels what are their component parts. In addition to infantile and artificial foods, These foods are and patent medicines, there are other articles, alleged to alleviate suffering, with which we ought to deal. I regret that the Government should have given way some time nso in regard to the delivery of letters addressed to Messrs. Freeman and Wallace. It is a pity that they should have permitted letters of that firm to be transmitted through the post. I think that Messrs.

I believe that the public desire that infantile foods and everything in the way of patent medicines shall bear labels describing their ingredients, so that they may know what they are buying. It will be remembered that some time ago some condensed milk wasi imported into Victoria, and that, when seized by the authorities and analyzed, it was found that children fed oa it ' would practically be starved.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE I understand that that is the object of the mover, and it can do no harm for the House to pass the motion. will probably do good, by emphasizing the necessity for strictlv enforcing the provisions of the Commerce Act, and of the regulations made under it, in the particular cases to which reference has been made. The matter was brought under my notice before the introduction olf the Commerce Bill, by Dr. Mackellar and Mr Beale, who, in Svdlnev, as members of a Royal Commission, obtained very .imrjortant 'evidence in regard to it. I have not seen the whole of that evidence-som e of it, 1 brieve, has not been published and distributedbut I have read parts of the reportwhich show rhe necessity for strictlv proiiiUiiJiiÂ£ the importations of certain articles, becauso they are a menace to infantile life. Under the Commerce Act a trade description must certify, amongst other things, as to quality and purity. Great objection was taken to the use of the word "" purity "" ; but, in using it, I had in mind the need for prohibiting the importation of medicines and infant foods which were not pure and of good quality. Section7 of the Act provides for the making of regulations to prohibit the importation or introduction into Australia of any specified goods unless there is applied to them a trade description of such character, relating to such matters, and applied in such manner, as may be prescribed. All goods imported in contravention of any such regulation mav be detained by the Collector, and by direction 2 of the Minister, seized as forfeited to the King. Under section 8 all imported goods to which a trade description is reauired to be applied found in Australia, in the package or cover in which they were imported, without the prescribed trade description, will, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to have been imported in contravention of the Act, or of the regulations under it. That is as far as the Constitution allows this Parliament fo go. It therefore remains for the States to see that goods are not sold therein und'er false trade descriptions, or if they are injurious to the public health. I believe that in Victoria and New South Wales Acts are now in force preventing the sale of goods harmful to the public health. Section o of the Commerce Act prohibits the importation by anv person, under a_ penalty of Â£100, of -goods to which a false trade description is applied When the measure was being considered in Committee, it was held that trade secrets connected with Imports should not be divulged, and therefore section 16 now Indeed, the carrying of it readsThe regulations under sections 7 and 11 of this Act shall not prescribe a trade description which discloses trade secrets of manufacture or preparation, unless, in the opinion of the Governor General, the disclosure 'is necessary for the protection of the health or welfare of the. public. know that all reputable firms disclose the nature of the contents of the proprietary medicines which they sell ?

Honourable members and the public generally can have no idea of the extent to which the trade in patent medicines is carried on. The honourable member for Barrier Kas wiselv brought within the scope of his motion, not only patent or proprietary medicineSj but artificial foods used for invalids to contain certain ingredients and to posand infants, and medical and surgical appliances. It is in connection with the last two of these that the greatest amount of fraud takes place. We have a number of so-called remedies in the form of patent and proprietary medicines which are unmistakable frauds. Even their names are deceptive. In some cases they are intended to indicate that they contain an ingredient which is entirely absent from their composition. I do not intend to act as an advertising medium for these frauds upon the public, but I shall describe some of them sufficiently to indicate their general character. preparations are the most fraudulent. They are rarely, if ever, innocuous. Some of them contain deadly poisons, and in other cases alcohol is distributed to an extent of which the revenue officers can have no conception. Queensland. being sold here, but we happened to catch the guilty parties. the officials who took action. A well-known firm of general providers, who have establishments in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, were brought before the Court for selling liquor without a licence. They were supplying a so-called remedy, which upon"" examination was proved to contain over 42 per cent, of proof spiri't, and less than 5 per cent, of anv other traceable constituent. tions so-called doses of a teaspoonful three times per day before meals. I would ask any father of a family whether he could without dismay contemplate the idea of giving a child of tender age ai teaspoonful of proof spirit three times per day. The constituents of these patent medicines are not stunciently well known. contain drugs for which a taste is rapidly acquired, and much injury is done by inducing a craving for a very injurious narcotic. We have done something recently with a view to remove temptation from persons engaged in one branch of the Commonwealth service, but we are not taking, any action to prevent injury to our young children by so-called medical preparations,, inducing in them a taste for alcohol or drugs which it may be difficult to shake off. A number of preparations on the market which are widely advertised, are supposed, sess certain magical properties. The coldblooded analyst has, however, brushed' aside many of the pretensions put forward by the vendors of these concoctions. One solution which is widely used, and is freely advertised, has been shown to contain QOÂ» per cent, of distilled water. This preparation is sold at a very high price, and' contains no ingredient of any value. In the United States of America, where the drug habit has undoubtedly become established far more firmly than in Australia,, and where! fraudulent preparations have an even wider, although, perhaps, a' not The most largely-advertised more lucrative, market than, here, certain investigations have been made by officials; of the Post Office Department and the Bureau of Chemistry. In regard to one preparation, ""Aquamiel,"" the following * 1 particulars are given: A case recently occurred in This remedy was exploited by the Mexican Remedy Company, claiming it to be "" The Miracle of Nature."" "" A magical bust developer and the most marvellous flesh-producing, bloodenriching, tissue-forming preparation the world"" ever knew."" "" Permanent development guaranteed."" "" Aquamiel is a product of the famousMaguey plant of Mexico. . ."" An analysisshowed that it consisted ofWater ... ... 97.33 per cent. Alcohol by volume ... 2.00 per cent.

An investigationshowed that the product was not manufactured The bottle bore direcfrom the purported Mexican plant, but was a concoction of some laboratory. It cannot f u l f i l to parents to administer the the remotest claim as a bust developer. "" Aquamedicine to infants in miel"" is absolutely worthless, and the representations made concerning it are false and fraudulent. Then, in regard fo ""complexion, tablets,"" the following is stated: A remedy under the above caption was analysed, and found to contain a deadly poisonknown as "" nux vomica."" The unfortunate inThey frequently cident connected with this case is that the remedy was not marked as to the poisonous nature of itscomposition, and a mother into whose possessionthe remedy came, carelessly placed it within? reach of her two and a half year old child, with:",22,Patent Medicines Artificial Foods And Medical Appliances
70,Mr Fisher,The same preparation is,23,Patent Medicines Artificial Foods And Medical Appliances
71,Mr Salmon,"Every credit is due to the result that the child consumed a number of the tablets, and died as a result of strychnine poisoning. We have in the Commonwealth a very much advertised preparation, which contains podophyllin, senna, and ginger. PodophylIin is one of the active poisons, and only within the last two or three days a case was reported in which a man lost his life through taking an overdose of the drug. The preparation to which I refer is "" Californian syrup of figs."" It contains no preparation from figs, but merely the ingredients I have mentioned. Then there is the so-called consumption cure, which is described as follows: The chief active agent in this compound is -claimed to be ""cannabis sativa,"" but an examination showed that the active agent in reality is opium. The only possible virtue that resides in opium as a cure for consumption is that it frequently affords the unfortunate patient some relief, but as far as a cure is concerned this agent is absolutely worthless. It is not only worthless so far as a cure for consumption is concerned, but it tends to make an opium fiend of the person who uses this "" consumption cure."" I can imagine no more lamentable spectacle than that presented by a person in the last stages of consumption flying to remedy after remedy in the hope of being cured. One of the most distressing features of the disease is the optimism which induces patients to fly to so-called remedies, and these are frequently of a particularly dangerous character. time that the Government stepped in and protected them. Here we have an instance in which use is made of a drug which we have expressly excluded from the Commonwealth. Another so-called remedy, called liquid electricity, is described by the experts who have examined it as follows:The company dealing in this remedy used a number of essential oils in its preparation, together with capsicum and a small amount of alcohol. The chief ingredient in this mixture was capsicum. On this uncloubtedly was dependent the value of the remedy, which was probably the basis for calling it ""liquid electricity."" Red pepper in itself is a very good medicinal agent, but it is wide from the truth to claim that with such a simple mixture as this it is possible to cure consumption and similar affections. I have had myself an experience in this connection. A so-called electrical apparatus was submitted to me. It consisted of a small cone which was, apparently, made of aluminium,. This cone, it was asserted, merely required to be clipped into a liquid and then inserted in the ear to cure deafness. found that it was composed principally of red pepper. readily understand that the cone thus prepared, when inserted in a sensitive organ like the ear, would produce a certain warmth. That warmth was supposed to be engendered by the application of electricity. I believe that the cost of the article is about 30s., whereas its commercial value is 3d., and its remedial value absolutely nil. Then there are such articles as methylene blue, radiumite, star pennyroyal pills, and magic foot drafts. The last named consist of pieces of oilcloth covered on the unfinished side with a border of adhesive mixture, whilst the central portion is covered with a plaster composed of poke root, 30 per cent.; pine tar, 62 per cent. ; and cornmeal, 8 per cent. These drafts are said to be "" a great cure for rheumatism,"" and it is alleged that "" 100,000 people from every State and Kingdom on earth have been cured of rheumatism of every kind, and from whatever cause, by magic foot drafts."" Any one with any knowledge at all will understand that there is absolutely nothing in these pads to warrant such claims and representations. There is no curative element whatever contained in the pads which, when absorbed into the blood will neutralise the poisons which cause the rheumatism, and so effect a cure. Then there is another alleged remedy for rheumatism known as vibro discs and tablets. This remedy is claimed to be the only sure It is high cure for rheumatism. It is alleged that it differs materially from all other remedies inasmuch as it is made up of rare and costly agents, one of which is stated to cost $40 per ounce. An examination showed that the remedy consisted of nothing but ordinary drugs, none of which is recognised as having, any material curative effect for rheumatism. The method of applying the medicine was by fastening to the sole cjf each foot a pad which contained in one case a disc of copper, and in the other a disc of zinc, and it was the claim of the promoter of this'remedy that the two discs so placed would generate a current of electricity which would course through the blood of the system and in this way carry with it, to the soles of the feet, the poisonous elements secreted in the body whidh produced the rheumatism. Upon testing this alleged claim, it was found that no current of electricity was generated, and that the scheme and alleged remedy were nothing but a device to defraud. ThereI had the liquid examined, and are a number of other so-called remedies, but I do not propose to weary honourable Honourable members can members by reference to them. one which has a very large vogue in the Commonwealth, and which is manufactured in Australia. come within the scope of the motion under consideration. is not far distant when the States will take up this matter and insist that articles in the way of medicines which are manufactured in the Commonwealth shall also bear a proper description of their contents upon the label. For the remedy to which I refer, marvellous results are claimed. consists of broom and the spirit of juniper. The broom of course is a very good bitter, and we all know what the spirit of the juniper tree is. A good teetotaller taking a dose of this medicine is really drinking gin and bitters. Of course there are some patent preparations which are undoubtedly valuable. I do not wish honourable members to imagine for a moment that I condemn all patent medicines. refrained from advertising those which are valueless, I shall also abstain from advertis ing, those which' are valuable. best patent medicines contain upon the label a description of their composition ? ficial foods also supply chemical analyses, many of them being conducted in Government laboratories. I feel sure that legitimate traders will not resent an attempt on the part of this Parliament to have the formula of their various preparations made public. In Chicago a leading drug journal recentlv statedPeople who are being dosed with recognised poisons have a right to a knowledge of the kind arid quantity, which should be made to appear on the label. All other preparations should, as a condition precedent to their sale, be submitted to the State Board of Pharmacv for registration, as required under the law of France. It has been said that the American States are the only places where we can point to legislation of this character. But I would point out that there is a very effective law operating in France, and we' also know that similar legislation was enacted in New Zealand some time ago. The journal in question continuesWc do not believe in the poly preparations, because a monopoly in medicines is progress or independence, we'fare of the people. I have here certain suggestions which have been made in America, an'd which I think would be valuable to the Minister and his There is officers in framing the necessary regulations under those portions of the Commerce Act which deal with this particular matThis, of course, will not ter. With regard to artificial foods, I think that the greater portion of them are imButI trust that the time ported, and might be dealt with by the central authorities. Repeated analyses have proved that in a very large number of cases those foods really produce starvation. In stead of partaking of the nature of foods, they constitute a drain upon the system. The attempt at assimilation causes It an amount of waste which is worse than actual starvation. That is> to say, the in fant which is fed upon them loses its life, more rapidly than it would if it were not fed at all. In a country like Australia, to which we are striving to attract population, it is of vital importance that the children who are born into the world shall not be murdered-for that is what it really amounts to-b v ' the use of the But, inasmuch as I fraudulent patent foods which are now placed upon our markets. The records of our coronial inquiries show that children are done to death ignorantly by those who are responsible for their care and well-being, although not ignorantly by those who supply these so called foods. The proprietors must know that these artificial foods are worse than valueless. Not only do they fail fo sustain life, but they cause death. To my mind, we can do nothing more important thanenact legislation which will have the effect of preserving the infant life of the community. Unfortunately, we are living under such conditions that many mothers do not find it convenient or necessary to suckle their children. As a result, the latter are deprived of the food which nature has intended for them, and the chemist has entered the field in an endeavour to supply the deficiency. But where one man is attempting to build up a perfect synthetic food, we have a number of conscienceless adventurers who are thrusting upon the market all sorts of so-called artificial foods which are nothing less than poisons. It is in this direction specially that the Government should take immediate action. One has only to read the dai.lv press tern; apprised of that fact. WhilstI honour rule of secret monothe r>ress, I do think that our large neither a secret nor conducive to medical newspapers abuse their magnificent opporand, hence, to the tunities by allowing their columns to be utilized for* the purpose of advertising abuses of this character.

It prevented the publication of advertisements which, in many cases, constituted an inducement to do evil. In my opinion,, the Post Office might render a great service to the community by causing a more careful scrutiny to be made of the various publications which pass through', it from year to year. I hope that something will be done in that direction. The testimonials which are published regarding the curative properties of many patent medicines are in most instances fraudulent. The honourable member for Barrier has quoted some cases in this connection. But he is not the only honourable member who has had an experience of that character. Within the past few days another honourable member was waited upon by a canvasser who desired him to supply a testimonial in favour of a particular remedy. His reply was that he knew nothing whatever of the composition of that remedy. He was then asked if he would verify the statements of a number of his constituents who had supplied testimonials, and he declined to do so. A couple of days later he was once more waited upon by the canvasser, who showed him the testimonials in question, and requested him to verify them, offering him, as an inducement to do so, the sum of two guineas. When the honourable member requested the canvasser to leave, the latter, who possessed a distinctly American accent, said, as he made for the door, "" If you will supply your photo as well, I will give you three guineas."" That individual was shown off the premises at once; but, in my opinion, lie should have been lodged in gaol. The incident which I have related actually occurred within the precincts of Parliament itself, and it merely goes to show how these testimonials, which are disseminated broadcast, are obtained. It is well known that anv struggling, country newspaper reporter who wishes to make a guinea or two has merely to visit some out-of-the-way place and induce one of its residents to declare that he has tried a certain remedy with most marvellous reHaving interviewed the alleged patient, he the latter's personal appearance, and of his residence-indicating , possibly, the colour in, which his front garden gate is painted-rand his restoration to health through the patent nostrum and for this serThat vice he receives a couple of guineas. That is the amount which is regularly paid to reporters who procure such testimonials. Such a practice should not be tolerated. Unfortunately, under the law as it stands, we cannot deal with these cases; but I hope that the time is coming when the health and well-being'of the community will be our first care, and we shall place upon the statute-book a law providSng that such things shall not be permitted. We have no higher duty to perform.

I regret that the Minister has not power to insist that all prescriptions shall be written in English so that we may know what they are. I speak with some degree of feeling, since I had occasion to notice how prescriptions written for my family varied from day to day. One thing alone was constant, and that was the price.

As to thedesirability of passing this motion, one only needs to go into a drug store to see the enormous quantity of drngsof various kinds that are taken-and taken, so far as I can see, with absolutely no beneficial result. But I am notgoing to condemn all patent medicines. I understand that the Minister pins hisIt is a fact that all those who do faith to one particular brand to which heflies upon occasions, with the most gratifying results. I do not know whether he is inclined to make known the brand, but if"" that he is, now is the time for him to do so.

There are, happily, patent medicines which db a great deal' of good. In spite of what the honourable member for Laanecoorie has said"" about patent medicines and quack practitioners, I venture to assert that on the whole the medicines that are dispensed by I am very pleased that regular practitioners will bear as little examination as will those banded' out by quacks.

Formerly, it was the custom of medical practitioners jto barbarously mutilate a man by blee'di'r.g him. That was considered to be the only method by which one could achieve anything like1 a reasonable degree of health and strength.

92,Mr Hughes,"the present generation of doctors will be considered to have been little further skilled patent medicines, however, are very few. in the science of medicine than were the medicine-men of the Red Indians. While surgery has made startling strides, medicine is in its swaddling clothes, and is kept there patent medicines are recommended tend to by such silly practices as the illegible writmislead the public, and there is associated ing of prescriptions in words, supposed to be Latin, which no Latinist could decipher or understand. Three words alone stand out plainly in the ordinary prescriptionthe word recipe-and, foolish enough, he follows the advice, and takes the medicine-and the words aqua pura. that element always being present in liberal quantities. I know that the Minister holds the views which I am now uttering, and has that contempt for the medical profession-of course, not for the individual doctors who compose it-whic h it deserves. No doubt, the profession is a beneficent one. It has done a great deal of good. Our cemeteries are proof of that. But it is obvious that its members have yet a great deal to learn. That is shown by the statement of the honourable member for Brisbane, who, after a lifetime of experiment, tells us that if a patent medicine contains aloes, or calomel, or soap-whic h I believe .to be, the foundation of certain pills-ther e is room for difference of opinion as to its probable action. I should have thought that there could be no difference of opinion on that subject, but, after his pronouncement, shall not venture to express mv views on the point. I hope that the honourable member for Barrier will accept the emendation suggested by this eminent authority, so that we may do what will be a.t once desirable and sensible. hardlv conceive that there should be any difference of opinion as to the need for action such as is contemplated by the motion ; but, although the subject has been discussed rather fullv , I wish to direct attention to a particular phase of it, in the hone that the Legislatures of the States will nrofit by our example, as they did in connection with the Commerce Act, and db their nart towards the removal of a great evil. There are patent medicines' made up on ver"" effective formula?, and I know that the chemists who had to make up the prescriptions of a leading medical man connected with certain friendly societies charged more for doing so than they charged for making up other prescriptions, because he was in the habit of prescribing proportions of patent medicines, holding them to be compounds of value. SuchI believe, too, that the patent medicines which are harmful in themselves are also few. But the advertisements by which with them an element of fraud. Mention has not been made during the discussion of the systematic manner in which the Australian people are raiaed by Americani f the patient is patent medicine firms. These firms often carry on business under the name of some doctor, whose prescription's they profess to sell. These doctors may or may not have an existence; it is not worth any one's while to go to America to investigate the matter. The companies send out circulars, offering to those who receive them certain inducements to send back the addresses of friends or neighbours who may be suffering from any ailment given in an accompanying list. These lists are so comprehensive that scarcely any of the ills to which flesh is heir are omitted from them. When addresses have been secured in this way, cleverly-worded letters are sent out, for the writing of which special staffs are engaged. These'letters are calculated to appeal strongly to sensitive persons, and to excite their imagination in respect to their physical condition. By these means, a large sum of money is annually extracted from our people for the purchase of drugs and compounds, which are probably useless, and in many cases exceedingly harmful. No doubt, many of the compounds sold for internal as well as for external application contain large quantities of alcohol. The costly advertisements which appear in our newspapers, the pamphlets with which the country is flooded, and the scale on which the business of the patent' medicine companies is conducted, are indications of the immense profits which, must be made in the business, and, no doubt, a great deal of misery is caused to sensitive persons by descriptions of symptoms which make them think that they are suffering from diseases. The health of thousands is ruined, and their pockets emptied, by those who sell these much-vaunted cures. The practices of these firms are virtually fraudulent, and as such should be put down by law. What the honourable member for 'Barrier wishes to do is to enlighten the public. I hope that the Legislatures of the States will make it a misdemeanour to deceive the public in regard to statements the truth",28,Patent Medicines Artificial Foods And Medical Appliances
93,Mr Spence (Darling) [4.20],"I canof which the average man cannot determine for himself. Very few persons are capable of analyzing a"" patent medicine, ;ind the average man cannot pay to have an analysis made for him. No doubt, the Australian public needs educating on the subject of drugs. There seems to be a wrong impression as to their value in 'securing health. I had some years of experience in hospital management, and am satisfied that many of the outdoor patients who came to be examined and prescribed for had practically nothing the matter with them. discomfort may have arisen from having the previous day: I know that one medical man had the courage to tell many of his would be patients tliat this was the case, but, as his outspokenness seemed likely to produce a diminution in the subscriptions, another doctor was procured, who used to prescribe largely what was practically only coloured water. He was able to run the hospital for twelve months at an average cost of i o ^ d . per patient, indoor and outdoor, and, of course, the indoor patients were really sick. Those who got the coloured water were perfectly satisfied, and, no doubt, in conversation with their neighbours, enlarged upon the beneficial effects of the medicine given to them. I remember .a case in which for years a lady received a bottle of medicine from the chemist every week, paying him 2s. 6d. for it. One day she called at the shop for it, and, as the chemist himself was out, the assistant made it up for her from the original prescription; but, on taking it, she became quite angry, and said that she had been given the wrong medicine. What she had really been having was something quite harmless. No doubt, many druggists' shops are licensed poison shops. Leading medical men admit that they do not believe much in drugs. They consider their use beneficial upon occasion, but condemn the practice of taking them generally. No doubt, if the public knew the ingredients of patent medicines, they would often refuse to buy them, because they would say, "" We will not pay 2s. 6d. for what does not cost twopence to make."" The results of investigations in the United States of America have proved that, in many instances, prescriptions are not properly made up by the chemists. Although the medical men who prescribe have ordered the use of certain drugs, these drugs are often not used, sometimes to the serious injury of the patient. However, as it is desired to take a vote on the question before the notices of motion are called on, I shall not prolong my remarks,^ although I should like to say a good deal more on the subject. Question resolved in the affirmative. I moveI n some cases their That, in the opinion of this House, all necessary steps should be taken, before any general eaten too large a dinner on election, to pass a Bill for the alteration of the Constitution, to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to enact uniform industrial laws, so that at the time of the election the Bill may be inexpensively submitted lo the electors, as provided in section 128 of the Constitution. I brought forward a similar motion last session, when I directed the attention of honourable members to the fact that opinion had undergone a considerable change since, the holding of the Federal Convention, at which it was decided not to bring industrial legislation under the control of the Commonwealth. Sir William McMillan, when he occurjied the position of leader of the Opposition, acknowledged that he had very considerably changed his views, and expressed himself in these words: I hold generally that everything that affects the rights and liberties-especiall y the industrial rights ancl liberties-of the community ought to be in the hands of the National Parliament. At another stage of the same speech he saidI do not think these great subjects should be settled, except by the National Parliament. I contend that the same Legislature that has the power to protect the manufacturer by imposing effective Customs duties, should also be in a position to protect the employees by enacting industrial legislation. In other words, protection is only half effective if it secures the home markets to the manufacturer, without providing for adequate wages, fair conditions, and clean environment for the whole of the employ6s. This is being recognised to a fuller extent every year. It is quite true that in Victoria, industrial legislation has been fairly effective, but even in that State it has many limitations. I find that in forty trades employing 44,000 operatives Wages Boards have been appointed; but there are still 19,000 factory operatives to whom no protection has been afforded by means of industrial legislation. The latter employees",29,Patent Medicines Artificial Foods And Medical Appliances
94,Mr Mauger (Melbourne Ports) [4.30].,"are, for the most part, engaged in industries that are protected, and are carried on mainly in shires and boroughs where the Factories and Shops Act cannot reach them. Others are employed in trades in respect to which no application has been -made for the appointment of Wages Boards. The .application of industrial legislation in operations are sufficiently large to justify Victoria has been considerably hampered during ihe last two years by the very far-reaching amendment recently adopted by the State Legislature.

If the Board were required to take the average wage ruling in the trade at present they would very closely approach sweating conditions.

107,As Mr Harrison Mr Frazer,"That evil is not peculiarcountries in which there is no industrial protection. I am sorry that it is net confined to South Australia. I mentioned that State because of the very remarkable change which has recently taken place there. Its Chamber of Manufactures has expressed a desire to adopt Victorian legislation upon what it calls "" safe lines."" I have shown what that expression means. In Queensland, I regret to sav, the position is no better. In New South Wales, the Chamber of Manufactures recently directed the attention of its members to the fact that most unfair competition was taking place betwen Queensland and New South Wales manufacturers, because, whilst many of the latter were working under the awards of the Arbitration Court, in Queensland the manufacturers were free to pay just what wages they chose, and to work their employees very long hours. here to plead the cause of the manufacturers. I am pleading for what is known in Victoria as the "" new protection."" That is the only protection that any reasonable man can advocate. A system of protection which merelv protects the manufacturer is worth nothing either to the country or to the industry in which he is engaged. It is because I want to see this "" new protection "" applied to Queensland, for example, where sweating is rampant, that I urge this Parliament to take the .matter up. In Tasmania, I am sorry to say, there exists nc| legislation of an industrial character. Quite recently, that was made very evident.

If it were he ought to welcome legislation It is peculiar to all which would bring the industry in Victoria up to the standard which exists in Tasmania. In this State the wages paid in the jam industry are as follow :-Adult males, 30s. per 'week; males over eighteen, but not more than twenty-one years of age, 17s. j males over sixteen, but not more than eighteen years, 12s.; lads under sixteen years of age, 9s. Females of eighteen years and upwards receive 14s. per week. These are the wages paid in a protected industry-a n industry out of which large fortunes have been made in Victoria. a protection of Â£ 1 4 per ton. wealthy men in Melbourne to-day are jam manufacturers, and before this law was enacted they were paying shameful wages. I am not not very liberal Mr 'MAUGER -Of course they are not, but they are infinitely better than they were. ployes in the jam industry receive a low minimum wage is that one of their representatives upon the Board went wrong. blameless in these matters. I know of operatives at the present time who are contracting themselves out of this very law. I do not for a moment affirm that the employers alone are to blame. If men were alive to their own interests they might do a great deal to assist the adState emphasized ministration of the Act. But my point fact that in many protected is that there are jam manufacturers in Victoria who are amassing fortunes, ancl who, nevertheless, pay miserable wages. I am sorry to sav that in some instances they give freely to the churches and to charitable institutions money which would be far better employed in the payment of reasonable wages to their operatives.

The inevitable result of that would be unfair competition of the very worse kind. When an anomaly of that kind can exist, and does exist, it is a matter for serious -consideration whether, having the power to impose protective duties, this Parliament is not the very best authority to declare what the industrial -conditions shall be, and particularly what shall be the remuneration paid in certain industries. up. I am not here to say that the States Parliaments, with their local knowledge, -may not be ;ahle, by means of Wia,ges Boards, to do better work than the Commonwealth can do by passing certain laws. But the larger issue confronts us, and will continue to confront us as long as we avail ourselves of the power to give facilities for the creation of new industries. support this motion the more cheerfully, because I find that in a speech delivered recently at Adelaide, the Prime Minister declared that the policy of the present Government in the future would be of such a -character as would enable fair industrial conditions-and I presume fair wages-to prevail throughout the Commonwealth. I took occasion, in making reference to that speech on the following morning, to say that, while the idea of fhe Prime Minister was a fair one, in my opinion, this Parliament has not, under the Constitution, the powers necessary to enable it to secure to the workmen in protected industries their fair share of the results of protection. We may increase duties as much as we please, but we have no power to declare that those engaged in protected industries shall be fairly remunerated. That being so, I think that the Government, if they sincerely hold the views enunciated by their leader, must support the motion. In my opinion, it is inevitable that this power will be given to the Commonwealth. this Parliament fihere is a fuller and broader representation of the people than there is in the Parliaments of the States, because there is not uniformity of representation throughout Australia, and some . of the State Legislatures are, from a radical point of view, not as truly representative of the popular mind as it is desirable that they should be. Every adult in Australia, however, has a right to cast a vote for candidates tb this Parliament, One of the States Legislaand it is by this body that I hope to see passed the measures necessary to ameliorate the conditions, and to assist the labours, of those whose industry is the back-bone of our national welfare. I do not agree with the honourable member for Bass that we should confine ourselves to the exercise of the powers we possess under the Constitution. It may be a fair argument to saythat the time has not yet arrived when we should seek to deal with this question. Mr ST*ORRER I say that we have not yet dealt with manv of the matters with which we have been specially empowered That is a logical position to take to deal. but, when we have dealt fully with all the matters referred to us by the Constitution, we shall have largely exhausted our usefulness, and there will not be much left for us to do but to' pass Supply; and no doubt the demands upon the CommonI shall wealth exchequer will go on increasing. The fact that we had not exercised many of our powers would not prevent us, if a crisis arose, from asking for power to deal with it. The honourable member for Bass is one of the most sensible men in the House, and, if a crisis arose with which the Parliament had no constitutional power to deal, he would be one of the first to say that we should appeal to the people for the power required for the protection of the public interest. crisis when it comes. its way; but it is better to provide machinery which will prevent the happening of crises, to the national injury. It is not proposed that the States shall be asked to hand over their powers to a foreign authority. It is merely suggested that they should transfer them to a Parliament elected on the widest suffrage by the people of the States, so that we may so frame our legislation that the manufacturer in In one State may not have an undue advantage over manufacturers in other States. The just, honest, and respectable manufacturer or producer is always anxious for laws which will prevent competitors from unfair dealing, for which opportunity is given by the cutting-down of wages.

145,Mr Tudor (Yarra) [5.31],"Duringeluding certain powers in the Commonwealth which we decided to leave in the States. At a later stage of his speech he remarkedI do not think those great subjects should be settled, except by a national Parliament. He supported the motion. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports stated that some doubt existed as to whether Wages Boards or the Arbitration Court afforded the best means of settling trade disputes. Personally, I favour-the Arbitration Court, although I am prepared to admit that it is slow in its operation. Its great virtue is that it affords protection to every employee. Those who have had experience of Wages Boards know that time after time the workmen who have represented their fellow employees upon 1?he Boards have been dismissed for standing up for their rights. The whole of the workmen who sat upon the first Wages Board in the butchering trade were dismissed, and the same thing took place ini the fellmongery business. Some of the employers in that business who are now complaining that their trade has fallen away-and I regret the fact as much as any one-were the very first to close down their works, with a view to defeating the object of the Act. They declined at first to be represented upon the Wages-Board of their trade, and when they were compelled to be represented on the Board, and wages and hours were fixed, they shut down their works and locked out their employees, as they desired to work them more than the eight hours per day fixed by the Wages Board, and threw the whole of their business into the hands of foreign buyers. These outsiders have now obtained such a firm hold of the market that the local manufacturers are very sorry that they ever took the unwise step to which I have referred. I consider that this Parliament, which has power to protect the employer, should also be able to take the employee under its sheltering wing. The honourable member for Bass urges that we should first exhaust all the powers we now possess before we seek to obtain others, and he also suggests that if we ask the people to consent to one amendment of the Constitution, others, perhaps less desirable, will be brought about. Personally, I think it would be very difficult to bring about any amendment of the Constitution, because the electors will requirea good deal of persuasion before they will vote in favour of any alteration. I shall certainlv vote for the motion, because I think that it is in the last degree desirable [79] that we should have uniformity in our industrial legislation. When the-honourable member for Melbourne Ports first brought forward a proposal of this kind, it was my privilege to second it, and I have very much pleasure in supporting him now. But whilst I thoroughly agree with the. motion, I am not insensible to some of the difficulties which will have to be overcome before it can be rendered effective. In the first place, we shall have to secure the support of a majority of the electors in a majority of the States before we can exercise the power indicated in the motion:. Seeing that this Legislature deals with Customs legislation which has an important bearing upon the industrial life of the country, I am .satisfied that the electors will not hesitate to hand over to us the responsibility c f dealing with industrial legislation in order that it may be made uniform throughout the Commonwealth. It is true that efforts have already been made by means of an Arbitration Act to assist the workers to obtain fair wages and other conditions; but it is necessary that we should have further powers than those now conferred upon us in order that we may give to the workers complete protection. From the commencement, we should have been in the position to pass all the laws necessary to insure the protection of the employee as well as of the manufacturer, and we should now seek to render our control over the industrial affaire of the Commonwealth as effective as possible. The hpncrable member for Yarra reminds me that representations were made to the States with a view to securing their consent to the transfer of the control of industrial matters to the Commonwealth. The replies received from them were not, however, of the most satisfactory character. Nevertheless, they were what might have been fairly expected at that early stage of our historv as a Federation. Even now, the States authorities are more or less jealous of the power of this Parliament, and it is not unusual to hear State Premiers and other gentlemen complaining bitterly, but without reason, of our actions. In these circumstances. I do not know whether we should, even at this stage, obtain. a very much more satisfactory set of replies than were vouchsafed upon the former occasion. The unfavorable attitude of the States should not, however, deter us from doing what we",37,Industrial Legislation Amendment Of Th E Constitution
146,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke) [5.39],"conceive to be our clear duty, namely, to pass such legislation as is necessary for the welfare of all those who are engaged in industrial pursuits. It may be said, as was stated in pre-Federation days, that if we pass legislation such as that contemplated, all sorts of ruinous results will be brought about! I have heard statements of that kind so frequently that I no longer attach any credence to them. Honourable members opposite have said with regard to almost every measure submitted to the House, that it would bring about disaster and ruin. If we had believed them, we should never have enacted any legislation of a progressive character. But we did pass the measures, and the result is that we have become more prosperous than ever. In the Victorian Legislature, in the old days, it was stated bf many honourable members that Wages Boards and factory laws would result in undue interference with industrial concerns, and bring ruin in their train. It was represented that money would leave the State, that the workers would be thrown out of employment, and that the most awful cataclysm would ensue. these things happened. 0,rt the contrary,' from the very inception of these laws, a steady improvement took place, both in respect of the condition of the employees themselves, and that of the employers. Not one of the evil prophecies was fulfilled, but everybody was benefited. In Victoria the effect of such legislation was very good indeed, and from that fact, I am bound to argue that the 'result would be equally beneficial in the case of the Commonwealth. The competition which can at present ensue between State and State on account of a lack of uniform industrial laws is bound, sooner or later, to bring a certain amount of inconvenience, if not of suffering, in its train. Let me give a simple illustration : Prior to Federation, Victoria had established a considerable trade in boots and shoes, and she still does the bulk of that trade. The industrv was built up by reason of the protection which the Victorian Parliament had given it. a considerable trade in boots without the aid of a protective Tariff. not nearly so large as was that of Victoria. To-day, however, the condition of things is changing. As we all know, Queensland is a State which deals largely in cattle. Every year she exports an enormous quantity of tinned meat. A ll the hides whichn come from beasts slaughtered for that purpose, could be converted into leather, and when the Queenslanders realize that, they will turn them into leather, and' will convert the leather into boots and shoes.. When that time comes-if the Queensland* manufacturers are not placed under the same or similar industrial conditions tothose existing in Victoria, more particularly with regard to Wages Boards-the y will easilv be able to command the market of the Commonwealth. If , for argument's sake, they are in a position toemploy operatives in the boot trade at Â£ 2 per week, whilst the average rate in the other States is Â£ 3 per week, they wilt enjoy a most decided' advantage. What istrue of that particular trade is equally trueof other industries which might be named. Consequently, the necessity exists for making our industrial laws uniform throughout the States. But when I speak of uniformlaws, I do not say that they necessarily involve the payment of uniform rates of wages. It is quite possible to have uniform* But none of la.ws in respect of industrial pursuitswithout having uniform rates of wages. There are quite a number of things whichwill require to be taken into account in* determining the rates of wages. For instance, there are climatic conditions, thedifferences which exist between the rate* of interest payable upon capital borrowed,. and the price of living in the various States. Everybody is aware that in Western Australia, money is dearer than it is in New South Wales and Victoria; that rent ishigher, and that living costs more. Consequently, it is absolutely necessary, if we are to preserve an equilibrium-that therate of wages paid in that State should behigher than it is in Victoria or New South Wales. These matters will need to he taken into account when we come to consider the question of uniform industrial' laws for the Commonwealth.

167,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat,"Minister offurther, that all necessary steps should be taken before the next general election to pass a Bill to secure an alteration of the Constitution. I am not blind to the fact that in supporting the motion-as I shall certainly doI am endorsing the first proposition. I do not know whether the honourable member who has submitted it-and who has everv right to be heard upon a question of this kind, to, which he has devoted many years of patient study and practical work-ha s any intention of proceeding further in the second direction. He must recognise that at this stage of the session, and under existing circumstances, his opportunities of doing so are likely to be very limited. 1 withdraw the motion. his judgment and not for ours; but, meanwhile, the motion readsThat, in the opinion of this House, all necesgard. Quite recently,"" we passed a measary steps should be taken, before any general election, to pass a B ill , &c. Speaking for myself, I concur in tihe rest of the motion, though not binding my colleagues to its exact terms. It appears to me to be one of the inevitable developments of Federation. There are a series of provisions in the Constitution which, taken together, render necessary some such addition as the motion suggests, to give them their full force and effect, and to round off the industrial portion of our powers For instance, there is that great and almost indefinable area which is covered under the heading of "" trade and commerce,"" the most immediate effect of which has been attained by the passing of Tariff laws. But, in addition to that, which enables us to control the general conditions under which Australian industries are carried on, we find ourselves, in conciliation and arbitration matters, introduced further into the arena. Here we are faced with problems with which it is impossible to cope except by a study of industrial conditions, and by trial effect. The exercise of any power relating to conciliation and arbitration necessarily forces the Commonwealth into the industrial field-and, indeed, has done so already. control that we exercise over -all trading or financial corporations, is another point at which we touch-and are likely in future to touch even more closely-man y branches of production. The tendency to transfer great undertakings from the control of individuals to that of limited companies marks a familiar development ""ih industrial affairs. Nor can we exclude from our view the more indirect relation between old-age pensions and the subject under discussion. Altogether, without looking at our remaining powers, such as those relating to taxation, or the granting of bounties for industrial development, iind a number of others which more or less impinge upon this question, an examination of the present position of the Commonwealth in relation to industrial affairs will show that it is, as yet, imperfect. It points clearly to a greater, though gradual, assumption of authority, in order that we may give full effect to the powers should which the Commonwealth already possesses, and exercise effective control from an Australian point of view. This Parliament has been by no means blind to its obligations in this resure in which direct reference is made to the industrial conditions obtaining in Australia. Under the heading of "" The Commonwealth Trade Mark,"" we have in the Trade Marks Act, passed last session, recognised the present unsatisfactory want of uniformity in our industrial affairs, requiring us to proceed in a very indirect manner to accomplish a very plain end. Under section 78 the Commonwealth trade mark may be applied fo all goods, in respect of which, in the opinion of Parliamentthe conditions as to the remuneration of labour in connection with their manufacture are fair and reasonable. Under sub-section 2, it is provided that where the conditions are laid down by the States as to the remuneration of labourprescribed, required, or provided in relation lo the goods, by an industrial award or order, or an industrial agreement under an industrial law the Commonwealth trade mark may also be applied. Where those conditions do not exist that trade mark cannot be applied. This cumbrous form had to be adopted by determinations having an industhe Parliament, because of the present limitation of its power. It is, nevertheless, an indication of its intention, as far as its authority permits, to mark its sense of the necessary imposition of certain industrial Then, again, the conditions everywhere which shall be equitable to the labourer as well as to the employer. There is also before another place at the present time a measure which recently left this Chamber, the Australian Industries Preservation Bill. Its keynote",40,Industrial Legislation Amendment Of Th E Constitution
168,Mr Joseph Cook,Then he,41,Industrial Legislation Amendment Of Th E Constitution
169,Mr Deakin,"That is a matter formay be said to be the distinguishing between industries in which civilized industrial conditions have been established, and those in which they are not in force. The inadequate remuneration of labour disqualifies appeals to it. It preserves industries which merit preservation because of the conditions under which they are carried on. Its provisions against unfair competition are amongst its most prominent features. Thus in the exercise of our existing powers we have found ourselves from time to time confronted by the necessity of dealing with the different conditions that obtain in the different States. I am far from assuming that an attempt should be made to rigidly apply precisely the same industrial regulations to the whole of Australia. We have to recognise that, in this vast Continent, there are already of various kinds, which would render different remuneration necessary, in order that there should be an actual, instead of a merelv nominal, equality in the wages paid in different parts of the Commonwealth. Other conditions as to hours and times of work might also be varied without any departure from a fair rule. We have to recognise that, even with our present population, the simplicity of municipal control is not possible federally, since our people live under widely different conditions in several parts of Australia. At present, top, we are faced by something beyond these natural contrasts; we are faced by contrasts in policy, and in the manner in which industrial conditions are sought to be regulated, or, in some of the States, by an absence of regulation of any kind. In dealing with industrial measures we have been confronted with the difficulties created by the existence of these marked contrasts in States laws. I have always held that, in the circumstances peculiar to our Constitution as it is-acceptin g the responsibility which it places upon us-w e are and shall be compelled, in discharging our duties to'our constituents, to face industrial conditions and circumstances. it is not possible for us to deal adequately with the problems already presented while we are faced with six different sets of industrial conditions in as many different States. I look forward in fhe future to the inevitable assumption by the Commonwealth-as an agency for the people of Australia of a greater control over any industrial conditions at present beyond its reach. It does not. rest with this Parliament to say when it will be conferred, nor the extent to which it will foe given. Both these questions require to be decided by the electors at a general election when they have been distinctly appealed to, and when a definite proposition has been submitted to them. I do not know that as yet this question has been discussed outside the Parliament in any systematic or persistent manner. Although in this Chamber it has recurred from time to time, this is the.first occasion on which an attempt has been made to push it to a directly practical issue. The honourable member who fathers the motion and has commended it to the House is probably more closely in touch with the industrial conditions of this State than is any one else in or out of it. I do not know, howmanifest certain variations ever, whether his knowledge of the industrial conditions in other States, and the sentiments of those affected by them, approaches that which he undoubtedly possesses .of those in Victoria. I question whether there has yet been sufficient public elucidation of the necessity for this advance, or a clear delimitation of the change proposed. I do not know whether there has been such an exposition of the case for a change as would entitle us to expect to put this question at the next general election, with that certainty of receiving a favorable answer which the honourable member must desire. I make this statement lest my '-support to the motion be misunderstood. I am in hearty agreement with its principle, because I regard it as the necessarily logical development of the Constitution. The Constitution is to-day imperfect on its industrial side, and can be completed only by an advance in this direction. I also approve of the principle, because I share the considerations which have affected honourable members who have preceded me, and adopt manv of their arguments, which, to save time, I shall not repeat. I agree with them that, having regard to the uniformity of conditions we Evidently are establishing as far as possible under the Tariff, the Trade Marks Act, and the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, the people of Australia ha.ve a special .claim upon this Parliament for uniformity of industrial legislation. These Bills deal, utid are bound to deal, from our stand-point, with Australian industry. That term covers the whole of the manufacturers and employers of the Commonwealth. They all are Australian, and we are able only by the most cumbersome methods to distinguish between the diverse conditions under which they are now working. We can continue to exercise our present powers f r u it f u l l y only able member and of the Prime Minister in when dealing with Australian industries established on the same basis, and conducted in the same manner. Until some change is brought about, our industrial efforts may be crippled, and the discharge of the powers we already have, impeded. It therefore appears natural that the electors of Australia, when more fully informed on this subject-and when more united in taking the necessary action towards its achievement-wil l press upon their representatives, as no doubt some of them have already done, the necessity of bringing about this uniformity without further delay. well content, if it is my fortune to be able to join, in recommending to them an extension of the Commonwealth powers that will permit of our making uniform industrial laws. The movement is at present in the educational stage. The education of the people must continue some time longer before we can hope that an appeal to them will receive the overwhelming support which I think it should get. The honourable memberi's motive is excellent. My honourable colleagues will exercise their right of private judgment in regard to the motion, though I believe all of them are in accord. support it as necessary to the completion of the Constitution, and' essential to the exercise of the industrial powers which our people wish to be employed on their behalf, and for their benefit. Seeing the importance of the motion, I am astonished that during the past two years the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the Prime Minister have taken so little interest in the matter with which it deals. bourne Portls moved a similar motion in the session before last, and brought the matter forward again at the end of last session. to deal with it when, we are within two months of a dissolution, and the Prime Minister, who says he is in favour of it . admits that it is impossible to give effect to it. If the educationof the people is needed, why has the subject not been seriously discussed before this, seeing that the motion has been on the business-paperand practically buried,-for nearly two years ? ward for discussion at the earliest possible moment; it has not been buried. regard to this matter of great national importance is the most extraordinary piece of make-believe that I have ever heard of in connection with an. Australian Parliament. Both honourable gentlemen admit the importance of the question, and yet it has been allowed to slumber for two years, and is row brought forward at a time when the Prime Minister says that it is impossible to give practical effect to it. I am in sympathy with attempts to make the Federation more productive of good than it has been so far. I am not one of those who wish to restrict the powers of the When that time comes I shall be Commonwealth, but, as was hinted by the Prime Minister, this is a most inopportune time to ask the people of Australia to extend our powers. Their disposition, at present is-perhaps , unfortunately-un favorable to any such extension. But, notwithstanding the importance of the subject, and the fact that it has been before Parliament for nearly two vears, the Ministry have never considered it, and the Prime Minister has had to declare that he can speak for himself alone, because he does not know what the views of his -colleagues are. A proposal Eor an amendPersonally, I shall ment of the Constitution cannot be entertained until the Ministry have arrived at a diecision in regard to it, and are prepared to introduce a Bill to give effect to it ; because it is a 'condition precedent to any such alteration that a B ill proposing it shall be passed through both Houses of Parliament before its submission to the electors. Surelyi t is the duty of a -Government, when a motion of this importance is placed on the notice-paper, to consider what action they shall take in reThe honourable member for Melgard to it . The position of the Ministry is noti say that the Government will not ultimately consider this matter. But they have not hitherto paid the honourable member for .

Legislation affecting the management of the agricultural industry and the land problems of Australia migh't be so embraced.

That view of the subject must receive consideration. No doubt, uniformity of law is, under ordinary circumstances, extremely -desirable. not necessarily mean uniformity of conditions. uniform, I do not see how you can fairly have uniformity of law. If we pay regard to the differences of conditions ""throughout Australia, we cannot have uniformity of law, because we must distingush between the conditions of an industry in -one part of the Continent and those of an ""industry in another part: The course proposed by the honourable member would be valueless if the Commonwealth obtained power to make only uniform industrial laws, 'because it would be impossible for us to pass industrial laws which did not take into .account the difference in the conditions prevailing throughout the Commonwealth, and the mandate of the people would have been ""to pass uniform industrial laws. law creating Wages Boards, and those Boards would take into consideration local -conditions and circumstances. -to my obiection. The law might be uniform, and yet its application might differ .according to condlitions. But the difficulties to which the honourable member for Bourke"" 'has referred would still remain. He pointed out that in Queensland^ where they have marvellous pastoral resources, factories may be established to make hides into boots, and contended that the Commonwealth should pass a law to place the 'boot making industry of Queensland under the same regulations as govern the boot making industry of Victoria. That would 'be the application of a uniform lawin a uniform wav. The Minister of Trade and -Customs has had a good deal to say about dumping; but. when I was in Queensland the other day, I found that, although the ""honourable gentleman considers that the -Commonwealth suffers from the dumping in Australia of goods produced in distant parts of the world, the people of that State complain that they suffer from the dumping, not of foreign, but of Victorian-made goods. I was told by leadThe ing business men there that their factories have suffered, owing to the increased importation of goods manufactured in Melbourne, and possibly in Sydney, too, where, the markets being larger, the manufacturing is on a bigger scale than is possible further north. able member not to discuss the subject of dumping. remarks in regard to it until another occasion. I wish to take the opportunity which the honourable member for Bourke has given me to repel one of the meanest and foulest slanders which has ever been uttered against a public man in Australia. My words have been quoted with a view to show that I anticipate with pleasure and desire the time when we shall have pauper labour in Australia. No viler or fouler injustice has ever been done to a public man. The workers of New South Wales have never had that opinion of me, as has been shown by the support which I have received from them. I referred merely to the difficulties of which Australian protectionists are speaking at the present time. Why is protection asked for? Is it not in order to keep out of Australia the goods produced by the cheap labour obtainable in the overcrowded countries of the old world? Is not the barrier of protective duties alleged to be necessary to keep out the cheap labour not only of Belgium and of Germany, but even of England? In dealing with that argument, I have based my free-trade views on the principle that we should avoid competition with the pauper labour employed in the industries of overcrowded countries, by devoting ourselves to the development of the great natural industries which our enormous resources and advantages enable us to carry on so profitable, leaving it to time to gradually produce the industries which bring into play the riper forms of human ingenuity. I have pointed out, not as something to look forward to with pleasure, but as an evil attendant upon overcrowding, that as our population increases, and labour becomes superabundant, we shall suffer as other countries have suffered, and our working people will not be able to command the wages which we desire that they shall have.",43,Industrial Legislation Amendment Of Th E Constitution

I do not ask the Minister to make a long speech; but, as he must know, the public to-morrow will be very anxious to learn the bearing of these resolutions upon -the revenue. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [7.49] The .recommendations of the Tariff Commission in respect of spirits would, if adopted in their entirety, have involved fhe Commonwealth in a loss of revenue ranging from jQlS,000 to ,Â£90,000. the Government have not adopted those, recommendations is that we could not afford to lose that amount of revenue. Accordingly, we have raised the import duty upon -spirits from 14s. to 15s. per gallon, and we have increased the Excise duty by is. per gallon, so as to preserve a proper proportion between the two imposts. -Government proposals will not involve us in such a large loss as might otherwise -3.1*1 SC ? involve the Commonwealth in nearly such a large loss of revenue, if , indeed, they involve it in any loss at all. right honourable member for East Sydney has stated that a great deal of good will result from the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, but it seems to me that the position taken up by that body and the Government in regard to the subject matters of these recommendations will lead to a great deal of manoeuvring. The procedure which' has been adopted to protect -the revenue will make certain individuals in the community even more prone to indulge in. speculation the moment it is known that the Tariff Commission has arrived at a particular conclusion in regard to any other matter. I take it that the Minister of Trade and Customs, during the past day or two, has been feeling the pulse if the commercial community upon the -items enumerated in his resolution. that there is a single soul who knew anything whatever about the course which the Covernment intended to take. Customs officers felt that there were other people besides themselves who were keeping a sharp eye upon the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, andwho, if they were not taking out of bond more goods than they would take uncier ordinary circumstances Sir WILLIAM LYNE I d'o not think that any large quantity of spirits have been withdrawn from bond. creditable to the Government that they have been able to take action without sustaining a loss of revenue. I venture to say that the commercial community are watching the decisions of the Tariff Commission even more keenly than are honourable members. One reason why surprised to-morrow morning. be more surprised when we come to deal with other items in the Tariff. If we deal with the Tariff in a piecemeal fashion, I fear that there will be a great deal of speculative action on the part of the commercial classes, despite all that we can do to prevent it. I am glad to hear that, so far, the revenue has not suffered. I heartily agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Wide Bay. It is a disadvantage to deal with the reports of the Tarff Commission in a piecemeal way. But I would! point out that the lines with which the Government are now dealing affect our own people more than will any subsequent report of the Commission, because they deal with Excise duties. I quite admit that various importing firms are very carefully watching the progress of the Tariff Commission's labours, and that they are closely noting what is being said from both sides of this Chamber regarding the attitude which will be adopted when the recommendations of that body are brought before the House. I am sorry that such statements have been made, because there is no doubt that they injuriously affect the revenue. I think that the discussion which has taken place in this Chamber furnishes one of the most potent arguments against dealing in a.

In the first place, a bountv is not usually as permanent as a duty, nor does it increase the cost of the article to the user, although, in almost every instance, that is the effect of a protective Customs duty. My objection to bounties-and there is an objectionabje. side to the system-is that they often reach the wrong person, that they do not often effect their purpose, for even the production of articles after the determination to grant a bountv in respect of them is not always the direct result of the assistance so offered. not purely local. The difficulty with some Then, again, there is a danger of a bounty being followed by the imposition of heavy duties, which, when applied to materials entering into other manufactures, may -necessitate an increase in the measure of protection granted to those manufactures. Honourable members, whether they favour or oppose the system, or are doubtful as to its efficacy, will have to consider on their merits the proposals of the Minister. They will have to examine this measure to discover whether the products which it is proposed to encourage are such as it is desirable to produce in Australia; whether the production of other articles might not be more worthy of encouragement; whether the proposals will be effective; and finally, whether, the encouragement proposed will be as effective as other methods might be. In dealing with this question, I feel that we are indebted to the honourable member for Echuca, who made an admirable, interesting;, and instructive speech, on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. recent visit to the United States of? America enabled him to give us first-hand information as to the latest methods adopted for the encouragement of production in that vast territory. us as to the success of some of these methods, and the desirableness of introducing them here, should cause us to give very careful consideration to his recommendations. ment of a Federal Agricultural Bureau, to which the honourable member referred, was debated at an earlier stage in the history of this Parliament. honourable member that such a bureau, properly established, would be of great service to the Commonwealth, and would do more to encourage production-and especially the I raising of products yet new to Australiathan would anything else. We should have to act in association with the States; I should not be in favour of a Federal Department of Agriculture which would duplicate the work of the States. The field operations, as well as the work of practical cultivation, subject, of course, to scientific instruction, would have to be left to the experimental stations, under the control of the States. But the results obtained in the United States furnish us with an illustration of what can be accomplished in addition to the practical work by means of a highly scientific central staff dealing with matters that are of the States is that, whilst they have experimental stations and instructors to attend to the practical work of their Departments of Agriculture, some of them are unable to deal with the higher scientific work, which requires the attention of a considerable staff fully versed in the science of agriculture. Some of the States are either unable to add such a branch to their Departments of Agriculture or to employ a sufficiently large staff of high-class officers. Eveni f they were, the position would be that we should have six separate staffs established at great cost, whereas one central staff could do the work which is not purely local, at much less expense. I think that the Commonwealth should assist the States in searching the world for trees and plants, not now growing in the Commonwealth, which would be likely to increase our productive assets, and largely benefit our producers. That would be a useful work, and the Commonwealth could His undertake it . We could introduce such trees and plants, and send them to the experimental stations throughout Australia, where the results secured in different climates and in different soils could be noted. The information he gave But, whilst the Parliament has indicated fairly strongly its desire that the Ministry should move in this direction, we find that the old method of granting bounties has been brought forward, and is to anticipate, The question of the establishat all events, a movement along the lines I have indicated. I do not think that any honourable member will say that the encouragement of the products mentioned in I quite agree with the the Bill is undesirable, but I think there will be a difference of opinion on the question of whether or not their production is more desirable than that of other things, and whether some of really greater importance have not been neglected. In the report which the Minister has furnished the House, and on which, he has informed us,, the B ill was largely framed, there are some remarks about other products, one or two of which are of even greater importance than some of those which are to be the subject of bounties. For instance, we find, in regard to the inveying from the sea-board. In this way, troduction and planting of foreign timbers, the statement that "" This might stand over for the present."" more pressing importance to the Commonwealth than the replacing of those assets which we are so extravagantly sacrificing, first of all by the restoration of our Australian timbers, and secondly, by the introduction of foreign timbers which are yielding large revenues to the people of other lands. The fact that nothing has been done in that direction is a reflection on Australia, and if the Commonwealth Parliament can do anything to remove that reflection it should do so in conjunction with the States. It is a reflection on Ausaid in the action necessary to carry out the tralia that, in the course of settlement-and policy which I suggest. But the CommonI admit that it cannot always be avoidedwe destroy large quantities of magnificent and valuable timber, and that whilst we lose that timber and part with our asset in the shape of the land, we do nothing in the direction of replanting with similar timexperiments in different places. bers other lands of little use, so' that our forests may be maintained for the use of future generations. Further than that, I think there is a vast field in Australia for the introduction of trees that have been found very valuable in other countries, and the products of which we are importing to a very large extent. instance, the corkwood of Spain a most valuable tree. cork of a similar species. cork tree grows well in gardens and planprofit for the making of packing cases, it tations in Australia, and we have, ir. varibeing hardly suitable for other use.

For instance, men who embark upon enterprises with a view of earning a bounty are not, as a rule, possessed of much capital. Those who acquire money by following agricultural pursuits generally devote their attention to the production of articles with which they are well acquainted, and in the cultivation of which they have made their money. They are very rarely prepared to enter upon experiments, particularly in tropical latitudes, for the purpose of earning a comparatively small bounty. The consequence is that the new growers who are attracted into an industry by the offer of a bounty very often find themselves in difficulties at an early stage. In the first place, they are not acquainted with the methods of production, but have to gain their knowledge from others or from books; and secondly, the methods that are successful in other countries are not always adapted to our conditions. A system of cultivation has to be adopted that is suited to our climatic and labour conditions, and to the differences in soils and seasons methods adopted here prove more successf u l than those followed elsewhere. likely, but success is often not achieved until after numerous experiments have been made and liability to failure has been overcome.

If they have all been tested, there should be no necessity for offering a bountv.

The farmers constantly say, "" You can grow the products at your farms; but that is nothing. We cannot grow them under ordinary commercial conditions.'' extent the honourable and learned member may be right. I think, however, that he will .admit that the experiments made at these stations have, in many cases, resulted in the adoption of methods which our farmers are now following with advantage. No doubt, in the first instance, the experiments conducted at the farms were carried out irrespective of the cost of production, but I think that those who are now in charge of the establishments in New South Wales, and, I presume, also in other States, recognise that they must be able not only to produce, but to produce on marketable lines. They must adopt processes which wili enable farmers not merely, to produce an article, but to produce it profitably.

Eveni f it finds its way into the pockets of those whom it is intended to benefit, it will be distributed over so many items that the result yielded will be very trifling. In other words, I claim that we shall be spending in the aggregate a very large sum without securing any sufficiently favorable result. That is my opinion. I hope that it will not prove to be correct. I should like to see the articles which are enumerated in the Bill successfully produced in Australia, and above all I should like to see them successfully produced under natural conditions. If the payment of these bounties establishes the fact that they can be produced here profitably, and that such of them as are used in our own manufactures can be produced at a cost which will not increase the price of those manufactures, I shall be gratified. ever, I fear that the results will not just if y the expenditure proposed.

I incline to the opinion that under a judicious system of bounties it is possible to achieve a great deal. The honourable member appeared to lay great emphasis upon his opinion that much more benefit would be derived from This Bill proposes the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture than can be achieved under this B ill . I do not for a moment wish to detract from the enormous advantages which would accrue to the Australian producer from a better knowledge of scientific Within a very short methods of production, but I would remind him of what happened when the If we are to pay Â£ 5 0 , 0 0 0 annually present leader of the Opposition met the States Premiers in Conference at Hobart. Upon that occasion, although he had the enthusiastic assistance of the honourable member for Gippsland, he found it impossible tor the Commonwealth to get the States into line, so far as the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture was concerned. In every instance they were opposed to it. When we recollect that the agricultural departments of the various States are spending approximately Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in educational institutions and experimental stations, all that we can reasonably hope to accomplish by putting them under a unified control is to secure the dissemination of the information which they collect throughout the length and breadth bf the Commonwealth. Although in Victoria we have some splendid agricultural establishments which are controlled by as good men as can be found in the world, the results of their work are not known to the public. This is not the first occasion upon which I have had to deprecate the methods which are adopted in governing our agricultural institutions in this State. I have not a personal knowledge of the conditions which obtain in the other States, but I do know Howwhat is being done here. We have some of the ablest men whose services it is possible to obtain, and vet, strange to say, some of .their best work is not known outside the college boundaries.

281,Mr Kennedy,"They had practicallyI wish to ascertain what is being done there I am obliged either to visit the institution or to write for the desired information. Concerning the deductions of the honourable member for North Sydney, I would point out that it is useless to urge that the necessities of the situation would be met by the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture. I look for no help in that direction for many years. In the first place, there appears to be a difficulty in getting the State Premiers into line upon a proposal of that sort. They fear an encroachment upon their State functions, and I admit freely that it is the function of the State to do everything that is possible to educate their own people in the agricultural arts and sciences. Every one of the States is doing something in that direction, but each does not know what the other is doing. To my mind, it is possible-withou t encroaching upon the sphere of the States in the slightest degree, and without creating another Department-for the Federal Government to collate all the available inforexporter, would not the position have been mation, and make it available to the public. For instance, if I required to know what is being done in the agricultural colleges of Queensland it would be idle for me to inquire at the Victorian Agricultural Department, and I venture to say that the same conditions wouldapply in Queensland to any inquirer concerning the methods adopted in Victoria. I hold that those who are prepared to embark in the new industries in connection with which, it is proposed to pay a bounty, will be materially assisted by' the aid thus offered. At any rate, I believe that it is well worth our while to incur a little risk in that connection. I have heard it stated that bounties do not always benefit those whom they are intended to benefit. For instance, that objection has been urged to the butter and the vine bonuses, which were paid in Victoria. That fact, however, is no proof that the bountv system is a bad one. Take the position in regard to the bonus granted for the establishment of the butter industry in Victoria. It has been said that the only persons who received it were the exporters. Those who make that statement forget that the regulations provided that only those who exported butter should receive the bonus. It was given specifically on the export of butter, and varied according to the price realized for that butter in the markets of the world. The maker of butter so exported could not procure the bonus on a mere certificate to the effect that he had manufactured it. I have provenby personal experience that, generally speaking, those engaged in the production of butter at the time in question received the full benefit of the system. Let me quote a concrete case. I was engaged in producing butter during the currency of the bonus, and sold to 2 proprietary company. My neighbour, who was producing a larger quantity, and could ship on his own account to Great Britain, adopted that course. I had an opportunity' cf investigating the sale papers, and found that in every instance where I sold to the proprietary company, I obtained as good a price as did my neighbour who shipped direct to London, and obtained the bonus. That is a proof that the man who produced the butter secured the benefit of the bonus. direct to the producer instead of to the improved ? Victoria was producing butter in excess of her own requirements, and the surplus was not of a standard that would enable it to hold its own in the markets of the world. Consequently, the bonus was given as an incentive to improve the standard. necessarilv to improve the quantity. butter sold in the markets of the old world at from 7d. to 9d. a bonus of one penny per lb. was paid; on that sold at from od'. to iod. a bonus of 1 Jd. was paid; on that which realized from iod. to is. a bonus of 2d. per lb. was paid; and on that above is., 3d. per lb. That was a direct incentive to the dairymen to improve the quality of their output. Although the regulations did not, and could not, provide that the bonus should be paid directly to the producer, it cannot be gainsaid that in an indirect way it went to him. It has been argued that provision should be made in the Bill for the payment of these bounties to those actually producing from the soil. That contention will not hold good. It is not necessary or essential that there should be inserted in this Bill a provision making it imperative that the bounty shall be paid direct to those who produce from the soil-that the man who produces, say,",55,Bounties Bill Second Reading
282,Mr Reid,If the bonus had been paid,56,Bounties Bill Second Reading

285,Mr Kennedy,"To do both. Ona ton of flax shall receive the bounty direct -provide d that it is paid on the production of, the fibre for manufacturing twine or cordage. Let us turn once more to the experience of Victoria. In 1890, regulations were framed providing for the payment of a bonus at the rate of Â£ 2 per acre for the cultivation of vines and frui t trees, and even for the planting of forest trees. I have heard it said that men actually planted vines and frui t trees for the sake of securing the bonus, assuming that there would be a profit on the transaction. That was an absurd view of the position, since the bonus was only payable in instalments! extending over three years. As a matter of fact, many of those who planted orchards and vineyards found that the ordinary rental value of the land when used for grazing purposes was in excess of the bonus. The mistake was in failing to make provision for dealing with the produce of the vines and frui t trees when they came into bearing. In the northern districts, where advantage was taken ot this bonus, many men, who had no knowledge of the manufacture of wine, and had to rely solely upon the guidance of the experts of the State Department of Agriculture, brought their vineyards to such a degree of perfection that they secured splendid yields, but had no market for their grapes. The small growers did not think it judicious to incur the expenditure necessary in setting up a wir.e-making plant. ledge of the work. position was the same with regard to the orehardists. They had the fruit, but had no market for it. The small growers had not the knowledge, or the means, to enable them to manufacture wine from the grapes, and what was necessary was the establishment -of wineries, where they could sell their croo, and a standard wine could be produced. The orehardists found in many cases that they had a splendid yield of frui t from selected trees, but they were not in a position to pulp or can that fruit, ancl there were no factories where that work could be carried out. The result was that the money paid in the shape of the bonus was wasted. Some men maintained their plantations for five or six years, and then realized that they could do better bydevoting their land once more to grazing purposes. In these circumstances, it must be recognised that it is not essential to provide that a bounty shall be payable to the man who actually raises any of these products. We should take care to provide, however, that means shall be adbpted by which the growers will be able to follow up their products-eithe r by co-operation or otherwise-unti l they reach a manufactured state. So far, we have not given much attention to the minor products that may be considered to be a source of wealth. We have not far to seek for the reason. In the early days the land was devoted to pastoral purposes, and the man who.thought .of going on the soil desired to obtain a run. of Â£2 per acre From that we went by easy stages to wheat field areas, and, except in isolated cases, we have not yet got away from the system of having large wheat-fields and dairyherds. Asa producing community we give little attention to intense culture. The tendency to-day, however, is to develop cultivation on small holdings, and those who have been looking on recognise that an evolution is taking place. Take, for instance, the cultivation of flax, which is to form the subject of a bounty. In Great Britain and Ireland to-day farmers practically pull the plant by hand. That is an expensive process, and could not be adopted here. After pulling the flax they put it up in sheaves, and, in order that the fibre may be extracted from the woody pulp, they ret, steep, and dry it before it goes to the breakers, and then to the scutchers. We have revolutionized that process^ in Australia, and have proved that flax can And many had no knowbe successfully grown by ordinary farmers. This! is one of the advantages derived from the association of experts with the Department of Agriculture. It has been found' that a farmer can cut his flax with a reaper and binder, and sheave it just as wheat would be sheaved. The latest scientific achievement is such that, instead of the process of retting, steeping, and drying occupying weeks, the flax can be placed in the breaking machine within twenty-four hours of its cutting. This proves that we are keeping pace with the times. A few enterprising men, finding that old-world conditions could not be observed here if they were to make a success of thc industry, persevered under the direction of the experts, and, applying their intelligence to the undertaking, secured satisfactory results. Strange to say-and I think it i's the result of environment-the average farmer or dairyman here is slow to take up anything new'in the way of production; but",56,Bounties Bill Second Reading

Thea gradual transition from large to small holdings is going on, and those taking up the latter are prepared toenter upon the cultivation of products practically new to Australia, when it can be shown that they can be successfully grown. According to the information disclosed in the papers, very tempting results can be obtained from other products. statements require careful analysis. In regard to some of the productions mentioned, as, for instance, the production of canned fish', r have no knowledge, and have had no opportunity to read up the subject. there are industries which I am confident could be made a source of great wealth to Australia, if a little assistance were given by the Commonwealth, not only financially, but also educationally, to induce people to embark in them. We know that many of those whose avocations keep them within the densely populated areas, are sending their children to the agricultural colleges, and, when opportunity offers to obtain land under reasonable conditions, are assisting their lads to settle in the country. These youths have enormous advantages, if their position is compared with that of the men who, thirty or forty years ago, were combating the difficulties of agricultural and pastoral settlement. lose any opportunity to assist them, and to further the movement to which I refer. If an opportunity offers to co-operate with the States, by all means let us take advantage of it. It is not necessary to wait until we can establish an expensive Department of Agriculture, before doing something in the way of collecting information regarding the experiments of enthusiasts, and making it available in the different centres of popuour land is subdivided into a greater numlation. That work might be done by some of the officials wbo are already in our employment. It is the duty of the Commonwealth, as well as of the States Governments, to do all that can be done to increase production. settled on the land has to put up with some disadvantages, my opinion is that, on the whole, he is much better off than are the dwellers in cities, while those who are producing wealth from the soil are performing work which is of enormous value to the community. enormous areas which are practically unsettled, and the so-called settled areas do not produce half as much as they should. On the seaboard of Victoria, there are districts in which 100 acres should support a family, but where for miles there are nothing but sheep, although there are men unemployed, and in want of land.. In southern New South Wales and the northern parts of Victoria, it is a joy to live, and the sunshine will keep one alive, and none of the hardships have to be faced which are met with in other parts of the world where But these the climate is trying, A neighbour of mine, a few years ago, went to Canada. He had been reared on the Murray, in New South Wales, and had an intimate knowledge of the conditions under which agriculBut tural and pastoral pursuits were carried on there. But after a visit to Canada, during which he was not content to hurry through the country in an express train, or a. fast coach, but spent two harvests there, he thought that it was the paradise of the farmer. Now, however, he is back in Australia again, and has put it on record that he would sooner follow a team on the worse road in New South Wales than be a farmer in Canada. The Canadian climate makes the life of a farmer in that country much harder than it is here, while he estimates that a man who wished to cultivate 500 acres of wheat there would have to embark twice .as much money in stock and plant as would be necessary to carry out the same operation in the But we should not northern parts of Victoria or the southern parts of New South Wales. I do nof think that we can employ our population more profitably and to greater advantage, from a health point of view, than in settling them upon the soil. The concentration of population in large centres is due, to some extent, to the increased manufacture of mechanical contrivances to ' aid the. agriculturist, and will be reduced only as ber of holdings. I have a knowledge of farming extending back twenty-five or twenty-seven years, and I say, without fear of successful contradiction, that, with the mechanical contrivancesnow possessed by Although the man who is the agriculturist, one man can to-day grow more wheat than ten men could then. Some of the labour which has been displaced is, no doubt, used in manufacturing the mechanical contrivances of which I speak, but there must be a further subdivision of land, and more intense culture, if we are Australia, however, has to give employment on the soil to all who should be there. able member going to bring that about? progressive land tax.",57,Bounties Bill Second Reading

Victoria and in New South Wales, and, no doubt, in the other States, where the climate is a moist one, and where land which should be worth from Â£ 3 0 to Â£4.0 per acre is not producing a return making its capital value equal to Â£ 5 or jÂ£6 an acre. A great deal more could be done in the direction of intense culture. Many years ago I travelled down the Murray, over what was practically desert country, when one was fortunate if he met a boundary rider between station and station during the day's travel; but, now that Mildura has been established, from 10,000 to 12,000 acres of that country is supporting a population of about 4,000 people in a state of comparative comfort. Many mistakes have been made at Mildura, and much money squandered there, not for want of intelligence or ability, but for want of knowledge of the local conditions. The results achieved, however, justify the expense. Before the application of water to that land, and the use of mechanical contrivances for its cultivation, it would not maintain 4,000 rabbits. ber suggest that the B ill provides for the establishment of irrigation works ? out that, in many places where now four or five acres of land support only a bullock, giving a return to the owner of, perhaps, Â£ 2 per annum, the return would be something like Â£ 4 0 per annum if a crop like flax were grown. Part of that sum would be spent upon labour where practically no labour-is now employed. Then, although we have not many great rivers, we have a considerable area of land close to watercourses which is well adapted for the growing of rice, and it is the opinion of experts that, by the application of water to it, rice could be grown in great quantities. be grown ? to say; but we have the opinion of a specialist that it could be grown to perfection on the Murray, north-west of Echuca, if proper soil were selected and water applied. The Bill will have my hearty support. I do not say that I shall vote for all its proposals, because upon the probable T h is is a Bill for the payeffect of some of them. I am not' yet in as position to give an opinion. the growing of wheat or the growing of' rice ? There are districts in rice, but the information is that the returnsper acre from rice are greater than those: from wheat, though, of course, the cost of production is more, since rice cannot begrown unless water is applied to the land. You would have to know exactly the cost of the application of the water to the soil. WhatI desire to say is that there is alwaysa tendency when we want a specialist to get some one of whom we know nothing, and* whose experience has been gained under conditions entirely different from our own.. No one knows better than the Prime Minister what enormous losses have been in curred by enterprising men who have comehere in the possession of knowledge of great value as applied to other conditions, but who, when they have attempted to adapt themselves to our circumstances, have miserably failed. That was the result at M i l dura. If we had looked the world over Ave could not have selected men who werebetter equipped with knowledge, intelligence, and ability than the Messrs. Chaffey Brothers, who embarked upon the Milduraenterprise. Australians owe a great deal tothese men. Notwithstanding anything that may be said to the contrary, Mildura stands as a monument to their enterprise a.nd> No . I am pointing ability, and, although they lost their time and money, Australia is to-day reaping the reward of their energy.

No doubt the experts put into this Bill a solemn proposal to include chicory, when, as a matter of fact, all tlie chicory which is consumed in Australia has for years past been produced locally. A similar mistake was made in the Manufactures Encouragement Bill in connection with the production of zinc. In that measure it was proposed to expend Â£ 1 2 , 5 0 0 by way of bounty to encourage the production of spelter, when, as a matter of fact, the wealthy BrokenH ill Proprietary Company had already solved the problem, without the aid of a bonus, and was actually engaged in exporting zinc. passed that measure, the richest proprietary company in Australia Avould have been presented with Â£ 1 2 , 5 0 0 for doing something which it 'bad accomplished years before. Now we find that the item of chicory has been eliminated from the Government proposals, although we are still confronted Avith pandanus and some other articles.

WhatI do like about the Bill is that it recognises one of the great Avants of Australia, at the present time, and that it makes an endeavour to attract enterprise, industry, and settlement from the towns into the country. The honourable member for Moira has pointed out that one of the gravest evils from which Ave suffer is that enormous estates, held by a few individuals, make national development impossible.

The Vice-Presiit is intended to take power to reduce any bounty. It would not be right to offer a bounty, and then for the Governor General, after people of enterprise had competed for it, to reduce the amount. I may sav. however, that I do not propose to offer any opposition to this B ill, and my earnest hope is that it will lead to the establishment of some of the industries to which it relates. If as the result of it any one OT two of them are established D o e s the provision the Bill will have done a great deal of good. It has one good feature, which I wish to acknowledge. In some cases Bounties Bills have provided for the payment of a bounty on the production of a certain quantity of a given article. For instance, a Bill passed by the Victorian Legislature provided for the payment of a bounty on 5,000 yards of worsted locally produced. I understand that the 5,000 yards were produced, that the bountv was paid, and that nothing more was heard of the local production of worsted. ing out that one of the commendable feaN o ; supposing the tures of this Bill is that the bounty in of years.",63,Bounties Bill Second Reading

I might say fhat that is quite the usual state of affairs. at 10.30, has made his first appearance since the dinner hour. Chamber far more frequently than has the honourable.member during this session. He has been conspicuous by his absence since the election of Chairman. honourable members who attend regularly to judge whether there is the slightest truth in that statement. I should not have devoted the slightest attention to the honorthe best judges as to what methods able and learned member but for his intrusion into a matter with regard to which he was not competent to speak. The leader of the Opposition spoke from quite a Socialistic stand-point when discussing the Bill, because his complaint was that fhe matter had not been dealt with upon the principle of State control. whole time he was discussing the item, and carping at the amount set down for the encouragement of the respective industries, he argued as if a series of Government farms were to be established for the cultiducements to capable men who have been vation of the enumerated produots. ment farms. gentleman spoke of the proposed bounties as being utterly inadequate to secure the establishment of the industries. I would point out, however, that it is not expected .the Commonwealth, opportunities for testthat the industries will be established by the outlay of the amount set down in the Bill. merely for the encouragement of industries, and should have the'. strongest support of the Opposition, because they are intended to aid individual effort. The Bill represents merely a small beginning, and I think it is desirable that we should begin in a small way. The leader of the Opposition referred to the disastrous effects that had followed the granting of large bounties in Victoria and Queensland, and I think that, by encouraging small individual effort, we shall accomplish very much more than has hitherto been achieved. For this reason, I entirely disagree with the leader of the Opposition. North Sydney spoke of the necessity for doing something in the direction of reafforesting the country. No State has suffered more than has Victoria from the devastation of valuable forests. I am glad, however, to say that work in the direction of reafforesting is now being carried on and that, within the next five years, a veryconsiderable area of country that has been denuded of trees will again be producing valuable timber. The leader of the Opposition referred 'to the desire of certain honourable members to secure public appointments for Australians, and he specially criticised the remarks of the honourable member for Moira. I believe that we cannot do better than study an industry on the spot, and that those who have been born and bred amongst us ought to be of cultivation are best adapted to our conditions. I have never been opposed lo the introduction of experts from abroad when we have not had the necessary material amongst us from which to make a proper selection. I think that it is desirable, insuch cases, to bring experts from abroad, During the and to make them Australians. That is one of the reasons why I hope that, at no distant date, the Commonwealth will be able to act upon the advice of the President of the United States, and offer intrained in the higher forms of certain cultivation to come here and utilize our soils, some of which are undoubtedly eminently' suitable for raising products such as we desire to encourage. We have had here in Australia, and especially in Victoria, where the genius for invention has been stimulated to a higher degree than in other parts of ing the capacity of our own people to carryon such work as that contemplated in the The bounties are to be granted Bill. It was an unknown farmer who invented the stump-jumping plough which subdued the Mallee, and added a new province to the State of Victoria. very familiar. familiarity has not brought it into the contempt of the honourable member. We have men in Australia who are capable of meeting all our requirements in regard to 'he cultivation of the land. I might refer to the inventor of the Wolesley sheep shearing machine, and also to that bete noir of the The honourable member for other side, the complete harvester, which is also an Australian invention.",66,Bounties Bill Second Reading
