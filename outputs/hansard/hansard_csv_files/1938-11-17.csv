McEWEN -Replying to the last part of the question first, I cannot say that the time has arrived when the Commonwealth Government should do something to prevent the mass entry of aliens to Australia, because there is no mass entry. The position .is, that no alien may come to Australia without firsthaving, as an individual, secured a permit to do so. proportion of aliens who secure permits and come to this country are dependent relatives of aliens who previously had secured permits, had come to Australia, and had established themselves in this country. The fact that numerous southern European aliens, who, as individuals, have secured permits, choose to come in a vessel belonging to an Italian line is perhaps natural, as they are voyaging from the Mediterranean. I intimate details of the case mentioned by the honourable member, but I shall have inquiries made and if there are any particular features associated with it I shall constructing dips for cattle in spite of give it special consideration.

I have received from the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose, of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The standardization of railway gauges "". Five honourable members having risen 'tn support of the motion, [3.6] I move That the House do now adjourn. The standardization of railway gauges as generally understood in Australia is covered by a report of a royal commission presented in 1921. The report was made after lengthy and careful investigation, and the commission recommended the construction of a trunk railway line of 4-ft. S^-in. gauge from Brisbane to Perth, and the conversion of the Victorian and South Australian railways of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge to the standard gauge of 4-ft. 8J-in. I regret that it has become necessary to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of drawing Senator public attention to the . failure of the Government to give effect to the promise of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) in 1934 that this work would be undertaken as one of its major schemes for the relief of unemployment. It would give far greater satisfaction, I feel sure, to all sections of the House to know that the Government had taken action that would have made such a step unnecessary. The reason for the neglect appears to be the complete incapacity of the Government to carry out its promise, whatever might have been its intention or desire at the time the promise was made. An examination of the report of debates, and replies to questions asked by myself and other honourable members, will show that responsible Ministers, including the Prime Minister, have persistently endeavoured to evade the' issue, instead of facing their responsibilities.

63,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),"policy of the Prime Minister, have, in the main, allowed the matter to slip, apparently viewing it as one that will provide another attractive piece of window dressing for the United Australia party and the Country party when the next elections are approaching. The honorahle member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr), who is not at present in the House, the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), and others on'that side of the House, have signified their approval of the proposal to standardize railway gauges, but they did not stand up to support this motion. of thing disgusts most people. They profess to believe in this very necessary undertaking, hut they are.not prepared to support a motion to discuss it with their votes. When* the Government has been criticized for its failure to get on with the work Ministers have sought to divert attention, or to sidetrack criticism, by referring to the lack of co-operation among the States, or by talking about what the Labour Government did or did not do. Excuses of that kind only earn the derision of the people. The Scullin Government was in office for two years during the worse economic depression in the history of Australia, whereas the Lyons-Page Government has been in power during a period of comparative prosperity. No intelligent person will be deceived by an attempt to compare what was done during the two periods. The Government cannot put forward any legitimate excuse for the delay, but no doubt will claim again that it has not had the co-operation of the States and that, as the railways are, for the most part, State owned, the responsibility for the failure rests rather with the States than with the Commonwealth. Let us further examine the Governsystem to another. Apart from the delay, ment's . promises. * Standardization of inconvenience railway gauges was not only put forward due to the varying capacity of trains of differat the election in 1934 by the Government ent gauge is serious and may mean considerable as one of its major schemes by the carrydelay at a critical time. ing out of which it. proposed to meet the unemployment problem, but also it was The Government talks about defence but part of the Governor General's speech at with full power to do so, makes no prothe opening of the newly elected vision to deal with an essential part of Parliament in October of that year. After it. We have never had an indication setting out .that the Government would that the Government is considering this survey the unemployment problem matter except a statement that there is through the agency of the then Minister for Commerce( Sir Frederick Stewart), and that the major portion of his labours would be directed to what was designated as "" the great problem"", the Governor General's speech said that the honourable gentleman would be relieved of much of his work so that he could direct attention to principal matters. It made reference to the selection and preparation of works of size and importance that could be done by the Commonwealth (a) alone, and (&) in collaboration with the States. That kind This is not one of the matters which can be side-tracked by suggestion of insuperable political difficulties, for not only are the Government's supporters committed by the Prime Minister's promise but also the Opposition is committed to it by its own platform and its leader's election policy speech. It was the first-mentioned work of major importance in the speech of the Prime Minister. Even in 1931 it was referred to by each of the party leaders as a necessary work that should be undertaken. The Inspector-General of the Military Forces of whose official opinion at a time like this when the Government is asking Parliament to authorize the expenditure of more and more millions of pounds on defence, every one should take notice, said in 1921The linking up of our capital cities byrailways, beyond striking, distance from the coast and the establishment of a uniform gauge throughout the Commonwealth are matters of paramount importance. ' "" Paramount importance "" ! I emphasize that. In 1923 he s a i d It is beyond question that a uniform gauge will avoid many of the disadvantages of possible troop movements caused by breaks of gauge with the necessary transfer from one and the wastage of man-power at transfer stations, the disorganization of units Io be a conference of Ministers of Transport some time in the new year. The same expert said in 1925The disabilities under which Australia is suffering on account of tlie breaks of gauge in its civil transportation, and the difficulties zation of railway gauges:which would lie imposed upon military transportation in war, nre generally recognized and it is regrettable that the production of a practical scheme to remedy the matter has been so long delayed. .In these circumstances it is necessary to look elsewhere for the reason for failure to proceed. The only conclusion which can be reasonably arrived at is incapacity which arises from the elements of which the Government is. composed. There are other promises which it has failed to f u l fil or even to make an attempt at f u l f ill the new year. This Parliament after ing, but its failure to give effect to its promise to bring about the standardization of the railway gauges is particularly glaring because of the urgency of the work as nn essential measure in making provision for the defence of Australia. in authority, including highly-placed military experts, who have made it clear that the standardization of gauges is an integral part of any scheme of nation-wide defence. These range from Lord Kitchener, who i u 1911 made reference to the disadvantages of breaks of gauge in military operations, to the Australian Inspector-General of M i l it a r y Porces who on three successive occasions emphasized the need for the problem to be dealt with in the interests of Australia's proper protection. Who are the military authorities"" who now say that it is unnecessary to standardize gauges? The Prime Minister said on Monday that it was not necessary to proceed with the work. W ill the Government disclose the identity of these experts who hide in official dugouts and either w ill not, or are not permitted to, have their qualifications and information tested? Minister and other Ministers when questions have been asked have side-stepped the issue by assurances that the matter was under consideration or that it was to be the subject o.f a conference. At the Premiers Conference, held in Adelaide in August, 1936, the amount of consideration received can be estimated from the fact that twelve lines of space is given to Ifr. Drakeford, it in a report of approximately 12,000 lines, covering S3 pages. It reads:STANiuanizATioir OP RAILWAY GAUGES. report of the sub-committee on tlie standardiIn view of the progress which has been made in road and air transport, this committee considers that, before any decision is arrived at with respect to standardization of railway gauges, a further inquiry by a competent body should be made, having special reference to the economic and defence uspects. Report adopted. The latest reply given on the matter by the Prime Minister is that it is to be the subject of consideration at a conference on transport matters early in approving of an expenditure of £43,000,000 in the next three years is now being asked to commit itself to further heavy expenditure on defence, and the public mind is being prepared with suitable propaganda based on fears the There are many people real cause of which, if any, has beeu kept from the knowledge of the elected representatives of tbe people. I know nothing of what the real cause is for the expenditure of this additional money on defence, but if it is necessary because an attack on our territory is feared^ some thing practical should be done to enable us to move troops with facility to points of danger. No t one word has been said by the Government so f a r on the question of standardizing the gauges, either out of the £43,000,000 for 'the three-year programme or the special vote which is to supplement it . The Prime Minister at the opening of the connection link of 56 miles, between Port Pirie and Port Augusta said:The new route was constructed as a result of the joint efforts of the State and Federal Governments and indicated that when the The Prime interests of Australia as a whole were involved, governments could act unitedly for the common good. The Prime Minister's election speech presented the Government's policy for the interests of Australia as a whole. It included the standardization of gauges and the Government demonstrated its capacity to handle the job, a major which this subject one at that, involving 6,450 miles of railway, by completing in four years 566 miles of line, at the rate",19,Standardization Of Railwa Y Gauges Formal Motion For Adjournment
64,Mr Patersoni Present The Following,"of 14 miles ii year. What an effort! At that rate of progress it would take 460 years to complete the job. Yet that is all this Government is capable of doing. I must confess that when I listened to the Prime Minister who had just returned from his triumphal overseas visit, speak so enthusiastically of the Government's gratification, and indicate its hopes for the future, and AvhenI heard at the banquet provided that night at Port Pirie the carefully prepared speeches which were delivered by the then Postmaster-General (Senator A. J. McLachlan.) and the then Minister for although driven to calculation of figures as to the rate of progress since the royal commission had made its report, I , too, felt a spark of hope that a rejuvenated Prime Minister was at last about to get his Government into action. My hope, like that of many others who listened, was dashed to smithereens on the altar of the Government's irresolution, incapacity and reliance on conferences. -On the 22nd October, 1937, I asked the would have to be faced some time.

The Prime Minister repliedThe matter will receive the consideration article:of the Government. That is the end of it. It has been forgotten ever since. The honourable member for Flinders and others have since that time commented on the need for examination of expenditure on defence by a parliamentary committee. It will probably be under consideration when the Government finally falls to pieces; signs of its disintegration were very apparent recently and are obvious now. ""Under consideration,"" or ""on the agenda for discussion by a conference,"" or "" the matter will be inquired into "" are the refuges in which the Government shelters itself when confronted with the need for going into action. It spends the intervening periods in devising ways and means of reconciling the divergent views of its polyglot components sufficiently to enable it to carry on the policy of shutting up Parliament while its leaders make overseas visits and return with some new display of showy propaganda which will divert attention from its otherwise conspicuous failures. Although the matter is one which, until recently, received only occasional publicity in the daily press-wit h the exception of the Melbourne Age, which has the Interior( Mr Paterson), ably and consistently -advocated it over a period of years-the press is now almost unanimous in advocating that this work should be commenced without further delay. If time permitted, I would quote from many recent articles, but as it does not, I shall make only a few quotations. As far back as 1924, the then Prime Minister of the same sort of government as that which now exists, Mr Bruce, speaking at Lithgow on the subject of a standardized railway gauge throughout Australia, declared that the problem must have had in mind a governmentthey face urgent matters at He went on to say that by the people; if they heavier."" The Melbourne Age made the following statement in a leading It is obvious that a uniform trunk line would be of incalculable value in time of national emergency. It should be ranked as an absolute necessity. . . . A uniform gauge is a sound productive investment in peace, an imperative needoto f u l l efficiency in war. On the 15th October last, the Age published the following comment:In view of the great practical value oi unification to Australia, it is not unreasonable to suggest that half the cost be met by the Commonwealth, which would leave £1.500,000 a year divided between the live mainland States. From a defence point of view the value of the railway network cannot he overemphasized. The main highways have not been built to carry heavy military loads, and even now require continual maintenance. . I u the last six years Victoria has spent iu unemployed relief works sufficient money fo have converted the gauges in Australia to the standard of 4 f t . 84 in. On tlie IS t h October last, the A r g u s published the f o l l o w in g : One outstanding problem that has not been faced-probabl y because it seems formidable W h a t a commentary on the Government t h a t it cannot face a n y t h in g because it seems for m i d a b l e !

I doubt whether men of courage to i m plement n a t i o n a l policy are to he f o u n d in the ranks of the Government. q u o t a t i o n concludesAnd in view of the time the completion of the practical work will occupy, itmust be faced now. . . . Onr great highways are magnificent for the motorist; with caterpillar traction, necessary for the transport of heavy military material, they would be crushed to pulp and powder within a few weeks. Only on steel rails laid upon substantial foundations could these great burdens be carried. The railways must be used for that purpose. They cannot be used as they are to-day, because many arc single-track for long distances. Thu incidental advantages of embarking upon the undertaking now include the absorption of the unemployed, tlie provision of work for newcomers (assuming that the policy of encouraging immigration is to be put into immediate operation) and the stimulus which it would give to general development. The direct effect of developmental works upon our ability to defend Australia should not be overlooked. For these reasons, this great enterprise is desirable; for effectual defence, it is necessary. These are people who have been giving the matter consideration over a long period of years. They now realize that if the Government undertakes further expenditure without tackling this great work, it will not be facing up to the situation. The Melbourne Herald^ on the 29th October last, published the following:The unsuitability of existing tary traffic is one of the aspects for serious review. Bridges and culverts have been constructed for light traffic aud road formations are unsuitable heavily-laden vehicles. ing the normal traffic diverted from the sea to the land intensified by the heavy demands of wartime would fall on the railways. have been designed to carry freight within the States to the capital cities, but not for the conveyance o.f large volumes of traffic across Mr Drakeford. the borders. . . ."" The ueod for the unification has been stressed by the highest railway authorities in Great Britain recently. I realize that the time available to me to make these quotations is limited; but I think that I ought to quote some recent remarks of Lord Oraigmyle, chairman of the Peninsula and Oriental shipping group, and also a director of the Bank of England. He statedI f you could only have a uniform gauge, say of 4 feet 84 inches throughout the conI t must be tinent I am sure it would be a great help to Courageous men must be found to commerce in Australia. A t first, of course, it would be to the disadvantage of shipping, but I think that in the long run it would be in the interests of shipping companies trading to Australia, because the prosperity of shipping to Australia depends on the prosperity of The Australia. No doubt the provision of a uniform gauge would cost millions of pounds, but I can think of no better investment. Nothing is so calculated to hold up the progress of Australian industry as the continuation of the present system of varied gauges. I am looking forward to having a talk on the subject with Lord Stamp, who is at present in Australia and is one of my colleagues on tbe Board of the Bank of England. There are other quotations which time will not permit me to make. They all go to show that the newspapers have now reached the stage of being practically unanimous in their approval of the scheme. The Government, by sitting with its head buried in the sand and refusing to tackle this problem, while asking this Parliament to vote millions of pounds for other works, is doing rank injustice to the whole of the people of Australia. [Leave to continue given.] I thank honourable members for giving me the opportunity to discuss the matter further and to quote the following from another article published in the Argus of a recent date, headed "" The Nation's Need ""It goes without saying that the most useful first step in such an expansion is to undertake public works of a character that will facilitate national defence, such as the unifiroads for milication of railway gauges. To embark on such projects requires a far-sighted and courageous financial policya policy of casting bread upon the waters in the confidence that it w ill for continuous streams of return after many days. Many big problems The problem of movare interwoven in the one transcendant problem of making Australia safe from external aggression.' For their solution they call for These big men With big ideas. The Melbourne He r a l d on the 10th November last published the following contribution by a political correspondent, presumably from CanberraThat old political plaything, standardization which have no relation to tlie accepted of at least Interstate railway gauges, should be given a swift and final survey. It should then be decided upon and carried through. The fullest employment of our workers must all through be a first principle. Indeed the whole defensive project would almost justify itself if it got rid of the very wasteful and expensive fag-end of relief work upon hole and corner shows, which as a rule contribute neither to defence nor to anything else. It concluded with the following:The latest administration has not had an auspicious opening. But it is not yet doomed, if it will boldly and spaciously lead, the Paran obligation on the people of New liamentary parties and Australia as a whole will gladly follow. The Argus on the l l t h November last published the following: The seeming inability of federal Ministers to see the relation of developmental works to defence prcparutions is very disconcerting. It does not appear tliat any serious consideration has been given to the question of railway gauges. That is how the matter strikes everybody. The Government promises, but does not appear even to give consideration to the fulfilment of its promise. It boasts of its accomplishment in connection with the .Port Pirie to Port Augusta section. If that rate of progress be continued in relation to the balance of the standardization project the work w ill not be completed before we are all mummies. Honourable members who sit behind the Government do not attempt to stir it to action in matters which they know ought to be tackled. I continue the quotationYet the relation of rail transport to military measures is close and obvious. Mobility is not in the motto of the Ministry. To make railway communication efficient and rapid is a real military measure, and one of the highest importance. The bitumen-surfaced highways would break like pie crust beneath the loads of military material which it would be necessary to move from point to point if we were at war. Such changes in the railway system should be undertaken at the earliest moment. If the altered system never carries a gun, the work will Temain as something permanently usefula national asset, as Mr apparent, that their interests have been Dunstan would call it. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane), by interjection, has referred to New South ""Wales. That State's share of the work has already been done. Apparently there are people in New South Wales who do not wish the whole project to be completed, and put forward new schemes involving millions of pounds scheme. I venture to affirm that New South Wales would derive considerable benefit from the prosecution of the balance of the work on the original plan. In it are situated the steel works, which would produce such things as axles, points, crossings, rails, girders and other materials required. Queensland and Tasmania, would benefit, because they would assist in supplying the necessary timber. In any case, there is South Wales to see that other States obtain their share of the work, particularly as national security is involved. The Government appears to be able to stand up, or lay down, to a good deal of deadly criticism, and yet continue on its sleepy and inefficient way. A t no time previously has there been such unanimity as there is now amongst the leading newspapers of Australia in regard to the urgent need to proceed with this work. Public opinion has at last been aroused in such a way that the Government's hesitancy and incapacity stand out in bold relief. Nothing hue a bold, even if a belated, effort w ill convince the country that the Government has either the will or the constructive energy needed to handle the project. In to-day's Canberra Times appears a report which should make clear the position which the railways occupy in relation to interstate traffic. Sir BiagnaT Colvin, First Naval Member, is reported as having said that, for every 1 ton of produce carried on the railways, 16 tons are carried on ships between Australian ports. While the breaks of gauge continue to exist, this state of affairs will operate, to the great advantage of the wealthy private shipping companies, and to the disadvantage of the Government-owned railway systems. The financial groups exert considerable influence, and it is utilized with a view to preventing the consummation of the scheme to the point where it could be seen that Australia is almost disastrously situated should it be called upon to transport troops for defence. purposes. I repeat and emphasize that, although the New South Wales and Queensland portions of the scheme recommended by the royal commission have been completed, both of those States would benefit from the further prosecution of the scheme, particularly New South Wales, because of the fact that the iron and steel industry is situated within its boundaries. Employment would be stimulated from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, and we should not have to ask for Christmab grants for -the unemployed from a government which is unable to visualize and undertake a big project. The issuing of new money would not be necessary. More than sufficient has been expended in each period of seven years since the royal commission presented its report, to cover the cost of the scheme. seven years, no less than £30,000,000 was expended on the railways of Australia, in connection with rolling-stock and other requirements. The scheme could have been completed for less than that. that expenditure? wbole. I shall take an opportunity during the budget debate to give full particuobtained the almost entirely unanimous lars to the honourable member, who apparently needs stimulating, because he knows nothing about the subject. I conclude by saying that honourable members have the opportunity in this debate to express their views regarding the need for proceeding with a generally accepted plan, and of urging this jaded custodian of the people's authority into some semblance of activity. that, although the Standing Orders prescribe a time limit for the debate, private members will regard the subject as of such importance as to warrant an extension of the time, so that expression may be given to the feelings of both Government and Opposition members on a matter which cannot longer be neglected with safety, and which is of paramount importance to the citizens of Australia. I draw attention to the absence from the chamber of Ministers'and ministerial members. If we were debating a proposition from which they might derive an advantage they would be in attendance as they were yesterday during the discussion on the Ministers of State Bill, but as the matter is one concerning the benefit of the people they are absent from their places in this House. They know that the charges I am making cannot be satisfactorily answered. They realize quite well that they have neglected to fulfil the promise made to the people, and they prefer to Leave one Minister to carry on the debate. No matter is of greater public importance, and nothing would be of more benefit to the nation at the present time than the standardization of the railway gauges. No doubt ministerial members are in their party-room trying to patch up the ever-growing differences that exist in their ranks. I trust that they will indicate to the Government that it must proceed with this work, which is useful in peace time as well as for In the last defence. The result could not fail to be of real advantage to the whole of the people of Australia. MT. McEWEN (Indi-Minister for tbe Interior) [3.35] -The subject brought under our notice by the honourable member fov Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) is of the highest national importance, and his decision to discuss it would have approval of the House had he not seen fit, unfortunately, to reduce the issues involved to the level of the most paltry party politics. In doing so, the honourable gentleman did a great disservice to the cause he has espoused. However, I do not propose to take my cue from him. I shall endeavour to discuss the subject apart altogether from party political I trust controversy, and perhaps my best course would be to recount the history of it. The standardization of the railway gauges of Australia has been considered by practically every Commonwealth Parliament for many years. AfterI have dealt with the historical background, I shall indicate what the Government proposes to do in the immediate future. Probably this will be the last opportunity that an honourable member will have to raise the issue as the honourable member for Maribyrnong has raised it this afternoon, for the Government intends to call a conference of Ministers of Transport of the various states early in the new year, and to submit to it various proposals, first and foremost of which will have relation to the. standardization of our railway gauges.

76,Mr Mcewen,"No. The apportionThis estimate was reviewed by the Federal Government and the State governments were advised that the Commonwealth re-affirmed the 1921 proposals and was still willing to pay one-fifth of the cost. The matter was listed for discussion at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in February, 1930; but the item was adjourned for consideration by a subsequent conference. During the remainder of the life of the Commonwealth Government of the day no subsequent conference was held. Since the estimate was revised by the Railways Commissioners in 1929, there has been a reduction of the basic wage under industrial awards, &c. The works would be carried out in the States of Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria, and in those States the basic wage now shows reductions on those applying when the revised estimate was prepared in 1929, as follows:Reduction compared State. This position must affect the flow State. Per cent. Western Australia C.8 South Australia Victoria The reductions would not apply in the same degree to the skilled workers receiving wages above the base rate, but in any case they would be substantial. In addition to the reduction of wages referred to, there has been a reduction of the prices of materials since the 1929 estimate was prepared. It is estimated that labour charges on the actual work can betaken as representing approximately 50 per cent, of the total expenditure, although actually there would be a much greater percentage of expenditure on labour, because nearly all expenditure on sleeper supplies is labour, as also is the greater portion of the expenditure on rails and fastenings. As practically the whole of the materials to be used would be of Australian manufacture, wages would form a very large proportion of all expenditure. these facts it will be seen that in the past the Commonwealth has not only accepted responsibility for a substantial share of the cost of the standardization of gauges, but also has done everything possible to advance the matter to a practical conclusion, in agreement with the States. Unanimity among the States, however, was not achieved, and the responsibility for the non-completion of the standardization of gauges, a3 recommended by the royal eommission in 1921, does not therefore rest with the Commonwealth. Another matter which should be referred to while this issue is under consideration is that of through railway freights. At present it is often cheaper to rail goods from districts adjacent to State boundaries for a longer distance to the capital of the producing State than to rail them the shorter distance to the capital of the neighbouring State. [Leave to continue given.] This is due to each State charging' its local rate as for a separate journey to and from the border for interstate traffic, instead of one continuous mileage rate on the tapering principle for the total distance being charged, as would be done for a journey of a similar total mileage within the with 1929. of certain goods traffic such as grain, wool and livestock, to the nearest port, as well 14.2"" as increase costs to primary producers 13.0 and entail the haulage of traffic over longer distances than that to the nearest port. Passenger fares and parcels rates are similarly charged. The areas principally affected by this unfortunate discrimination in respect of border rates areDistriot-States affected.

There are certain exceptions where special competitive through goods and parcels rates, local special goods rates, and special through dntercapital fares From are provided to meet competition by sea and road; but generally speaking, this unfortunate discrimination in respect of border rates exists, and is a very serious factor. An exhaustive analysis of the whole of the intersystem goods and livestock traffic in Australia for the year ended the 31st December, 1922, which occupied",28,Annual Expenditure Over A Period Of Eight Years Based On Commonwealth Accepting
77,Mr Mceioen.,"twelve months and cost £10,000, was made by the Australian railways commissioners. This analysis was made in order to ascertain the effect on railway revenue and freight charges to the public by the introduction of through-rating for goods and livestock traffic. The Australian railways commissioners refused, on account of the adverse effect on railway finances, to introduce the system of through rating. It was contended that a uniform system of rating, without regard to State boundaries, would tend to the gravitation of traffic to the market or port geographically entitled to it. Apart from the restraint on trade, commodities are hauled unnecessary distances, entailing very serious economic waste. Owing to the present rating system, in many cases railway hauls are much longer than would be the case if the traffic crossed the border en route to the market or port of the adjoining State. There is no uniformity in the classification of goods in the different Australian railway systems; neither is there uniformity in the scales of the tapering rates. Both the classification and the scale of tapering rates have been framed on a State, rather than an Australia-wide basis. Some years ago, the Australian railways commissioners made an exhaustive investigation as to . the financial effect of through-rating interstate traffic as against charging the sum of the local rates as at present. The investigation was made in respect of traffic for the year ended the 31st December, 1922, and showed that there would be a total saving to railway patrons, in reduced charges on goods and livestock traffic, of approximately £272,000 per annum. This, of course, would mean a corresponding loss of income to the various railway systems. The analysis showed that the loss to New South Wales on account of the Biverina traffic going to Melbourne and the Northern Rivers traffic goinp; to Queensland would amount to over £380,000 per annum, whilst, by conversion to this through-rating system, Victoria would gain about £96,000 and South Australia £38,000 per annum. Other systems would have minor losses. These figures do not include the parcels or passenger traffic. Since this investigation was made sixteen years ago, newfactors have developed. The expenditure of twelve months' labour by selected staffs in each capital city at a cost of not less than £10,000 is obviously not warranted to bring the 1922 figures up-todate, as they broadly reflectthe present position with, of course, fluctuations of the actual financial result which is, in detail, unknown. Broadly, after taking all these new and changed factors into full consideration, it may be concluded that the introduction of interstate through-rating would result in great savings in freight charges and would encourage traffic to flow to its nearest port.. No doubt, it would involve serious losses of railway revenue in certain States and cause embarrassment to their railway finances, but that would have to be considered against the greater national aspects which are involved. In 1936, the Commonwealth again listed the matter of standardization of gauges and through-rating for discussion at the Premiers conference held in Adelaide. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has drawn attention to the report on the subject contained in the proceedings of that conference. The matters were considered by a transport committee of the conference, consisting of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Transport. The committee, which displayed no enthusiasm for the further standardization of gauges, made the following recommendation, which was approved by the conference to which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has referred:In view of the progress which has been made in road and air transport, this committee considers that, before any decision is arrived at with respect of standardization of railway gauges, a further inquiry by a competent body should be made, having special reference to the economic and defence aspects. consider the Transport Committee to be a competent authority? matter has been under consideration by representatives of all the railways commissioners in Australia since that time, who, in my opinion, are competent authorities. advertisement of that fact.",29,Annual Expenditure Over A Period Of Eight Years Based On Commonwealth Accepting

80,Mr Drakeford,"There has been nomittee also recommended, and the conference approvedTliat a conference of Ministers of Transport should be held at a date to be agreed upon for the purpose of considering railway and transport matters generally. That decision, I have no doubt, was made because of the very genuine desire of my predecessor to achieve something definite in this direction, notwithstanding the entire lack of enthusiasm displayed by the representatives of the State governments at that particular time. The Commonwealth Government considered it desirable that the States be consulted regarding the preparation of an agenda for this conference of Ministers for Transport, and, early in 1937, it invited the States to nominate representatives as members of an agenda committee to confer with representatives of the Commonwealth in the preparation of a draft agenda. Meetings of the agenda committee have been held from time to time, and the Commonwealth proposes to invite the State Ministers for Transport to confer with Commonwealth representatives at a conference to be held early next year. One subject, if not the most important amongst those to be considered by the conference, will be the standardization of railway gauges in Australia. This was placed on the agenda at the initiative of the Commonwealth and Victoria. That fact, I think, provides a complete answer to the charge levelled by the honourable member for Maribyrnong that this Government and its predecessors have been recreant to their trust in connection with this issue. moment. I hope to be presiding within the next few months at a conference of Ministers of Transport, and I assure the House that if this matter is viewed with the same seriousness by the State Ministers for Transport as it will be regarded by me, we may look forward with confidence to some action being taken in connection with this vitally important undertaking. considered increasing its quota above the 20 per cent, originally offered ? discussion by the Minister for Transport. I shall raise no obstacle in that regard. of importance from a defence point of view. Defence will presently have something to say on that aspect. The break of railway gauges is the one thing which, perhaps more than anything else, emphasizes and tends to perpetuate State consciousness, thereby preventing the full realization of Australian nationhood, something we possess in name, but not in fact. I suggest that if we can eliminate this break of gauge we shall take a big step forward towards breaking down Snate consciousness, and towards removing the evils associated with it. It is not, however, sufficient to eliminate the physical break of gauge if we permit the continuation of the break of gauge on the rate books of the various railway systems. I know that to bring about a complete system of through rating would cause serious loss to at least one State, but I a.m not prepared to accept that as an insuperable barrier to the achievement of the ideal of one gauge and one system of through rating. All Commonwealth governments, irrespective ofparty, that have been in power since the royal commission sat on this question in 1921, have been earnest in their desire to achieve a standard railway gauge for Australia. I hope that while I am in office I may be able to contribute something further towards the achievement of this objective, even if I am not able to bring the scheme actually to fulfilment. Mi-. MAKIN (Hindmarsh) [4.10] I warmly commend the honourable member It is a live issue at the for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) for bringing forward this matter of major public policy, and for endeavouring to stir the Government into activity. I desire also to congratulate the honourable member upon the very informative and helpful speech he delivered this afternoon. There is no doubt that he has made a thorough study of tbe subject. The Minister for the Interior( Mr McEwen), in his reply, was at some pains to try to exonerate his Government from blame for the delay that has taken place, and he indicated that there was some hope for the future in a conference that was to be convened early in the new year.

I feel that a golden opportunity was missed, during the period of the depression, to do something towards standardizing railway gauges. At that time, there was an unprecedented number of unemployed, and materials could be bought more cheaply than at any time before or since. That was the time for the Government to launch a scheme for the standardization of gauges as a major undertaking for the relief of unemployment. A considerable saving would have been effected, and the work would by now have been far advanced. The present position in regard to our railway gauges is absurd. Two things about Australia, are inexplicable to observant visitors, and to those abroad who are interested in our affairs. They cannot understand how we tolerate the existing duplication of governments, and they cannot understand why we permit the existing breaks of railway gauge to continue. These things are put forward as showing how backward Australia really is. I was a member of a parliamentary committee which, in 1925, investigated certain aspects of defence and the supply of munitions. ""We had a very distinguished member of the Australian Military Forces before us for examination who stated in evidence that it would take six weeks to transport a division of troops, with the necessary equipment, from the east of Australia to the west. If that is so, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, it indicates what a serious threat to the security of Australia is inherent in the present system of varying railway gauges. Although developments in road transport have done much to remove some of .the difficulties,' it remains true that, in certain circumstances, railway transportation cannot be dispensed with. If railway gauges were standardized, important savings could be effected by having uniform rolling-stock, stores and supplies, and by having standardized repair shops and equipment I believe that there are throughout the whole of the Commonwealth.. I suggest that the Commonwealth should make an earnest endeavour to solve this problem. If the States are not prepared to co-operate, the Commonwealth should move to secure such power as would enable it to assume control of all the I hold that opinion railway systems of Australia. The Prime Minister in his policy speech of 1934 made a definite promise that the standardization of railway gauges would be regarded as a question of major importance, but it is only when the Opposition arouses the interest of members of the Government in this matter that it is permitted to have any knowledge of what the Government's intentions are. able gentleman's time has expired. welcome this opportunity to discuss this important national question, but I regret that the honourable gentleman who moved the adjournment of the House in order to initiate this discussion should endeavour to make party political capital out of it. Many efforts have been made to right the wrong that was done in the development of our railways systems in the early days, but, in recent years, all of the efforts by the Commonwealth Government towards the standardization of the railway gauges have been hindered by some of the State governments, on which lies the responsibility for the failure to standardize the railway gauges. I have no doubt, and I am sure that every honourable gentleman shares my feelings, as to the urgent need to standardize the Australian railways systems, and I regret the lack of desire of some of the State governments to cooperate with the Commonwealth Government, which has caused the delay.",31,Annual Expenditure Over A Period Of Eight Years Based On Commonwealth Accepting

Mr .FRANCIS -If the right honourable gentleman would listen he would know that I am referring to the efforts that have been made since 1921. Special Premiers conferences on this question were called by the Commonwealth Government in 1924 and again in 1934. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) interjected earlier in the debate that New South Wales should receive its share of any standardization work. gentleman that the responsibility for the tangle of railway gauges in Australia to-day lies with New South Wales. In the year 1851 the adoption of a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge was proposed and strongly supported in the new colony of Victoria and in the province of South Australia, but the Government of New South Wales preferred a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, in Australia to-day. The United States and in July, 1852, an act of council was passed whereby the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge was made compulsory under heavy penalties in the colony of New South Wales. This gauge was then reluctantly adopted in Victoria and South Australia and the Melbourne to Hobsons Bay railway was built with a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge in June, 1853. South Wales passed an act revoking the 5-ft. 3-in. standard which it had forced on Victoria and South Australia, and adopted the 4-ft. 8-J-in. standard which had been preferred by Victoria and South Australia. The Minister for the Interior( Mr responsible for the construction of the McEwen) referred to the royal commission which was appointed in 1921. It was an independent commission, and it consisted of Mr R. Blake, of England; Mr F. M. Whyte, of the United States of America; and Mr J. J. Garvan, of Sydney. The Minister pointed out that the proposal placed before the royal commission for inquiry was the linking of Fremantle and Brisbane through the' capital cities with a uniform railway gauge of 4 f t . 8£ in. At that time it was estimated that the cost would Be £21,600,000. The amount to be expended within each State was allocated as follows:£ Western Australia 5,030,000 Commonwealth 67,000 South Australia 4,074,000 Victoria 8,324,000 New South Wales 1,657,000 Queensland 1,848,000 It was proposed that the work should be done by the expenditure over eight years of the amount of £2,700,000 a year. I submit that that amount of expenditure would not have been difficult in those days. It would not be excessive to-day, but as the result of the delay, the estimated cost has risen. In the case of Victoria alone it was estimated that the cost of altering I point out to the honourable the permanent way was-1897 , £350,000; 1913, £3,569,000 (ten times greater), and 1921, £5,240,000 (fifteen times greater). Every year of delay adds to the cost iind adversely affects the development of Australia. Other nations have had to tackle this problem and as the result of their having clone so, they have made greater progress than is being made of America started the conversion of its seven different railway gauges in 18S6, and approximately 13,000 miles of railways were converted to a standard gauge. In consequence, the United States of America has reaped the benefit of enhanced prosperity. Australia's prosperity would increase if the breaks of gauge In the following August, New were eliminated. The royal commission of 1921 reportedAny time or money spent on a third rail or mechanical device will be wasted. Experience has shown that that is so.

94,Mr Scult.iit,"Does the honorableland contributed. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia should have contributed but did not do so, the Commonwealth consequently paying not only its own share but also that of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. That alone indicates the enthusiasm and anxiety of the Commonwealth to convert the Australian railways systems on a standard gauge basis. The adoption of a uniform gauge is essential for Australia from economical n d defence viewpoints. a In times of drought or other trouble, if the gauges were standardized, rolling stock which was not needed in one State could be lent on an economic basis to other States. There could be a free interchange of rolling-stock. Because this exchange is not possible, every State has to construct sufficient rolling stock to he able to meet the peak period of production, and this is not economical. It would require 100 trains to shift an army division. We have in Australia seven divisions, five infantry and two cavalry. It would be difficult enough to transport a division from one part of Australia across the continent on a standardized railway gauge, but it would be a colossal task to try to do so with breaks of gauge. A uniform gauge is therefore of great importance to assist in the development of the defence measures. It has been said that the breaks of gauge are of benefit to troops because they provide the means by which the troops can have a rest out of the carriages, but that rest could easily be provided in other ways. The standardization of the gauges should be started without delay in order to serve the interests of Australia from the point of view of defence and economic developmental needs. support, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) because I believe that the standardization of railway gauges is a question of national importance must be prepared has been stated in the press on a number of occasions that military authorities say that it is not necessary for defence reasons to standardize railway gauges, but personally I cannot belieye that any man with military experience would make such a statement. Defence experts may say that there are other measures more necessary for defence than the standardization of railway gauges, but they would not deny that standardization is absolutely vital to the effective defence of this country. Before the standard gauge line from Port Pirie to Port Augusta was constructed, I investigated the question of the time that would be taken to shift a military division from Sydney to Perth and estimated that it would occupy about five weeks. That is a crime against the defence of Australia. The removal of the breaks of gauge, like the abolition of the extra impost on interstate telegrams, would help to develop a national spirit in Australia. The Commonwealth Government must face the fact that these steps are necessary to foster a better spirit in this country. Victoria at present is suffering from a severe drought and is dependent for forage on the more favoured portions of New South Wales. The extra cost which would be saved in bringing forage from New South Wales to Victoria and the cost of transport of other goods over the two railways systems would go a long way towards meeting the cost of standardization of the gauges. These artificial barriers between the States are fundamentally wrong. member for Barton( Mr Lane) that New South Wales is the most vulnerable State in the Commonwealth and in the event of war against Australia would be the first to be attacked, and that residents of New South Wales would squeal like hades for Victorians to come to their assistance.

98,Mr Street ('Corangamite,"Ministe rsay in connection with it must receive very serious consideration. I wish to make a few remarks concerning the standardization of railway gauges from the viewpoint of the department that I am at present administering. I shall endeavour to discuss the matter in its proper perspective in connection with the whole of the defence problem of Australia. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), whose military knowledge we all respect, "" h it the nail on the head "" when he said that it is a matter of degree of priority. What priority does standardization of the railway gauges take in the defence problem of Australia? The Commonwealth Government is at present undertaking the rehabilitation and strengthening of the fighting forces, and the development of the local production of munitions. This policy, of course, is directed towards obtaining security from the most likely form of attack. When these proposals are completed, Australia will be reasonably well protected against scales of hostile seaward bombardment or air attack, and against raids that might be made by enemy landing parties. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) and the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) gave an illustration of the length of time which would be involved in moving troops from east to west, ""and tlie honourable member for Hindmarsh fixed the time at six weeks. There are two big factors which govern this matter. One is the size of the attack made on the threatened spot and consequentially the size of the force it would be necessary to move. division. What is the number of troops in a division? the policy of defence against raids, which is the present aim of the Government, the interstate movement of large bodies of troops is not envisaged; consequently, from a purely military viewpoint, for the implementation of this policy it cannot he said that the standardization of the railway gauges is urgently needed; the existing facilities would very well meet the army requirements for that form of attack. developmental programme on which the Commonwealth Government is engaged represents a very large financial commitment; and the Government is .at present considering extra financial provision for the remaining requirements, including any additional preparations recommended by the service boards as the result of the recent emergency. When further preparations are undertaken to resist large-scale attacks on the vital centres of Australia, Parliament will again be asked to provide, first, the most direct forms of defence, represented by man power, war materiel, and preparations for additional supplies of munitions. It is obvious that those must take priority over the improvement or the development of our railway systems. It would be totally unwise to devote to the standardization of our railway gauges the very large sum required for the work while man power, materiels and munitions remained inadequate. In the event of a large-scale attack, it might be necessary to concentrate troops by interstate movement. Everybody must agree that for this purpose the ability to move troops without the delay caused by breaks of gauge would be an enormous advantage. The honourable member for Bendigo, I have no doubt, has a very good personal recollection of what happened to the Turkish army when, in trying to escape, it encountered a break of railway gauge. The movement of large bodies of troops, however, is governed by railway capacity, which in turn is dependent on a large number of factors. The defence requirements of the railway systems can, in effect, be met by carrying out the following projects in order of priority: The development of transfer facilities at break-of-gauge stations. The duplication of certain sections of our railway lines. The ballasting of lines which may be required for heavy military traffic. The provision of certain new railway lines; and finally, the standardization of certain lines. The process of. standardizing the gauges of the whole of our railThe combined defence and way systems, however desirable it may be, cannot in the last resource",34,Annual Expenditure Over A Period Of Eight Years Based On Commonwealth Accepting

100,Mr Street,"About 20,000. Forbe said to be essential for effective defence against tbe most likely form of attack; it is paramount first to re-arm the defence forces for that purpose. Iu accordance with resolutions passed at a recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the Government is examining earlier items of priority with a view to further consultation with the States on the subject. increasing the militia if there is no danger of invasion? increase the strength of the militia to 70,000 in order to deal with defence against raids, not against invasion. ' The number is to be increased because, as the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said quite recently in this House, the advice has been tendered to the Government to step up the man-power in order of priority so as to make it equal with that of material. Shortly stated, that is the reason why the militia forces are to be doubled. As other honourable members wish to speak on the matter, I merely remind the House that, from a purely defence viewpoint, to implement a policy of defence against raids, the standardization of the railway gauges caunot be said to be essential. Sir -PREDERICK STEWART -Would we have time to change our policy when an etnemy has changed its tactics and invaded instead of raided? whether the honourable member heard me when I mentioned the order of priority which it is considered it is essential that railway works should take, commencing with the improvement of break-of-gauge facilities where breaks of gauge occur. honourable gentleman, standardization comes last. defence point of view, it is believed that the improvement of break-of-gauge facilities, the duplication of certain sections, the ballasting of certain other sections for heavy traffic, and the provision of some new railway lines, are more essential in order of priority than is the standardivery definite statement as to what was to zation of the railway gauges. that if the British fleet were tied up in European waters, Australia would have only raids to fear? situation arising in which Australia could not get help from the British fleet. have listened with more than ordinary interest to the debate on this particular matter. I join with other honourable members in congratulating the honourable ford)' on the thoughtfulness he has displayed in the preparation of the material for the speech he has' made to-day. I know from contact with that honourable member that he has given a good deal of consideration to this matter over a period of years. As an ex-railwayman, he has an inside knowledge of the disabilities caused by breaks-of-gauge. In some degree I can join with him, hecause, as most honourable members know, I also have some knowledge of railways and railway works. I cannot say that I was very greatly impressed with the opening remarks of the Minister for the Interior( Mr McEwen). In the first place, he attacked the Opposition on the ground that it was making this a party political question. I assert that the attitude of the Opposition has been amply justified to-day, because it has brought from the Government a statement of its future proposals in this regard. Digressing for a moment, the policy of the Government seems to be one of secrecy. The House is told nothing of what action it proposes to take until the Opposition moves a motion for the adjournment of the House or a censure motion. It is interesting to note that the Minister for the Interior went to a lot of pains to justify the Government's ineptito the tude in this matter. It is merely begging the question to say that the Commonwealth Government has resolutely set about tackling the problem of the breaks of gauge. Practically only at election time do we hear anything of the project. An attempt to "" pass the buck"" to the States is not an answer to the charge levelled by the Opposition.

109,Member For Maribyrnong ( Mr Drake,"-thut time? The honourable member for llaribyrnong has demonstrated how long it would taKe to effect the standardization of the whole of the railway gauges of Australia at the rate of progress so far .made by this Government. The Minister for Defence( Mr Street) has tackled the matter from the point of view of the Department of Defence. He has made the amazing statement that that department regards standardization as of the least importance. He has spoken of proyiding transport, of ballasting certain already constructed railways, and of building new lines. It may be argued that the general standardization of the railway systems throughout Australia could be placed last; but, in my view, the standardization of essential trunk lines for the purpose of moving troops from one point to another, even if only to provide against raids, is essential, so that transport may be effected in the most expeditious way. It is easy to visualize the hopeless mess Australia would be in if it became necessary to shift large numbers of our population quickly. The necessity for standardized railway gauges in Australia has been discussed since the very early days of settlement in this country. Away back in 1840 the issue was before the public. But as the years have gone by, different States have built railways of varying gauges. It seems to me that the time has now come for the 'Commonwealth Government to take the initiative. Nothing will be done to correct the present deplorable condition if we wait for agreement among the States. The Prime Minister declared in his policy speech in 1934 that the standardization of railway gauges would be an important element in government policy if his party were returned to power. Yet in 1938, we are told that all the Government can do is to call another eonference in 1939! The 1934 promise of the Prime Minister has therefore gone the way of many other promises he has made. The right honourable gentleman could have given effect to his undertakings if he had been strongly disposed to do so, for his Government has always had a majority in both Houses of the legislature. Yet, although eminent visiting railway men, as well as military leaders, from other countries have referred in almost Mr Barnard. scathing terms to the impossible position created by our different railway gauges, nothing has been done in any effective way to remedy the position. The Government has lamentably failed either to declare a policy on the subject or to put in hand any effective work. In the United States of America, the gauges of 13,000 miles of railway have been standardized since 1S86, and to-cViy the United States of America has 305,000 miles of 4-ft. 8$-ki. gauge railway. the standardization operations? figures at hand. If the United States of America could carry out an undertaking of this description Australia could also do it. I entirely -disagree with the view expressed a few moments ago by the Minister for Defence( Mr .Street.) on the importance of standardized railway gauges for defence purposes. Military experts have declared that under existing conditions it would take five weeks to transport 20,000 men from the eastern States to Western Australia. Surely some effective steps should be taken immediately to correct such a major disability. Although the Government proposes to spend £43,000,000 on defence works within the next two or three years, no effort is to ""be made, apparently, to standardize OUT railway gauges. I strongly support the attitude of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) on this subject. matta) [4.58] -Lik e the Minister for the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) has brought under our notice a subject of transcendent importance to the Commonwealth-; and I endorse the view of the Minister that he somewhat spoilt his action by importing into the discussion a degree of political rancour which the circumstances do not justify. I take second place to no honourable member in this chamber in my anxiety to see our railway gauges standardized; but if we wish to look for the real culprits to blame for the delay that has occurred, we must look beyond the Commonwealth Government.

Fair play to the Commonwealth ence has been made in the course of this discussion to a promise purported to have been made by the Prime Minister (Mv. Lyons) in his policy speech in 1934. Too much has been made of the right honourable gentleman's observations on that ' occasion, for all that he said was that, in seeking means by which the unemployed people of Australia could be put back into work, consideration would lie given to large public works such as the standardization of our railway gauges. No definite or specific promise was'made under this heading.

As the Minister for the Interior stated, the 'Commonwealth Government has been chiefly responsible for the only two works that have been put in baud to implement the 1921 report of the Royal Commission on Railway Gauges. He referred to the construction of the Kyogle to South Brisbane line and the Port Augusta to Port Pirie line.

For many years the defence authorities had indulged in a great deal of shilly-shallying and back-pedalling on this subject. I was sorry to hear the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) say a few moments ago that, in order of priority in defence undertakings, the standardization of onr railway gauges was a long way down.

Whilei t may be true that, so long as our defence experts consider our immediate danger is more likely to come from raids than from invasion, the standardization of our railway gauges might not be of vital importance; but what will happen when these experts change their views, or when prospective enemies of Australia change their views, and invasion becomes more likely than raiding? transported for great distances, it is essenDrakeford). I desire at the outset to tial to detrain them now and again, and that could be done at break-of-gauge stations. aware that some people aTe reluctant to see this work put in hand because of what they regard as its unconscionable cost. But the Minister for the Interior has reminded us that, although the ultimate cost of the standardization of the whole of the railway systems of Victoria and South Australia, and of the trunk lines from Kalgoorlie to Brisbane, is estimated at £21,000,000, it has never been proposed that the whole amount shall be provided in one financial y*ear, or that the burden of providing it shall fall upon one Treasury. 1 hope that at the conference which is to be held, the Commonwealth Government will be prepared to liberalize its offer, having regard particularly to the commercial and defence aspects of this question. The Minister also said, and quite truly, that it would be quite useless to adopt a uniform gauge of 4 f t . 8^ in. unless at the same time the artificial barriers which exist between ithe States were removed. ber has exhausted his time.

Motion agreed to. support the motion moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr tender my congratulations to the honourable member for bringing this matter forward, not only on this occasion, but also on other occasions, because, in my opinion, it is one of vital importance to the welfare of this country. The charge that he has endeavoured to make party political capital out of it cannot be sustained. His justification for bringing the matter prominently under the notice of the Government and of the people generally, is the promise made by the Prime Minister on the hustings, but never honoured, .that the standardization of railway gauges was a part of his policy that would be put into effect. The Commonwealth in the past has undertaken a rather unique duty in the construction of railways in parts of Australia where the State governments themselves could not possibly contemplate the task. The railways constructed by the Commonwealth in outback and desert regions of more than one State have no possibility of ever being profitable. State governments have restricted their railway construction to serve those areas where they are likely to secure a financial return for their investments. It has been said during this debate that Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia contributed -nothing towards the building of the Brisbane-Kyogle railway. It is true that the financing of that venture was left to Queensland, New South course, only those two States derived any immediate benefit from the construction of that line. When it is able to secure the essential standard-gauge railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. Western Australia will be quite prepared to pay its share of the money expended on that work.

However, I have no wish to pursue that matter further at this stage. We have every reason to be proud of the railway service between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie. Not only have we air-conditioned cars supplybers that if I were the enemy and knew ing maximum comfort to passengers not equalled by any other railway system in the Commonwealth, but also the time occupied by the journey from the eastern States to Perth has recently been cut down by one day. The services rendered by the staff could not be bettered.

The huge capital expenditure involved in the construction of the EastOne means by which Western Australia's West line, amounting to approximately £7,000,000, precludes any possibility of the venture being a profitable one for some considerable time.

States and would enable the ready and This will occur, not, perhaps, in my time, effective transport of troops and war but in the not very distant future. Whilst material from Brisbane and Sydney to five years ago the grouped railway systems operated by the Commonwealth earned £77,000 less than working expenses, the latest figures show that they have earned £31,436 above working expenses. This increase in five years looks hopeful for the future, particularly the New South Wales railway system when it is considered that the primary objective in the construction of these systems was not to secure a return for the in case of an invasion of the western expenditure involved. I was very pleased, indeed, to hear the illuminating remarks of the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) to-day in regard to this important subject, and I feel sure that honourable members generally would be pleased to listen with interest to many more speeches of that kind. With a good deal of diffithe subject, I totally disagree with his contention that the Commonwealth railways are not essential from a defence Because of this point of view. If the Government's campaign to increase the voluntary enlistments in the militia from 47,000 to 70,000 is successful, it is. necessary to arrange for the expeditious transport of troops and war material in the event of emergency. I have no desire to be regarded as a scaremonger when I inform honourable memsomething about this country, I should attack that portion of the continent least able to defend itself. That, of course, would be the coast line of Western Australia. Once an enemy contacted the .shore line of Western Australia, he would be within 400 miles of the finest gold-mines in the Commonwealth, which produce £10,000,000 worth of gold per annum. And once in possession of those mines, he would be in a position to dictate terms to the eastern States. unfortunate position in this regard might quickly be remedied would be the conversion of the existing track of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge from Port Pirie to BrokenH ill to the standard gauge of 4 f t .

I advocate that as a desirable first step in a general scheme for the standardization of railway gauges which could be undertaken relatively cheaply. If that work were put in hand, the rolling-stock of the whole of of over 6,000 miles could be diverted to South Australia and Western Australia coast-line of the Commonwealth. My suggestion should commend itself to the Government if it is prepared to do something in regard to this matter in a really big way. It might be said, of course, that people from Victoria and South Australia would not be very keen about the undertaking of that work at the present time-naturally , they would want the big scheme undertaken first;-but, in my opinion, it is one that should commend itself to people generally because of its importance from a defence aspect.

The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) has performed a useful service in bringing up a question which is of such great interest to the whole of Australia. We know that he has considerable technical knowledge of this subject, and that he is enthusiastic with respect to the standardization of railway gauges, and for that reason I listened with great interest to his speech this afternoon. might be permitted to allude to a characteristic interjection of the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane), by which he showed to the House what his attitude is with respect to this question. In his opinion, it is, apparently, not of great interest to New South Wales, but is rather one for Victoria and South Australia to look after. MightI say to the honourable gentleman that it was through the action of New 'South Wales many years ago that Victoria was induced to construct its railways on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge and that, as a loyal New South Welshman, he cannot altogether rid himself of responsibility on behalf of his State for what happened. The position, if I might briefly recall the circumstances, was that at that time the New South Wales Government had the services of an Irish order to point out the desirability of something being done to bring about the unification of railway gauges, I cite the following figures relating to the mileages of lines of different gauges in the various States:Gauge. 4 ft.

The Government of New South Wales tried to get the Government of Victoria to change also, but the Victorian Government evidently thought then that as it had somersaulted once on the advice of New South Wales in order to adopt the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, it would now adhere to that gauge. This had the rather extraordinary result that the State of New",39,Annual Expenditure Over A Period Of Eight Years Based On Commonwealth Accepting

129,Mr Paterson,"I remind the honSouth Wales, which had intended to build on 5 f t . 3 in., evenutally built on 4 f t . 3-in. gauge railway from Adelaide to Red &i in., while Victoria, which had intended to build on 4 f t . 8£ in., actually buiit on and we brought the transcontinental 5 f t . 3 in. The honourable member for Barton cannot relieve his State of all responsibility for what happened. I desire to remind honourable members of what was done by the Bruce-Page Government in connection with the building of the Kyogle to South Brisbane line, which was the first step to standardize the gauges. By the construction of that line from Kyogle through the Macpherson Ranges to South Brisbane, 100 miles was cut off the distance between Sydney and the Queensland capital, a good deal of climbing was avoided, an.d there was a saving of seven hours. The Commonwealth Government not only accepted its own responsibility in accordance with the agreement to provide one-fifth of the amount which really should have been furnished by Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia. The only two States which contributed anything, besides the Commoiiwealth, were Queensland and New South Wales. While that railway was being constructed-and the work was done while I was Minister for Transport in the Bruce-Page Government -w e were also conducting negotiations with the Government of South Autsralia in an endeavour to induce it to agree to the next step in the process of standardization, which would provide a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line right through from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie. There is no harm in mentioning now that at that time we tried to induce the Government of South Australia to sell to the Commonwealth the RedH ill line as far as Salisbury, a junction about thirteen miles north of Adelaide. The Commonwealth Government intended to convert this line to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge and to extend it from RedH ill to Port Augusta. We did not succeed in inducing the Government of South Australia to agree to this proposal. Then that government was defeated, and the depression followed. The next step occurred during the life of the last Parliament, when I was Minister for the Interior. After a great deal of effort, we succeeded in getting the Government of South Australia to accept a compromise by which it agreed to extend its 5-ft. Hill, a few miles northward to Port Pirie, down as far as Port Pirie, which made a much better break-of-gauge station than RedH ill would have done, because it was a town of considerable importance. Now passengers may travel from Melbourne to Kalgoorlie on only two trains, whereas previously they travelled in four different trains. They travelled in one from Melbourne to Adelaide, in another from Adelaide to Terowie, in another from Terowie to Port Augusta, on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and then in a fourth from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, on the 4-ft. Si-in. gauge. Then, in order to continue their journey to Perth, they had to change again to a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge train. As the result of the construction of this new line via Port Pirie, the total distance between the cost, but ' also provided Adelaide and Port Augusta was reduced by 70 miles, and instead of there being inclines of 1 in 40, and curves with a radius of 40 chains, the steepest incline now is 1 in 100, and there are no sharp curves. This, together with the speeding up that has taken place on the Commonwealth transcontinental line, has enabled a day to be saved on the total journey to the west. The next step-and I speak as an Australian rather than as a Victorian-shoul d be to construct a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge railway line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. After that, very serious consideration should be given to converting the present 3-ft. 6-in. track from BrokenH ill to Tort Pirie to if t . Si in. If that were done, it would be possible to use the same rolling stock from Brisbane to Fremantle. honourable member's time has expired. debate is unique in that not one of those who has so far spoken has opposed the motion for the adjournment of the House.

We are only too familiar with the procrastination of this Government in connection with this and other matters. I should like to receive an assurance from the Minister that the Government intends to increase its quota of the cost of carrying out this work, hecause only in that way will it be possible to induce the smaller States to become enthusiastic supporters of the scheme. Much has been made of the importance of this work in our defence scheme, and it has been suggested that other works should, perhaps, have priority over it. Practically every question that has been before this Parliament recently has heen clouded by the raising of the defence issue. Defence seems to be first and foremost in the minds of honourable members. ThisI regret, because the standardization of railway gauges was an urgent problem long before we had any potential enemies on our flank. Honourable members are tending to make a fetish of defence matters. inaugurating a campaign of national fitness for defence purposes, but I do not agree that the people should be made fit simply that they may become cannon fodder. This matter of the standardization of railway gauges should be viewed from the angle of social and economic welfare to the community, rather than of defence.

Mr Sheehan. In 1846, a royal commission in England reported in favour of a uniform gauge, and an act passed in the same year made 4 f t . 8£ in. the standard gauge for England. On the 30th June, 1848, the Colonial Office suggested to the Governors of New South Wales and Western Australia that a uniform gauge should be decided on, "" with a view to the probability of the meeting, at some future, though probably distant, period, of the lines, not only in the same settlement, -but by a junction of those constructed .in the adjacent colonies."" The English commissioners favoured the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge which had heen adopted by South Australia, and the British authorities asked New South Wales, which then included Victoria, and Western Australia to conform to that gauge. Because of the break of gauge of Australian railways, it is impossible for rolling-stock to be interchanged except in a small measure between Victoria and South Australia. If we take privately owned railways into consideration, South The Government is even Australia has six different gauges, Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales four each, Queensland three, and Tasmania two. The Commonwealth Territories, Federal and Northern, are the only areas with one gauge each, and those gauges are not the same.

""When the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge line was constructed from Kyogle to South Brisbane, it was assumed that 4 ft. 8$ in. was to be the standard railway gauge for Australia, but there is no guarantee of that, because who knows but that the Defence Department will suggest at the conference next year that a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge should be the standard. It has been my experience since I entered this Parliament that the Defence Department from day to day has altered its opinions and decisions. Standardization of the railway gauges would enable a State to draw on the rolling stock of other States if its own rolling stock were, for the time being, insuffiworking. The main feature of it is that cient to cope with the traffic that would result from a good season. In the present circumstances in New .South Wales the delivery of wool, wheat, and other primary products is often delayed because of the insufficiency of rolling stock. The honourable member's time has expired. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford), who is to be commended for initiating this important and interesting discussion, has given a great deal of the time to research into the subject of the standardization of railway gauges. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) was right when he declared that, quite apart from the huge cost which the conversion would entail and the absence of any practicable plan, delay was due to friction among the States and between these and the Commonwealth Government. That spirit too often prevents successful co-operation between the Commonwealth and the various States on matters which concern railways, health and social services, and even defence. Tho national spirit which should characterize discussions of such matters is swamped by waves of interstate friction and jealousy. Sooner or later the people of Australia will demand a revision of the Constitution in order that the national machinery should run more smoothly. [Quorum formed.] My main reason for speaking is to redirect the attention of the Government, towards the possibility of the exploitation of what is known as the Boock break-ofgauge device as an alternative to the construction of a standard gauge. That device has been investigated by several Australian experts and I understand that it has"" been the subject of favorable reports by many of them, including the chief engineer of the New South Wales railways, Mr Young, and Sir George Julius, whose mechanical genius needs no elaboration by me. A model of the device was exhibited recently in King's Hall, and, accordingly, most honourable members must be aware of the way in which it is operated. Is is a simple process and I shall not spend time in discussing its its adoption would involve expenditure of a trifling amount of money, compared with that which would be involved in the standardization of railway gauges. Whereas the standard gauge would mean the re-laying of thousands of miles of railway tracks, all that would be involved in the use of the break-of-gauge device would be an alteration of the rolling stock. As a preliminary, the principals of the Boock break-of-gauge device have offered a practical demonstration. I urge that, even if the Commonwealth Government be involved in the outlay of a few thousand pounds, it should finance the construction, on full scale, of a working model of the device in order that its efficacy could be tested. I feel that the device is worthy of a trial in view of the fact that it has been commended by experts. [5.42] I join with other honourable members in commending the honourable ford) for his persistency in advocating the standardization of the Australian railway gauges. The view expressed by experts in Australia and in other parts of the world is that the standardization of the railway systems in Australia is one of the most vital subjects which the Commonwealth Parliament could discuss. There is a misunderstanding as to Victoria's attitude towards the standardization of the railway gauges. It has been",42,Speaker Mr Engineer Who Naturally Thought That The

135,Member For Maribyrnong ( Mr Drake,"suggested that Victoria holds back from guaranteeing its share of the cost, but it can be said truthfully that Victoria has been and is still anxious to play its part in the development of the project. The only obstacle so far as Victoria is concerned, is that it has never been able to obtain an assurance that the standardization, if re-started, would be carried to its conclusion. It fears that it would be left out of the scheme. The difficulty in the past has been that the standardization work has been done in dribs and drabs. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) suggests that it should be continued to be done in such a way, but that is not the way in which a work of national importance should be undertaken. A definite guarantee should be given to the various State governments that the work will proceed on a long-range plan without interruption. given, not one State in Australia would hold back from guaranteeing its share of the cost. It is the absence of such an assurance that has made Victoria diffident about giving a definite promise that it would pay its share of the cost. Hitherto, it has been suggested that the standardization should be undertaken only in portions of South Australia and Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales not participating. The only way in which to achieve unanimity among the States on this question is by bringing them all within the project. Most honourable members in this debate have stressed the defensive value of this standardization of our railway gauges. they have said, but I take this opportunity to lay stress on another important aspect, namely, the good effect that standardization of the railway gauges would have on Australia's economic development in peace time. The breaks of gauge at the borders which entail double handing costs and two freight charges impose an enormous and unnecessary burden on industry, and, if they were eliminated, the saving to the people of Australia would amply repay the cost of their elimination. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Fishermen's Bend is a case in point. McEwen) said that the history of the advocacy of the elimination of the breaks Mr Holloway. of gauge went back to 1921. Actually it goes back to 50 years earlier than that, but conversion of the gauges first became practical politics in 1911-12 when, strange to say, in spite of the claim by the Minister for the Interior that Labour had done nothing towards solution of the breaks-of-gauge problem, the Eisher Labour Government caused the construction of 1,000 miles of standard gauge railway, whereas in the 37 years since then anti-Labour governments have authorized the construction of only 300 miles. It is regrettable that the party political aspect of this matter should have entered the debate, but, as it was introduced by tbe Minister for the Interior, it is only fair that I should bring before honourable gentlemen that which he refrained from mentioning. The construction of a standard gauge If that assurance were in Australia would be of enormous benefit in reducing the number of unemployed, because at least half of the work would be done by unskilled workers for whom there is great difficulty ire finding employment and on whom the State governments for many years have had to expend millions of pounds annually. I cannot cite exact figures, but I have no fear in saying that the expenditure in recent years on the provision of relief work and sustenance in the States for the unemployed has been more than double what it would have cost to standardize the Australian railway systems. It has been said that the locomotive is the greatest mechanical pioneer in the development of a country, and I believe that for many years to come, the locoI agree with what motive will play an important part in the destiny of Australia. In the last fifteen years, as the result of road and sea competition, the Australian railways have slipped back. The breaks of gauge and the additional handling costs thereby involved have made it too costly for manufacturers to use railways for the transportation of heavy articles from one end of the country to the other. As the result, industries have been situated within comfortable reach of ports, so that they can benefit by the cheaper sea freight charges. The aeroplane factory at Iron and steel works are similarly affected. They have been developed two or three hundred miles away from where the raw materials are mined in order that they may use the cheaper sea transport. Completion of the standardization of railway gauges would make it possible for the development of an iron and steel industry in ""Western Australia at the site where the ore is mined. With standardization making it possible to transport commodities which could be turned into the raw material for the manufacturing industries of Australia, there would be nothing to prevent the establishment of a large iron works with a rolling plant installed, right alongin the country. side the iron ore deposits of Western Australia, just as electricity is generated in close proximity to the brown coal deposits of Victoria. Leading captains of industry all over the world nowadays say that the most efficient, the only scientific, way, to commence new developmental processes, is to establish them at the point of production of the raw material. Western Australia would be a very necessary competitor of the only great iron works in this country. I suggest that in peace time, as well as for purposes of defence, one of the most efficient works of this Government, even if it saddled itself with the greater portion of the cost-and I think that it ought to do so, because it controls the purse strings of this country-woul d be the completion of this scheme. If the plan suggested by tlie Minister this afternoon, which has given a lot of courage and hope to those who have advocated this scheme for so long, visualizes a complete plan which will bring all under an Australia wide scheme, no State would be hesitant; in paying its share of the cost. AIL of us can remember the visit to Australin of a great military expert from England to advise us as to the best methods to adopt in order to organize our forces generally. statement that, in comparison with other countries, the Australian nation would be like the babes in the wood in war time, because of its complicated multiplication of railway gauges. Throughout Germany there is one mass of steel rails, every inch of which is of a standard gauge. {Leave Lo continue given.] I have seen the railways in some other countries. The reason for the adoption of standardization throughout is to minimize costs. I have seen in this country, at peak periods, in connection with the handling of not only heavy commodities but also large numbers of people, half the rolling-stock out of use because it could not be shifted from one railway system to another. The same thing applies to our tramways systems. All over the world, experts in transport have, pointed out these anomalies, and have said that the aim should be to make possible the shunting of every piece of rolling-stock on to every line of railway -On e thing which emerges clearly from this debate, if indeed there were any need for it to emerge, is that honourable members on both sides of the House believe that some effort should be made to standardize the railway gauges of Australia. This subject has been before the people of Australia for as long as I can remember, and it is a matter for regret that nothing concrete has been done towards the desired end. If ever the fallacy of the application of multiple control to big national subjects needed exemplification, it has been provided by Australia. The day is approaching when essential national services will have to be handed over to some supreme authority, and the sooner it arrives the better. The Commonwealth Government and every State government lost a golden opportunity to undertake a work of real value during the depression years, particularly, when they expended vast sums on the relief of unemployment in other directions, the great bulk of the money being wasted. Even to-day millions of pounds are being raised in Australia, particularly by State governments, for works for the relief of unemployment, and we know that a good deal of it is He made the remarkable being wasted when it could be applied to the provision of employment, not only directly, but also indirectly, on this work, which would provide a cure for what is undoubtedly a national malady. One can travel the entire length of Europe on the one gauge of railway. I believe that one can join a train in London, transported across the channel without leaving it, and continue on to Romp, Vienna, Berlin, and as far north as RigR,",44,Speaker Mr Engineer Who Naturally Thought That The
136,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [5.53].,"before .encountering a break of gauge. Tbe break of gauge was a tremendous mistake made by Australia in tbe early days. From every aspect, but particularly for the relief of unemployment, this work should be pressed on with as early and as quickly as possible. Every endeavour should be made to bring the States into line. The difficulty of bringing the States into line and of securing a. real national view on the problem of transport was made apparently only a short time ago, when the Commonwealth took a referendum on the subject of aerial transport, and found honourable members opposite advocating a policy which was a direct contradiction of that which was placed before the country. sightedness was without parallel in the history of Australia. able member for Herbert( Mr Martens) is out of order. I ask for the withdrawal of what I say is not true. member cannot ask for a withdrawal of a statement merely because, in his opinion, it is not correct. He is out of order in saying it is untrue. denied that a considerable section of honourable members opposite was as responsible for as any other factor, or posand locomotives. sibly was the predominant cause of, the failure of that referendum to achieve the object of the Government. From every aspect, this matter is of first-rate national importance. As a country man, I can speak of the vast amount which would be saved by obviating the present wastage of stock. Any one who has been to the border of the two States of New South Wales and Victoria must have seen the knocking about which stock receives in being un trucked, stood in the yards, and retrucked. There is enormous wastage because of this fact, particularly with fat lambs and fat sheep. Although there is a good deal of disagreement iu the matter, I believe that this has a. most vital bearing on defence. The Minister for Defence( Mr Street) has stressed the view that the break of gauge is not the first problem that should be tackled in Australia. He has informed the House that in the movement of troops a stopping place is needed; horses have to be watered, and so on. But there is another matter from, the defence aspect which he did not mention. I refer to the movement of munitions and guns. We must remember that a large number of our factories are in the south of Australia. The transport of these materials would be expedited if there were no break of gauge. I would go further than to deal with the matter merely from the economic' and defence points of view, and I suggest that some interstate control of the railway systems is definitely necessary, seeing that the Commonwealth Government has not the power, and is not able to obtain it, to assume control of transport throughout Australia. When one notes the hopeless confusion caused by carriages, rolling-stock and locomotives of different types, one can imagine the enormous additional cost that is thus imposed on transport in this country. A public servant who, I think, knows a good deal about this subject, has expressed the view that in this country there are hundreds of different types of rolling-stock, dozens of different types of locomotives, and machine and manufacturing shops scattered throughout the continent manufacturing along different lines, every State carrying up to millions of pounds worth of spares for its particular rolling-stock only the one gauge, there are locomotives of different types. multiplicity that we have. I believe that a greater distance of similar gauge would pave the way for more complete standardization in the building of rolling stock and locomotives, thus effecting a considerable saving to the people of this country. There are rewards, apart from the aspect of defence, to be gained from the settlement of the matter. I congratulate the Government on having again called the States together in an attempt to arrive at unanimity, and hope that",46,Speaker Mr Engineer Who Naturally Thought That The

145,Mr Hutohinson,"But not thebefore long we shall see a beginning made with a settlement of the matter in real earnest. wish to enlarge on the record given by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Western railway in 1838 on a 7-ft. gauge. A McEwen) of what has been done in the past. In the particular State from which I come, an ex-Treasurer of this Commonwealth, Mr E. G. Theodore, as Premier, had quite a number of bridges over large rivers between Brisbane and Rockhampton replaced by new structures. Every one of them was built to carry the heavier rolling-stock and the wider gauge of railway. To my way of thinking, that was evidence of considerable foresight on the part of that gentleman. I believe that we should have a standard gauge on at least our main' arterial lines. The distance from Brisbane to Cairns is 1,041 miles, and that coastline is a vulnerable portion of Australia. There should be one gauge from Western Australia to Cairns so that, if necessary, troops could be transported from one particular point to another at a quick rate. It has been suggested that the agitation for the standardization of our railway gauges is of recent development; but this is not so. As a matter of fact, before any railways were constructed in Australia, experts from overseas were asked to make recommendations on the subject, and the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge was recommended as the most desirable standard. The historical background of the whole subject is covered by an article which appears on page 366 of Vol. 2 of the Australian Encyclopaedia. It reads as follows:The Government railway gauges of each State vary in gauge, so that it is impossible for rolling stock to be interchanged, except to a certain extent between Victoria and South Australia. If we take privately-owned railways into consideration, South Australia has six different gauges, Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales four each, Queensland three, and Tasmania two. The Commonwealth Northern) are the only divisions with one gauge each, and those gauges are not the same. The standard gauge in New South Wales is 4 f t . 8-£ in., and the few miles of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge in that State are extensions i m m the Victorian systems. All other .4-ft. 8£-in. lines are federal. The standard gauge of Victoria is 5 f t . 3 in., and of Queensland, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Western Australia 3 f t . 6 in. South Australia adopted the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge for her lines around Adelaide and those running towards Victoria, and 3 f t . H in. for the rest During the early days of railways, the question of gauge waB much debated iu England -George Stephenson adopted 4 f t . 8$ in . : Brunei built the Great royal commission in 1846 reported in favour of a uniform gauge, and an act passed in the same year made 4 f t . 8A. in. the standard gauge for England, and 5 f t . 3 in. for Ireland. On the 5th October, 1847, the Legislative Council of South Australia adopted 4 f t . 8$ in. for all future public railways. On the 30th -Tune. 1848, the Colonial Office suggested to the Governors of New South Wales and Western Australia that ' a uniform gauge should be settled on "" with a view to the probability of the meeting at some future, though probably distant, period, of the lines, not only in the same settlement, but by a junction of those constructed in the adjacent colonics:"" the English commissioners of railways favoured 4 f t . 8 i in., which had already been adopted by South Australia, and it would be as well for New South Wales (which then, of course, included Victoria) and Western Australia, to conform. In 1848, New South Wales railway proposals were forwarded"" to thehome Government, the 4-ft. 84-in. gauge was approved of, and the Sydney Railway Company contemplated building to that gauge the projected railway from Sydney to Goulburn. On the 21st May, 1850, however, F. W. Shields, the engineer of the company, strongly advocated the adoption of the Irish gauge of 5 f t . 3 in. The English commissioners said the matter was not of sufficient importance to justify opposition, and on the 14th February, 1851, the Colonial Office intimated that New South Wales could do as it liked. On the 27th July, 1852, 5 f t . 3 in. was fixed by legislative act' as the gauge for the railways of that colony, and the Governors of Victoria (now a separate colony) and South Australia were so advised on the 23rd August. In November, 1.850, however, Shields had resigned and returned to England, and his successor, James Wallace, reported on the 8th September, 1852. in favour of the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge; the company in turn induced the Government to repeal the act of July, and on the 4th August, 1853. a new act sanctioned the narrower gauge. This action, taken without the concurrence of Victoria and South Australia, was strongly protustcd against by the Victorian Government and condemned (but not annulled) by the Colonial Office. The Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company and the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company had already placed indents for rolling-stock and crossings made to a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and Victoria and territories (Federal and South Australia determined to adhere to 5 f t . 3 in. In 1857, John Whitton, Wallace's successor, pointed out that difficulties would occur when the Now South Wales and Victorian lines met at Albury, and endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to persuade the Government of New South Wales to revert to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. On the 14th June, 1.883, the railways of New South Wales and Victoria were brought",47,Speaker Mr Engineer Who Naturally Thought That The
146,Mr Martens (Herbert) [6.2],"Iiuto touch by the opening of a railway bridge over the Murray at Wodonga; from that moment, the inconvenience and expense of transferring passengers, goods, livestock, & c , between the colonics became apparent. On the 10th January, 1888, the Queensland (3 f t . 6 in.) and New South Wales (4 f t . 8 i in.) lines met at Wallangarra and the same inconvenience was experienced. Thenceforth, the question of unifying the various gauges, at least on the main lines between the colonial capitals, became one of practical politics. In 1889, E. M . Gr. Eddy. Chief Commissioner of the New South Wales railways, impressed on his Premier, Henry Parkes, the urgency of adopting a universal gauge; forthwith, conferences of Premiers, railway commissioners and engineers resolved, and continued for many years to resolve, that unification must come-ther e weve such conferences in 1897, 1903, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1918 ( 2 ) , 1920 (2) and 1921. The first of these tliat took practical steps towards the solution of the problem was that of July, 1920, between Commonwealth and State Ministers, which set up a royal commission-tw o experts from oversea and an Australian not connected with any Australian railways-to report on the whole -(uestion. Prederick Methven Whyte from the United States of America., and John Joseph Gurvan, of Sydney, were accordingly appointed on tlie Sth February, 1921, aud their report was discussed at a Premiers conference in November. They recommended the adoption of the 4-ft. 8j-fn. gauge, and estimated the cost of conversion of all Australian lines of other gauges (including the rolliug-stock), and of the construction of certain new lines, at £57,200,000. the cost of conversion of the more important lines only-al l Victorian and South Australian broad-gauge lines and the Fremautle-Kalgooriie line in Western Australia-togethe r with the construction of new lines from Port Augusta to Adelaide and from Kyogle in northern New South Wales to Brisbane, they estimated at £2.1,600,000. accepted this report in principle, deciding that the Commonwealth should bear one-fifth of the cost, the remainder being shared among the mainland States in proportion to population; but Victoria aud South Australia afterwards withdrew for tlie time being insofar as their broad-gauge lines were concerned. In 1924, the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Queensland decided to begin work on the Kyogle-Brisbane line, which will give through running from Brisbane South to Alhury (1,014 miles) or south-west to BrokenH ill (1,309 miles). This part of the scheme is now (1926) in progress. The construction of u 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge line from Port Augusta in South Australia to Redhill, 126 miles north of Adelaide, and the laying of a third rail from Redhill to Adelaide, is still under discussion ; this would eliminate two breaks of gauge and provide a clear run from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide (1,241 miles). It is stated conferences already Mr Martens. Government has declared that it proposes to call another conference. This conference will consist of people of the same professional outlook and knowledge as those who attended the previous conferences. In elaboration of the remarks made about Queensland in . that article about Queensland, I direct attention to the fact that the coast of Queensland between Brisbane and Cairns is particularly vulnerable. Some attention should be devoted to it for defence purposes. Mr Theodore no doubt had this in mind when he directed that the new bridges over the Burnett, Kolan, Calliope and Boyne Rivers should be such as would carry a railway of 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge. member's time has expired.

In the two minutes which remain for discussion I cannot reply fully. The honourable gentleman did no more than indicate that the Government intended to call another conference which he hoped would be successful. A declaration of the Government's intention to treat the standardization of our railway gauges as a national undertaking to the cost of which it would conThe Premiers tribute say 50 per cent, of the total would have indicated that the Government harboured some definite purpose in connection with the work, and not merely shadowy good intentions.

If the honourable gentlemen opposite were really in earnest in their desire to see our railway gauges standardized, they could bring pressure to bear upon the Government to ta.ke some effective action which it seems to be quite incapable of taking on its own volition.

This bill is intended to establish the newsprinting paper industry in Australia. Several attempts have been made within the last fourteen years to manufacture newsprint in Australia, but none of them reached maturity. About the year 1929, plans for the establishment of a full-sized mill were in hand when the depression intervened and the scheme was set aside. During the depression several of the newspapers joined forces and a further unsuccessful attempt was made to inaugurate the industry. The next step taken was an investigation of the possibilities of establishing the industry on behalf of Australian newspaper publishers proceed in three stages. The first stage in general. The basis of this co-operative will involve the erection of a mill with scheme was that all metropolitan newspapers would participate in the provision of capital, and would purchase the output of the mill in quantities proportional reached the co-operative scheme broke down, but there emerged a scheme sponextended time sored by a group of newspapers which uses Australian newsprint in respect of two-thirds of its requirements. A company known -is Australian Newsprint Mills Proprietary Limited, was formed with a capital of £1,300,000 issued in £1 shares, consisting of 250,000 cumulative preference shares issued to the Tasmanian Government and 1,050,000 ordinary .shares. Of the ordinary shares SOOjO ' OO have been taken up by the newspapers concerned, while 250,000 are to be issued for the assets of the two companies which carried out the early experiments and acquired the freehold properties and concessional rights now taken over by Australian Newsprint Mills Proprietary Limited. At the present time newsprint is manufactured in other parts of the world, principally from softwoods. However, honourable members will have gathered from the Tariff Board's report that the sponsors of this industry, after considerable and protracted experimentation and careful surveys of available forest areas, are confident of the successful manufacture of newsprint from hardwoods. Australian Newsprint Mills Proprietary Limited is not alone in the use of hardwoods for paper manufacture. Early this year a mill commenced the manufacture in northern Tasmania of writing paper and fine printing paper, while a pulp mill is in course of erection in Gippsland, Victoria, for the production of hardwood pulp suitable for the manufacture of kraft paper and paper hoards. Australian Newsprint Mills Proprietary Limited proposes to erect a factory on the Derwent River in southern Tasmania, and to utilize local timbers, principally swamp gum, known botanically as Eucalyptus Regnans, in conjunction with a certain proportion of imported chemical pulp in the first stage of manufacture. The manufacture of newsprint will",49,Speaker Mr Engineer Who Naturally Thought That The

153,Mr Perkins (Eden,"Monaro-Minisone machine capable of producing 27,000 tons of newsprint annually and a mechanical pulp mill capable of ultimately supplying 75 per cent, of the pulp required. The remainder of the pulp used in the first stage will comprise imported chemical pulp. In the second stage, a second paper-making machine capable of an additional annual output of 45,000 tons will be installed, together with a chemical pulp mill, while additions will be made to the mechanical pulp mill. In the third stage, another paper-making machine with a capacity of 45,000 tons annually will be added, and suitable additions will be made to the pulp mills and auxiliary services. Employment, .principally in the bush and at the mill, is expected to be given to 266 hands in the first stage of production, while at the final stage it is estimated that 850 hands will be employed. The bill now before the House covers only the first stage of production, during which approximately 27,000 tons of newsprint will be manufactured annually. The Tariff Board recommended that the industry be assisted in the first stage by a bounty, the funds for which should be provided by a duty, and that both bounty and duty should vary as the imported cost of newsprint varies, with the condition that the bounty should not exceed £4 a ton. The Government proposes to grant to the new industry the measure of assistance recommended by the board, but has decided to give this assistance by means of bounty without duty unless the price of newsprint falls substantially below present-day levels. No additional duty to that in ""force at the present time will be imposed unless the c.i.f. and e. price of imported newsprint, plus primage, is less than £15 a ton. The bulk of the newsprint being supplied to Australia under 1939 contracts cannot be landed at less than £16 6s. a ton, inclusive of primage duty. Under the Government's plan of assistance to the new industry, the cost of imported newsprint will not be increased beyond the present-day level by reason of that assistance. The amount of bounty which will be paid when the imported cost is £16 6s. a ton will be approximately £1 14s. a ton. The bill provides that the bounty shall be on a sliding scale. No bounty will be paid Mr Perkins. when the imported cost is £18 l is . 3d. a ton or greater. The bounty will increase as the imported cost falls, and a bounty of £4 a ton will be paid when the imported cost of newsprint falls to £12 l is . 3d. The bounty will in no circumstances exceed £4 a ton. In the event of a material fall of the cost of imported newsprinting paper to a level below £15 a ton, the Government proposes to apply a duty at rates substantially lower than those recommended by the Tariff Board; The rates of duty will be-5s . a ton when imported cost is below £15 a ton; 7s. 6d. a ton when imported cost is below £14 a ton; and 10s. a ton when imported cost is below £13 a ton. Whenever the duty is applied the rate of bounty will be reduced by an amount corresponding to the amount of the duty. The bill will not operate until production of newsprint commences, and will continue for a period of four years. So far as can be seen at the moment, production will not commence until the end of 1939 or early in 1940. The question of what assistance, if any, is to be granted after the expiration of the fouryear period will be. determined only after further investigation by the Tariff Board. The Government feels that this industry will provide a welcome addition to the industrial fabric of this country. It will be established in one of the less industrialized States of the Commonwealth, and should thus meet with the approval of those honourable members who have, on various occasions, expressed a desire for the greater decentralization of industry within the Commonwealth. The establishment of the industry should eventually help to control the price of imported newsprint, and should create a supply at a reasonable price should the landed cost of newsprint rise to extreme heights as it did during and immediately after the Great War, when newsprint prices rose as high as £S0 a ton, and supplies were difficult to obtain. Finally, the industry will, when fully established, mean the investment of several million pounds of capital and the provision for a considerable amount of employment.

M INISTERS OE STATEBILL 1938. Debate resumed from the 16th November, 1938 (vide page 1570), on motion by That the bill be now read a second time. port this measure. The Opposition has objected to it on two main grounds. First, it claims that there is no need for an additional Minister, and then it says that, if an additional Minister is to be appointed, his remuneration should be provided out of the existing fund. As for the first objection, I believe that there does really exist a need for an additional Minister. The demand for his appointment has come, not only from this parliament, but also from the public, who recognize that, because of the increased duties which have devolved on the Minister, for Defence, the administration of defence matters should he divided amongst two Ministers. We are all agreed on the principle that members of this Parliament should be remunerated for their services, and it follows that Ministers should also be remunerated for the duties they have to perform. I fail to see how any objection can be taken on principle to the Government's proposal. There can be no doubt that the duties of government have increased with the years. Government is now concerned with many important phases of social and economic life that in the past lay outside the sphere of governments altogether. It is only reasonable, therefore, that this increasing work should be divided among a more numerous body of Ministers so that none of them shall be overloaded. I believe, however, that the present system of paying Ministers is wholly unsatisfactory. I do not blame this Government for it, because the method of payment is prescribed in the Constitution, section 66 of which providesThere shall be payable to the Queen ont of the Consolidated Revenue fund of the Commonwealth, for the salaries of the Ministers of State, an annual sum which, \intil the Parliament otherwise provides, sliall not exceed £12,000 a year. if an additional Minister is appointed, it becomes necessary to pass an act of Parliament in order to provide for his remuneration. Theni f , at a later date, that Minister resigns, or is put out of office, the additional amount of money still remains i i i the fund. It is not obligatory on the Ministry to reduce the fund by the amount of his salary. I believe, as a matter of fact, that when the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) resigned, the money intended for his remuneration was paid back into consolidated revenue. Of course, that is the proper thing to do, but the Government is not obliged to do it. In Great Britain, there is a much better system in operation, one which might well be followed here, though the great difficulty is that it would be necessary to amend the Constitution. The British act provides that the salary of the Prime Minister shall be £10,000 a year. There is no mystery about what he shall receive, as there is here. It is set down for everybody to read, and that is as it should be. The relevant section of the act states that each Minister of the Crown named in schedule 1 shall, subject to the provisions of the act as to",52,Import Duties

The section goes on to state that Ministers named in schedule 2 shall'receive £3,000 a year each, while those named in schedule 3 shall receive £2,000 a year. At the present time, there are eighteen Ministers of the Crown in the British Cabinet, but there are several other Ministers who do not sit in Cabinet. Their remuneration is also prescribed in the act, and salaries Australia party. The honourable member are provided for parliamentary undersecretaries, which is not the case here. In the circumstances, this Government has no choice but to make provision for the payment of the additional Minister. I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to divide the work of the Defence Department into two sections, and I congratulate the Government on its choice of a Minister for Defence. I .believe that the present Minister( Mr the Country party refused to have Street) will make a success of the job,' particularly as he is prepared to see the other man's point of view. I do not believe that the public will object to the increased expenditure involved, despite the fact that honourable members of the Opposition have taken exception to the proposal on this ground. vinced that the Government will be well served by the new Minister, and I have no doubt that it has acted wisely. listened with interest to the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and other speakers from the Government side of the House trying to justify the increased expenditure involved in this measure. The main argument advanced in justification of the Government's proposal was that Cabinet had an increased amount of work to do at the present time. If . that is so, the Government has, at any rate, plenty of time in which to do it, because it has met Parliament for shorter periods during its term of office than has any other government in the whole history of Australia. During tbe depth of the depression, when the Scullin Government was in office, Parliament sat 28 days longer during a period of two years than did its predecessor, the Bruce-Page Government, during a period of six years. During the term of the present Government, Parliament has sat on fewer days than did even the Bruce-Page Government. cannot see any reason for the appointment of another Minister, except that the Government desires to placate the Country party. It cannot really be claimed that Ministers are overworked, in view of the fact that so many of them have spent so much of their time on trips overseas. It has even been stated in the press that those who want to see the world should join the ""United for Barton( Mr Lane) expressed the opinion that the action of the Government in appointing another Minister was merely an attempt to pander to the smallest party in this House, namely, the Country party. We know that there was a public demand that the honorahle member for Calare( Mr Thorby), who was Minister for Defence, should be relieved of his office, but members of him made a scapegoat. I agree with them in that, because I believe that the Minister for Defence, owing to the international situation, and to. the Government's expanded defence programme, was really overworked. However, if the Government believed that he I am conwas not capable of carrying out hisduties, and that he should be replaced by some one with military experience, I cannot see why it has kept him in the Cabinet except that the Country party has demanded it. The Country party has fifteen members in this House, less than one-fifth of the total number of members, yet eight of that fifteen hold positions that carry remuneration over and above their parliamentary allowances. Pour of them are full Ministers, two of whom are in the Inner Cabinet group. One is an assistant minister, and one is Chairman of Committees. Another is joint whip, and still another is a member of the Public Works Committee. We all recall the memorable statement of the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) in 1934, when he and his party were outside the Government, that they stood for principles before portfolios. What has become of that policy now? At the present time, it seems to be a matter of portfolios and more portfolios, and if there is anything over, then it is still more portfolios. The party seems to have I no concern with principles at all. The Country party has always been",53,Second Reading
159,Mr James (Hunter) [8.25],"Iable, at the expense of the government in office, to get everything it wants, and the public has had to pay, by way of increased taxation, for the satisfaction of its avaricious demands. An example of this was the bread tax that was imposed on the poor people in return for the support of the Country party. manding concessions and, although the Prime Minister, as we know, is not pleased with its demands, because of the pressure of the powers that keep him in office he has to accede to them. If he were courageous, be would go to the country rather tban acquiesce in the creation of a new portfolio at the cost of £1,650 a year. The appointment of an additional Minister cannot he justified on the ground that the work of Ministers demands it. Purely and simply, the appointment is being made to placate the Country party. This bill, I say definitely, The Treasurer, to whom I desire to be is an abject surrender to that party. It is extraordinary that, since the Coalition Government was formed, there have been two increases of the salaries .of Ministers. One took place in 1935, when the honourable member for Corio( Mr Casey), who was then an Assistant Minister, was given the full status of Treasurer. At that time, a bill was brought down for the purpose of increasing the appropriation for the ministerial pool by £1,329, in . order to pay the honourable gentleman'his augmented salary. Shortly afterwards, the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett), who was then Minister directing negotiations for Trade Treaties, resigned from the Ministry. I asked a question to-dayto-night. for Henty resigned shortly after the appointment of the honourable member as Treasurer, thus ending the need for the additional appropriation. Only £500 was required to bring the honourable member's salary as an Assistant Minister to that paid to a Minister, but the Government looted the Treasury of £1,300.

That is wrong, especially when we take into consideration the fact that most honourable Ministers have no work to do. Some Ministers are overworked. fair, has too much to do, but the Attorney-Oeneral( Mr Menzies), a man of outstanding ability, is just rusting in Cabinet waiting for work to do.

168,Mr James,"In 1935, the appropriater's salary by £1,500 a year. Now, in this bill, it is proposed to increase the amount of the pool by £1,650. Parliament, when the Scullin Government was in power, sat for 2S days more in two years than it sat for the previous six and a half years when the Bruce-Page Government was in office. The Lyons Government has set an all-time record for a Commonwealth government by having Parliament sit on fewer days than any other Commonwealth parliament. The Scullin Government's performance in work was overwhelmingly greater than that of the present Government. I concede that the difficulties which confronted it were greater than those which confront this Government, but Ministers in the Scullin Government did work hard. The amount of the pool from which Ministers drew their emoluments during the Scullin regime amounted to £11,858, compared with £18,450, which is appropriated under the budget for Ministers this year. That amount is to be augmented by £1,650, which will bring the amount in tbe pool to £20,000. Ministers also draw the allowance paid to private members, and, as the result, they will share this year £33,450. The reason for the huge increase is the continual demands made by the Country party. Are those demands to go on and on? What will happen if another Minister goes from the treasury bench to the back benches, where we can see to-day about nine former Ministers? Will what happened when the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) resigned from the Cabinet occur again? Will the extra money which is sought in this bill for the payment of an additional Minister be kept in the pool if a Minister resigns and is not replaced? there was a surplus which not refunded in 1935, there will be a surplus that will not be refunded this year if another Minister resigns and is not replaced. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) never knows when he is going to lose Ministers. They seem to be deserting the ship, and if my judgment is correct, we shall soon be facing our masters because of the discontent which exists in the United Australia party. That discontent is due to the fact that honourable members who have been loyal * supporters of the United Australia party in this chamber since 1929I refer in particular to the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn), than whom there has been no honourable member more loyal or more capable-hav e been passed over because the Country party members, some of them "" Johnny-come-latelys"", have been pushed into the Ministry for political expedience. It is a tragedy that the Prime Minister is not fair to Western Australia in not having a representative of that State in Cabinet and to an honourable gentleman who has been loyal to him. The honourable member for Perth should have been in the Cabinet long ago and probably would have heen had it not been for the influx from the Country party. Honourable members generally have, on tbe one hand, had their salaries restored, and on the other hand, been robbed of the restoration by a new tax, whereas Ministers made provision to meet the outlay for that new tax by increasing their salaries still further by augmenting the amount paid into the ministerial pool. In effect, Ministers are robbing private members in order to pay themselves enhanced salaries. If the work of Cabinet were so arduous as to warrant the appointment of an extra Minister, no honourable gentleman would cavil against his appointment, but honourable members who know the little work that Cabinet does, and recall the trips abroad that Ministers undertake, know that, there is no justification for this bill. [8.45] -'Whil e the words of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) are still ringing in the ears of honourable If members, I should like to refer to the was resignation in March, 1937, of the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett), to which reference was made.

I say again to the honourable member for Hunter, that the salary of the honourable member for Henty was not drawn by me, or by the Cabinet or any member of it ; it reverted to the Treasury. No member of the Cabinet at that time was a penny better off by reason of the resignation of the honourable member for Henty. the budget? honourable member in the budget papers. gentleman not answer the question that I asked? looked into the matter and confirmed the facts. I interjected, but the honourable member chose to ignore my interjection. He entirely overlooked, in his references to myself, the fact that Senator Thomas Brennan was appointed an Assistant Minister at the same time as I was raised from the rank of Assistant Minister to that of a full Minister. Those two outstanding examples of the venality of the Government collapse of their own weight, as heing completely untrue. I have risen merely to. make some observations on the financial side of this not suggesting any evil motives or malmeasui'e. I shall attempt to make perfectly clear to honourable members the exact position that is being established. Two new full Ministers have been added and one Assistant Minister has been removed from the list of Cabinet members. The amount of £1,650 is being added to the Cabinet fund. PerhapsI may make brief mention of the Cabinet fund, and of the way in which it is worked. For the future, eleven Ministerial salaries will be paid into a pool known as the Cabinet fund. From that pool, twelve full Ministers will be paid their salaries, in addition to three Assistant Ministers and three Whips. Also, a fund is being established from which the Cabinet will defray the cost of the entertaining it is obliged to do from time to time. This amount of £1,650, concerning which there has been so much dispute, will be added to the Cabinet fund, and from that amount two new full Ministers will have to be paid. The net result of this measure will be that every full Minister and Assistant Minister will receive less than he was previously drawing. That means that the amount being added to the Cabinet fund is quite insufficient, to maintain the rate of remuneration previously paid. I remind honourable members that even before these reductions of Ministerial salaries are made as the result of this legislation, the salaries of Ministers in Canada and South Africa-and the latter Dominions are very much smaller in size than Australia-ar e appreciably more than are those of Ministers in the Commonwealth of Australia. The remuneration of a Cabinet Minister in Great Britain is appreciably more than double that of a Commonwealth Minister. I suggest that the responsibilities and anxieties of a Commonwealth Minister are not appreciably less-to put it mildly -tha n are those of Ministers in other self-governing parts' of the British Empire. I thought that these .few facts in respect of our position should be made as clear as I could make them. [8.52] I should like to try to raise the tone of the debate, by saying that I am distribution of money. But I cannot help thinking that the man in the street must view this addition to the Cabinet with a good deal of suspicion.

178,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"Casey), in confronting many problems during tbe last two or three years, has repeatedly met the request of the Opposition for more money for urgent needs with the statement that no greater amount could be made available. Even last week, in conference with the State Premiers, he curtailed the amount which the States said they required. He even cut the orthodox amount he would have had to pay had he maintained the expenditure at the level of the previous year. We cannot forget that, during the many months when important Ministers were absent from AustraliaI am not suggesting that they had no right to go away; that does not enter into our consideration of this matter-n o honourable member on this side of the House, no newspaper, and no public man in Australia, heard of any dearth of assistance in the Cabinet to meet the requirements of the period. Everybody thought that those Ministers who had been left in Australia were discharging their duties in a perfectly satisfactory manner. We heard of no complaint from them. I knew of no Minister who had insufficient time to meet any request that I made of him, nor did I hear any other honourable member complain on such an account. It cannot be denied-it is so obvious that no Minister would risk his reputation by attempting a denial-that there has been some kind of continuous intimidation, by a section of ministerial supporters, of the leader or of the members of the Government, with a view to frequent changes being made of those who hold portfolios. That feeling could not be dissipated; everybody, either consciously or unconsciously, felt that these things were going on. The changes eventuated almost as tiiey were forecast. Knowing and' seein'g this, we wonder whether there is any need for this additional provision of £1,650, and the extra trouble and worry of establishing new departments and fitting men into them. It is not a matter of whether Ministers individually are receiving too much. The feeling is that these re-adjustments, which have cost an additional amount, would not have been made in tbe ordinary legitimate circumstance of government but for the difficulty of blending the two contending parties together; the impossibility, without making provision for these additional ministerial positions, of quietening the disturbing element. If that be so, the public has reason for complaint, and it is the duty of the Opposition to protest against this measure. On that account 1 justify opposition to the biLl, with a.view to drawing the attention of the public to the fact that these additions, both of number and of money, were not brought about in the ordinary legitimate way because of the needs of the moment, but were designed to stifle some disgruntled members outside the party, or to make what some members consider is a more balanced division of ministerial positions between the Country party and the United Australia party, whose policies, so far as the public knows, are as far apart as the Poles. are called upon to pass judgment as to whether or not the provision of an extra amount in order to make possible the appointment of an additional minister is justifiable or desirable. In being asked to consent to such a measure, the House should feel quite confident that the appointment of an additional minister is definitely justified and desirable. I believe that Ministers should be amply remunerated, but I do not consider that at the present time it is necessary to appoint an additional minister. As a matter of fact, some Ministers have very little indeed to do, and the duties of the Government could well be divided up amongst the present number. One of the chief complaints that I have against Parliament granting power to appoint an additional minister is that which is felt by the citizens of this country, namely that the power to govern this country is being taken away from this Parliament and is being handed to the Ministry and to the Public Service. Ear too much power is being taken away from the Parliament. The authority of honourable members to govern is being deliberately restricted by the present Ministry. The electors send representatives to this Parliament to speak on their behalf, to deal with national problems which arise from time to time, and to secure for them a greater measure of happiness and economic security. Parliament meets very little",57,Second Reading
179,Mr Clark (Darling) [8.57],"W eindeed; one month, or probably two months, would cover the whole of the sittings throughout the year. The Parliament is not being consulted from time to time on matters of major national importance. Unfortunately, also, the practice of submitting matters of government policy to the full Cabinet for consideration is also being discontinued, for an inner council of seven members has been appointed to which is referred subjects that should be considered at least by the full Cabinet, if not by the whole Parthe holes in his leaky ship. I am opposed liament. Eour members of the inner junta could force their views upon the other members, and the inner group could then go to the full Cabinet and insist upon its policy being adopted. It must be apparent to all honourable members that this departure from the recognized parliamentary practice of this country is deserving of strong condemnation. We are well aware also that government by regulation instead of by Parliament has developed enormously since this Ministry has been in office. This has resulted in grave errors of national policy. For example, the Government not very long ago, adopted a restrictive trade policy in respect of Japan without giving Parliament a proper opportunity to consider the subject. This had an adverse effect upon the country and seriously restricted the sale of Australian wool to Japan with the result that millions of pounds was lost to our wool-growers and to the country at large. The publication of proclamations and regulations in the Gazette instead of the introduction of legislative measures in. Parliament is subversive of all principles of democratic government. In fact, it is not too much to say that democratic government is heing challenged in Australia to-day. It is the wish of the Opposition that well-recognized principles of parliamentary procedure shall be adhered to, and that an inner Cabinet group shall not be permitted to filch the rights of the elected representatives of the people. I oppose this bill because I do not overseas their colleagues in Australia believe that Ministers are being overhave, on every occasion, been able to disworked. At one period, four members of charge the additional duties that must the Ministry were abroad at the one time, have devolved upon them. Over-work is yet the business of the country was carnot the real reason for the introduction ried on as efficiently as if they were here of this bill. -though I do not wish it to be underMr Clark. stood that I regard the members of the present Ministry as efficient. It is noticeable that in consequence of the dislocation in the Cabinet the Prime Minister has been called upon to discharge extra duties in an endeavour to preserve his position as Prime Minister. As a matter of fact, the right honourable gentleman has lost the confidence of his party, but that is no reason why we should permit him to divert additional public money to enable him to caulk to the bill. honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) hit the nail on the head in the course of his speech on this bill yesterday, and I endorse the views that he then expressed. I do not propose to discuss the visits of Ministers overseas except to say that during the absence of three senior members of the Cabinet for some months, the business of the. country proceeded as satisfactorily as it had done when ithey were here. That, of course, is not saying a great deal. Those Ministers were absent during part of the parliamentary session as well as part of the recess, and I heard no complaints at that time that their colleagues were over-worked. The present Postmaster-General( Mr Archie Cameron) is one of the most active Ministers of the Government. He has adopted an attitude which other Ministers would do well to emulate. When he is asked about matters concerning his department he almost invariably intimates that he is quite prepared to meet honourable members who desire information to discuss the matters at issue with them. When the honourable gentleman was Acting Minister for Commerce he mingled among the primary producers of this country to a greater degree than any of his colleagues have done, and so was able to make himself conversant with their everyday problems. Other Ministers should follow his example. The plea that Ministers are over-worked cuts no ice with me, for during the absence of ministerial delegates",58,Second Reading

[9.29] -We have listened to a forensic discussion by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). that. word "" forensic"" if the honourable member objects. At any rate, Ave have listened to a discussion on the part of the honourable member with that degree of sincerity which w-e have become used to associate with him. The clause deals with the date of operation of this alteration, and if it government would be elected that would is necessary to advise honourable members why the date, the 7th November, was selected, it is because that is the date on which the changes in the Ministry were made; and it has been the custom of all governments, including the Government in which the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) was so conspicuous an ornament-agai n to use a phrase hallowed 'by time rather than by truth-to make measures of this kind date from the time when the actual changes in the Ministry took place. Again, if the bill were in fact to have any real retrospective effect, I remind the honourable member that its retrospectivity is in regard to a reduction of the salaries of all members of the Ministry, and not in regard to an increase. Furthermore, the honourable member's figure of £15,000 is an unfair exaggeration. support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Fadden, A. W. Brennan). The argument used by the Treasurer (Mi-. Casey) lacks conviction. Pie may be able to convince his friends on that side of tbe. House that there has been a reduction of ministerial salaries, but I question very much whether he will be able to convince the people of Australia. I go further, and suggest that he will have a much harder task to convince the electors that this provision is necessary. Certainly, the retrospective nature of this clause cannot be justified. I recall an occasion, not many years ago, when legislation was made to apply retrospectively in order to legalize the collection of £250,000 in sales tax which the Government wished to retain. and I have no desire to digress. I challenge the. Treasurer to prove 1 doubt that the amendment of the honourable member for Batman is flippant. That is a favourite retort of the Treasurer when faced with an argument with which he does not agree. The amendment is a serious one; it has much merit, and I intend to support it. If this readjustment were postponed for the period proposed by the honourable member for Batman, it is probable that by then a legislate for the benefit of the mass of the people.

I take this further opportunity to protest against the proposal of the Government to vote this additional sum of money to Cabinet Ministers. I think that we should at least have more information as to who is to get the money that is to be provided in the clause before us. The honourable member for Martin( Mr of them have jobs outside Parliament. McCall) said that we were entitled to know what each member of the Government received, and, whether or not we believe that the members of the Government are overpaid collectively, we should, having regard to the respective ability of Ministers, know which of them receives the most, and which the least. Ministers have told us that that is no concern of members of Parliament. I remember recently, when honourable members were trying to get some information from the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) regarding disbursements from the Cabinet fund when the number of Ministers was reduced by one, the Treasurer said that it was not a matter which concerned only members of the Cabinet and not members of Parliament, I believe, on the contrary, that it is the concern of members of Parliament. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) declared-and though this was denied by 'the Treasurer, he did not produce any' evidence to the contrary-that the amount paid to CabinetMinisters is approximately £15,000 more.now: than during the.dep.th of the depression. We must remember, Makin, N . J. 0. moreover, that this £15,000 does not Martens, G. VV. include the £1,500 which Parliament Pollard, R. T. voted specially for the Prime Minister Riordan, VV. J. F.

Yet, they tell us that they are overworked. My opinion is that Ministers are paid salaries on such a generous scale that there should be required from them their full time and attention to the business of this Parliament and of the country. Ministerial office should not be treated as a part-time job. One member of the Cabinet, the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), amongst other activities outside Parliament, is a newspaper proprietor. The Treasurer does not devote the whole of his activities to the business of this Parliament and to the work of the Cabinet. He has other activities. I am informed that he is a director of certain companies and undertakings which require some of his time. If I had the time, I could run through the whole Cabinet list and find that all the Ministers have other activities' beside those for which they are liberally paid by this country. .",62,Bbeknan S Amendment Stand Part Of Tho

The honorcompared the salaries paid to Ministers in Government, is always anxious to increase Great Britain with those paid within the Commonwealth Parliament, but if the honourable member wishes to make comparisons he should compare the amounts of money paid to Commonwealth Ministers with that which is received by his own unemployed constituents. are deserving Australian citizens who probably have performed much more useful work in their lifetime than have many honourable members of this Parliament. Yet anti-Labour governments say to the unemployed, "" Seven and sixpence a week is enough to keep you until we require you to don khaki and take up a rifle. Then, perhaps, we shall give vou a little extra "". member is getting wide of the subject. genuine unemployed, the honourable members of the Cabinet. They have yet to prove to the satisfaction of Parliament that they are overworked. It is ridiculous for them to claim that they are, because it could not bo imagined that, without experience, they could take up the administration of a public department except under the guidance of senior public servants. Any one would imagine, however, from what they say that they work day and night in order to become conversant with the activities of their departments. ""To prove that they do not, it is only necessary to cite the fact that hands into the public coffer to increase when they are asked questions in Parliament, unless their attention has been recently directed to the subject-matter of the question, they ask that the questions be put on the notice-paper. The next have had sufficient decency to leave the day they read to the House the typewritten replies which have been prepared by public servants. That is the way in which the business of public departments is transacted. I do not say that there is not plenty of work in some departments for Ministers to undertake if they are sufficiently interested or capable, but, generally, it is not undertaken. Ministers are merely rubber stamps. Some of them receive deputations and sign letters on behalf of senior members of the Cabinet. I realize that the Prime Minister, in his anxiety to overcome difficulties between the parties which make up the the number of Ministers. I was amazed that clause 3 was allowed by the Government to pass without amendment. I should have expected that the figure "" eleven "" would be replaced by "" forty-five"". Then all members .of the They two parties opposite could have been in the Cabinet; probably, that is the only way in which satisfaction-could be given to members of the warring sections. What concerns me at the moment is the way in which members of the Government and honourable members of the parties ' opposite expend the. public moneys without regard for those who have to pay. It is all right to vote a few thousand pounds now' and then for this purpose and that. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) said that this, increase of the appropriation for the Ministry would cost each taxpayer a fraction of a penny, but I suggest to him that he should take an entirely different point of view. This Parliament and members of the Government should set an example to the rest of the community. Thousands of men are being displaced from employment and evicted from their homes and little children are denied sufficient food, but when the Labour party asks that something be done to assist them the reply of the Government is that its finances will not permit it. If . that be the case the Government should not be dipping its Ministerial salaries. It was indecent for Ministers to participate in the last division. They should chamber when a division was taking place on a question which concerned their own financial' benefit, and the decision should have been left to other honourable members who have no pecuniary interest in the matter. Instead of that, every member of the Government voted in the division. Ministers have displayed an Some unusual interest in the proceedings of",63,Pairs

And lined up with Ministers on the side of the Government in the division were honourable gentlemen who, although they have no immediate financial interest in this bill, hope, when some further reconstruction of Cabinet takes place, to achieve cabinet rank. I hope that honourable members of the Opposition will go, not only into their Bruce-Page Government took some beatown electorates, but also into those of honourable members opposite, and tell the people how honorahle gentlemen opposite, like the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart), talk one way and vote another. orable member must confine his remarks to the clause. that, in my opinion, every member of the Cabinet should immediately vacate any position which he occupies other than that connected with his parliamentary duties. resign from directorates and concentrate the whole of their activities and time to attention to the work of the nation for which they are paid such liberal salaries. Members of the Opposition should go into every electorate and explain to the people just how this Parliament disregards the requirements of the general community and how it can alway find time to legislate for the benefit of Ministers. took strong objection to this bill on the second reading, and I feel that I should again register my protest against this unwarranted claim, on the public exchequer, which results from the great anxiety of the Prime Minister( Mr Ministers will be hard pressed to make Lyons) to placate the conflicting elements among his supporters. The attitude of the Government is in striking contrast to that of the Labour Government of New Zealand. Whereas in the Commonwealth an inner group of Cabinet has been formed, in New Zealand the government has taken the ' opportunity to grant responsibilities to its supporters in parliament. To avoid hurt to any Minister who has been left out of the inner group, there is to he extra emolument. If members on the Ministerial side of thu chamber did their legitimate duty they would share to an even greater degree than they do the responsibility with which they have been entrusted; but on all occasions they evade that responsibility. This Government has been more recreant to its trust in the direction of accepting direct responsibility than any government which has occupied the Treasury bench. The record of the ing, but I believe that this Government, in its delegation of authority and power to boards, commissions, and like bodies member is not confining his remarks to the clause. show that this extra amount is not warranted. Rather than being prepared to exercise the executive authority entrusted to them, the members of this Ministry have narrowed the limits Ministers should of responsibility to an even greater degree than they have been narrowed at any time in tbe previous history of this Parliament. Authority and power have been delegated to commissions and boards. The claim that Ministers are over-worked cannot therefore be sustained. When we realize the hopeless incompetence of the majority of those who occupy the front Ministerial bench, we must come to the conclusion that the claim for an additional amount of £1,650 is not justified, more particularly as the Government refuses to do anything during the approaching Christmas season to relieve in any way the position of those who are unfortunately circumstanced. an adequate explanation of their conduct. There has been no attempt to justify this measure. Apart from the Minister who introduced it, no Minister has sought to substantiate the claim for the extra amount. I invite the Postmaster-General( Mr Archie Cameron), even at this belated hour, to give some justification for the attitude of the Government. He would be hard pressed to"" justify the proposed addition to the already costly list of salaries, for the maintenance of those who to-day occupy places on the treasury bench.

We have to keep a close watch on the expenditure of the Commonwealth in order to see that all the money, is expended judiciously and in the best interests of the nation as a whole. If Ministers are conscientious and honest in their desire to serve their country, they, should be content to accept their publio duties without seeking to increase their allowances. A prospective member ofParliament knows that he will be called. upon to serve his country, and that for his service an allowance will be paid to him.

Everything should be done to discourage this attempt on the part of the Prime Minister to buy the support of the Country party. If a Minister is not capable of doing his job he should resign.

After listening to the technical nature of his speechand it is a great advantage to have in this chamber a man with professional talentsI realized that probably rights of the people, and particularly of he has aspirations in the direction of a scat being found for him on the ministerial bench later on. My view is that the Government had a perfect right to increase the number of Ministers and, conside of the chamber is fully justified. I sequently, the amount required to pay them, if it could justify the work being done, but I do not think that honorahle members have been furnished with any information which justifies an increase of the ministerial allowances. If the Government wants to add to its ranks, that is its own business, but to ask Parliament to vote a sum of money in order to cover the increased personnel of the Cabinet is quite a different matter, particularly when the Government by public opinion, and, the Government is tottering on the verge of a precipice and indulging in a tightrope walk before disappearing into political oblivion. orable member must know that be is making a second-reading speech. parliamentary authorization for this additional amount of money will, in my opinion, reflect upon the parliamentary life of Australia. The people will naturally ask, "" What is this increased allowance for?"" I , as a representative of the people, feel very nervous as to what Fairbairn). If there had been a proper public opinion will do about this matter, particularly as this increase is sought at a time when the parliamentary institution is suffering from a good deal of criticism from outside. It is institution, this Parliament is failing to have too much. I say, advisedly, after give satisfaction to the people. Is it any wonder that these suspicions arise when we find that the Ministry, for party political reasons, decides to appoint another Minister to the ministerial bench and says that it has to have an additional £1,650 for ministerial allowances, so that there shall be no furtlier falling out amongst the parties supporting the Government? introduction of this bill. vernment, of course, is sure of a sufficient majority to pass it or it would never have brought the bill down; hut, in doing so, it is getting away with something it has no right to get away with, while at the same time ignoring the the unemployed whose claims are not receiving reasonable consideration. For this reason, any criticism levelled against the measure by honourable members on this regret that this legislation will have a tendency to lower the opinion of electors throughout Australia of the parliamentary institution, which, as a consequence, will reflect upon us all. question very much whether this change is necessary or worthwhile. The Cabinet reconstruction has been forced upon if it is ineffective, public opinion will force still another reconstruction. I hope that it may be effective, and I wish the Government well; but at the same time. I believe that no extra 'members were needed in the Cabinet. I have always felt that the Defence portfolio, which has brought the Government so much censure, and has been responsible for the reconstruction, should have been held by a full Minister aided by an Assistant Minister able to devote his whole time to the task, preferably a Minister in charge of aviation, in the person of an honourable member such as the honourable member for Flinders( Mr allocation of work and an appropriate division of labour amongst Cabinet Ministers, such an addition to the Cabinet as has recently been made would not have been necessary.

Increasing the Cabinet in size, making it fifteen in number with Assistant Ministers, brings it to such dimensions that therein one gets a form of cave, cabal or junta such as is illustrated at present by the inner group which will decide policy for all Ministers who will have to share equal responsibility for whatever happens.

Up to the seventh .I'arliamemt, only nine, and for the greater part of the time, only eight, -Ministers sat in Cabinet. orable member that the committee has already agreed to the number of Cabinet Ministers. We are now dealing with the amount of money to be provided for ministerial allowances. while this bill was before the House was whether the emoluments were sufficient, and whether members of the Government should hold directorships. I believeand it is only my own opinion-that English practice in that respect is that when a member of parliament is called to the Ministry he gives up all directorships he may hold. I make no boast when I say that I did that when I was called to the Ministry. ter give up his farm? difference between owning a farm and being a director of a large enterprise, company or corporation which might indirectly benefit from the association of one of its directors with the Cabinet. It has been laid down by successive British Prime Ministers as a rule of prudence, if not of law, that, in the interests of the State, a Minister should surrender any directorships be may hold in order to demonstrate that he is giving unselfish service to the State and not prospering his own interests by his association with the Cabinet. I believe that member is not keeping to the clause. the increased allowance proposed in this bill is unnecessary. I believe that the work of Cabinet Ministers could have been re-allocated in such a way as to have made this proposed increased expenditure unnecessary. At any rate, I hope that the Cabinet reconstruction may be helpful, but, as I have said, I warn the Government that as the reconstruction was forced by public opinion, if it proves futile, public opinion will force a further reconstruction. we wanted an argument in favour of the rejection of this clause, we had it from the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) this evening. The honourable gentleman has just left the Cabinet and knows exactly what is necessary. After listening to the honourable member,, and to arguments advanced by other honourable members during this debate, I am perfectly satisfied that there is no necessity for the proposed increased expenditure. WhilstI believe that the Ministry should be paid adequately, I consider it unnecessary to add to the expenditure on ministerial allowances at a time when members are frequently directing questions to Ministers urging the provision of necessary works for the relief of unemployment, only to be told that no money is available. Even in this Australian Capital Territory, there is in the Property Office of the Department of the Interior a great list of applicants waiting for homes. The money proposed to be voted under this bill would at least provide some homes for those people. I register my emphatic protest against this proposal to increase allowances of I think there is a vast Ministers. We know, of course-and it has been stated more than once during the debate-that the increase of the personnel of the Ministry was due simply to a desire to stifle the internal dissatisfaction which existed amongst members of the parties supporting the Government. Because some were inclined to be troublesome and to stop the bickering that had been going on, the Government decided upon the recent re-allocation of portfolios.",69,Pairs

I oppose the proposal, and I hope that even at this stage the committee will reject the clause, and that the money will be put to a better use in providing homes for the people here in Canberra. I would fain make a few more observations which n o become relevant on this w clause. This is really the vital clause of the -bill. It speaks in terms of money and, as everyone knows, money talks. When I was addressing myself to an amendment moved earlier in the evening, which was unhappily lost, I quoted some figures, the accuracy of which the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) took it upon himself to challenge. He did not attempt anything in the nature of disproof. It is possible that he considered himself hampered by the fact that disproof was not quite relevant to the clause, and that it was only due to the indulgence of the Chairman, or to his momentary forgetfulness, that I was able to make the charge. But it is entirely relevant to this clause. I said that the difference between the salaries and parliamentary allowances of Ministers during the period of the depression, when the Scullin Government was in office, and during the first part of the term of the Lyons Government, and the ministerial salaries and allowances at the present time, was approximately £15,000. Actually, I understated the amount by £600. I gave it, as I said at the time, in round figures. Progress reported.

At the present time, the amount paid to Ministers in salaries and allowances is £35,100, an increase of £8,600 over even the boom period of 1928-29. However, what I have to establish for the satisfaction of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), if it is possible to satisfy him on the point, is a. comparison between the depression period and the present time. It is to this period that my second set of figures relates. When the Lyons Government assumed office in January, 1932, Ministers received by way of Parliamentary salary £650 a year, and Assistant Ministers received the same as members of Parliament, namely, £S00 a year. From the 1st October, 1932, there was a £50 reduction of the Parliamentary allowance, so that Ministers received approximately £600 a year, and Assistant Ministers £750 a year. The figures for this period, when a 30 per cent, cut applied to Ministers' salaries, and for the present period of 1938-39, are as follows:HW2-a:-. LYON SMINISTRY .

The Government could not undertake to coerce the boards in a matter of this kind. man say that the inquiry will take place at an early date? able to fix any date, because it is a matter which does not now come under my administration.

Honourable members on both sides of the chamber have made it clear that whether the insurance be undertaken by an overseas company or by the Australian companies, a great deal of exploitation of primary producers takes place. In order to obviate that, I have moved this amendment. It provides that .the board, shall be the only insuring authority in this country in respect of this particular risk. We have had experience of insurance offices in the States, particularly in New South Wales, where the State The Insurance Office commenced without any capital whatever, and operated so successfully that it was able to make a profit of £100,000 per annum after paying all the taxes for which it was liable. Any profit made as the result of the board undertaking this work should accrue to the growers themselves, and it should prove of material benefit to them. If it be argued by some honourable members that the board would not have the necessary financial resources to undertake this insurance work in case of the loss of a shipment shortly after its establishment, the Government could give the necessary guarantee to tide it over the initial period. We know that over a period of time this form of insurance would prove profitable to private insurance companies. If any profit is to be made, it should go hack to the growers whom this Government says it is anxious to assist by the passage of this legislation.

On the law of average, over a certain number of risks, somecome through and others may go down. If the amendment were accepted, the board would be placed in an extremely dangerous position.

An insurer should be a person of substance, able to pay if mishap should occur. In connection with one of these boards, a loss of approximately £250,000 was incurred. Eveni f a moderate loss had to be borne in connection with apples and pears, what funds would the board have to meet any claim? I understand that it has no funds, and ia not likely to have any substantial amount. The growers should have some assurance that in case of mishap they will the companies will not cover loss or get that for which they are insured. The proposal of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) is impracticable. Honourable members are labouring under a misapprehension. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has endeavoured to prove to the committee that this particular form of insurance, because it would be confined to one commodity, would not be profitable either to the board or to any particular company. In view of the speech which the honourable member made only a few nights ago, I think he recognizes that, over a span of years, all forms of insurance prove profitable to the companies which undertake them. It is only at a particular moment that the risk might be greater than the stage of its operations. If we want any evidence as to whether or not this particular insurance would be profitable to the private insurance companies, we have only to recall the lobbying of a few nights ago to secure the support of honourable members for 'a particular amendment which has now been withdrawn. Evidently, then, the private insurance companies of this country do not hold the view of the honourable member for Richmond, that this particular insurance would not prove profitable to them. insurance. member for Richmond that, whether or not it was combined with other forms of insurance, taken over a specified span this particular insurance would prove profitable to the companies undertaking it. If they were not assured of that, they would not be so anxious to secure it. Their premiums are .fixed on the basis of covering all their risks.

Since the loss of the Ferndale, there has been a long .unbroken period of profit or income to the private insurance companies. Shipwrecks do not occur every day in the week. I think that honourable members wifl recognize that had a board undertaken the insurance work over the whole of the period of export it would have found it very profitable and would to-day be in possession of funds which would permit it to undertake the risk that honourable members say it would be dangerous for it to undertake on its own behalf.",74,Pairs

277,Mr Ward,"According to the honor.1 hope that honourable members will not be misled into believing that the board would be taking an undue risk in insuring apples and pears under the provisions of my proposed new clause. The honourable member for Perth said that the board should not be asked to accept risks until it had accumulated funds. My reply is that the Government should guarantee the board against immediate loss until funds have accumulated. The honourable member for Richmond explained only' a few days ago how the State insurance office of New South Wales had developed. He told us that its premiums were 50 per cent! less than those sought to be imposed by the private insurance companies, and that immediately the anti-Labour Government of New South Wales provented it from accepting workers' compensation business the premiums charged by the private companies increased by 300 per cent, and in some cases even by 400 per cent. The purpose of private insurance companies is, of course, to make profits for their shareholders, whereas the purpose of the Apple and Pear Board would be to conserve the funds of the apple and pear-growers. took the insurance responsibility it could that, in connection, with its workers' comprotect the growers against deterioration while fruit was awaiting transit and also during transit. The private companies will not accept this risk. The honourable member for Barton( Mr tions. In that period it accumulated Lane) observes by interjection that the board would have no funds. Did the State insurance office have funds when it£1S9,000. began operations? It did not. It operated for some time under the guarantee of the State Government. We contend that the Apple and Pear Board could operate under a similar guarantee from the Commonwealth Government. I ask honourable members opposite to support their words by their votes on this occasion and give the Apple and Pear Board the opportunity to protect the growers from undue exploitation by private insurance companies both in Australia and abroad. -An obligation rests upon me to answer some of the statements of the honourable -member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). If his proposed new clause allowed the board an option to undertake insurance risk if it desired to do so after it had explored the whole situation, I could regard it with more favour. Buti t seeks to make it mandatory for the board to undertake risks which it might not be in a position to carry. The main principle of insurance is the .distribution of risks. Life assurance companies provide a case in point. On the whole range of their business, they may make a profit, but in respect of particular cases they make a heavy loss. An individual may insure his life to-day and die to-morrow. This would involve the company in loss, but the company would make up tbe deficiency by the premiums it received from persons who live for 50 years or so after they insure their lives. The Apjde and Pear Board, if it undertook insurance risks at the inception of its operations, might suffer heavy losses in respect of the first two or three shipments of fruit it sent overseas. That would permanently injure its financial status. Reference has been made by the honourable member for East Sydney to my recent remarks respecting tlie profits of the State insurance office If the board underof New South Wales. I pointed' out pensation risks, the State insurance office had made a profit of about £350,000; but its profits were made principally during the first three or four years of its operaprofits of more than £500,000, but in the depression years it suffered a loss of Stevens' Government took the workers' compensation business away from it. Mir. ANTHONY I was fair to the Lang Government the other night. TonightI want to be fair to the Stevens' Government and also to the officers of the State insurance office. The reason why losses were suffered in the depression years, during which period all public companies engaged in similar operations suffered losses, was that injured persons were tempted to remain on the funds for a longer period than was absolutely necessary, as they knew that after they went off the funds their incomes would cease because their jobs would be gone.",75,Pairs

287,Amendment (By Mr Abohie,,78,Pates
288,Mr Poll Arb (Ballarat) [12.30 A.m.].,"I merely stated that the Government could not accept the amendment. if Cabinet ties, he would have supported the proposal of the honourable member for East Sydney The members of the Country party should support my amendment. Most likely, the board will be influenced by the attitude of some members of the Country party, and will be inclined to transact its business, as other boards have done, through the usual trade channels. The Country party was formed to eliminate middlemen, but it has departed from its original intention. I desire to refer to the reasons given by the honourable member for Richmond( M i . Anthony) for opposing the new subclause proposed by the honourable member for East Sydney. The honourable gentleman said that because the board would deal with only one class of product, the risk would be too great. He added that it would not have other classes of risks to balance things in the event of a disaster occurring. That argument could be advanced in regard to manj types of insurance. It is known that many church organizations in Australia transact -their own insurance business and do not deal in any other class of insurance. Various State governments have their own insurance offices. In Victoria a State department deals exclusively with workers' comlard) differs from that moved by the pensation insurance. What holds good with these instrumentalities should also hold good with the Apple and Pear Roard. It must he remembered that the insurance would be effected upon a large number of packages. Many thousands of cases of apples and pears are exported annually, in about 60 vessels. It. will thus be seen that the risk is well spread. I am convinced that the companies which transact this type of business fix their premiums on a basis which enables them to meet any losses that are likely to occur. In these circumstances I feel sure that the board would be quite safe in transacting business of this type. However, the committee having rejected the proposed newsub-clause I am now moving for the insertion of a new clause the purport of which is to give to the board the option of transacting business of this type if it thinks fit. 1 hope that it will think fit to undertake the business and that it will insure the first year's cargoes. We must realize that as a business concern the Minister were free from the charge made by the' board for insurance would be based on what is necessary to cover loss, but should it be unlucky enough to sustain a heavy loss it could appeal to the Treasury or to the Commonwealth Bank to guarantee it for the loss incurred and recoup the loss out of the succeeding two or three years' operations. If the board itself undertakes this work and for the first three years sustains no great losses it will have at its disposal at the end of that period a substantial sum of money available for distribution in a manner beneficial to the industry with which it is to deal. I have nothing further to say except to express the hope that the Government will accept my amendment and that it will receive the support of honourable members generally. Postmaster-General) [12.37 a.m.] -The Government has considered this proposal of the honourable gentleman very carefully, and I b.ave to inform him that it is opposed to it. a.m.] -The amendment moved by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and disposed of previously by the committee in that, whereas the honourable member for East Sydney proposed to compel the board to undertake a monopoly of insurance, the honourable member for Ballarat first of all desires to leave the board free to make up its own mind as to whether or not it should undertake this business, and secondly, requires the consent of the Minister before it can undertake the business. A sub-clause further provides that, if the Minister thinks fit and the board so recommends, the board may be given a monopoly of the business. The effect of the first sub-clause of the proposed new clause is that the board may enter into the business, but it does not give the board a monopoly of the business. The operation of the remaining sub-clauses is contingent upon the board,",78,Pates

Dr. L. Keith Ward, Doctor of Science; Bachelor of Arts; Bachelor of Engineering; Government Geologist and Director nf Mines for the State of South Australia. Mr W. G. Thomas, (Department of the Treasury), business adviser, 10. Dr. Wade has had 31 years practical experience in all phases of geology, drilling and production in the United States of America, Egypt, Dutch East Indies, Poland, Greece, Trinidad, Venezuela, Columbia, Algeria, Papun and other countries. The committee has the assistance of Mr E. A. Kodyen, a Canadian, who occupies the position of Commonwealth Drilling Inspector. Mr Kodyen is Member of the Institution of Petroleum Technologists, who has had 25 years' experience in all phases of drilling and production in Canada, the United States of America, Persia, Irak, Greece and Afghanistan. He has oceumed the position of district superinten[80] dent for the Anglo-Iranian Company in Persia, Held manager for the Near Jiust Petroleum Company, assistant superintendent for the British Oil Development Company in Irak, and general manager for the Kockton Oil and Gas Company in Canada. 11. The final drilling o{ the Imray Well was made by the company's own driller in the presence of the Oil Advisory Committee and Mr Kodyen, the Drilling Inspector. On the advice it was considered that the drill had penetrated into the oil sands to a point beyond which there would have been danger of letting water into the well. The company accepted the advice of the Commonwealth Government's, experts that drilling should cease at this stage. Subsequently the well was tested for production of oil, which proved to be in the nature of a few gallons a day. The Oil Advisory Committee considered that nothing further could be usefully done in that well and thereupon intimated to the company that no further advance in regard to this well would be granted, and that it should be plugged in a certain manner at the bottom and sealed for protection at tlie top. Immediately afterwards the company was advised that if it were able to comply with the statutory requirements, the committee would recommend i i further advance for the boring of another well' in accordance with a pre-arranged programme. 12. I know of no such statement, which, if made, would not be in accordance with facts. 13. No amendment of the Petroleum Oil Search Acts is necessary to give assistance to companies engaged in the search for oil. 14. No advances have been made from the Petroleum Oil Search Trust Account for the search for oil outside Australia.

319,Mr Casey,"On Thursday, the 13thThe answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Grants to assist prospecting were authorized by the loan Appropriation (Unemployment Relief) Act of 11)34-35 and a revenue' Appropriation (Unemployment Relief) Act of 1936. 'Ihese grants were made in respect of metalliferous mining generally and not solely for gold, but in actual fact most of the grants went to gold prospectors. 2 Now South Wales 75,700 Victoria 95,700 Queensland .. 130,500 South Australia . . 46,300 Western Australia .. 100,400 Tasmania 39,150 Northern Territory 45,000 Papua 5,000 543,750 The period covered so far as the States are concerned was from January, 1935 to June, 1938. In addition about £38,000 was appropriated under annual votes for the Northern Territory. 3. No amounts are being made available for the States on the current year's Estimates. For the Northern Territory the following amounts have been provided:General services-Assistanc e to and development of mining industry .. 10,000 Additions, now works, &c, metalliferous mining-Constructio n of batteries . . 14,000 4. As explained in the answer to question 1, practically the whole of these grants were for gold prospecting. £250,000 was placed in a trust account in 1935-36 under the provisions of the Petroleum Oil Search Acts 193C. From this account advances are made to approved persons and companies in respect of approved operations. Since the beginning of 1937 advances have been made to companies operating at Lakes Entrance and Longford, Victoria, Mulgoa and Kulnura, New South Wales, and Roma, Mount Bassctt, Hutton Creek and Arcadia, Queensland. 5. No additional appropriation for prospecting is proposed in 1938-39, except £24.000 for Northern Territory for assistance to gold mining. A balance of £167,000 still exists in the Petroleum' Oil Search Trust Account from which further advances may be made. £ £",84,Grants Fob Mineral Research
