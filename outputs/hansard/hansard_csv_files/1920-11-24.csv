19,Sir Joseph Cook,"The honorableintimation from the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to call attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The infringement of the protective policy of the Commonwealth pertaining to the returned soldiers and sailors and the manufacturers of Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. This matter is of such striking importance that I consider it my duty to bring the particulars before honourable members. The Commonwealth has a protective policy. I purpose to endeavour to show how that policy is undermined. The citizens of Australia, have endowed the Treasury with a large sum of money in order to settle returned soldiers upon the land; and it is on behalf of the citizens, and also in the interests of the soldiers themselves and of the manufacturers of Australia, that I have introduced my motion. Following a meeting of manufacturers,, a letter was sent to the Lands Department of Victoria. The communication which I shall quote is an answer to the manufacturers' request for permission to scan periodically the list of names of successful soldier applicants. Before reading the epistle I desire to remind honourable members that the subject is not wholly a Federal one. Commonwealth find the whole of the money for soldier settlement on the land, but the policy itself is linked up between the States and the Federation. It is "" up to "" the Government to demand that the manufacturers of Australia shall have a fair show. The latter, in making their request to the State Department, sought no favouritism, but merely desired that they should be told the names of soldier applicants whose claims had been successful. The reply was as' follows:Tho matter was considered by my Committee at its last meeting. In view of the fact that the Department has appointed men to advise each soldier in regard to the selection of (Formal). machinery, stock, &c, and of the difficulties involved in allowing access by representatives of business firms to the departmental records, I regret to say it is not considered practicable to grant your request. .Prior to Federation a motion was agreed to by the Victorian Parliament to the effect "" That substantial preference should be given in all the Victorian Government Departments to Australian-made goods."" Although that was agreed to by the State Parliament at a time when I was a member, owing to the splendid business capacity of the Germans, the number of . Krupp's goods sold was larger than that of any other make. It was proved conclusively before a Select Committee that the price paid for Krupp machinery was in excess of that at which English machinery of equal value had been tendered. I hope that the Federal Government will avoid the mistakes that have been made by the State. We are told in a report that the Department has appointed men to advise each soldier, and I think it would be well for the Minister -to make inquiries, and to inform the House as to what machinery has been supplied to soldier settlers, and what proportion of that machinery is of Australian manufacture. My information seems to indicate that the representatives of American manufacturers of farming and agricultural machinery have better means of getting in touch with soldier settlers, and of ascertaining their requirements, than have the agents of local manufacturers. The Federal Government appealed to Australian manufacturers to employ as many returned soldiers as possible. Our agricultural and Citizens of the farming machinery. makers are employing large numbers of returned soldiers, and I am convinced that the average returned soldier settled on the land would prefer an Australian to a foreign made machine. It 13 only fair to the people who find the money for our soldier settlement scheme that local industry should be given special consideration. Abraham Lincoln pointed out that if Americans purchased a locomotive in another country, when that locomotive wore out they had neither the engine nor the money, but that if they purchased a locally manufactured locomotive then, when it had worn out. the money would still be spinning round their own country. That",20,Papers
20,Mr Speaker,I have received an,21,Adjournment Commonwealth Protective Policy And Soldier Settlement
21,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [2.46],"is still true. By purchasing Australian instead of imported machinery our returned soldiers will keep their money circulating in the country, and will avoid adverse rates of exchange. The whole of the taxation of Australia is borne by something like 900,000 householders, and it is up to the Commonwealth to see, in the interests of the taxpayers who find the money, that the State Government, which deals with soldier settlement in Victoria, expends that money, as far as possible, amongst our own people. I should be loth to say that a question of commission is involved, but if the statements made to me are true, then, as surely a* day follows night, it is either because of that or some other occult reason that the representatives of American manufacturers can always obtain the information they want as to soldiers going ou the land. I should be very sorry to say that any State or Federal officer was guilty of treachery to his country by giving speciiil information in return for a commission received, but if proof is forthcoming of any such treachery, then the officer concerned should be treated, not as an Australian, but as an alien who has no right to be here. The honour of the Victorian State and Commonwealth Governments is at stake in this matter, and I hope that the watchword that will ring out throughout Australia will be, "" Australia for the Australians, and Australian tools for Aus' tralian hands."" I recognise that 'it is difficult to adeto say that, in regard to soldier settlequately protect some Australian industries, and that the members of the Country party hold strong views in regard to import duties on farming machinery, but we ought certainly to manufacture all our own requirements. We should be a self-contained community. I have the fullest belief in the initiative and mechanical genius of the Australian worker. I know a Flinders-lane clothing manufacturer who has had experience in Austria, Switzerland, and Australia, and he assures me that he has never hnd more intelligent workers n his factories than ; he has obtained here. In the name of the manufacturers and of the aericultural implement makers of Australia, who are employing a lot of returned soldiers, I demand that they shall have a square deal. They should always be able to obtain information as to returned soldiers who are settled on the land. I recently saw a number of returned soldiers, who are settled along the Murray, and the average ""Aussie,"" who was man enough to risk his life for his country and his race, would rather have an Australian-made machine, when he goes on the land, than one that comes through the Customs House. The Telbart tractor was successful against all competitors in a recent reliability trial held at Werribee, and Australian-made agricultural machinery is equal tc* that of any other country. My sou, who is farming in Western Australia, obtained agricultural implements through ths State Government, and found them all that could be desired. He tells me that local manufacturers, who have to compete with imports, not only from abroad, but from all the other States, are turning out first-class machinery, and that their operations are tending to keep down prices. In the name of thecitizens who provide the Government with the money to carry out its scheme for the benefit of those for whom we cannot do too much, I ask for fair play for local manufacturers. The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph'Cook) holds the purse strings, and is therefore entitled to tell the State Government that, if they do not observe our requirements in connection with the returned soldiers' settlement scheme, we shall have to make other arrangements. AB the member for Melbourne, I regret ment, the Victorian State Government has bpen the slowest and slackest of a'l the State Administrations. with the honourable member. ment that I saw on the Victorian side of the Murray recently does not compare with what has been done by South Australia.

The Government entirely agree with the honourable member in his desire to see Australian machinery used on the soldiers' farms, seeing that Australian soldiercitizens are employed in manufacturing it . I regret to say that the honourable member on this occasion has not a good -case to present. Dr. Australia give an absolute contradiction to that statement. attention of honourable members to a resolution passed by the Board on the 20th September, 1920, instructing the district officers, wherever possible, to see that Australian-made goods are purchased. that instruction? possible.

He would only have to do that to get the honourable member for ""Wakefield to agree to anything that he might propose. The Prime Minister, being reluctant to throw off the robe of dictator, which he has i worn for-the last four or five years, was able to make the honourable member and others agree to his proposal without much difficulty,, because he knows exactly how to appeal to certain persons for what he wants. would put an end to the War Precautions legislation, and, as I expected nothing better, I am not disappointed. I knew that the Prime Minister would find it difficult . to relinquish the unlimited power that he possesses, and that for the past four years he has used against the liberties and interests of the country. he loves power. and those who follow him could hardly be expected to extend the privilege of trial by jury to the people of .this country, Parliament in 1916 by the ex-Premier judged by their latest act. On the bare .report of a newspaper, with nothing else to guide them, they expelled an honourable member from this House, and there was no. indication that they desired to give him fair play. I was not here on the occasion, being absent in another State with the Public Works Committee ; but, from all accounts, there was not the semblance of fair play. member is now reflecting on an action of the House. referring to it as an indication that we are not to expect anything in the nature of trial by jury from this Government. If the Bill becomes law, those who propose to meet to-morrow night to express their grievance against the Government respecting the non-acceptance of the basic wage might be dealt with and punished for daring to criticise the Government's action. I cannot understand the members of any party agreeing to some of the provisions of this Bill. It proposes to make a person coming to these shores go through the farce of taking the oath of allegiance. I can understand that the Prime Minister had certain persons in view when he got his party to agree to that upstairs, and I know how he appealed to their prejudices. An Act of Parliament cannot make a man loyal. A person coming tothese shores might take the oath of allegiance, and it would prove nothing of value. On the other hand, to force persons to take the oath is the very course which would lead to disloyalty. When every man is liable to be bailed up and have his loyalty questioned, he is made to believe that he is regarded with suspicion. Such conduct I did not expect that this Bill will not make one a more"" loyal or more dutiful citizen. The proposals of the Government, as indicated in this Bill, would be laughable were they not' so ' serious. They are absurdly foolish, and the measure can only have been introduced because there are certain individuals in the minds of' the Government against whom they propose to use these powers. The Government are not even original in this absurd legislation. The powers which The Prime Minister they propose to secure with respect to sedition are borrowed from the Sedition Bill introduced into the New South Wales( Mr Holman). So much did it aggravate the people that that measure was one of the chief causes of Mr Holman's relegation to political obscurity. The only satisfaction to be gained from the introduction of this Bill is that a similar fate may very reasonably befall this Government. Besides drawing upon the New South Wales Act, resort has also been had to the old Queensland code of fifty years ago. Queensland. one great principle recognised in the Queensland code which is conveniently absent from this Bill. I refer to the right and privilege of trial by jury. The Government have borrowed the worse features of other criminal codes, and have cast aside all the better features. It ia",27,Hughes

112,Mr Parker. Moloney,"There is to a large extent immaterial what a Government may seek to import into the criminal laws of a country so long as they retain and safeguard the great right of every citizen to open trial hy a jury of his fellow-countrymen. There is a clause in the B ill which seeks to make it seditious to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of the TJnited Kingdom, or against a Government of the King'6 Dominions. Was ever such a proposition sought to be foisted upon a free' people? We are to be required not only to swear allegiance to H is Majesty the K in g , b u t to H is Majesty the Australian Czar. We must refrain from criticising either the .Lloyd George Government of the UnitedK in gdom, or the Hughes Government of Australia. We must be very careful, if we do not wish to excite disaffection, not to dare to criticise this Government or any of its laws, in operation or proposed. Having studied the history of t i e Lloyd George Government and of the Government of the Commonwealth, it would be hard to avoid laying oneself open to a charge of sedition. One may not even offer reasonable priticism, it would seem. I can quite appreciate how this proposed law will make it a very serious matter for any one to refer, for example, to the Ready incident, the recollection of which still carries a very bad odour. It w ill be recalled that steps were taken by the Government to increase their majority by spiriting away certain persons-as in the Ready and Watson cases. However, no longer are we to be permitted to refer to those incidents. All our boasted rights and privileges with respect to the criticism of governmental administration are to go by the board. The honourable member for Dampier many people in Australia who were ( Mr Gregory) referred yesterday to the anxious to bring about revolution and meddling practices of the Prime ister. lating to companies: and, having in mind, I quite agree with the honourable member for Dampier that it is about ternment camps or our gaols, they would time the Prime Minister ceased from his have been f a r too small to hold such a meddling which are being thwarted at every turn.

If he desired to deal with companies along the lines proposed within this measure, his proper course should be to introduce a B ill to amend the Companies Act. And , with respect to the proposed restrictions upon immigration, the Prime Minister would be acting properly if he introduced a B ill to amend the Immigration Restriction Act. The desire of the Prime Minister is not to help industry. His past actions have tended in the opposite direction. H is proved desires have been to thwart industry. His chief purpose now is to continue to wear the robes which, unhappily for Australia, he has donned for so long. The Governmentsay it is their great desire to introduce suitable immigrants to Australia. The worse way in which they could possibly go about that purpose is to publish broadcast the provisions of this measure. If a stranger were to land on our shores, and were to read of these proposed safeguards against sedition, he would say, "" This is' the best country in the world to shun."" The worse advertisement which could possibly be given Australia is to have it made known abroad that our people are such that these safeguards against sedition are necessary. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) referred yesterday to people who were trying to disrupt the Empire. He remarked that he was pleased that these clauses had been introduced to deal with sedition and the like. He spoke of quite a large number of people who, during the war, were seeking to overthrow the Government of this country and of the Empire. H is language would give one the impression that there were really very Minchaos.

I hope that we shall have a speedy return to normal times, and that our industries will be allowed to go on peacefully without meddlesome interference on the part of the 'Government.

In the past the administration has been directed in certain channels, and, probably, against one particular class of the comimunity; but tration affecting the whole community. The clause in this B ill which continues the War Precautions (Coal) Regulations gives the fullest possible power to the Commonwealth Government to deal with any matter which may arise in connection with the coal-mining industry. Under these regulations this Parliament derives its power to pass legislation recently enacted affecting the coal-mining industry. But my contention lis that we are not endeavouring to make the power we possess effective. Certain negotiations I cannot-accept that amendment. are proceeding at the present time to bring about a settlement of a dispute which has arisen in connection with coalA n aimendment of mining, and I hope they will prove satisfactory; but I cannot permit an opportunity like this to pass without entering my protest against the neglect of the If the usages of Commonwealth Government to' take action under the Industrial PeaceA c t to force the Victorian State Government to observe an award given by a Tribunal appointed under the provisions of that Act. It is idle for us to have this power if we do not use it for the purpose of giving effect to an award made by a T r i bunal appointed in consonance with the power we exercised by virtue of the Coal Regulations. Who are to police the awards made by these Tribunals ? The employees, the employers, or the Commonwealth Government ? There can be only one answer. Under the Industrial PeaceA c t the Commonwealth Government is charged with the duty of policing awards made by Tribunals appointed in pursuance of provisions of the Act. Yet to-day we have the spectacle of a State Government setting an example to private employers by refusing to observe an award made by a Tribunal, and attempting to . justify its action on the ground that it was not a party to the dispute. The Industrial PeaceA c t makes it quite clear that the Commonwealth Parliament has .assumed complete power over the coal trade throughout the Common-",32,Pairs

On the merits of able industrial dispute. There was an impending probable dispute It became necessary to appoint a Tribunal. The Tribunal gave an award. To-day a State Government is defying that award. The proper course of that Government was to observe the award, and pay the meu the wage allotted to them, and then appeal to the H i g h Courti f it was not satisfied with the decision of the Tribunal; but it has assumed the attitude that the Tribunal had no right to control its workmen, and has raised the point that it was not represented at the inquiry. As a matter of fact it was. The State Premier at first objected, but, after the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) had been consulted, and had expressed the opinion that the question was one that ought to be submitted to the Tribunal, the State Government was represented by two persons. It then took no, exception whatever to the proceedings unti l an award was made, whereupon it refused to obey it . Tbe Act provides that any person wbo does not wish to become a party to the dispute may appear before the H i g h Court and show cause why his name should be struck out of the list of parties cited; but the State Government d i d not adopt that procedure, and instead of the Commonwealth Government saying, "" We propose to police this Act and see that you carry it into effect, just as we would -compel any private employer to do so,"" no action has been taken against the -State Government. tions were opened up. but I contend that it is our duty as a Parliament to assert our authority. Of course, if we have no authority in the matter, the sooner the public know it the better; biit if we.have the power, why should we allow a State Government to flout it ? A penalty of Â£500 may be imposed for a breach of an -award, but no attempt has been made to Tecover any penalty from the State Government, which refuses to recognise the authority of the Commonwealth, and chooses to defy us. ment impose a penalty on a State Government ? Federal Government is to police its own Acts, and it is for the Courts to decide Avhether the State Government , the case I venture to say it is wrong. Certainly its actions are not in the best interest of the people of the State itself or of the Commonwealth as a whole, because if a settlement is not arrived at within a week steps may be taken which may be h a r m f u l not only to Victoria, but also to other portions of Australia. This matter is so serious that I cannot allow this House to go into recess without raising my voice in protest. The State Government has taken up a wrong attitude. Some honourable members have asked why the Morwell miners should be classed as coal miners, but as a matter of fact under the award of the Tribunal they are classed as' ordinary labourers, and are to receive the lowest wage paid under the award, namely, 16s. 6d. per shift. The lowest wage paid under the award to a coal miner is Â£ 1 per shift. MrJ . H . CATTS -Evidently the position of the Morwell men has been grossly misrepresented. one knows that in any industry there are all classes of men engaged, and that if a plaint is filed the log covers all classes of employees. When a Tribunal gives its award it fixes the wages to be paid to a l l classes of men engaged in the industry. In the case of the MinersFederation it fixed the wages not only for the miner, but also for the wheeler, the clipper-on, the screen man, and every other person Certainly negotiaemployed about a coal mine. ThisT r i bunal fixed the wages, to be paid to the Morwell men at the lowest possible rate awarded, namely, 16s. 6d. per day. ber's colleagues in the State House have their remedy for the action of the Victorian Government. vernment w ill be out of ofiice to-night",33,Pairs

153,Mr Mcwilliams,"The Lawson Goif it is not kept in power by tbe Labour party. wbicb sets tbe example set by the Lawson Government does not deserve to remain on the Treasury bench for five minutes. If it felt aggrieved by the award of this Tribunal it had the right of appeal. Eirst of all, it could have appealed against being made a party to the dispute, but it did not do so, and Mr Lawson admits that he made a mistake in that regard. However, if it felt dissatisfied with the award the only course open to it was to appeal to the High Court upon the constitutionality of the Industrial Peace Act. It eould not appeal on the merits of the award. Premier simply proposes to ignore the award of the Tribunal, with tbe result that under that law. It is useless for the State a very bad feeling has been created in the community. Some honourable members have said, ""Why cannot these Morwell men allow a State Tribunal to deal with their case?"" But these men are members of the MinersFederation, which has decided that it will not bring about any industrial upheaval in the Commonwealth on condition that the whole of its members are protected by a Tribunal appointed under the Industrial Peace Act. imagine that a federation would not protect a section of its members because they happen to be small in numbers, and allow it to be debarred from the advantages given by the award of this Tribunal; or that it would forsake its friends, and not stand by them, especially knowing that a Government was breaking the award? If the men had broken this award they would have been dealt with, but no action is apparently to be taken against a .State Government for breaking it . know whether this is because a National Government has control of affairs in Victoria, but that is a fact which should not weigh at all in connection with this matter. A State Government has as much right to be dealt with for a breach of an award .as has a private employer who refuses to observe an award. The point I wish to make is that the Commonwealth Government ought to police the awards of its own Tribunalno one will contend that it is the duty of the workmen to police them-bu t it chooses to depend on negotiations. I hope these negotiations will be successful; but from what I heard on Saturday last, unless some change has occurred in the meantime, the position is not too hopeful. If the State Government adheres to its decision that it has the right to go to a Police Court for remedy, trouble will occur. If a certain point is raised before any Police Court in Victoria, the decision will assuredly go against the men. The State Government ought to be compelled to comply with the provisions of Commonwealth legislation, and go before the High Court. Theni f it should get a decision favorable to it , well and good; but no Government should be permitted But the State to flout the law of the land, or refuse to obey an award of a Tribunal appointed Government to argue that if it complies with this award it will be obliged to pay the same rate of wage to every other person throughout the State engaged in similar work. We know that when an application is made for an award in connection with a certain industry the award given affects that industry only. Any other person who seeks to increase his wages to the amount fixed by that award is obliged to cite a case for the Do honourable members Court, and the Court will deal with his application on its .merits. In view of the fact that we have a declaration *that the basic wage is about Â£ 5 16s -a week, will any one say that an award of 16s. 6d. per day is too much ? Although the men at Morwell may be working in an open cut, their work is arduous, they have a lot of material to shiftf, and they lose a lot of time through wet weather. No one can argue that the wage of 16s. 6d. per day for six days a week, even without lost time, is more than sufficient to I do not maintain a family at the present time. Yet when an award is given fixing 16s. 6d. as the standard wage for certain employees of a State Government, that Government absolutely repudiates it , and the Commonwealth Government does nothing to enforce Commonwealth legislation. The Prime Minister said to me the other day that he did not know what could be done in the matter, and asked me to suggest what I thought could be done. My only suggestion is that the Commonwealth Government is charged with the duty of policing these awards.",34,Pairs
154,Mr Charlton,"A GovernmentMorwell paid previously? they were paid 13s.. 6d. per day, and I have it on the best of authority that when their wages were increased by Is. 6d. per day, the Government at the same time increased the price of coal by about 2s. per ton. Of that 2s. per .ton, 9d. covered the increase given to the men,, leaving the Government the advantage of an extra Is. 3d. per ton, which I believe would fully cover the increase to 16s. 6d. per day under the recent award. But the real question is, what is a fair and reasonable wage for the men employed in the industry? that these men are entitled to 16s. 6d. per day, it is the duty of the Victorian Government to pay that wage, and of the Commonwealth Government, if it refuses to do so, to take what action may be necessary to compel it to obey the award. Unless this is done, what will be the value of our industrial legislation? If a State Government is permitted to disregard an award, a bad example will be set to private employers and also to employees, who, when they do not get decisions of which they approve, may say, "" The Victorian Government has disregarded an award, why should we not do the same?"" If a settlement is not come to in Sydney to-day-thoug h I hope that it will be-the Commonwealth Government should cite the Victorian Government before the High Court with a view to compelling it to observe the award.

The honourable member for Calare( Mr Lavelle) now seeks, by his amendment, to remove the very essence of it . The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) has, unintentionally, misrepresented the effect of the provision. It is not designed to prevent the public discussion and formulation of grievances, nor will it prevent assemblies of the people to discuss publio grievances, except w it h in the immediate neighbourhood of Parliament House buildings. It provides that it shall not be lawf u l for any meeting of persons exceeding place within the area denned, but, subject to that exception, all public grievances may be discussed in any part of the Commonwealth. There is absolutely no limitation to the free expression of public opinon. hibit deputations coming to Parliament House. good thing if no deputations assembled at Parliament House'. They should be received in the Public Departments presided over by the Ministers whom they desire to see. making any provision to prevent such assemblies at Canberra. a precedent. Under die Victorian Unlawfu l Assemblies and Processions Act of 1890 the State Parliament, which was then meeting in this building, took steps to prohibit meetings near Parliament House. Section3 of that Act providesI t shall not be lawful for any number of .perserve a useful purpose in enabling the sons exceeding fifty to meet in the open air within that part of the city of Melbourne and its suburbs included within a line commencing at the junction of Exhibition-street and Flinders-street, running along Flinders-street and Wellington-parade to Lansdowne-street, thence by Lansdowne-street to Victoria-parade, thence by Victoria-parade to its junction with Exhibition-street, thence by Exhibition-street to the point of starting, including the said streets, for any unlawful purpose or for the purpose or on the pretext of making known their grievances or of discussing public affairs, or .of considering of or preparing or presenting any petition, memorial, complaint,remonstrance, declaration, or other address to Her Majesty or to the Governor or both Houses or either House of the Imperial Parliament or the Parliament of Vietoria. . . . on any day on which the two Houses or either House of .Parliament shall meet and sit or shall be summoned or adjourned or prorogued to meet and sit. It w ill be noticed that the prescribed area is much wider than that set out by us. The principle embodied in the clause is well defined, and is certainly a reasonable one. An y person who desires to make known his grievances can do so in a reasonable way, but it certainly is unwise to encourage tumultuous assemblies in the neighbourhood of Parliament House. W it h gifted orators addressing large crowds from Parliament House steps, the twenty in number to take minds of the people might become in flamed. The object of this clause is to prevent any attempt to overawe the Parliament in its deliberations. Although we have been meeting here for nearly twenty years, it has not been thought necessary before to enact a provision of this kind for the protection of the Parliament. It is evident, therefore, that the Government must have done something to shake public confidence in them, and that they fear that the people may gather in the neighbourhood of Parliament House to give expression to their views concerning them. This is really an insult to the citizens of Melbourne. It suggests that they are so violent that it is not safe to allow them to hold a public meeting for the discussion of a public grievance within a reasonable distance of Parliament House. I do not wish to insult the people of this city. They conduct themselves quite as well a9 do the people of any other city, and I have a very high opinion of them.

I can foresee the end of this measure. Common-sense and liberty-loving people will return men to those benches opposite with sufficient supporters behind them to repeal all this obnoxious legislation. When Sir William Irvine passed his Coercion Bill, I told the people that a Parliament would soon be elected which would take the extreme pleasure of expunging the obnoxious provisions of that the statute-book, and even men who were the colleagues of Sir William Irvine at the time he passed the measure were to be found amongst those who subsequently voted for its repeal. It is absurd to make out that there is danger in a peaceable community from the holding of public meetings. The Government are sowing seeds that may produce a crop which will not be to their liking. me, repulsive measures, instead of having the result desired, will have the very opposite effect. The prohibition of the right to speak in the open air is contrary to the very spirit which moved the Chartists and other great reformers in days gone by. Parliament should not be interrupted in its labours? member ever felt any danger in sitting here ? the sittings of this Parliament there was a violation of our privileges. member for Maribyrnong is a changed man. ber is quite mistaken. I still have the feelings of abhorrence to which I gave expression in 1890, when I was a private citizen and a member of the executive of a union, though my language, perhaps, might not be so extravagant or violent in condemnation of these things. I know that when many citizens, not members of unions, found that public speech was prohibited in a certain area, they joined issue with those who had introduced that legislation, and, so far as.I know, have ever since voted for the Labour party. When we adopt repressive measures which deny the people public and civil rights, we are only increasing the number of agitators, and the numbers of those who will join in asking for a restoration of the privileges of which they are now deprived. I deplore the fact that we are called on to pass this measure, because I know the crop which will ensue from the seeds we are sowing. measure from we ought to be improving on what was done in 1890. I am always prepared to endorse what is old if it is good, but I am equally ready to denounce what is old if it is bad. By this legislation we are not reviving anything good. Instead of increasing the privileges of the people we are decreasing them. sidering this measure we have ' to ask ourselves, What is the genesis These repressive, and, to of this clause?

I said last night that this clause had apparently been drawn with the deliberate purpose of exposing to the danger of a dulged in strong criticism of the Government in power at that particular time. There is this curious verbal difference between the clause and the text books, that whereas Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, and the Encyclopcedia of the Laws of England-whic h first publishes an article on the subject, and afterwards quotes Mr. Justice Stephen-stat e that it is seditious to "" excite disaffection against,the Sovereign, or the Government, ' and ' the Constitution of the United Kingdom,"" the words used in this clause are "" to excite disaffection against the Sovereign, or the Government, ' o r ' Constitution of the United Kingdom"" ; that is declared to be a seditious intention. portant difference. important difference. I ask the Minister whether that alteration has been deliberately made.

If that be done it w ill be made clear, at a l l events, that it is not intended by this clause so to strengthen the hands of tbe Government as to make it an act of sedition to strongly criticise the Government of the day. There is a very material difference between attempting to overthrow the Constitution and attacking the Government for the time being in power. phrasing is exactly the same as that contained in section 44 of the Queensland Criminal Code, in which appear the words "" against the Sovereign or the Government or Constitution of the TJnitedK in gdom."" this instance the Minister is not concerned with the draftsmanship of the Queensland Criminal Code. Queensland legislation is a model which the Governments in most respects might well follow. the Government, however, not to be too obsequious in following the lead even of the Queensland Government, although on general lines they set us a wise example. I leave that point, and ask the Minister to consider it . The next most objectionable part of this clause is in paragraph e, wherein it is declared that to excite disaffection against the connection of the King's Dominions under the Crown is a "" seditious intention."" I realize that the whole-hearted, if somewhat hysterical, Imperialists in this Chamber are not likely to be impressed by my contention that that paragraph should not remain in the clause. I mentioned last night the case of Ireland; but the .time may come when, quite apart from Ireland altogether-when , with reference to India, SouthA f r i c a , or any other part of the [280] Empire-the law-abiding and loyal citizens of the Commonwealth may conceive it to be their public or private duty to declare in favour of the complete indehonorable pendence of any oart of the Empire.

I am not alleging any grievances of an Imperial character other than the one I have already indicated having special reference to Ireland, but I urge that in connection with the government of all these various integral parts of the Empire there might well come a time when it would be not only a right, but also a duty, of a citizen of this country, to express his sympathy with those who desire complete independence, provided, of course-and this is only a proviso-that complete independence is desired by a majority of the persons in the country concerned. In other words, what I am arguing for now is really well expressed in that new-born phrase so much used in connection with the war, namely, the right of self-determination. These are the only matters about which special comment may be made in connection with this clause. I venture to say that the law upon this subject wa6 sufficiently clearly stated and well understood, at all events, as far as it could be understood in the Statutesi n exist-ence, and more particularly in the common law, without bringing it forward in a special measure, exciting, as it necessarily and naturally does, controversy and those feelings of ill-will which, on the face of it , it was designed to prevent.

In fact, we have had exhibitions of it in this House.

The article was not published to give information of any value, but simply to pander to the wishes of a contemptible section community. I hope that the Government will inflict punishment on news^ papers that print articles for such a ,[280]2 Australian newspapers print purpose, and impress-on them the fact that such paragraphs only bring the Sovereign into contempt. I also object to paragraph g of subclause 1, which provides that an intention to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects so as to endanger the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth is a seditious intention. It is There are many persons who avail themselves of the opportunity to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects, and any attempt to prevent them from so doing will be an interference with their He may political liberty. I have a right to express my political opinions, although they may cause ill-feeling and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects by hurting the feelings of another section of the comimunity opposed to my views.

Many unfair punishments have been inflicted upon sections of the community by the putting into force of laws which were supposed to be obsolete. Some day I can imagine a far-seeing gentleman like the Prime Minister or the Treasurer going through these laws and discovering something which will ""down"" their political opponents for the time being. their opponents would be a desire to remove them from the Government bench, they could charge them under this measure with sedition. the Treasurer advocated republicanism again, as he used to do? surer, but many supporters of the Government on the other side of the chamber, have talked republicanism. I believe that the limited monarchy of Great Britain is preferable to the presidential system of the TJnited States of America, or even that of France, but still I am a republican at heart, because I believe that a republican form of government such as I could mould would be better than our monarchical system. For saying that I might be charged with sedition, but I submit that it is not seditious. this Bill were made retrospective? porters of the Government would be locked up,' or worse* The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), for instance, would not be quite so comfortable as he is now. ber suggesting that the Bill should be made retrospective? might desire to see every honourable member opposite removed, I should not like to see any of them hanged, drawn, and quartered. Will any honourable member who reads the clause carefully tell me the need for including it in the Bill? What is the good of it? What is it intended for? It seems to me that it is intended as a drag-net to enable the Government to deal with their political opponents for no other offence than that of desiring to supplant them on the Treasury bench. [8.34] I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation of the wording of the Queensland law, which he has adopted in preference to the wording of ' the British law. I therefore move That in paragraph (b) of sub-section 1 of proposed new section 24A, the word "" or,"" between the words "" Government,"" and "" Constitution,"" be left out with a view to insert Although the only offence of in lieu thereof the word "" and"". The same phrasing occurs in other parts of the proposed new section, but the question can be tested at this point, where it first appears. There is a great deal of difference between discussing the shortcomings of the Government and attempting tb upset the Government and Constitution of the country. Under the English Act, the offence is the doing of something subversive of the Government and Constitution of the realm. It is very doubtful whether, under the form of wording adopted in this Bill, it would not be an offence to criticise severely the Governmentof the day or the members of the Government. If that is so, it is altogether too great a restriction to place upon the rights of a democratic people. If the English form of wording were adopted, it would bring under the penalties of this measure every person who tried to upset Government as Government, because Government is part of the Constitution. Now that the newer phrase has been-adopted in the Bill, the Committee is entitled to some much more weighty reason than has yet been given for the departure from the English model. paragraph, b of sub-section 2 tone it down tremendously. relieve a person of the offence of causing disaffection to the personnel oi the Government, as distinguished from the Government as part of the Constitution.

That does not cover my point at all. The absurdity of the proposal is shown by the fact that, while a man is to be free to criticise fully the administration of justice, he must not criticise the administrations of works and railways. The exemptions will not protect a man in 'criticising the personnel of the Government. They will not permit h i m to criticise the Prime Minister's administration of his Department. There is not a word in them which w ill enable him to criticise the administration of the Wheat Board, or of -metals, or of any 'other bi? ' undertakings of the Government except-. ing the administration of justice, and also excepting legislation. He will be allowed to criticise legislation, but not administration. Sub-section 1 provides that a man shall not criticise the Government as Government. That is altogether too narrow. No part of the clause will give him the righ t to criticise the administration of a Minister, apart from the administration of government. He is not given the righ t to criticise the Government upon any other heads than those set out in sub-section 2: In its present form the clause gives altogether 1 too wide .a power to the Government. The people should not be deprived of the fullest right of criticism of the Government in all its phases. ter for Works and Railways) [8.42] The very best answer to the criticism of the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector -Lamond) is that this provision has been the law in Queensland for many years, :and there has not been a single prosecution under it on the lines which he indicates. Tf he had been a Queenslander, or taken anv part in o p t i o n s in Queensland, he would know that there is a latitude of criticism in that State the extent of which I do not suppose is exceeded in any part of the King's Dominions. It is apparent, therefore, that the section in the Queen land Act does not e apply in the way which the honourable Attention haa been member suggests. The honourable member has, perhaps, been misled by the way in which the word "" g o v e r n m e n t"" is used. Nowadays we are constantly using the word ""government"" in the sense of the persons or individuals who do particular things. The clause allows the freest possible criticism of the administration of every Minister .and adviser of the K in g , because paragraph a of subsection 2 provides that it shall be lawf u l for any person "" to endeavour in good f a i th to show that the Sovereign has been mistaken in any of his counsels."" There is the principle of responsible government. Every Minister is responsible for the advice he gives to the Crown, and every person in the community has the right to offer the fullest criticism of a Minister or Government for any advice tendered by him or them to the Crowni n relation to the administration of public affairs. There is, therefore, not the slightest ground for the objection taken by the honourable member. The meaning of the proposed new .section is clear. It appears to me that the interpretation of tlie word "" Government"" as used in the clause .is "" the .Executive."" This country is governed by an Executive, it is legislated for by a Parliament, ,and its laws are administered by the Justices of the H i g h Court. These organs are all provided for in the Constitution. Their functions are assigned to them under the Constitution', and in the administration . of law generally the Executive must be sustained in its. position. What is aimed at here is to p ut a stop to all movements of a seditious character which have for their purpose the undermining of constituted authority in its administration of the laws of the land. This has nothing to do with the individual acts of Ministers. I would .be properly liable to be criticised if I , as a Minister, were guilty of maladministration. But, at a time when feeling is running high, and when men are trying to play upon that feeling in order to weaken the administration of the law, surely there should be authority such as is provided in this clause. In the law of the United Kingdom there are the words, "" Government and Constitution."" In the Queensland code, however, the phrase is "" Government or Constitution."" ' There is no attempt, in this piece of legislation, to take away from any persons in the community that",50,Pairs
305,,"Mr GROOM (""Darling Downs-Minisright of criticism which should exist if we are to have healthy administration. The difficulty will be, w it h the phraseology of this measure, to secure convictions for sedition; there is a heavy onus thrown upon the Crown to prove any charge of such an offence. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) argued fchat under paragraph g anybody who criticised the Government might be proceeded against on the ground of a seditious intention. Paragraph g does not deal with that phase of the matter at all. It has to do w it h those seditious movements which are launched with a view to set class against class, and undermine the peace, order, or good government of the community. I quote fro m Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law the following words, which are the declared common law of the United Kingdom:To raise discontent or disaffection amongst His Majesty's subjects or to promote feelings of iil-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects. As regards that passage, Halsbury statesThe above statement of the law upon the subject of sedition is taken almost verbatim from Stephen's Digest of Criminal haw, 6th edition, pp. 70, 71, which is partly taken from the Criminal Libel Act 1819. The corresponding passage in the 1st edition of that work, pp. 55, 56, which is in substantially the same terms, was approved and adopted by Cave. J., in It. v. Burns (1886), and by the King's Bench Division in Ireland, in 11. v. McHugh. The offence contemplated by paragraph g is, therefore, embodied in the common law of the United Kingdom. It is embodied also in the Queensland code. We are a Federation, and, assuch, the Federal Government have somewhat more restricted powers than the States. Consequently, we have legislated only within the ambit of our authority. We have, therefore,, added these words, "" so as to endanger the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth."" bodying those additional words? of such a contingency arising in relation to the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. the only power you have under the Con-6titution ? powerwe have; and can the honourable member blame the Government for embodying here that sole ijower? admitted ? lating within the ambit of our author it y. tliese words on some other ground. inserting them because of the limitation of our authority. leave them out? would leave them out.

Now, however, the Minister( Mr Groom) departs from that standpoint in support of the contention, that any one who criticises the Government may render himself liable to be charged with seditious intent. the Queensland authority. The Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England, page 448, describing seditious words, statesIfc is sedition to do any act or to publish any words tending to bring into hatred or contempt the person of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, or the Government and Constitution of thc United Kingdom as by law established, or either House of Parliament.

I want to say a word in favour of the amendment which was forecasted by the nan), who pointed out the reason for adopting it , and which was subsequently moved by the honourable member for I l l a warra ( Mr Hector Lamond). It is proposed to substitute "" a n d "" for "" o r "" in order to make the burden of proof on the person laying the charge a heavier one by calling upon him to show that disaffection has bsen excited, not only against the Government, but also against the Constitution. I thought that the Minister( Mr Groom) might have argued that "" Go-verniment"" and "" C o n s t it u t i o n "" were alternative or synonymous tennis mutually explanatory of one another, but he has not taken up that attitude. I certainly think that the amendment moved would be an improvement to the paragraph. It might be only a slight i m provement, but we cannot expect to get anything b u t slight improvements in a measure of this sort. The Minister regards this as a very meritorious provision, deserving of support, because it has been taken from the Queensland law. It is quite a new experience to me to hear the Government claiming that anything that comes from Queensland is deserving of support. that it carried the weight attaching to the view of the late Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith, seeing that it was taken from his code. Mr RY.AN -There was also a reference to the Labour Government of Queensland not having altered the law, The r e is sufficient and to me, as the late Premier and A t torney-General of the State, not having taken steps to have it altered. Now, the Labour Government of Queensland, while I was Premier of the State, was not able to remedy all the evils that had been committed by Governments during the previous fifty-six years. lo them. may say that. Certainly we did not put this law into operation, and I do not think that if the Labour party came into power in the Commonwealth it would operate the law now proposed to be enacted. Labour Governments do not require adventitious aids of this sort; they should be able to live on their record. It is because of its record that a Labour Goverument still retains power in Queensland. Although the Minister and his colleagues, in December last, went up aud down Australia saying that Labour had made the cost of living higher in Queensland than in any other State of Australia, a report just made by a Royal Commission to the Governor General of the Commonwealth shows that in that State the worker is 10s. a week better off than in any other. listened carefully to the explanation of the Minister regarding the objection of the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr. Lamond), and it did not quite satisfy me as to the advisability of adopting the Queensland verbiage instead of that of the English law. I am at a loss to understand why "" government "" should be disconnected from "" constitution "" in this regard. I understood the Minister to say that the two terms are practically synonymous, and that, therefore, no action could be taken for an offence against one which did not include an offence against tlie other. But the word "" or "" is disjunctive; it distinctly dissociates government from constitution, and, to my mind, its employment makes it possible for action to be taken against criticism of the Government, whether in reference to the Constitution or not. ber had better look out for himself, because of his publication.",56,Pairs

A t any rate, I should prefer a greater degree of safety, and I think that undoubtedly I should be safer under a provision fashioned on the British model than under this fashioned on the Queensland model. We cannot go far wrong if we accept English precedents in a matter of this kind, and, for that reason, I shall support the amendment. am glad to notice that the argument which I opened on this subject, in respect of which the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler), has not been good enough to notice me far, f r u it f u l as to promote a good deal of nutshell, and has read from the authority discussion. Minister( Mr Groom) shall either, in tentionally or otherwise, mislead the Committee as to the real point now to be decided. When the Minister first spoke on the subject, he quoted against members on this side Stephen's Digest, and the common law of England, to show that the present B ill is merely a reproduction thereof; but I had already noticed, and later called his attention to, a very significant point of difference between the texts on which he relied, and the wording of the B ill . It is perfectly clear that the deliberate substitution of "" or "" for "" and "" has either a significant meaning or no meaning at all. If it has a significant meaning, the Minister should admit it , and that meaning must be that he intends, by the substitution, to give a wider meaning to the term "" sedition "" than is accepted by British jurists as sufficient for the Government of the TJnited Kingdom. It is perfectly obvious that the intention of the Minister now is, if there is any reason for the substitution, to place some measure of restraint on persons and newspapers desirous of criticising the GovernI was about to say ment, and, that if the clause becomes law in its present form, it is beyond doubt fchat many members on both sides of the Chamber, should they repeat outside what I was imprudent they have already said here, could be punished, and equally evident that the publishers of many of our newspapers could be successfully indicted under the criminal law. much. enactment a defender of newspaper publishers, nor as the defender of members opposite, b u t even the most insistent loyalists snould desire to stop short of hampering free criticism of the Government of the day.

It is clearly so in The question Queensland. Trial by indictment means trial before a jury.

389,Mr Brennan (Batman) [10.1],"Tthat sedition is a very grave crime. From my reading of the legal text books, I have obtained the same impression, especially as for a number of years I have been sedulously endeavouring to avoid committing thing that it is said to be, surely it is sufficiently grave to warrant its beought not to allow the Government to be ing treated in the same way as other serious offences are treated. I -can imagine what would have happened if honourable members upon this side of the Chamber had argued that the crime of sedition should be a matter for summary jurisdiction by a police court. should have been told that the offence was a very grave one-too grave to allow it to be dealt with in the summary jurisdiction of such a tribunal. members opposite would have asked, "" Why should we place sedition upon a lower plane, from the stand-point of jurisprudence, than is larceny ? "" should have been assured that sedition constitutes an attack upon the very foundations of our civilization, and that therefore we should not permit it to be dealt with summarily. But, because the amendment comes from the Opposition side of the Chamber, I fear that it is not going to receive very much support. I suggest that, as sedition has always been regarded as a very serious offence by jurists of older lands than our own-an offence which has been punishable even by death-it is only fair that it should be placed at least upon the same footing as larceny or embezzlement, or other offences which require to be initiated by indictment, and which give the accused person the right of trial by jury. Why should this matter be left toi the discretion of the Attorney-General, seeing that the offence is, to a large extent, political in character? specially unfitted to deal with it. The Minister has stated that in certain instances the right of trial by jury may be conceded to the accused. But we are not concerned with the intentions of the Ministry, or with the possible effect of this clause in particular cases. We are concerned only with the broad principle as to whether, upon a charge of sedition, an accused person should have the right to be tried by a jury. The clause in its present form will give to the Attorney General, if the prosecutor desires it, the right to determine whether or not the accused person shall be so tried. Mr Brennan. hope that the Minister will gracefully agree to the amendment, just as he did to the amendment submitted by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan). By so acting, he will be doing it. If sedition is everya still greater measure of justice to the Government and to himself. He certainly open to the suspicion that they are animated by political motives in connection with this sub-clause. The Bill which is now before us is one We which, to an extent, will repeal the War Precautions Act, and thus enable us to get back to normal conditions. I have no objection to urge against the proviHonorable sions of the Bill which relate to the treatment of persons who are disloyal to the Empire of which we form a part. Whatever powers were given to the We Executive during the war period-power s the exercise of which resulted in accused persons being punished without even the formality of a trial-were abundantly justified by the conditions which then existed. But in time of peace, there can be no justification for denying any citizen who is charged with the serious crime of sedition the right to be tried by a jury, which is the recognised right of every British subject. I have not one word to say against the Attorney General personally, but I am not prepared to clothe him with the power to say to the police that an accused person shall be tried summarily. If the honourable gentleman were armed with any such power, it would necessarily follow that he would also possess the power to say that an accused person should ibe tried summarily, and the right of a trial by jury denied The Attorney-General is him. We are not legislating solely for the Administration of to-day. We do not know what Government or what Attorney-General may be administering the law upon some occasion in the future when it may be invoked. Are we prepared, then, to give any one individual-eve n though he be the Attorney-General of the Commonwealthpower to send a person for summary trial before a magistrate? If the individual charged were to prefer to plead guilty and be summarily dealt with, well and good. In South Australia there is provision whereby, even though an offender I has in aU circumstances the right of trial",60,Lamond S Amendment Nal Code I T Is Provided That A Person Can

We should be the last people on earth to do anything in the direction of restrict.will meet with the general desire. ing the right of trial by jury. The Government are not now copying the Queensland law, or the law of any State, or of the TJnited Kingdom. They are going out of their way to re-enact legislation which, necessary though it may have been in time of war, nevertheless caused more ill-feeling and turmoil than any other piece of legislation in the history of the Commonwealth. Why, then, in all the circumstances, should we perpetuate such a law in times of peace? Let us demonstrate that this Parliament is really prepared to return, to normal conditions; and let us re-affirm that when any person is alleged to have broken a law of the land, he shall retain the right of trial by jury which would be his in any other part of the British Empire. As for the provision whereby the Attorney-General may send a person for trial before a magistrate, I can only speak in respect of magistrates in my own State. There are some in South Australia before whom I Avould be very sorry to send any man for trial upon any alleged offence whatever. Certain among them have reached a stage where they ought to be retired, because they are no longer fit to carry out their responsible duties. I strongly appeal to the Government to accept the amendment, or to wipe out the whole sub-clause. While discussion has centred around the question whether a person should be sent for summary trial before a magistrate or be permitted to be tried before a jury, it appears to me that it is the Attorney General who will really try all such cases in the first instance. Every matter .must be submitted to the Attorney-General before a decision is reached concerning whether or not an alleged offender shall be prosecuted summarily or be tried before a jury. examines the circumstances and makes up his mind. Thus he pre-judges the case. ter for Works and Railways) [10.16] I have already pointed out that in this subclause the Government are really giving something in the nature of a concession. However, if honourable members feel that there should be preserved in every case the right of trial by jury, I am prepared to move an amendment which, I think, I ask the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), therefore, if he will withdraw his amendment to enable me to move in the direction which I have indicated. ing that the amendment to be moved by the Minister will have a similar effect to that which my amendment seeks, I have no objection to asking leave to withdraw it.

If the amendment is accepted in that form, it will preserve this further rightthat there may be, with the consent of the Attorney-General, a prosecution before an inferior Court.

Amendment agreed to. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [10.22] I have heard no justification for the introduction of this B ill . It is odiou3 and obnoxious. I shall take this opportunity to briefly place on record my strong objection to the present Government of the Commonwealth having a special law passed for the purpose of safeguarding themselves against public criticism. There are old laws at present on the statute-books of the States that at this time are a disgrace to any country, and should long ago have been wiped out. Most State Governments have sufficient public decency to allow them to lie dormant. the Commonwealth, and yet on top of them the Government require Parliament to pass a special law re-enacting obnoxious legislation, and putting the thumb-screw and the rack into it . There are new and novel features included in this B ill , which should be protested against. Many of the most important provisions of the B ill are to be operative on the ipse dixi t of one man-the Attorney-General. The probabilities are that in some time of special trial and strong feeling that one man may be the present Prime Minister, who has shown his gross partiality in administering legislation of this kind. That such a power should be handed over to a dictator and petty tyrant such as the PrimeM in ister is a gross reflection on this Parliament. of order. I ask whether the honourable member's remarks are relevant to the clause before the Committee, and whether the language he has used should be applied to the Prime Ministeri n this chamber. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Fleming) -S of a r the honourable member for Cook has referred to powers proposed to be vested in the Attorney General, but his personal remarks conI am satisfied if , under cerning the Prime Minister should be withdrawn. MrJ . H . CATTS -If it is necessary under the rules of the House that I should withdraw them, I do so. are true. I have no objection to the Mr J. H . CATTS -Thei r truth or otherwise has nothing to do with the matter when an honourable member is ordered to withdraw statements made in Parliament. We all know that. I propose to place on record in Hansard, where the people w ill have an opportunity of reading them, some of the provisions of the legislation which we are in this B ill being asked to enact. The people generally do not have an opportunity to see the provisions of the Bills which are considered by Parliament. They are passed into law, and the people generally do not know the details of measures Parliament has dealt with. It is necessary that there should be some widespread publication of this obnoxious legislation. If there is one thing which, more than another, w ill damn this GoThese laws are available to vernment and those who are supporting this legislation, it will be that the publio should know that this Parliament is being asked to re-enact 'this tyrannical legislation on the top of existing laws which give the Government power, practically, to drag any public man by the scruff of the neck into the Courts of this country who dares to criticise them for the most obnoxious and odious administration. This Parliament, on top. of existing legislation, is now engaged in legislating to make it an offence for any person(a) to bring the Sovereign into hatred or contempt; (6) to excite disaffection against the Sovereign or the Government or Constitution of the United Kingdom, or against either House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom; (c) to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of any of the King's Dominions;",62,Lamond S Amendment Nal Code I T Is Provided That A Person Can

CATTS -Unde r sub-section 2 of proposed new section 24A it is provided that it shall be lawful for any person f o endeavour in good f a i th to show certain things. A f t e r setting out to suppress public criticism on public affairs, there is a pretence at making some qualification of this despotism. But who is to be the judge of good faith ? Then, again, in proposed new sub-section 24B, it is declared that a seditious enterprise is an enterprise undertaken in order to carry out a seditious intention. and any one of the above acts constitutes sedition. It is further provided thatAny person who(a) engages in or agrees or undertakes to engage in a seditious enterprise; (6) conspires with any person to carry out a seditious enterprise; (s) counsels, advises, or attempts to prosuch a matter Probably, no criticism of cure the carrying out of a seditious the balance-sheet w ill be allowed, since a enterprise, shall be guilty of an indictable offence. Proposed new section 24E declares thatAn offence under either of the last two preceding sections shall be punishable either on indictment or summarily, but shall not be prosecuted summarily without the consent of thu Attorney-General. Here, then, we have a list of offences created by the Government. There may be some matters affecting the Government to which I wish to call public attention, but the probabilities are that if I attempt to do so the Government, under this B ill , will be able to prevent their public discussion. risk of such a public discussion at a public meeting the minions of the law, the long arm of the Commonwealth, the mighty power of the Commonwealth administration, would be following h i m u p and down the country just as some of us were followed during the late war. It would be impossible to tell the people what occurred in the Ready case-t d say how the Government got at a member out of the Senate when it was held up for want of a majority in that House, and its very existence was threatened. would be held to be inciting disaffection against the Government to speak of the tactics resorted to by them in order to get a member out of the Senate, and to secure the return of another holding different political opinions. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Fleming) -Order! i That matter has nothing to do with the clause under consideration. MrJ . H . CATTS I submit, sir, that it has. Clause 10 declares it to be an offence to incite disaffection against the Government or either House of the Parliament. All these matters of administration are thus brought within its repressive scope. There must be no criticism of the sale of our primary products during the war that might be calculated to bring the Government and the Parliament into hatred or contempt. The primary producers may be robbed of hundreds of millions of pounds in connection w i th the sale of their wool and wheat, but there can be no criticism of punishment of three years' imprisonment is provided for in the case of any person who "" writes, prints, utters or publishes any seditious words."" In order that the Government may review what is printed and published in newspapers and pamphlets it will be necessary to have censorship regulations. Such regulations w ill be required to enable them to police these publications under this Act. And so we shall have the censorship once more. What occurred under the censorship regulations during the war? A t a farmers' conference held at Ouyen, for instance, the Government were criticised, and it If a public man attempted the was shown that some of the money of the farmers passing through the Wheat Pool was going in a wrong direction. A report of that meeting was sent to the Melbourne Age, but the censor censored the whole report, and directed that the public of Australia should not know the facts as they were given at that farmers' conference by the representative of the farmers on the Wheat Board. A r e we to allow that system to be re-enacted under this obnoxious Bill? Under the censorship system in New South Wales the military were marched It down to Macdonnell House where I was in charge of the Labour campaign, and a demand was made that every circular intended for issueto the branch Labour organizations throughout the State, giving them instructions in connection with the political campaign, should first of all pass through the hands of the Government Censor. I was prosecuted on several occasions. one occasion, however, when I was not prosecuted, although I defied the Censor to his face. I told' him that in no circumstances would those circulars be made available to the Government who were conducting a campaign against us. Could anything measure the infamy of such an administration ? The honourable member for Barrier( Mr( Mr Fleming) I draw the honourable Considine) reminds me that the military were also marched into this building to seize and suppress reprints of my speeches containing inconvenient criticism of the 10. Government. of order. Have these remarks anything whatever to do with the clause? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The clause is a far-reaching one, allowing wide latitude, and I think the honourable member for Cook( Mr J. H . Catts) is within his rights. Mr J. H . CATTS I can well understand the restiveness of the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond), having regard to his past professions. ""When the miners of Illawarra learn of the legislation that he is assistvernment. ing in passing to-night, we know what will be their attitude. majority than ever. Mr J. H . 'CATTS -Will he? Are we going to prevent the public discussion of such transactions as the purchase of Â£3,000,000 worth of shipping without the approval of Parliament, or the letting of contracts to American shipbuilders, which resulted in our being supplied with vessels pleader for the Government. The honorthat were so unseaworthy that they had to be sold at great loss to the people of this country? Are we to permit suppression of discussion on such matters as the effort to sell vessels to the Government at great loss to the community, but to the great profit of a particular firm? Are we to permit the suppression of all reference to the administration of Cockatoo Dock, which presents such a great scandal at the present time? At that dock, men are being given money, Â£100 at a time, which they feel themselves they are not earning, and are permitted to walk away with ? Are all such matters not to be criticised? Are we to have There was more censorship, and further interference with the newspapers? vision in the Bill for censorship. Mr J. H . CATTS -There is provision for an oversight of printed and published matter. The TEMPORARY CHAIRM AN member's attention to the fact that we have already dealt with that matter in clause 9, and have now before us clause Mr J. H . OATTS -Then I direct your attention, Mr Fleming, to that subclause of clause 10 which makes it an offence for any person to print or publish auy seditious words relating to such matters as those to which I have referred. The Government have power' to make -regulations to .police this measure, and under those regulations the Government may, if it so desire, and no doubt will, introduce a new censorship over all mattei"" which they consider to be seditious.

CATTS -And it is my duty not to permit my opposition to this scandalous Bill to be side-tracked by a special able gentleman is not here to interpret the provisions of any measure for me; it is my duty to submit my own case. I can give another illustration, from my own experience, of the maladministration of the Government during the war. I had a letter from a soldier at the Front, who was a resident of my electorate, telling me that he had been transferred to the Sixth Division, and he forwarded me a Christmas card bearing the colours of that division. On that authority I stated at a public meeting that a sixth division had been formed, and the Government",64,Lamond Criticis M May Order That The Prime Minister May Con

417,Mr Groom,"It is my duty to correctpr.osecuted me for telling a falsehood. I had that letter aud card iu Court to support my statement, but under the rules of evidence I was not permitted to produce them; and a military officer stepped into 'the box, and swore that a sixth division had never been formed. On that officer's evidence a conviction was recorded against me. Are we to have a repetition of prosecutions of that kind, by means of which the Government may really fix up a conviction, for that is what it really amounts to? not lay an information against the oflicer for perjury? Mr J. H . CATTS -An information could not be laid, because the Government absolutely refused to initiate a prosecution. What proof had I of perjury, anyhow? There was the soldier's letter aud card, .but these were not accepted as legal evidence against the perjured evidence of a military officer. We cannot get officers to swear one against the other; and the only evidence I had, which I knew to be authentic, was refused. The Government prosecuted me seven times, but it is significant that there never was a prosecution, initialed against me when I had my own shorthandwriters at my meetings. It was only when I was found to be without my private shorthand-writers, and tliere was,, therefore, no possibility of contradicting the military evidence, that it was sought to obtain a conviction against me. When I put an advertisement in the press calling for shorthand volunteers to come to my assistance, I was able to have two of them every night on my platform in order to insure that no injustice could be done; and the prosecutions immediately ceased. That is the kind of administration that we shall have under this Bill. On the other hand, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) could, during the war, make practically any statement he chose. He could libel and maliciously scandalize all and sundry with He spoke of "" Germany's mouth"" at people's ""ears,"" ""Germany's hand"" in their "" palm,"" and "" German gold"" in their pockets; and theu he passed' a regulation which prevented any prosecution of himself for libel. Mr J. B. Catts. Minister libelled men who sit on this side of the House, and, with a special law, protected himself against any action. Is that the kind of administration we are to have under this Bill? I have mentioned the partisan administration of the Government in several cases. When the Leader of the Labour party, and the organizations of the party in the various States, called upon the Government to initiate prosecutions for gross and palpable breaches of its own law, the Government absolutely refused to proceed against any one on their side, though always ready to proceed against members of the Labour party. I desire to put ou record the perversions of the law which this so-called enlightened Government are placing on the statute-book. Such measures as this are absolutely unnecessary-nav e not the slightest justification. No evidence has been brought forward to show that the existing law is not sufficient. The probability is that the Government appreciate that their own administration may drive the. masses of this country to disorder; and are, therefore, getting ready legislation to meet such a contingency. That, it appears to me, can be the only justification for a. measure of this kind. The Government may think that at this moment of inflamed passions on one or two points they have a little public sympathy with them, but I feel confident that the Democracy of this country, when it realizes the full iniquity of this Bill, will take an early opportunity to sweep the Government out of office. The Government are. pretending that they are repealing the War Precautions Act; but, in my opinion, if there could be anything more obnoxious than that Act, it is the Bill before us. This is not a proposal to repeal an obnoxious measure in order to bring us back to pre-war conditions, but a measure which only shows how impossible it is to wrest from, the Government the eximpugnity. traordinary and tyrannical powers they were permitted to assume during the war.

MrM c WILLIA MS (Franklin) [11.6]. It seems to me that this clause opens the way to compulsory borrowing. pistol. at the heads of the municipal bodies. The last two loans have been to a considerable extent compulsory. The municipal bodies of Australia have funds which they may invest, and if we empower them to invest these funds in Commonwealth stock, there is nothing to prevent the Treasurer from issuing a compulsory loan, and compelling them to put their money into it , whether they desire to do so or not. I am not prepared to assist further borrowing, and I think that the position which it is sought to create is an exceedingly dangerous one. A glance at the Argus list will show that at the present time Commonwealth loans return in interest to can be borrowed privately on mortgage at 6 per cent. Yesterday, as a trustee, I signed a mortgage on property in Melbourne for an advance of Â£2,50 0 for three years at 6 ner cent. The money was borrowed from a nnancial institution. A f t e r the transaction I asked how it was negotiating for a loan in America, and I that when its funds could be invested in Commonwealth stock for a return of 1 \ per cent., they were willing to lend on mortgage at 6 per cent. The answer I received was that it was easier to finance on mortgage than on Commonwealth loans. For the first time in the history of a British community we find that the credit of a mortgage is considered a better security on the financial market than Government stock. I have said in this House before that we have reached the Plimsoll mark in the matter of borrowing, I do not mind a and only the other day we received an in timation from the British Government that it was not advisable for Australia to I am content to go on the London market for short-dated loans. Surely that was an intimation that the Government should ' ' keep off the grass."" MrM c WILLIAMS I have endeavoured to obtain the reason from financial experts, and they have informed me that no sane Government would endeavour to place long-dated loans on the money market at present, and, therefore, when we get an intimation not to place short-dated loans on the market, it is surely a direction to stop borrowing. is placing a period of fifteen years on his own loans.

If the Treasurer will now inform the House that there shall be no loans floated before Parliament re-assembles, except for repatriation purposes, I shall accept this clause without any objection. The Treasurer has said that my proposal would be tbe means of abolishing the Repatriation Department, unless taxation can be increased to the extent of Â£20,000,000. If the Treasurer will give the House an assurance that loans to be raised will be only for repatriation purposes, I shall be satisfied. undertaking you require. to accept a mere statement on the lines I have indicated. However undesirable it may be to go on the money market, our promise to the soldiers must be kept. If loans are to be raised for ordinary purposes, such as we have floated from time to time, I do not intend to assist the Government in the slightest degree by increasing their facilities to borrow. This practice of borrowing must sooner or later be stopped. There are tens of thousands of men in Australia whose financial position has, been saved by their bank manager informing tbem it was time they called a halt. The time has come for this House to tell the Government that they, too, must call a halt in borrowing for ordinary purposes, and unless the Treasurer gives the assurance I have sought, I will divide the Committee. not like this clause, and I question very much whether we have the power under the Constitution to make a law that will override a State Statute. laws relating to the borrowing of money. power, I do not know that we should do it. The clause reads12. Notwithstanding anything contained in any law of the Commonwealth or a State, any Municipality, Harbor Trust, or Board, or Marine Board, or local governing body may(a) invest in any loan raised by the Government of the Commonwealth . . That is the portion to which I take exception, because I do not think we have any right to pass a law thab will interfere with State laws controlling local governing bodies. I am not a constitutional lawyer, but I do not think we have the power, and even if we have, we should not exercise it . honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) has to a large extent voiced the only feeling I have in regard to this proposal. If the word "" shall"" was where the word ""may"" is in the first part of the clause, I would oppose it. I regard it as an invasion of State rights, and of a very particular right, too, because each State may have certain laws and regulations for the development of its own territory, whereas this Act will override all those laws, and exonerate any of the bodies mentioned from the necessity of investing their money in State securities. On. the other hand, there is the fact that municipalities and Harbor Trusts and Boards within a State will certainly give some preference to their own State before they invest in Commonwealth securities. They may have surplus money to invest, and I hold that they could not invest it in any better cause than a Commonwealth loan, but the State may seriously want money'also, and this provision would be a way out for such municipality, Harbor Trust, or Board to set the State aside and invest its money in a Commonwealth loan, which it would not now be entitled to do under State legislation. I have not had time to consider the real aspects of the proposal from every stand-point, but I can see in the clause a possible intrusion of a serious nature upon State rights.",69,Paibs
