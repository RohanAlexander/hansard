I disagree with the view of the honourable Those opposite sometimes forget that we put member for Moncrieff that the Government forward to the Opposition-not under this has lost its appetite for reform. Part of the Prime Minister but his predecessor........ what was problem that we confront now is not that we the product of a considerable amount of have lost our appetite-we have not; we are deliberation on our side of the House as to an extraordinarily active government as far as how Question Time should operate.

Only eight would be available once a week. There would shadow Ministers have got questions together be an opportunity to question those Ministers in the Budget session to date and it is almost over that time. This proposition was rejected over. I am sure there are sound reasons in for reasons that are entirely a matter for those terms of Opposition tactics as to why this opposite. One thing that we will not be doing should have occurred. is altering Question Time without the agreeThere is a grizzle to the Government about ment of the Opposition. In our view, that Question Time. I may be corrected on this, would be untoward: we would not make those but in the life of this Parliament I have never substantial radical changes. seen a backbenchers' question day. I have I think it was a great shame that the Opposeen a period in which the Opposition front sition did not agree to our proposition. What bench has limited itself in its questioning, and we have is a situation-it is not unique to this perhaps two or three times in the life of this Government-where 80 per cent of Ministers Parliament, I have seen Opposition backscarcely field a question. Of those 80 per cent benchers rise to ask questions after about four of Ministers who scarcely field a question, it or five questions from the Opposition front is pretty clear-cut that they have had a discusbench. Before pots call kettles black, the sion with an honourable member on this side Opposition might like to review with its back of the House in an attempt to get something bench members their opportunities for asking up for presentation in order to get a point questions.
