From The Acting Treasurer When The Sec","tions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act providing for the payment of invalid pensions will be brought into operation,, and the manner in which applications forsuch pensions have to be made? When will, the necessary proclamation be issued? receiving attention recently. It is intended that the proclamation shall be issued sufficiently early to allow the first payment of invalid pensions to be made on 15th December, and a ""second before the new year, and regulations are being prepared accordingly. Applications may be made at once to the Commissioner for Invalid and Old-age Pensions, or to his deputies in any of the States. It is the intention of trie Department to recognise, as far as possible, the certificates already issued to invalids in some of the States, though probably triepayments will be different, because the Commonwealth Act is, generally speaking,, more liberal than most of the State Acts. When the proclamation bringing into forcethe invalid sections of the Act is issued,, a proclamation allowing the payment oÂ£ old-age pensions to women at the age of sixty, instead, as now, at the age of sixty* five, will be issued. A general outline of the intentions of the Government in this, respect was given by the Treasurer in his. Budget speech. communications from persons desirous of applying for invalid pensions, and therefore I ask the Acting' Treasurer if he will make some public announcement as: to where application forms may be obtained. As only seven or eight weeks Willi, elapse before the invalid provisions of the law are brought into effect, application forms should be available at once. If they are not, many persons eligible for invalid pensions will be unable to receive them on the first date of payment. attention, and, as soon as possible, one common form will be issued for use all over",14,Setup

Government has stated that it will pay invalid pensions on a particular date, and reduce the age limit at which women are eligible for pensions, and these reforms will be brought about years before they would have been achieved had the public had to rely on my honourable friends opposite. Acting Treasurer had under his notice the case of blind persons, who, in New South Wales, I understand, were not eligible for invalid pensions? Will they be eligible under our Act? not now inmates of State institutions, or institutions supported by the State"", and are sion. not in possession of property or income, and are unable to earn a living, will be eligible for invalid pensions. Treasurer take an early opportunity to explain to the House why the Government has departed from its emphatic declarations in the country that it would pay pensions to males at the age of sixty years, and to females at the age of fifty-five years ? that promise has been definitely made. We are particularly sympathetic in regard to the payment of pensions, and have made a big advance by reducing the age at which women are eligible for old-age pensions from sixty-five to sixty years. I hope that that will not be the last .step which we shall take in the direction of reform. ther, if those who are now inmates of blind institutions supported by the State, choose to leave them, they will become eligible for invalid pensions? Will the fact that a blind person has been the inmate of a Government institution debar him from receiving an invalid pension? a wide field for consideration, and I should not like to reply to it until I have given more attention to the matter. ing Treasurer whether provision is likely to be made for the payment of invalid pensions to persons who, although in good health, arc unable to follow any employment owing to the loss of a limb? person has lost a limb, or has been injured in any other way, will be treated on its merits -In all probability those who, as the direct result of the loss of a limb, are prevented from earning the maximum sum mentioned in the schedule, will be regarded as entitled to some consideration. surer, in framing regulations under the Old-age Pensions Act, consider the claims of applicants for old-age pensions who have been resident in Australia for forty years, but who, because of an absence, say, in New Zealand, for two years, are debarred from receiving'old-age pensions. I know of a man who, although he came to Australia forty years ago, and, with the exception of a two years' absence in New Zealand, has remained continuously in the Commonwealth, has been denied a penyears from the Commonwealth during a term of forty years' residence would certainly not disentitle a person to receive an old-age pension. that it does. made provision for the payment of invalid pensions to persons suffering from miners' complaint ? sult of following an unhealthy occupation, have become permanently invalided by the contraction of such a disease as the dread complaint to which the honourable member has referred, will certainly be brought within the provisions of that part of the Act which relates to payment of invalid pensions.

We are practically asked by these proposals to look at the fundamental provisions of our instrument of government, and to see whether its underlying principles are those best adapted to the well-being of the people of Australia. The keynote of the whole of our Constitution is found in the first few words, where it is stated thatWhereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessings of A l mighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth. The words "" indissoluble Federal Commonwealth "" indicate the underlying principle now to consider not a question of CommonThe maintenance of the State Governments, says the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Texas v. Whiteis as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National Government. The Constitution in all its provisions looks to an indestructible union composed of indestructible States. Our union, then, is distinctly Federal in its nature, and, being Federal, was distinctly and specially adapted to meet the needs of the Australian people. The Australian Constitution did not arise from a mere academic debate. It arose from the conditions of the Australian people at the time. The British people have a genius for government; and the method by which they proceed is always to examine the nature of the problem, and then, out of their practical experience, to devise a form of government best adapted to the needs of the situation. The Federal principle was mooted early in Australian history. In 1847, Earl Grey, in a despatch, suggested a form of Federal union. He contemplated a central authority to consider "" questions which, though local as respectsthe British possessions of Australia collectively, are not merely local as respects any one of those possessions."" Fiftythree years elapsed before the objects of In dealing with matters of this that memorandum were attained. Earl Grey desired to have common regulations for "" the conveyance of letters and the formation of roads, railways, and other internal communications traversing any two or more such Colonies,"" together with common duties and common commercial regulations. But the time for Federationwas not ripe; Australia was then movingtowards the separation of the continent into distinct self-governing areas. For a period of fifty years the energies and activities of the Australian people were devoted to building up their local States under thefull powers of government they possessed; and, obviously, their attention being thus directed, the broader question of national' union was not urgently pressing on them-",20,Public Service Increments

78,Mr Groom (Darling Downs) [11.12].,"Yet, as time went on, the necessity for closer union was becoming every day more apparent in the minds of Australian statesmen. colonies of common origin treating each other as hostile countries. questions arose which indicated the need for closer union. which the States could combine for common action could not have been better stated than they were by Sir Henry Parkes in his resolutions of 1891, as submitted to the Convention1. That the powers and privileges and existing territorial rights of the several existing Colonies shall remain intact, except in respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as necessary and incidental to the power and authority of the National Federal Government. 2. That the trade and intercourse between the federated Colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal navigation, shall be absolutely free. 3. That the power and authority to impose Customs duties shall be exclusively lodged in the Federal Government and Parliament, subject to such disposal of the revenues thence derived as shall be agreed upon. 4. That the military and naval defence of Australia shall be entrusted to Federal forces, under one command. These four general propositions were accepted by the Commonwealth in 1900, and the underlying principle was the formation of a Federal union which would meet the practical needs of the time-brin g together the Colonies in closer bonds as regards trade and commerce, open up the highways, establish defence, and thereby create a National Government. What was essential for National union was delegated to the National Parliament; but the States were left as sovereign bodies. National needs demanded a sovereign National Parliament. State Parliaments. I may say at the outset that I always have been, and always shall be, an enthusiastic supporter of all that tends to Federal union. It was realized that there should be a real and permanent union; and the only question was how that should be attained. The answer was a union arising out of our own needs, and not slavishly following the model of any other country. It was decided, however, that the union should be based on the American model; and it is idle for honourable members to sneer at that model, and contemptuously call it a "" Yankee Constitution."" That Constitution was devised by Alexander Hamilton, who is recognised by all authorities as, perhaps, the greatest political genius the world has ever seen. But how did he proceed to solve the probThere were six different lem? He first investigated the troubles in his own country, realizing the necessity Yet certain for a national union under a constitution which, while it would give full and comThe three points on plete play to local conditions, would, at the same time, create a union so strong that, in tlie conflict of nations, it would be able to hold its own. He succeeded ; and the result is to-day one of the most powerful nations in the world. But Australia did not slavishly follow the American model, though we adopted the underlying principle, creating two sovereignties-that of the Commonwealth and that of the States. Our Constitution delegates to the National Government as much power as is absolutely essential for the preservation of a Federal union. To that end the statesmen of the day thoroughly investigated the needs of Australia, and, as a matter of fact, gave greater power to the central authority than is the case in the United States. Further, they recognised the necessity of a more elastic Constitution, and although our Constitution is rigid so far as concerns the preservation of the principle of Federalism, it is sufficiently flexible to be an instrument adaptable to the changing needs of the people. The Federal principle of the American Constitution is clearly described by Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Gibbons v. OgdenThe genius and character of the whole Government seems to be that its action is to be applied to all the external actions of the nation, and to those internal concerns which affect the States generally; but not to those which are Local needs demanded sovereign completely within a particular State, which do not affect otheT States, and with which it is not necessary to interfere for the purposes of executing some of the general powers of Government. The completely internal commerce of a State, then, may be considered as reserved for the State itself. In creating our Constitution we considered the conditions of our own people only; and although we were wise enough to adopt many of the. provisions of the United"" States Constitution, the powers of the central authority were determined with a' view to our own needs. For instance, power was given to the Commonwealth to deal with old-age pensions, industrial disputes extending beyond a State, and other matters, which indicate the growth of a Democratic national spirit, and a desire to deal with social problems that was not ment of the Constitution simply bedreamed of when the Constitution of the cause one or two ""States have refused to United States was framed. Mr W. J. JOHNSON I desire to Wages Boards do not exist, the question call attention to the state of the House.

Speaking of something radically wrong with the structure and those very powers, Dicey saysWhat may be the working of new institutions no one will venture confidently to predict; but a critic of Constitutions may entertain the hope that Australian statesmanship has accomplished the feat of framing a policy which'^hall have the merits both of a rigid and a flexible Constitution, which cannot hastily be changed, but yet admits of very easy amendment whenever alteration or reform is demanded by the deliberate voice of the nation. It will be seen, therefore, that the Constitution is of a flexible nature, giving the national authority power to deal with problems as they .arise, provided, as Dicey points out, that amendment is the result of the deliberate voice of the nation. Before any alteration is made in the Federal Constitution we should, however, closely investigate the evil alleged to exist, and then ask ourselves whether it presents a case for an amendment-whethe r the problem is national or local. The problem which all federalized nations have to solve is how to secure an efficient central government and preserve national unity while allowing free scope for the diversities and free play to the authorities of the members of the Federation. That is, when there is a Federal Government and certain problems arise, we have to ask whether those problems are national, or whether they are such that the States should deal widi them. If they are matters with which the States should deal, the answer is clear, if they have become national, and the Federal authority has no power to deal with them, the answer is equally clear-a n amendment of the Constitution must be sought. the Constitution that we should take such a drastic step as an amendpass some local law. Where in a State must be asked, Is the absence due to a defect in the State Constitution? If the No Constitution ought to be Federal Constitution, the proper remedy Their (the several States) failure to correct operation of their Governments, that they have failed to be sensitive and efficient instruments for the creation and realization of popular opinion-the real function of Constitutional Governments. If a State Government is not capable of dealing with matters essentially local, and does not respond quickly and easily to local public opinion, its Constitution should be altered, so that the ready expression of popular opinion may be obtained. The mere blocking of a social reform by a State Parliament is not justification for the alteration of the Federal Constitution. The chief reason why some honourable members opposite ask for the extension of our Federal powers is, not that that is necessary because uniformity is essential, but because reforms are being blocked by some of the State Legislatures. There must be stronger justification than that. There is also a danger of overloading the National ParliaBryce saysment. If we continue to increase the powers of the Federation, this Parliament will be as overburdened as is that of the United Kingdom, or the Congress of the United States. I am informed that, in 1905, 309 Bills were introduced into the British Parliament, of which only twenty-three were passed. In 1906, 383 were introduced, and fifty-eight passed; in 1907, 336 were introduced, and fifty-six passed; and in 1908, 412 were introduced, and sixtynine passed. When power' is unduly centralized a grievous wrong is done to the people, as necessary reforms-are delayed.

79,Mr Groom,"We distinctly recognised ground is taken that a Legislative Councilthe British Parliament to legislate adequately for the local affairs of Scotland, Ireland, England, or Wales. We do not desire a central authority so overweighted as to become an inefficient instrument of legislation. The problem is how ic adjust the relations between the central and local powers in order to secure the best government.

Comparison with the House is best made by figures for the second session, at which senators brought in three hundred and thirty-seven Bills and Representatives five hundred and ninety-four. In 1861-1863 senators introduced seven hundred and fifteen, Representatives nine hundred and fifty-one; in 1881-1883 senators two thousand six hundred and fifty-two, Representatives eight thousand and fifty-two; in 1895-1897, senators three thousand nine hundred and forty-five, Representatives ten thousand six hundred and thirty-nine. Those statements indicate what may happen to this Parliament if the Federal legislative power is too greatly enlarged. mad. Bills introduced into the British Parliament were all public Bills.

But all these matters must be considered apart from party politics and partisan feeling. A disappointed party which cannot get its way in a State Parliament has no right to try to alter the Constitution to effect its object by means of the Federal Parliament, irrespective of its suitability to be dealt with as a national problem. If the wide-sweeping powers now asked for are vested in this Parliament, the tendency will be to paralyze its usefulness. Legislation is being more and more increased, the modern tendency being to define powers and make The attempt at blems to face, in regard to which one writer saysOur experience then of the actual work of Original Government in South Africa points to the conclusion that hard and fast vertical lines dividing national from local functions are a mistake, and that we should be rash to schedule any function as one which a National Government should be forbidden to touch. The writer points out that it will be necessary in their legislation to prevent the overweighting of the central Government. But we have to solve our own problems in the light of our own Constitution. Unification for South Africa does not prove the wisdom of its application to Australia. To-day we are asked to amend the Constitution infivedistinct particulars : -as-to trade and commerce; corporations; combinations; and trusts; industrial powers and the nationalization of monopolies; and we must ask in each instance if a case has been made out for the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth. As to trade and commerce, have any practical difficulties been shown justifying a transfer of power? One of the objects of Federation was to remove all hindrances to Inter-State trade, and they have been swept away. Has any difficulty been experienced during the last decade in providing for freedom from experience, I say that the only difficulties of administration we have had have Whenever it can been in regard to trusts and combines, with which we cannot deal while their operations are confined within the limits of a State. We are not now asked merely to deal with that difficulty, but to sanction the transfer of all power regarding trade and commerce to the Commonwealth.

If it were shown to read only the last, as reported at page be necessary for the proper control of trade 5 5 8and commerce to extend our present power, I should be agreeable to such an extension, commerce,"" especially the English words ""trade but that has not been done. We are told that we should make this change so as to bring ourselves into line with the Dominion of Canada. As a matter of fact, the Canadian power in this regard has not been fairly stated. It is correct to say that the Dominion Parliament has power, under section 9.1 of their Constitution, to regulate trade and commerce, but the provincial Legislatures have also vested in them the exclusive power to make laws -relating to municipal institutions, shops, saloons, taverns, and auctioneers' and other licences, in order to raise revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes, the -incorporation of companies with provincial objects, property and civil rights in the province, and, generally, all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province. The result of the interpretation -of the Canadian trade and commerce -power has been to make it approximate to that under the Commonwealth Constitu-tion. Here are a few decisions by learned Judges, as given at page 555, of Lefroy's Legislative Power in Canada, in regard to the meaning of "" regulation of trade and commerce''Thus it has been said the "" regulation of trade have powers to make efficient all the and commerce"" in No. 2 of section 91 means "" The regulation of trade and commerce in the Dominion,"" which is "" a very distinct thing from the individual trades or callings of persons subject to the municipal government of cities."" : per Johnson, J.

"" The general features, and not the minute and trifling subjects which might otherwise be as included "" : per Henry, J. "" General regulations of trade between the States, but not internal regulations and local one province or within any one in the province"": per Tessier, J. "" The regulation of commerce in the wide regulations affecting purely internal com"" : per Mackay, J. "" Commerce in a national point of view"" : "" Regulations relating to trade and commerce their general and quasi-national sense, and not to the contracts or conduct of particular "" Trade' and commerce in a general way."" and commerce in its broad and large It is manifest that by the words "" traffic et and commerce,"" it was intended to express legislation over the general interests of commerce which relate to the whole Dominion of Canada, the mode of importing and exporting merchandise, the storing of this merchandise in towns so as to protect the Customs, entire prohibition in certain cases for the general protection of the commerce of the Dominion; but not special laws of provincial legislatures, which do nothing more than regulate the mode of selling and trading in certain matters of a merely local nature in the province. These cases indicate that the Canadian power is not as wide as that sought by this proposed amendment of the Constitution. If it be agreed to, the Commonwealth will, apparently, be empowered to take over and regulate all private businesses and trades, and also to deal with navigation, and the regulation of State railways. It will have full and complete control of all these agencies, so far as they are instruments of trade and commerce. The Government are asking for a wider sweep than Canada apparently, possesses, and a comparison with the Canadian Constitution is, therefore, not in point. When we look at our own Constitution we find that not only have we power to deal with trade and commerce ""with other countries and among the States,"" but that we agencies of Inter-State trade and commerce, and that no difficulty has arisen in connection with them. A man in one State can enter into a contract with a man of another State by means of our uniform post and telegraph services, and when such a contract is made, the regulation of the transport between the States is a matter entirely under the control of the Commonwealth, whether it be by railway or by means of navigation. As to the terms of the contract there can be no. difficulty. The whole position in regard to the law of contract as between a citizen of one State and a citizen of another State is clearly understood. Nor can there be any difficulty regarding the terms of payment. The Commonwealth can make laws in regard to currency, coinage, and legal tender, bills of exchange, and promissory notes. We have established an Australian note system, and we have complete power under the Constitution to deal with banking. agencies for enforcing judgments obtained by citizens in one State against citizens in another State, and we have power to make laws with regard to the service and execution of civil processes, and with regard to bankruptcy. ficulty has yet in regard to any of these matters, to justify the transfer of this broad power to the Commonwealth. As to our power to deal with corporations, I should like to see passed as soon as possible a uniform Companies Act. When I held office as' Attorney-General, instructions were given for the preparation of such a measure; but it was impossible at the time to define the exact constitutional position. The Commonwealth Government could not say definitely what powers it possessed in this regard, but these were clearly laid down subsequently by the decision of the High Court in Huddart, Parker, and Co. v. Moorehead, 8 C.L.R. In giving judgment in that case, Mr Justice Higgins pointed out what the Commonwealth powers are with respect to corporations. He said that he would not care to attempt a final exhaustive definition, but he pointed out, amongst other things, that there was no express power on the part of the Commonwealth to incorporate companies; such power as it possessed was an implied power. May I frankly confess that I should like to see the Commonwealth vested with express power, and also with power to deal with the dissolution of companies ? We do not need such a wide power as is asked for in this Bill, but I should certainly like to see the Commonwealth given clear power to regulate the formation of Australian companies, so that the incorporation of a company would leave it free to carry on its operations all over the States, just as any Australian citizen may do. We should, have power to enable State corporations to be converted into Federal corporations, and we should also have power to define their status and their capacity, and to regulate the terms of their dissolution. There should be one uniform winding up throughout Australia, so that Australian creditorsmay all be dealt with on the same basis. of the power of the Commonwealth. way in this direction, but I should be prepared to support an amendment enabling us to deal effectively with legislation of that We have legislated to provide class. That, however, is not asked for in. this Bill. The Bill asks for somethingmore. The Government are asking for a wide sweeping power far in excess of what is actually demanded. I come now to the question of the reguNo diflation of trusts and combines. This been pointed out Parliament, in my opinion, should have complete and adequate power to deal withcombines and trusts, whether Inter-State or Intra-State. My experience in administering the Australian Industries Preservation Acts has convinced, me of the necessity for an alteration in that direction. In the first place, there is no difficulty in the way of the amplication of our power arising from existing laws, since the States have passed no laws on the subject. They have taken no action for the regulation of trusts, but the Commonwealth has done so. When I held office as Attorney-General, it fell to my lot to have to administer for the first time the Australian Industries Preservation Acts. A great many cases were brought under thenotice of the Department, and the vast majority of them were of a purely Intrastate character, and the Commonwealththerefore could not deal with them. It is very easy for a trust to evade the operation of the undoubted Federal law. Combines, at times, are an evil, and wherever combines of that nature exist there should be power to deal with them. There are many articles of consumption dealt with by combines which go beyond the confines of aState, and the exercise of the national' power is, therefore, called for. My own experience in this respect is entirely in accord with that of the honourable member for Angas. When the second"" Deakin Government were administering the Australian Industries Preservation Acts,",24,Chapman Th E Central Of Trade Between The States Speaking
84,Mr West,That means an enlargement,26,Chapman Th E Central Of Trade Between The States Speaking
85,Mr Groom,"Our powers go a longproceedings were instituted against Messrs. Huddart, Parker, and Company, to ascertain exactly what were the powers of the Commonwealth, as well as to deal with an evil which was believed to be in existence. The case was decided, the Commonwealth powers were defined. That trusts are of themseh'es an evil may best be shown by a quotation from the judgment of a United States Judge in the Northern Securities case. Pools and Corporations, the following quotation is given : When competition is left free, individual error or folly will generally find a correction in the conduct of others. But here is a combination of all the companies operating in the Blossburg and Barclay mining regions, and controlling their entire productions. together to govern the supply and the price of coal in all the markets from the Hudson to the Mississippi rivers, and from Pennsylvania to the Lakes. This combination has a power in its confederated form which no individual action can confer. The public interest must succumb to it, for it has left no competition free to correct its baleful influence. When the supply of coal is suspended the demand for it becomes importunate, and prices must rise. Ori f the supply goes forward, the price fixed by the confederates must accompany it. The domestic hearth, the furnaces of the ironmaster, and the fiTes of the manufacturer all feel the restraint, while many dependent hands are paralyzed and hungry mouths are stinted. The influence of a lack of supply or a rise in the price of an article of such prime necessity cannot be measured. It permeates the entire mass of the community, and leaves few of its members untouched by its withering blight. Such a combination is more than a contract; it is an offence. . . . In all such combinations, where the purpose is injurious or unlawful, the gist of the offence is the conspiracy. Men can often do by the combination of many what, severally, no one could accomplish, and even what, when done by one, would be innocent. . . . There is a potency in numbers when combined which the law cannot jvsrlook, where injury is the consequence. I do not wish to elaborate the position, but I would remind honourable members that the second Deakin Administration passed two measures dealing with combines, and took steps in the Court to enforce those laws. The third Deakin Ministry also introduced an amending Bill. So far as the national power is inadequate to cope with the evils, I am quite prepared to support an amendment which will make good the deficiency. As to our power to deal with industrial conditions, my desire undoubtedly is that fair and reasonable conditions shall prevail throughout Australia. That object could be accomplished by the establishment of some such tribunal as was proposed by our narty at the last general election. Mr Groom. member really re-assert that? that were found to be'inadequate I should be prepared to give even wider powers to the Federation. I cannot see my way to go the whole length which the Government asks us to go in these measures. They are not seeking power to deal only with disputes of an Inter-State At page 339 of Ripley's Trusts, nature or to grapple with evils where industries extend beyond one State, but are asking for power to deal, not merely with , every little matter of every possible kind relating to industrial conditions, but to industrial matters generally of the widest possible scope. That They have combined power, together with the wider power over trade and commerce, and all the incidental powers, mean taking over a large and undefined extent of jurisdiction from the State authorities, and I cannot see my way to go to that extreme. As regards the nationalization of monopolies, no case whatever has been made out for the exercise of that power by the Commonwealth. I shall not deal more fully with these matters now, my only intention at present being to point out that in these proposals an attempt is made to assume power far beyond the necessities of the case. If the attempt succeeds it will lead to an undue centralization of authority, congest the Legislature, and make administrative action impossible, while many of those social reforms which are sought will not be as well accomplished as they could be if certain of the powers which are now sought to be transferred were left with the States. Wherever a case can be made out for national action, I am prepared to transfer the necessary powers to the Commonwealth, but in this instance no justification has been shown for the transfer of most of these powers, and, in the circumstances, I cannot see my way to support the measures in their entirety. regard the measure before us as one of the most important ever brought before any Legislature in the Commonwealth. I am prepared to give every credit to the framers of the Australian Constitution. Our Federation arose after a great deal of agitation at various periods in Australian history.

90,Mr Batchelor,I s this another proof,28,Chapman Th E Central Of Trade Between The States Speaking
91,Mr Higgs,"There is no truth in theus. It is calculated to have a chastening effect. But the honourable member for Hindmarsh is too much of a parochialist. He can see no good in any other nation than the British, and referred in most opprobrious terms to the Americans. It is quite right that we should have due self-respect and pride in our race; but that should not blind us to the virtues of other nations. Throughout the world one will find some good in every nation. In the realms of music, art, literature, and science enjoyed by 2,000,000. As I said before, are to be found representatives of the highest type from all nations. I claim that it is our duty to keep an open mind, and if any nation can suggest a means whereby we can remedy the wrongs of mankind or improve our conditions, we ought to adopt it. The framers of our Constitution looked to the American model and adapted a great many of its provisions. Its basis is American, the main difference being with regard to the election of Senators, who, in the United States, are elected by the State Legislatures. This is an anachronism, but the Americans of the time, the ex-Britishers, ex-Frenchmen, and others-wh o helped to draw up the United States Constitution, did what they believed to be the best in their day, and it was a tremendous advance upon the Constitution of the Old Country. The honourable member for Hindmarsh talks about the virtues of j h e unwritten British Constitution. There is no doubt a great deal in the genius of the British race for self-government, but that genius, which showed itself in demanding the Great Charter from King John, has allowed its powers to slip away until at present we find the Old Country ruled by members of the wealthy classes. The honourable member said that all that was required was to abolish the House of Lords, and to carry out two other reforms. the House of Lords. three reforms were necessary. The fact remains, however, that these reforms cannot be carried into effect owing to the existence of the House of Lords. The honourable member further scorned the idea that we could graft on to British political institutions what he called the "" Yankee Constitution "" we now have. member loses sight of the position in which the people of England have allowed themselves to be placed by the gradual filching away of their powers. In times gone by tlie people used to elect their own representatives, but that privilege was gradually taken away, until now, I believe, a person has to reside eighteen months in one house before he can get a vote. We can all realize how that operates, seeing that people, and especially the working classes, move about so much. At the present time, out of a population of 40,000,000 in Great Britain, only about 7,000,000 have the vote, whereas in Australia, out of a population of over 4,000,000 the franchise is I am an internationalist. internationalist. the interjection. The capitalist is also an internationalist, but of a different character. As an illustration of this latter fact, I have only to read the following cable message, which appeared in the Rockhampton Bulletin on the 27 th October, 1909: London, 26th October. An International Shipping Federation has been formed, which includes ship-owners in Britain, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium, and controls a tonnage of 17,000,000. The principal objects of the federation are to enable ships to load and discharge cargo during strikes, and to indemnify against losses. Mr A. Devitt, of Messrs. F. Green and Company, London, joint managers of the Orient Company, has been elected president, and Herr Feisen, of the North German-Lloyd, vice-president. France and Norway will join the combination shortly, as also will other nations whenlocal federations have been established. Why should we encourage racial prejudice to our detriment-, when the capitalists of the world are federating to keep the people in subjection? In Australia, as elsewhere, we are face to face with the fact that industry has undergone a considerable change during the past hundred years. The man who at one time plied his avocation and completed an article of manufacture from start to finish has practically disappeared. Labour-saving inventions have taken away his occupation, and he is to-day, in hundreds of instances, employed in performing one simple operation, such as feeding a machine in the process of manufacture. And the capitalists The honourable of the world are rapidly getting full control of all the machinery, and eliminating competition in regard to the disposal of products, more particularly the food-stuffs of the people.",28,Chapman Th E Central Of Trade Between The States Speaking

95,Mr Higgs,"I thank my friend forThe honourable member for Darling Downs sees no reason for the proposal to nationalize monopolies. The honourable member, I suppose, cannot see that monopolies exist, but he must have a very short memory if he has forgotten the cable news of not very long ago, to the effect that a meat trust has been formed in America, and has succeeded in monopolizing the sale of beef. Like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, this Beef Trust does not sell directly to consumers, but to retail distributors, and the result in America was that as much as is. 5d. per lb. had to be charged for chops. The retail butchers had an idea that redress could be obtained by appealing to President Taft to remove the protective duty of 25 per cent., and thus allow them to obtain supplies from Argentine. But what did the Beef Trust do? They obtained control of certain preserving factories in the Argentine, and where they could not obtain control of existing factories, they instituted factories of their own. The result was that they obtained as much control in the Argentine as in the United States.; and it was found impossible to protect the retailer and the public from their operations. A cable message informs usBelieving that the shortage of cattle in the stock-raising States was not wholly responsible for dear beef, 11,000 heads of families in Cleveland, United States, pledged themselves to abstain from the use of meat for a period of sixty days. That cable appeared in the Bundaberg Daily News on the 22nd January of this year, and was followed by another on the 25thOne million persons in the United States have now pledged themselves to abstain from eating meat in order to force the Beef Trust to reduce the price of beef. Boston has joined the boycott of meat. What is the use of people abstaining from the use of meat in the hope of fighting a great combine such as this is? their abstention did not in any way prejudicially affect the directors of the beef trust, who were very much in the same position as that of the directors of the coal company during the recent strike in New South Wales. If men go out on strike and half starve themselves, directors of great companies are not affected one bit; they are not called upon to deny themselves a single creature comfort, and the price of shares io unaffected. I venture to say that the strike of the 1,000,000 people in the United States did not reduce the price of the shares of the trust one penny. I may be told that I go far afield for my facts, but the world is so small nowadays that the trust in America has endeavoured to get control of the production of beef in Australia. Only this morning a cable message appears to the. effect that the price offered by a trust-English or Americanfor a certain station in Queensland is not deemed sufficient. An Honorable MEMBER -Perhaps Mr S. Kidman has something to do with it. man would be a prominent member in any combination, because he has already organized a kind of trust in the Bovril Estates Company. In my opinion, if things go on as they are, it will not be very long before there is a big meat combine in Australia. As a matter of fact, even now if an individual or a small company tries to send a cargo of beef from Australia to the United States, they would find that all the refrigerating space in the vessels to New York had been taken up by, I believe, Mr Arthur Kidman. I remember reading some time ago an article written by Mr Frank Fox, formerly of the editorial staff of the Bulletin, in which it was stated that, although meat is so dear in Canada and the United States, it was impossible for any person to send a cargo from Australia for the reasons that I have just stated. It might be suggested that another line of steam-ships might be established, but I ask where the capital is to come from ? To use a homely expression, .""dog does not eat dog,"" and the capitalists are not likely to start a rival line. If an individual were to attempt to emKirk in the trade he would meet with a similar experience to that of the owner of the barque Laura, referred to in the following newspaper extract from the Sydney Morning Herald, of the 25th September, 1909 : The enormous powers wielded by the coal vend have just been strikingly illustrated by the case of the barque Laura, which has been refused a cargo of coal at Newcastle. The position is almost incredible. The coal trade of the northern district is very depressed, the mines are working less than half time, yet a little vessel like the Laura, which only requires 550 tons of coal, is unable to secure a supply. The Laura, since she was purchased about two years ago by Mr Peter Burrows, of the firm of E. D. Pike and Company, of this city, has been engaged in the timber trade, carrying hardwood from New South Wales to New Zealand, and bringing back cargoes of pine. During the whole of this",29,International Shipping Federation

98,Mr Higgs,"I dare say that Mr Kidtime she was only twice diverted-onc e on a trip to the South Seas on a three months' time charter, and once with a cargo of naphtha and kerosene to Suva. She may, therefore, be regarded as a regular trader between Australia and New Zealand. chartered by the owners from Messrs. Kedpath and Sons, of Christchurch, New Zealand, and she arrived at Newcastle from New Caledonia on Monday week to load coal for Lyttleton, New Zealand. The vessel has now been lying idle at Newcastle for nearly a fortnight without any prospect of being permitted to purchase or load coal. Mr Peter Burrows, the owner, applied to the charterers' agent-the Hetton Coal Company Limited, of which Mr Wilkins is the manager-for a cargo, but was informed that instructions had been received from the coal vend that the Laura was not to be loaded, as she was not included in the list of vessels authorized to be loaded by collieries connected with the vend. Tf it were found possible to raise sufficient capital to furnish a vessel, in all probability the shipping combine would prevent a supply of coal, or in other ways make the venture absolutely profitless. Further, if a cargo of meat were taken from here to New York or elsewhere in America, the beef trust would do just as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company do here-the cargo landed, they would lower the price of meat temporarily, and the enterprise would fail. That furnishes the best of reasons why we should appeal to the people for power either to nationalize a monopoly entirely, or .to start business in opposition to it. As business men, we must realize that should we nationalize monopolies, we should have to adopt business methods, and that in competing with an established monopoly we should find ourselves confronted with the opposition of a section of the public. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company was a grievous monopoly, which used to charge 9s. 4d. per word for transmission of messages from Great Britain. An agitation was set on foot by merchants who succeeded in getting Great Britain, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Canada, and New Zealand to spend Â£2,000,000 in laying the Pacific Cable; but some of those who were foremost in the agitation for a Government line still continue to do business with the company. tions by reason of the competition. duced to 4s. 9d., and then to 3s. a word; but there are .merchants who are not grateful for what was done by the Government, and still continue to do business with the company. As a consequence, our share of loss on the Pacific Cable is today about ,Â£50,000 per annum. The annual loss is diminishing, and it would disThe Laura was recently appear altogether were business men as a whole to support the Government enterprise. I have heard of a case in which the chairman of a co-operative dairy company is selling his cream to an opposition concern because he can get a slightly higher price for it. We are faced continually by the selfishness and greed of human nature, and are all of us more or less selfish, but it is our duty to protect the community against this selfishness. If the Commonwealth gets the new powers which are asked for we shall probably be unable, because of the cost, to buy out a monopoly like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which, I saw it stated the other day, would expect Â£6,000,000 for its property, while the millers would ask Â£10,000,000 more. We must be careful that we do not load our national business enterprise with an enormous interest burden such as the borrowing of Â£16,000,000 would entail. Therefore, it will pay best to start in opposition to the company. If we are going into the business of supplying the public with goods we must conduct our enterprises on such lines that prices will not be made any higher. Should we desire to compete with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, we should be met with ingratitude such as I have instanced in connection with the Pacific Cable. After we establish a national sugar refinery, and reduce the wholesale price of sugar, we shall find some ungrateful business men who will desert the national refinery, and patronize the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which previously extorted money from them. Those who suggest that if the Labour party had the power it would nationalize industries right and left are either misleading themselves or the public. We shall have to proceed slowly, and on safe lines, and to bring any monopoly to its knees, must so conduct our business as to supply the public with goods at reasonable rates. In my opinion, State .enterprises should be self-supporting. No doubt, some day, Communism may come about. In some cases, even now, it is found more convenient, instead of charging each householder for the quantity of water he uses, to levy a general rate on the community, and this system may be extended to the supply of other things. Indeed,",30,International Shipping Federation

In framing our Constitution we had the experience of other countries to guide us, but the suggestion made by some honourable members is that the Conventions of 1891, 1897, and 1898 did not look into all these matters. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. ferred to the unsuitability of a unified form of government for Australia, and pointed out that at one time New South Wales had control of most, if not the whole, of this continent, but that separate States were formed because the people were dissatisfied with the way in which the affairs were managed by the central authority. I think that is the general opinion, and suppose that honourable members opposite would not argue that it was advisable for a Federal Parliament meeting in the south-eastern portion of the continent to attempt to manage the whole of the affairs, local as well as national, of Australia. It was never intended that it should. Ministers here at present may not intend to use such an authority if it is given to this Parliament, but once it is given the exercise of it will be forced upon us, as time goes on, by dissatisfied constituents and dissatisfied people in the States. Therefore, if we do not want the Commonwealth to exercise the powers now exercised by the States in local matters, the best way to prevent if is not to give it those powers. The honourable member for Hindmarsh yesterday made very disparaging observations regarding our Constitution and Federal Constitutions generally, but I think he should have thought well before he made use of such drastic observations. I. do not believe there is any reason to be dissatisfied with the working of this Constiorable member is quoting from an article tution. felt is due to the actions of honourable members opposite, and those who send them to this Parliament. From the very beginning, they have been dissatisfied with the Federal powers under the Constitution, and have been trying by one means or another to invade the arena reserved to the States. That is the reason why the High Court has had to decide so often against the action of this Parliament in passing legislation close to, or overstepping the border line of State and Federal powers. I blame * honourable members opposite for the whole of that. orable members opposite, although their electors may be behind them. If it had not been for the existence of a desire on the part of members opposite to exercise powers not given to us, there would have been no fault to find with the working ot the Constitution. In reply to the disparaging observations of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, with regard to the American Constitution, let me quote what Mr Bryce said about it in 1888Yet after all deductions, it ranks above any other written Constitution for the intrinsic excellence of its scheme, its adaptation to the circumstances of the people, the simplicity, bievity, and precision of its language, its judicious mixture of definiteness in principle and elasticity in details. Honourable members will be able to judge which authority is the more to be trustedMr Bryce or the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I would ask honourable members why Federation was established. Why was it desired by the people of Australia ? Why did the States give up some of their powers, without any pressure, and of their own free will? They gave the Commonwealth nearly all the powers it possesses, some, I believe, coming from the Imperial Parliament. Those powers were given up voluntarily by the people of Australia so that this Parliament should be brought into existence. I read the other day the answer to those queries in a leading journal, published in this city. I altogether concur in the reason given by that publication in the following termsThe Commonwealth Parliament was not constructed for the' work of controlling State land settlement, State production or manufacturing industries, or State internal tradeThe only dissatisfaction I have in a newspaper commenting on a matter now before the House. a journal.

I asked the House was : "" Why was Federation desired, and why did die States give up some of their powers?"" I was about to answer that by quoting the opinion of some one who gave the necessary information. I can answer the question without the article, but it seems to me that what I was about to read is only an answer to the question tliat I put. However, if you, sir, are against me, I shall say no more about it. The reason why the States federated was that there were many matters in which a united Australia was interested, and regarding which a united Australia could do what the States could not do for themselves. It was in order that a Parliament should be brought into existence that would attend to all matters of general or national concern for the whole ot Australia, that the States agreed to federate. They never agreed to do so in order that their internal affairs should be internot a fair argument to say that the Upper fered with, or that their land settlement, and other matters, which they thought they could manage altogether for themselvessuch as their businesses of buying and selling, licences, and general internal economy and management-shoul d be controlled by the Federal Parliament. It seems to me, however, that, having federated for national purposes in regard to defence, Customs and Excise, and external affairs generally, it is now desired to use the instrument the States then brought into existence in order to intrude on the local arena, and control those matters which the States had no idea of parting with or of giving control of to any one else. I have often said in this House, and must say it again, that the efforts of the party opposite the effort. The fact of the matter is that -whethe r they call themselves the Labour party or the Caucus-Socialistic party, have been always in the direction of invading the arena of legislation reserved to They have got so far now that, perhaps without intending it, they are travelling on a course which, if followed a little further, will destroy altogether the autonomy of the States. A good deal has been said during this debate with regard to the State Upper Houses. When any argument as to the power of the States to do everything necesI sary is driven home, we are at once confronted with the statement that the Upper Houses will not allow reforms to be made. I had a good deal of experience with a nominee Upper' House, in which the numbers were limited, and afterwards for many years with an elected Upper House, and I never found them unreasonable, nor do I think they have been, taking their acts altogether. orable member. always; but it is not reasonable to expect them always to agree with what is put before them. If they do not pass all the legislation that is proposed to them by the Lower Houses, it is at once assumed that they are an obstruction. They are there, however, for a certain purpose; they are elected for the most part by the people, and they exercise their rights. I do not believe that the acts of the Upper Houses of the States, taking them altogether, have been injurious to the people of this continent. When we say that the States have self-government, and can alter their own Constitutions, it is Houses block the way. The people may try to get their legislation passed, and may abolish the Upper Housesi f they like, or may try to do so. When they do not try to do it with any persistence, it is not fair for honourable members to say that the Upper Houses are an obstruction. If they are an obstruction, why do the States not try to do away with them, or alter their Constitution ? The people should try to do so, and when they have persisted in. the effort tried in South Australia. that he did try, the fact that he failed once was no reason why he should give up the party opposite are always trying to obtain by legislation what is not advisable in the interests of the country.",34,International Shipping Federation

120,Sir John Forrest,"Supposingthe wishes of the people ! Sir members opposite represent only one-third of the electors of Australia, so that I do not see that the honourable member is correct in that assertion. The Bill proposes to ask the electors to say ' ' Yes'' or "" No "" to four proposed amendments of the Constitution, which provide for giving the Commonwealth f u l l control over trade and commerce, both external and internal -ove r all foreign and State corporationsover monopolies and combinations in relation to the production, manufacture or supply of goods or service, and the control of all industrial matters, including employment ditions of employment, and also including the prevention and settlement of disputes. Those four intricate and difficult questions are to be asked in one referendum; and I submit that that is not a fair method. In my opinion, the questions ought to lie placed before the electors separately, in view of the possibility that the people may be in favour of one or more of the proposals and against the others; yet, as now proposed, they must swallow the whole or refuse the whole. As I have indicated, the questions are not closely related; and, according to the notice I have given, I shall test the question in Committee as to whether they shall be voted on by the people as a whole or separately. If the powers mentioned are to be taken over by the Commonwealth, what will remain to the States? The administration of the lands, I suppose, will yet be with the States Governments, although even that power may be removed if the lands are taxed in the way proposed by members opposite. The mines of the country, also, may be placed almost in the same category, and also education; but there, again, we are faced with the possibility of the powers even in regard to these being taken over by the Commonwealth, if not by direct means by indirect and roundabout methods. Altogether it appears to me that by proposals such as these the States will lose a great portion of the self-government that they now enjoy. The result of our taking over the control of industrial matters will, I think, be that we shall, in part if not wholly, establish similar conditions and wages all over the Commonwealth; and I do not know that such a state of affairs is advocated by any one. In those parts of the Commonwealth We are carrying out where the climate and other circumstances render work more arduous, surely those emJOHN FORREST -Honorabl e ployed are entitled to more consideration than are those who earn their living in the more temperate and agreeable places; no one will say that a worker at Port Darwin should not receive higher wages than a worker in the salubrious climate of Hobart. Of course, unless something be done to equalize wages and conditions, it will be impossible for a State, where the wages are high, to compete industrially with States where the wages are low. In the case of my own State, for instance, .several industries have gravitated to Victoria because of that very difference. I have this session asked this Government whether they can and the wages and consuggest a means by which industries may be kept within States instead of being removed for the reason mentioned. Western Australia represent more than the difference in wages ! Sir JOHN FORREST I am not prepared to admit that, but will the honourable member deny that wages are higher in Perth than in Melbourne, and that, in consequence, the boot industry and the tobacco industry have been destroyed in Perth and have been removed to the east? I do not think that similar wages and conditions all over the Commonwealth are practicable, but something will have to be done to meet the difficulty I have indicated. The late Government made a proposal by which, if Wages Boards, or the State authorities, acted in any way prejudicial to the interests of another State there was an appeal to a Federal tribunal, with power to settle the matter; but that proposal did not become law. At present the Commonwealth has control over all trade and commerce and industrial matters except within a State; and the question now is whether the internal affairs of the States are also to be handed oxer to the Commonwealth. It certainly was never contemplated by those who framed the Constitution that it should be used as an instrument for invading the arena of the States. For my own part, I should be very chary, indeed, unless with the consent of the States, in doing anything which could be construed into a breach of faith with the people of the States, seeing that they have treated us so generously, and have so trusted us, in endowing this Parliament with such large powers under the Federal Constitution.

I understand the opposition of those who are afraid of any alteration of the Constitution, on the ground that it may have results which are not intended j but honourable members opposite should not contend that the Constitution is unalterable, because to the holding of a Conference at Corowa those of them who took part in the framing of it were prepared then to admit that, as time went on, alterations might be found to be necessary. Great credit is due to Sir Edmund Barton and those who helped him to frame the Constitution. They were not afraid of subsequent alterations, their concern being the creation of a nation. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking in this debate, pointed to the map which hangs on the wall to draw attention to the lines which divide State from State; but the object of the Federal Convention was to create one Government which should rule this island continent from ocean to ocean, and its members achieved it. I hope that there will never be anything powerful enough to break up this great union. The Attorney-General, in introducing the Bill, rose to the occasion, and made a speech worthy of the measure. I have not yet heard his statements answered. The position is this: After nearly ten years of experience we are finding an alteration of the Constitution necessary to enable the people to give effect to their wishes. Some of these they expressed at the last election. The Commonwealth needs power to legislate in regard to industrial matters and for the nationalization of monopolies. The people, in giving a majority to the Labour party, required it to introduce a measure providing for a referendum on this question. I do not think that our opponents can be in earnest. If a referendum is taken, the questions submitted to the people should be simply and plainly stated. separately ? proposal of the right honourable member for Swan. Our chief object is to gain .the power to legislate in respect of industrial matters and for the nationalization of monopolies. The people of Australia are indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for the work which he has done for them at various times, but when he stated that the nature of these alterations would ruin the Federation, I was forced to interject that his remarks seemed to me like a funeral service. His reply was that these measures would bring about the funeral of the Federal power. When he spoke like that, he was not the same Deakin that we knew some years ago. My knowledge of the honourable member for Ballarat goes. back many years ago, and I thought that he would have stood by the Federal position, instead of being a champion of State rights. It must not be forgotten that it was those who now constitute the Opposition who proposed the first alterations of the Constitution, namely, those respecting the Financial Agreement and the State debts, while they intended to refer to the people two other questions very similar to those which we wish to refer to them. When this referendum is being discussed, I hope that those who speak on it will confine their remarks to the subject-matter of the proposal, and not dwell on the danger of giving the Labour party power to carry out the legislation which they desire to pass. I hope that honourable members generally will rise to the occasion, and not try to belittle this party. Nothing is gained by personal abuse. I have seen that from an experience of elections extending over the whole course of my life. It will be the members of the Labour party who will have most to do in forming a public opinion regarding the questions at issue in this instance, because the public press will do the work for the other side, and whip us all the time. I hope that the whipping will not deter us from the proper performance of our duty. The object of the attempt to split up the questions to be submitted to the people seems to be to give some honourable members an opportunity to claim that they are in favour of new Protection, and allow others to say that they are opposed to it -",37,International Shipping Federation

129,Mr West,"I am not in favour of theI f our honourable friends opposite are really serious in their professed desire to bring about these changes, they will allow the Bill to remain as it stands. The chief measures of a Government have never yet been defeated at the second-reading stage, and so-called attempts to test the feeling of the House on an amendment to a motion for the second reading of a Bill are usually made to induce the people to believe that those responsible for them are the only men carefully watching the political life of the country. I cannot understand why an attack should be made upon us for proposing an alteration of the Constitution. A Constitution that would not permit of amendment would be most undemocratic. There are amongst the Opposition some who assisted in framing that under which we work, and they used to tell us that it was undoubtedly Democratic, because it could be altered at any time at the will of the people. As I understand that an arrangement has been made to take a division within the next few minutes, I shall not detain the House any longer, although I regard such a measure as this as one of first importance, deserving full discussion. However, since such an arrangement has been made, I am prepared to bow to the will of the House. I sincerely trust that both measures will be put through as quickly as possible, for I am sure that tlie country is thirsting for the amendments of the Constitution which are now proposed. [3.18] I have twenty minutes within which to discuss the far-reaching questions which these Bills involve, and I shall try to compress my remarks within that space of time, so that a division may be taken at the hour arranged. My speech, I hope, will be a study in condensation. No one can overstate the importance of these proposals. I entirely agree with the Acting Prime Minister when, in the course of his able speech in moving the second reading of this Bill, he said that the proposals involved were by far the most important questions with which the Parliament has yet had to deal. It seems to me that if they are carried there will be scarcely a State function that is not invaded, or a State power that is not potentially destroyed. This industrial power will ramify into every nook and cranny of our industrial and social life, and there will not be an aspect of our social concerns that will not be profoundly affected. The control of the lands under these provisions will be liable to be taken from the States. Let that be understood. You may not begin to nationalize your mines-yo u may not begin to appreciably regulate the conditions of mining-withou t also appreciably regulating the conditions of land tenure which are precedent to mining operations. I cite that as a simple illustration, and the same may be said with regard to your railways, your shipping, and your sugar industry. The Labour party propose to deal with the sugar industry, and, possibly, to nationalize it. If they do, they must deal with the lands devoted to the production of sugar-cane. Thus we may find the States stripped of every power left to them under the Constitution as it stands. It will be impossible to confine the scope and range of the powers that are proposed to be taken. I ask myself, as I have been doing throughout this debate, what necessity is there tor amendments so drastic, so far-reaching, and so fraught with consequences to the future integrity of the States. I am told in an airy fashion by the honoiable member for Hindmarsh to look for an answer to the decisions of the High Court. When I examine them, I find that all that the High Court has had, perforce, time and again, to tell us, is that we are dabbling with matters which the framers of the Constitution never intended us to touch, and that certain acts on our part have been ultra vires. What is the High Court for if not to confine us to our proper ambit, and to limit us to the proper exercise of our true Constitutional powers? Surely that Court is to act as much by prohibition as by the conferment of privilege? There seems to be an underlying presumption, however, in the minds of honourable members, that, no matter what we do, if the High Court refuses to agree with us, we must take further power so that we may do just what we please. That is not Federation. We might as well have no High Courti f we are not going to observe the limitations that it imposes. We had better at once revert to a complete unitary system such as the honourable member for Hindmarsh desires. In that he is quite logical, and always has been. He has been for Unification first, last, and always, and therefore his argument can be readily understood. But we reach other considerations when we come to view the necessity for these drastic proposals in the light, say, of the speech delivered the other evening by the honourable member for Flinders.",38,International Shipping Federation
130,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"the honourable member did not like. honourable member would not interrupt me. I am always ready for a rough-and-tumble, but there is no time for such a thing today. I should like here to answer the honourable member for Flinders, who declared that he believed the people had deliberately chosen that the experiment of regulating wages by a Federal tribunal should have a fair and full trial. Therefore, he said, we should give power to that body which could best do the work. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Most effectually, I said. the word used by the honourable member, but ""effectually"" will do just as well. MightI suggest that that really begs the whole question, and turns us back to the consideration of what power can and ought to control those matters, and what power can do so most effectively. That really does not bring us any nearer a solution of this matter, and so we push back to a consideration of what is wise and prudent rather than what the people intended when this instrumentality was brought into existworkers, in particular, easing with the ence. With regard to these interesting questions of jurisdiction, when we see the High Court dealing with this question and that, and, on the other hand, observe the industries of the. country rolling on undisactivity. And so honourable members go turbed, growing in volume and importance, and making the people infinitely more prosperous than they were, it does seem to me that we really can -afford a great deal of this legal experimenting without seriously doubted fact, that our Federation is so affecting or modifying the prosperous condition of the country. that the Commonwealth is like that Roman knight of old, who, clad in armour, turned and said, as the shafts hurtled about him, "" Did a leaf fall ?"" It seems to me that what is transpiring in the High Court from day to day, more particularly with regard to industrial matters, which we know the instrumentalities have affects and modifies the great courses of public prosperity just about as much as the falling of a leaf would do. In one sense, the Federation itself is an artificial creashaped under pressure from without. tion. I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that these artificial distincon entirely prudential considerations, with tions do not count for much, and that some of them seem to be absurd. But, on the other hand, he will recollect that in one sense the Federation itself is an artificial as has been found absolutely necescreation, in that it represents an arbitrary sary in other cases. division of powers, and none the less arbitrary because it happens at the same time to be logical and sequential. We come back to the broad consideration of what is wise, and prudent, and best to be done, so that we may get greater efficiency out of our Government, and bring it in the most beneficent way close to the industrial life of the community. The starting on one side of the boundary or the other of an engine does not matter very much, so far as the totality of the business portion of the country is concerned. I come back to the question, What is the real necessity for these far-reaching proposals? What is the trouble that makes them necessary? Will theii rejection cause trouble; or, if the trouble be present, will the powers now proposed to be taken to the Commonwealth completely cure it ? In other words, will the sum of the general advantage be increased by the Federal acquirement of these further industrial powers as proposed by the Government? Where are the abuses that these proposals are intended to cure? When I look for them, what do I find? Wages steadily rising all over Australia, no strikes, perfect peace so far as we know, within the industrial arena; the condition of the passing of every day, and all because of the multiplication of those local ameliorative agencies that have done such infinite good within the spheres of State on. They assume the necessity when they make these propositions now before the House. The honourable member for Flinders told us, also, what I think is an unshaped that we have actually weaker I always feel powers than has almost any other Federation. So far as the Quantum of our powers goes, I think that that is so. I agree that they are few in number, and perhaps less than those of any other Federation. But I hope that my honourable friends will not forget that in nearly every Federation of all been shaped so as effectually to achieve the objects which they have had in view.

In Canada we have the problem of two races living side by side under the one Constitution, the very thing which the honourable member for Hindmarsh said could not be done.

It has been incoiitestably shown that they are introducing proposals which will take from the States, if desired, nearly all those things .which make up their Statehood, taking them from Constitutions which are relatively democratic, and placing them under a Constitution which the party opposite themselves declare to be absolutely undemocratic. So, I . say, that they must redress the balance of the Constitution before very long. I admit that, as the Acting Prime Minister very properly pointed out, the Federal, character of a Constitution does not depend upon the number of powers which are taken over, but it does depend upon the nice balance and adjustment of those powers. As set forth by the honourable member for Angas, in his memorandum, it depends upon whether those powers are selfsufficient and effective in their use. I apdead letter, so far as the preventive side ply that test to these proposals. In my judgment the Labour party cannot get what they want in the way they are proposing. It has been asseverated by the Acting Prime Minister, and by the Leader of the Government, who is now on his way to South Africa, that they are not going to take these industrial powers from the States, settlement of disputes in the light of local but that all they are asking for is concurrent power. It seems to me that concurrent powers exercised effectively must lead simply to concurrent confusion. Take as an illustration what happened during the Newcastle strike. Just when that dispute was on the point of settlement the engine-drivers of Victoria stepped in and appealed to the Arbitration Court to be joined in it. The result was to put that settlement back for some time. Mr J. H . CATTS -That matter did not affect the settlement in anv way. might have done. It was only owing to the good sense of the Judge here that it did not. That kind of thing, if multiplied will have a deterrent effect on the settlement of these disputes, and, in fact, prevent settlement. You cannot have; two bites at a cherry in this way, and the concurrent powers, referred to by the Government, will ultimately resolve themselves into the supreme controlling power of the Federation over all those matters which are now left exclusively to the States. At the same time, I admit that things have been somewhat altered by the recent decision of the High Court, and it is just as well to come squarely up to the situation as we find it to-day. Even since last year things have happened which greatly modify the industrial situation, and I admit that since the common rule has gone there has gone with it the effectiveness of that paragraph in the Constitution which provides for "" the settlement and prevention of industrial disputes."" You cannot prevent industrial disputes unless you have power to make general awards. In the absence of that power, I admit that the operation of tbe arbitration clause would tend rather to the multiplication than the settlement of disputes. So it comes to this, that we have to look at the situation anew, and meet it in the light of recent happenings. I , therefore, am prepared to go a step further than we otherwise would have gone if that rule had not been taken out of the Constitution. For all practical purposes that provision is a of it is concerned, and, therefore, something must be done to restore it. In doing that we may still preserve the line of demarcation between what is Federal and what is State. Why interfere with the State Courts, which are doing their work well? Why take power to interfere in the circumstances and surroundings? We ought to be content when we take sufficient power to control all matters which have become Federal in their character by the Inter-State ramifications of the industries affected. So, to sum up this view of the matter, I am proposing an amendment whicli will represent the views of this side of the House on the question of industrial control now proposed by the Government. I move That after the word "" T h a t "" the following words be inserted:-""in the opinion of this House the industrial provisions of the Constitution should not be altered except to regulate the conditions of employment in all industries that are Federal in operation or which cannot be effectually regulated by any one State; further enabling the Inter-State Commission to prevent and remove unfair competition between the same industries carried on in different States."" As I view it, the amendment simply strikes a purely Federal line, as the course which should be followed by the Federal Parliament and Government. It leaves State instrumentalities intact, and as complete in their powers as they are to-day, wherever they are organized, to deal with all matters of purely domestic concern in the light of local circumstances. After all, the fundamental idea of the Federation is to take over the control of, shall I say, purely national industrial matters, in which",41,International Shipping Federation
145,Mr Joseph Cook.',"No, but itevery member of the community is equally interested, wherever he may reside throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Rut by the same reasoning all our purely local and domestic concerns should be rigidly excluded from the Federal sphere and left to the control of the State agencies. strikes a clear line of demarcation between Federal and State industrial functionsa line which would lead us, not into confusion as the proposals of the Government undoubtedly will, but out into the broad, open Federal path. It will make our course as clear, and open, and plain -is we leave the course clear, open, and plain for the various States. In this way the State power will implement the Federal power; the Federal power will implement and complement the State powers. We shall thus get an effective exercise of industrial power, which I hope, as we all do, will lead to industrial peace in the future of this great continent.

The Standing Orders distinctly provide that no quesreading an extract from a newspaper totion once dealt with shall be dealt with again in the same session. The honourable member must not anticipate the discussion of a motion set down on the notice-paper unless he withdraws it. rigidly adhered to, any honourable member could prevent the discussion of a subject by putting on the business-paper a notice of motion relating to it for the last day of the session. point out that I had on the notice-paper a notice of motion dealing with the question of the hours worked by officials of the House, and by members, and referring to the eight hours principle. Notwithstanding that, you, sir, allowed the honourable member for Coolgardie to anticipate my motion by initiating a debate on the same subject. I called attention at the time to the fact that I.had a notice of motion on the paper dealing with it. wish to make a personal explanation. More than a fortnight ago I made an arrangement with the honourable member for Grampians to pair with him on any"" division in the House during my absence. accepted an invitation from New South Wales to assist the Labour candidates at the recent general elections there ; but was detained here a week longer than I expected. During my absence in connection with the elections the arrangement with the honourable member for Grampians was evidently overlooked. This was due to some inadvertence, and while wishing to acquit the honourable member of all blame, it is only right that I should explain how my which took place on the Land Tax Assessment Bill.

I shall hand the paragraph to the Minister, whose attention I have continually drawn to the fact that misleading advertisements are published regarding the vast advantages that people can get here and the enormous amount of land that they can acquire for settlement close to railways. I wish to get from the Minister a decided promise that his Department will see that those who report concerning lands for settlement in Australiar do so correctly and fairly, so that our good name may not be besmirched. that I was trying to blacken the name of I had Australia, but my intention is exactly the opposite.
