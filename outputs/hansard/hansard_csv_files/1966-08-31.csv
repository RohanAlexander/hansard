Will the Minister review the terms of the agreement and consider amending it to allow mine pensioners to elect whether they will receive mine superannuation or the age pension? Alternatively, will the Minister inform me of the section of the Social Services Act or the regulation that allows his Department to conclude with other authorities an agreement that denies persons of pensionable age their entitlement previous Government.

As I understand the situation, part of the Island of Sakhalin and some other areas are scarcely to be regarded as having been colonies. These territories belonged to Russia. This was acknowledged. Sakhalin was ceded by Russia to Japan after the Russo-Japanese war of 1905. On undertakings given at the Cairo Conference of 1943 and decisions taken at the Yalta Conference in 1945, Sakhalin and Kurile were to be handed over to Russia at the end of the last war. This was done. In my own judgment, there is no exact basis of comparison according to which they may be regarded as former colonies.",14,Nurses War Memorial Chapel

PerhapsI should go a little further. When the original question was directed to me upon notice, adopting the usual custom of Ministers, I sought advice from my Department. That advice indicated that the Leader of the Opposition had required Labour members to have his approval before taking part in the programmes in question. Having a doubt about this, I took the trouble to ring the honourable gentleman and to ask whether it was true. He denied it. I then discussed the matter again with the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He subsequently had a discussion with the Leader of the Opposition, who intiparticular peace keeping project? If so, mated to the Chairman that the conversation in question had taken place previously and that this had been his attitude. Subsequently, not having received any word from the Leader of the Opposition I again rang him and he confirmed the discussion that he had had with Dr. Darling. FU1A BOMBER. the Minister for Air. I remind him that last week he said that he had been advised in June of modifications to the F111A bomber and of the extra cost involved. I ask: Why did he not give this information to the addressed to the Minister for Labour and House during the week before when the National Service who represents the Minister honourable member for Capricornia asked for Housing. Did the Minister visit my conhim a question relating to the performance stituency early in 1964 at the invitation of and cost of the F111A bomber? Why did the Council of the City of Greater Wollonhe withhold the information from the House gong to confer with the Council on its at that time? Why did the House have to special housing problems as a major centre wait for someone to discover and quote of heavy industry, population growth and facts about the extra costs from the report migrant inflow?

I said then that the major points that the honourable member for Capricornia had asked me related to the performance of the aircraft. Those were the questions that I answered at the time. He had not raised these other matters. I have explained these other matters to the honourable member for Bendigo and I have nothing further to add. the Minister for Defence. Has his Department made any assessment of the claim frequently made by Labour Party spokesmen that Communist China has no aggressive ambition? In view of tbe fact that Communist China has a standing army of 2.7 million men and calls up 700,000 men each year for three years military training, can the honourable gentleman say whether this form of activity is being directed to any where is it? tion given in the form of a question by the honourable gentleman rather constitutes the answer.

The Minister will know of the worry that this matter is causing the trawler fishermen in the area. Can he say what developments are likely which will bring about recovery of this lethal object? this district can be eternally grateful to the honourable member for his persistent approaches about this matter. As he knows, the initial efforts to locate this charge failed in which he advocated the encouragement and, due to rough weather, the search had to be abandoned. In consultation with the local fishermen the Navy will now send a team of clearance divers to that area when the fishermen say the weather will be suitable to enable the search to continue. I believe that will be at the end of October or early in November. The Navy divers will use a chartered fishing boat to see whether they can do what the honourable member seeks.

Is he also aware that a lc per therm difference means a difference of £750,000 to £1,000,000 per annum in the total return? In view of the undoubted Commonwealth financial and constitutional interest in this question, I ask the Minister whether the price arrived at will in the ultimate be subject to confirmation by the Commonwealth Government. conference is being held today. It is a conference between some producers in Victoria and a State instrumentality. I am perfectly certain that the State instrumentality will bear in mind the need to establish a reasonable price for the people of Melbourne and Victoria who use this gas.

The Royal Australian Air Force court of inquiry has not yet completed its investigation of this accident, but I am in a position to provide the House with additional details. The Sabre aircraft concerned, flown by Pilot Officer Goddard, took off from RAAF. Williamtown at 18.01 hours on Tuesday, 16th August, for an authorised I night instrument flying training exercise of approximately 50 minutes duration. This flight was one of a number of similar training exercises programmed on that particular night by No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit at Williamtown. The weather briefing for the night's flying programme gave no indication of anything untoward to cause concern. The pilot, Pilot Officer Goddard, graduated from No. 57 Pilot's Course in April 1966. He subsequently commenced operational conversion training at No. 2 O.C.U., Williamtown. At the time of the accident, he had completed 14 of the 16 weeks",19,Superannuation

Pilot Officer Goddard's performance during pilot training at the Advance Flying Training School, Pearce, was above average in all phases. He was selected for fighter flying because of his sound ability, sensible attitude towards flying and conscientious application to allotted tasks. At the Operational Conversion Unit, he had been assessed as being above the average course pilot and had achieved sound results throughout. After a normal take off from runway 12 at Williamtown, the aircraft was observed both visually and on radar to be following a flight path to intercept the 170 degree magnetic diversion course away from Williamtown. This is in accordance with standard operating procedures at RAAF. Williamtown, whereby aircraft after take off from runway 12 are diverted out to sea away from Newcastle and should pass no closer than four miles to seaward of Newcastle. Similarly, for aircraft taking off towards the opposite direction, laid-down .procedures ensure that the aircraft has reached approximately 15,000 feet when passing by Newcastle on its way out to the seaward training area. In addition, there is an instruction whereby RAAF. aircraft are prohibited generally from flying over the Newcastle as to the adequacy of the Newcastle area, except in cases of operaR.A.A.F. flying procedures in the vicinity tional necessity.

As I have previously said the official court of inquiry is still proceeding, and if this reveals any fresh evidence or information I will inform the House accordingly. I am sure that honourable members will join with me when 1 again express deepest sympathy to the relatives of Pilot Officer Goddard, who was, as I stated previously an above average pilot and an officer of considerable promise. My sympathy is also extended to those citizens of Newcastle who were either injured or whose property suffered damage as a result of this unhappy accident. As the House knows, immediate arrangements were made for an officer of my Department and of the Attorney General's Department to go up to Newcastle the day after the accident to talk with those involved, to assess the damage, to do everything possible to facilitate the repair of damaged property and to deal promptly with claims that are arising out of this unfortunate event. I am advised that satisfactory arrangements have been made with the various authorities concerned and that priority attention is being given to these matters. I think that was confirmed earlier by the honourable member for Newcastle. Also, in order to reassure the citizens of of RAAF. Williamtown, I have asked my Department to review existing proboth of us are responsible for the flights of aircraft over that area.

I have noted on numerous occasions that aircraft from Williamtown have flown across the city. I have made reference at different times to the need to remove the Williamtown training base from the immediate vicinity of Newcastle. I reaffirm this view. When the Williamtown base was located where it is at present, aircraft had an operational speed of about 200 to 250 miles an hour, and therefore it was necessary, for the defence of Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong, that an air base be located reasonably close to those cities. Today we have aircraft which travel at 1,200 miles an hour. The Government has said what an excellent aircraft the Mirage fighter is. I believe that the time is now due to examine the question of having a fighter base, not adjacent to a city but some distance away from it, though at the same time still where it can do the job for which it is designed-the interception of enemy aircraft, should that be necessary. We hope and pray that it will not. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the removal of the Williamtown training base, bearing in mind that accidents do happen. There was this unfortunate accident. An aircraft also crashed on, I think, the l l t h or 12th November 1963, when only a miracle saved an old lady, Mrs. Tillitski. She poured herself a cup of tea, but instead of remaining in the rear of her house to drink the cup of tea she walked to the front. Just after she moved to the front an aircraft crashed into the rear of the house. That indicates a miracle on that occasion, as on this last one. Similar accidents have occurred in which-withou t going into details-youn g pilots have crashed their aircraft in the course of their training. It is unfortunate that they crashed, but at the same time it is fortunate that they crashed in scrub land adjacent to the airfield. We> have been lucky up to date, but I think we need to look at this matter. We should bear for damages. I have observed with appreciation the work of the Royal Australian Air Force officers in the Newcastle district in helping the people affected to make their claims and overcome the building ordinances. I think I should also mention the legal services provided by Mr Mulrooney and others who have been working with him. Harry Wilson, the chief building inspector of the Newcastle City Council also deserves mention. They all tore the ordinance book up and got on with the job of restoration. The honourable member for Shortland told me, before I rose to speak, of one house in Glebe Road which was almost completely demolished. Today even the paint is back on it. Those responsible have restored most of it and have done an excellent job in unravelling some awkward problems. SoI hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to removing the airfield from the immediate vicinity of the city of Newcastle. I know that he cannot pick the airfield up, but the Government can remove the fighter training base from Newcastle so that the lives of the people in this large city of some quarter of a million population will not be jeopardised by the accidents that unfortunately do occur.

Marrickville Holdings has advanced the argument that it would be able to use more safflower oil if it were not for the imposiwhich, despite this encouragement, has tion of quotas on the production of margarine. This argument falls to the ground because Marrickville Holdings, which has not been living within its quota since 1954, has had the advantage of endeavouring to use safflower oil on whatever basis it would like without being hindered by margarine quotas. Added to this is the fact that in the United Kingdom and the United States, where endeavours have been made for a number of years to use safflower oil, it has been found that it is not an economic proposition.

This gives an average price of 17s. a gallon or a tariff protection of 70 per cent. Let us look at the yield that comes from peanuts. Over a period of six years the yield has averaged 7 gallons of oil or 70 lb. of fat per acre. Let us now look at cotton, which receives a cash bounty. I do not quibble with this, because T believe the cotton industry has received a cash bounty equivalent to 40 per Mr Ian Allan -It is a reducing bounty. the relevant fact is that cotton received a bounty of 40 per cent, on last year's",24,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
76,Mr Nixon,"Yes. The honourable memThe dairy industry has been under challenge. AgainI quote Mr Lloyd, because he and I had quite a difference of opinion on a television programme about this matter. Mr Lloyd has said that the best dairying areas in Victoria can produce only 60 Ib. of butter fat an acre. He has now Changed the figure to 70 lb. I challenge him to show me how he arrived at this figure. I believe he has taken seed growers. The directors of Marrickville thc figures of the Commonwealth Statistician and has called all farmers who say they milk a cow dairy farmers. He has then divided the total production of butter by the total acreage used and has come out with a result of 60 lb. Let me illustrate my point by mentioning my brother-in-law at Narromine. He has a large grazing property but milks one house cow. He puts in a return that he has one or two cows ancl Mr Lloyd includes him as a dairy farmer. There is no other way in which he could have arrived at his conclusion. In fact, the dairy farmers in Victoria get up to 300 lb. of butter fat an acre. The dairy industry receives a cash bounty of 14 per cent. J will give the figures again so that they will not be lost in all the argument. The dairy industry receives a bounty of 14 per cent.; the cotten industry receives a bounty of 40 per cent, on a reducing scale; the safflower industry has a tariff protection of 33 per cent.; and the peanut oil industry has protection of 70 per cent. I do not think that anyone would claim on those figures that the dairy industry is being over protected vis a vis the other primary industries. I would suggest, therefore, that the arguments produced by Marrickville Holdings in this case again fall to the ground. 1 suggest that the potential growers of saiflower direct their attention to the remarks of Mr Watt, Director General of Agriculture in New South Wales. In the ""Financial Review"" of 23rd June, he said that saiflower needs to increase its production per acre four times to be economical and should be regarded as an experimental crop. I nail the arguments advanced by Marrickville Holdings to the mast. In this argument, when I speak in the collective sense I refer to members of the Commonwealth Parliament, members of the State Parliaments and people who, according to Marrickville Holdings, have influence. I nail these arguments to thc mast because they are an absolute misrepresentation of the true position of the oil seeds industry and the dairy industry. 1 suggest to the House that this is a very expensive attempt to create a division not only amongst members of the Parliament, through the sheer pressure of thc campaign, but also between the dairy industry and the oil Holdings fail to recognise that people who make decisions in matters such as this study the allegations and information that come before them and do not make a judgment based on the pressure or weight of an advertising campaign. They look at the validity of the arguments advanced and then make their judgments. I think when I highlight these differences thc House will agree with me that Marrickville Holdings does nothing to assist the oil seeds industry when it uses this form of pressure. We were next told that Marrickville Holdings was getting in behind the formation of an Australian edible oil seeds group. Mr Lloyd, my opponent, wrote an article in a newspaper. 1 am sorry to keep referring to him, but I need to do so to develop the argument. He said in his articleWe may see, soon, some signs of schizophrenia developing in ihe Country Party. He related this to the formation of the Australian edible oil seeds group. I informed Mr Lloyd very quickly that I had no knowledge of the formation of this group and, as far as I knew, the formation of the group had made no impression whatever on other members of the Australian Country Party. I also informed him that it was childish nonsense, if I may use the exact expression I used to him, to say that the Australian Country Party would develop schizophrenia, because the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann), who is, in fact, a member of the Australian Country Party, had introduced legislation into the House that was designed to assist the cotton seeds industry. But let us look at the formation of this Australian edible oil seeds group. First we had Marrickville Holdings, which was behind the growers. It invited the Peanut Marketing Board of Queensland, Allied Mills Ltd., which is another manufacturer of margarine, Unilever Australia Pty. Ltd., another manufacturer, Nuttelex Food Products Pty. Ltd. and Meggitt Ltd., which has been well known in the oil seed industry for more than 20 j'ears as a most responsible company, to join it in the formation of this group. But it was no sooner formed than it started to disintegrate. It has been said in public statements by several of the companies that they recognised that Marrickville Holdings was intending to use the formation of the group for its own devious ends, to obtain some sympathy, and would use the group as a weapon to obtain what it wanted. We finally saw the companies deserting and leaving the Australian edible oil seeds group because of their recognition of the problem. Several articles appeared in the newspapers. Meggitt Ltd. inserted a public notice in the "" Canberra Times"" on 11 th August 1966. It gave reasons for not being in the group and then saidWe deplore the direct action which has contravened the laws of this country, believing there are proper means which are always available to correct harmful legislation whenever it exists. The cause for edible oil seeds is well founded but must depend in some measure on the accuracy of production figures. This responsibility in the hands of a self-acclaimed leader in this field is creating unnecessary embarrassment to, and doubt about, the industry which has not yet produced the tonnages of oil quoted by Marrickville Holdings Limited, nor, unfortunately, are the 1966/1967 crop prospects favourable, due to prevailing adverse seasonal conditions. The notice began by statingMeggitt Limited announces that it wishes to dissociate itself from any statements and views expressed or actions taken by Marrickville Holdings Limited on matters affecting vegetable oil seed operations in Australia. That firm is a very responsible oil seeds agent and it has dissociated itself from the campaign conducted by Marrickville Holdings Ltd. Remarkably, Meggitt Ltd. was joined in this action by a number of other margarine manufacturers who do not believe that Marrickville Holdings is going about its campaign in a truly ethical fashion and who have no wish to be associated with such a campaign. One such firm is Nuttelex Food Products Pty. Ltd. in Victoria, which published in the Press a letter to this effect. Another is Vegetable Oils Pty. Ltd. These companies took this action because it had become apparent that the arguments of Marrickville Holdings were sheer fabrication. That is all they are. Next we get to the question of health. On this question, Marrickville Holdings returned to the attack that it launched a few years ago on the health qualities of butter vis a vis poly-unsaturated margarine. There is a very interesting story to be told about this. Marrickville Holdings claimed first that if its licence to manufacture were suspended or if any way affected the production of safflower margarine would cease and that any benefits that the community might gain from the use of polyunsaturated margarine would be lost to the public. This is plainly not true, because there are in Australia three producers of poly-unsaturated margarine. At one stage, the advertising of Marrickville Holdings was so blatantly untrue and unethical as to attract the attention of the Victorian Statute Law Revision Committee, which declared plainly that the company's advertisements were unethical, misleading and false. Thc Committee pointed out that the advertising used loose phrases such as "" informed medical opinion"" and also the "" R x "" symbol, thereby denoting that medical authorities agreed with what the company was stating. On this question of health, the company flew in the face of world authorities who support the stand that claims made about health benefits obtainable from polyunsaturated margarine are untrue. I quote the views of Dr. Rutstein, of the Harvard Medical School, who stated that there is "" not a shred of medical evidence to prove that substituting unsaturated fats for saturated will affect the course of coronary heart disease"". I do not want to quote the views of these authorities at length. I shall mention only one more opinion. It is that of Dr. David Turner, a leading child specialist, of Toronto, who stated that pregnant women who go on low cholesterol diets may have mentally retarded children. Despite the fact that bodies such as the British Medical Association, the Australian Medical Association and the National Heart Foundation of Australia dissociate themselves from the claims made by Marrickville Holdings, the company has persisted with its campaign. As late as yesterday, the Minister for Health (Dr. Forbes), speaking on this subject in his House, saidThe National Heart Foundation of Australia has this matter under continuous review, but at present it believes that there is not sufficient data believes it can win support. It has begun available to justify claims for replacement in the trying to whip up some enthusiasm among diet of saturated fats by poly-unsaturated fats. The claims of Marrickville Holdings with whole shabby story comes to a good conrespect to poly-unsaturated fats are called clusion when we see the final advertisement into question further when it is realised that that has come into my hands.

78,The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Described,"New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, have clearly indicated that in order to maintain their programmes of works and services, they must raise taxes and increase charges. This in turn must further decrease consumer spending, thus creating frustration, lack of confidence and, eventually, unemployment. If one adds to this gloomy picture tbe fact fhat our overseas balances dropped by some $300 million in the two years ended 30th June 1966 and the further admission by the Treasurer that the raising of loans both overseas and in Australia will be difficult this year, one does not wonder at the reaction of fear and disappointment throughout a wide section of the community at the presentation of this negative and spineless Budget. I want to make some reference to social category and also the estimated cost of services and to say, first of all, that the applying the full pension to all couples Government has talked a lot of nonsense where the husband was 65 years of age. in this Budget about the increase in pension This action, of course, would do away with rates.

What the Government regards made for an extra $6 million to overcome as a generous amount is in fact an increase the impossible and intolerable position of of 16c a week or less than 3c a day. Of these forgotten people to whom I have course, and I think everyone in Australia referred.

The alternative for her was. at the age of 58, to seek employmentafter not having worked, other than at home duties as a wife and mother, for the past 38 years.

They are gravely concerned at the buildings which still exist. It is crystal clear this year has allocated an additional $30 million for education purposes. I feel that it appears to me that ihe Government is As one who has been closely associated period of years, and who knows from bitter experience what any curtailment of demand tor the products of this industry means to my State of South Australia, 1 want to make some observations on this subject. First of all, let me remind the House' that in the metropolitan area in South Auslralia by far the greatest numbers of private employment opportunities are in the motor vehicle industry and its supply industries, the building industry and the consumer durable manufacturing industries, in all of which the Treasurer ( Mr since the provisions of the Budget were McMahon) has said that there has been a slackening of demand. The Government has been aware of the position for a considerable time, yet it has sat idly by and watched the position continue to drift until today these industries face a crisis. As to the motor vehicle industry, some 12 months ago I warned the Government that unless some practical steps were taken to assist the industry, further deterioration would result, with disastrous results in the employment field, particularly in South Australia. In September of 1965 my colleague, the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Beaton) asked the then Prime Minister what plans the Government had to arrest the startling fall in motor vehicle sales, with consequent dismissals in the industry, and the steep fall in approvals in the building industry. 1 know of no government plan of any note which attempts to rectify this serious problem. As late as June of this year the managing director of General Motors-Holdens Pty. Ltd., Mr Wilson, issued a Press statement showing clearly that if the poor consumer demand continued his company would have no alternative but to reduce the work force. I have before me a newspaper article published on 12th June. It bears the heading "" Fears Over Car Jobs"" and the date line "" Melbourne, July 11 "". It readsThe managing director of General MotorsHolden's ( Mr M. E. Wilson) said that unless Australia's economy could be stimulated, retrenchment in the automotive industry was inevitable. "" The industry is waiting with its fingers crossed "" he said. "" Our big hope is a Federal Budget which will stimulate consumer spending in the community. "" Unless this occurs, I am afraid we will be forced to retrench some time in the future."" F.9056/66 -R -[23 ] of General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd., and he said it in July. He gave the Government good warning. The Government must know that figures for new car sales show that sales for July of this year were down 18 per cent, on those of the corresponding month of last year. The Government has been fully aware of the situation-thi s was admitted by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech-bu t it has done nothing to help the industry in any way. In the short time announced the Ford Motor Co. of Aust. Ltd. and the British Motor Corporation (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. have begun dismissing employees. Jt is with extreme regret that I have to inform the House that within the last half hour I have had what I would call official advice that at this very moment General Motors-Holden's Ply. Ltd. is, as a first step and a first step only, giving notice to some 700 of its employees throughout Australia. to the Treasurer and his Budget. On Monday of this week the "" Australian "" newspaper, referring to the motor industry, carried a front page story headed "" Budget Blamed for Dashing Hopes of Rising Sales "". l t went on to sayFord warns industry faces further cuts. The British Motor Corporation sacked 300 production workers from its Sydney plant yesterday after a sudden change in its original plan to stand them down without pay for only two weeks. And in Melbourne, the Ford Motor Company said it feared further widespread retrenchments faced the automotive industry unless some stimulus was injected into consumer buying before the end of the year. General Motors-Holden's is also extremely worried and the company is stockpiling cars because of falling sales. The industry pressed strongly for an income tax reduction before the Budget but is now looking to a sales tax cut as the solution. An editorial in today's issue of the same newspaper is headed "" The plight of our car industry"", and it saysThe Government, said Mr Holt on Monday, does not treat the present situation in the Australian motor vehicle industry as a matter of concern.",28,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

82,Mr Birrell,"This afternoon, thanksI wonder whether the 700 men who are receiving notice this afternoon, and their families, would adopt the same view as our Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt). The editorial continuesTo put it mildly, this is surprising. Mr Holt's statement seems to ignore that rework under a system providing for a trenchment and its effect on the industry's sales guaranteed annual wage. This system of a are occurring in a sector that has enormous guaranteed annual wage, as the Minister importance because the state of its health has a well knows, does not apply in Australia. great deal of influence on consumer behaviour. The Government views this unhappy state of affairs as an adjustment by manufacturers who dustry, in co-operation with the unions, has, had over-extended themselves in the past three since the Second World War, endeavoured years. But this is quite preposterous. If anything, the work force and has designed a system that industry is the victim of the vacillations and conendeavours to maintain stability even during tradictions in what the Government is pleased to call its economic policy. On Tuesday, 23rd August 1966-onl y last periods of failure have been when the inweek, Mr Deputy Speaker-the Minister dustry has been interfered with or harassed for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury), by the Government, as in 1961, for inwhile speaking in this debate, made a brief stance, and now, when the industry requires reference to the motor industry. I do not some Government assistance, which is not know whether he was speaking for the forthcoming. Government or whether he was making only personal observations, but as he is the Minister in charge of the important portbecause of lack of consumer spending, a folio of Labour and National Service and a situation that can be rectified only by the member of the Cabinet, I for my part accept Government itself, demand has fallen, and his contribution as representing the view of consequently stockpiling has reached the the Government. He saidIn every advanced country-particularl y in the United States of America-the motor car industry is subject to cycles of demand, fashion and purchasing at different times which move sometimes at a considerable variance with the general level of the rest of the economy. Whatever happens to the economy at large, we will still have to face considerable future fluctuations in the motor industry. In other words, he agrees with the position adopted by the Government for so long in accepting no responsibility for the stability of the industry. In fact, he virtually gives the workers in the motor industry an assurance that fluctuations in the industry will be considerable in the future and that therefore they must accept their positions as pawns in the game in an industry subject to ups and downs that this Government believes cannot be stabilised. I should have thought that the Government's experience in 1961, when it almost wrecked the industry -and , in fact, almost wrecked itselfwould be remembered by the culprits. The Minister showed his complete ignorance of the circumstances when he tried to compare the industry wilh its counterpart in the United States of America. In America ever since the introduction of mass production it has been accepted that lay offs will occur at the time of model changes. However, to maintain consumer spending, all workers in the industry, whether laid off or not, To offset this difference the Australian into maintain as far as possible a stabilised model changing periods. This stabilisation system has worked quite well. The only The position of the industry now is that danger level. I am aware that some people say the industry has expanded too quickly. Should this be so surely the Government is mainly to blame, for it was only last year that it was encouraging the Japanese indus'ry to commence assembly operations in Australia. The Government had already been warned of what would happen unless it did something to bolster the existing Australian industry. I know that some people suggest that in some sections of the industry profits are too high. If this theory is correct then the Government, which completely controls taxation in this field, is wholly to blame. Be these things as they may, the stark facts are that the country now has a sizable motor industry, which has been accepted as such by the community at large and by the Government. The industry is a major employer of labour. Its Australian suppliers, representing thousands of small factories throughout thc land, depend almost entirely on the industry for their very existence. It is a highly efficient industry. Annually it takes its maximum number of apprentices, who will become the skilled tradesmen of the future. Much of its complex and modern machinery cannot be found anywhere else in Australia. Furthermore-and this is very importantin case of danger it is one of the few modern industries in Australia that could be converted quickly to almost any type of defence production on a large and efficient scale. Having all these facts in mind I put it strongly to the Treasurer and the Government that Australia cannot afford to let such an industry run down or become complacent, without at least some attempt to bolster it up. Accordingly, 1 suggest as a first step that a considerable sales tax reduction should be applied immediately to Australian made vehicles; that the present sales tax applicable to knocked down vehicles only assembled in Australia should be increased; but a further steep increase in sales tax should be applied to completed vehicles imported into Australia; and that the Federal Government should take heed of the famous slogan "" Buy Australian Made"" by instructing all of its departments that in future when purchasing motor vehicles they must, where they are available, purchase only Australian made vehicles. In introducing the Budget the Treasurer saidThe effect of the Commonwealth Budget will be expansionary. I believe it has already proved to be just Opposition ( Mr Calwell) condemned the the opposite, because all the indicators Budget on a number of grounds. He moved suggest that it has deflated further an already an amendment listing six grounds. I have weak ancl sick economy. Evidence of this not the time to deal with each of them, but is in the motor industry, to which I have I should like to analyse the first three. The just referred. In yesterday's Adelaide first ground related to wage injustice and "" Advertiser"", under the heading "" Share stated thatDowntrend is Unchecked"", the following comment appearsAustralian exchanges yesterday entered their seventh successive week with prices on the downtrend. The continued downtrend in consumer demand is clearly indicated by the fact that large retail stores are advertising extensively and asking people to "" buy now, pay later "". There is definite lack of confidence among business establishments, both large and small. The Treasurer must be aware that there is no shortage of manufactured goods in Australia; in fact, the position is just the opposite. Motor vehicles have been stockpiled to a dangerous level. Warehouses and store rooms all over Australia are crammed full of unpacked new refrigerators, washing machines, television sets and the like. Even in the housing field we have the almost unbelievable position of thousands of Australian families being inadequately housed when in every capital city in Australia there are thousands of vacant new homes and home units ready for occupation. The shortage is lack of money, not lack of goods or materials. In other words, there is not sufficient consumer spending. If the Treasurer thinks that his meagre social service and repatriation benefits increases will allow our unfortunate people to rush out and buy these goods he is sadly mistaken. Nor will the recent basic wage increase make any material difference, because that has been practically absorbed already by increased prices ancl by heavier income taxation. What the Government must do, and must do quickly if it wants to recover from its own created financial mess, is to inject more money into the economy so as to increase consumer spending, and to reduce interest rates and deposits. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. last Tuesday evening the Leader of the The House condemns the Budget because it fails to recognise the injustices wrought upon wage earners because real wages have fallen as prices have risen faster than wages. not stand up to analysis.

86,Mr Fox,"That is not right, and it will the figures he has quoted from the publication, but I do quarrel with the conclusion he has drawn. It is not much use to have statistics at one's fingertips if one cannot properly interpret them, and the honourable gentleman has fallen into a trap. He saidMy interpretation of the Consumer Price Index is that it has risen 9 per cent, in the last two years. This interpretation is completely wrong. It is true that the Consumer Price Index has moved from 125.8 to 135.4 during the period March 1964 to March 1966. This represents an increase in the index of 9.6, but this is not 9.6 per cent.; it is an increase of 9.6 on 125.8, not 9.6 on 100. This is a percentage increase of 7.6, not of 9.6. In arriving at his interpretation the Leader of the Opposition proudly quoted from the "" Monthly Review of Business Statistics"" and saidThis, of course, is not a Liberal Party publication engineering and metal working; ships, intended only to deceive and mislead. I suppose we can all make up our own minds about whether, when he cited an increase of 9 per cent, in the price index, he set out to deceive or mislead or whether he just did not understand. Either way, it reflects no credit on him. Having demonstrated that the consumer price index has risen by little more than the basic wage, he used this fact to bolster his argument that real wages have fallen as prices have risen faster than wages. Let me mention another publication "" Survey of Weekly Earnings"" issued by the Commonwealth Statistician. I shall refer to that publication, as well as to the "" Monthly Review of Business Statistics"", and in particular to two tables. The first is headed ""Weekly Wage Rates for Adult Males"". This represents the basic wage plus margins and loadings. It shows that the rate of weekly income moved from $37.63 in March 1964 to $40.79 in March 1966, an increase of nearly 8.3 per cent. before the basic wage rise. refer to another table which shows the average weekly earnings of employed males; the figures include overtime, over award payments and bonuses. This table indicates that between March 1964 and March 1966 average weekly earnings increased from $48.40 to $54.50 a week, an increase of approximately H i per cent. Honourable gentlemen opposite will ask: ""But who earns this wage? It is certainly not the man on the basic wage."" That is true, but I pose the question: ""Who earns the basic wage ""? The October 1965 issue of the ""Survey of Weekly Earnings"" reports the findings of a survey taken for the last pay period in October 1965. It covered 3,000 of the largest employers of labour representing an estimated 1,181,000 full time adult male employees. It also covered 409,000 full time male employees of Government departments-Commonwealt h and Stateand local government authorities. It covered a multitude of industries, both manufacturing and non manufacturing. The manufacturing industries covered the extracting, refining and founding of metals; vehicles, parts and accessories; textiles, clothing and footwear; food, drink and tobacco; paper, printing, bookbinding and photography; chemicals, dyes, explosives, paints and non-mineral oils. The nonmanufacturing industries covered mining and quarrying; electricity, gas, water and sanitary services; building and construction; transport, storage and communication; the wholesale trade, primary produce dealing and the retail trade. No one can claim that this was not a comprehensive business survey. Employers were asked to comment on any full time adult male employees receiving less than $32 in the survey week. Remember, the basic wage at that time was not $32 but $30.80. I will give the honourable member for Robertson the opportunity to guess how many of the 1,589,000 full time adult male employees received less than $32 a week, not the basic wage of $30.80 a week. member could not guess, nor could any honourable member of this Parliament. Approximately 300, or less than .02 per cent, of the 1,589,000 employees to whom I have referred earned less than S32 a week when the basic wage was $30.80, so it is logical to assume that less than .02",33,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

90,Mr Fox,"I would bet the honorableper cent, of all full time adult male employees were earning only the basic wage. With the total wage up 8.3 per cent., with average wages up 12.5 per cent, and with the consumer price index up only 7.6 per cent, in the period under review, what a lot of rot it is for the Leader of the Opposition to claim that real wages have fallen. I remind the House that I am not quoting from a Liberal Party publication "" designed to mislead and deceive "". I am quoting from the same source of information as used by the Leader of the Opposition-the Commonwealth Statistician. The honourable gentleman then referred to the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure for 1965-66 which accompanied the Budget. He spoke of a miscalculation by the Treasurer and referred to negative productivity. He cited figures from the White Paper to show that during the past year the market value of goods and services produced in Australia rose by 4 i per cent, whereas in the same period prices rose by 4 per cent, and the number of persons engaged in producing the national product increased by 3 per cent. The honourable gentleman then went on to sayWhen these factors are combined, there has been actually a decline in the gross national probecause an examination of what previous duct of something like 2 per cent. . . . We on the Opposition side could perhaps call it "" negative productivity "". I am by nature inquisitive so I set out to learn the comparable figures for Labour's last years of office-the four years after the war had ended. AgainI sought information from the Commonwealth Statistician and I found that between 1947-48 and 1948-49 the gross national product increased by 13.4 per cent. In the same period the C series index, the measuring stick which preceded the consumer price index, increased by 9.7 per cent, and the number of employees in civilian employment by 4.2 per cent. If we combine these figures as the honourable gentleman suggested, what do wefind?I do not know whether the honourable member for Robertson can guess, but we find that this was another year of negative productivity. ber of the Cabinet at that time too. perhaps I should say irresponsible-member of Cabinet at that time. As I have pointed out, according to the honourable gentleman's statement, the year in question was another year of negative productivity. When we take into account the fact that the employmentfiguresfor 1949 were well down due to the very bad coal strike which resulted in the Labour Government putting servicemen into the field, we can see that the picture was actually worse than he indicated. So much for the Leader of the Opposition and the figures he quoted from the Commonwealth Statistician. People who quote figures and statistics should be sure that they understand them. The second point of the honourable gentleman's amendment is that the Budget makes inadequate adjustments to social service payments. During the course of his speech he said that what the Government had done for the pensioners in this Budget is regarded as an insult rather than a benefit. He said that the first priority of a Labour Government would be to raise the amounts now paid to those receiving pensions to a more satisfactory level. Evidently Labour has one policy when in government and another policy when seeking government Labour governments did for pensioners does not bear comparison with the record of this Government. Collectively, Labour in its last year of office devoted 14.6 per cent, of its total budget expenditure to the National Welfare Fund. In his Budget Speech a week ago the Treasurer announced that payments to the National Welfare Fund for this current year are estimated to exceed $1,000 million which is actually 17.2 per cent, of the total Budget. Individually, pensioners receive a far better deal from this Government than they ever did from Labour. I have compiled a table which singles out certain groups of pensioners and shows in dollars and cents the amounts which they received in 1949, Labour's last year of office, and the amounts which they received under this Budget. I have also indicated the amounts as a percentage of the basic wage. With the concurrence of in "" Hansard "".",34,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

Instead, I will single Government the total represents 105.6 per out one or two groups of pensioners. For instance, when Labour was in office in 1949 the single age pensioner received $4.25 which represented 33 per cent, of the means test, from also receiving part of the basic wage. Under this Budget he will receive 40 per cent, of the basic wage. benefits. fringe benefits, one of which is the rent allowance. If we allow for that, a single pensioner receives 45.7 per cent, of the basic wage. Under a Labour Government, the A class widow received 34 per cent, of the basic wage. Today she receives 49 per cent, of the basic wage. In both instances, the sum includes the domestic allowance. I do not know whether my friend from Robertson knows how much extra she received from the Labour Government if she had three children. received $4.75, which represented 34 per cent, of the basic wage. This Government pays $1.50 for each child, and the widow with three children receives $20.50, or 62.5 per cent, of the basic wage.

Labour paid him 82 per cent, of the basic wage. Under this Government he receives 93 per cent, of the basic wage. If we add the allowance paid to the wife of a T.P.I, pensioner, we find that under the Labour Government he received just over 100 per cent, of the basic wage. Under this Government, which removed the ceiling that prevented the T.P.I, pensioner, under the service pension, the income of such a pensioner and his wife, if they can meet the means test, climbs to $37.50, compared with a basic wage of $32.80. So between them they are receiving 114.3 per cent, of the basic wage. Under those circumstances, can there be any doubt, that all classes of pensioners are doing very much better under this Government than they did under Labour? In addition, this Liberal-Country Party Government has introduced, as my friend from Robertson has said, many other benefits not thought of by Labour. For example, we pay a guardian's allowance of $4 a week to single pensioners who have children under 16 years of age in their care. Labour paid nothing for such children. We also pay an allowance of $1.50 for each child of an A class widow. The homes for the aged scheme, which, up to the end of last month, had provided a total of nearly $60 million, and accommodation for 23,567 aged persons, was introduced by this Government.

It has also greatly liberalised the means test in relation to both property and income and so has made many more persons eligible to receive pensions than ever received them under Labour rule. This Government reduced the residential qualification for age migrants from 20 years to 10 years, and in this Budget it has removed the nationality qualification which prevented migrants who did not become naturalised from receiving the age pension. It made war widows and World WarI nurses eligible for war service homes assistance and it introduced remarriage gratuities for war widows. It introduced a scheme under which the next of kin of seriously ill servicemen may obtain free air travel to visit the servicemen in hospital. This Government introduced telephone rental and television licence concession rates for pensioners. In this Budget it has again increased the permissible earnings of A class widows so that those of them who wish to work may earn $3 a week for each child without their pensions being reduced. This Government also introduced the tax age allowance for persons of pensionable age who do not draw pensions. IfI have enough time, I shall say a little more, on this subject. IfI do not have the time, I hope I shall be able to avail myself of thc opportunity of saying something about it when we are discussing the Estimates. These are only some of the additional benefits and liberalisations introduced by this Liberal-Country Party Government to assist pensioners. But I think I have said enough to prove the falsity of the claim by the Leader of the Opposition that the Budget makes inadequate adjustments to social service payments. I believe that performances speak louder than words and with much greater authority than promises, and this Government has the performances on the board. Speaking of pensions, I was very distressed to read in the latest issue of "" The Combined Pensioners' Association News"" of the opposition to the special rate pension for single pensioners. Some married pensioners evidently regard this as robbing them. The article states that had the rise been given also to the married pensioners, the single pensioners would have lost nothing by it. As I am fully convinced that the special rate pension for single pensioners is a just arrangement, I want to try and explain why the Government introduced this special pension. ber have time to explain the justice of it? the justice of it, if the honourable member will only listen. Let us take the case of a married pensioner couple, each receiving the full pension. In that case, there are two pensions coming into the home. If one of the pensioners dies and there is no special rate of pension for the survivor, the income coming into that home is cut in half. Let the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) ask himself: Is the rent halved? Are the rates which are paid to the council, the board of works or the equivalent authority in a State halved? Does it cost only half the amount to have the house painted and repairs made? Can the survivor burn half a fire if he or she wants to keep warm and buy only half the former quantity of coal, briquettes or coke? Can the survivor use only half a radiator? Can he burn half an electric light? Or is it suggested that he should replace a 75 watt lamp with a 25 watt or 40 watt lamp? Is the radio licence fee halved? Again, if the pensioner is fortunate enough to own a television set or to have a telephone, is the television licence fee or the telephone rental halved? If the pensioner owns a motor car, can he say: "" I will only drive half as far today, because I can afford only half the petrol""? Will the garage cut the repair bills in half, and will the ' registrar of motor vehicles reduce his registration fees by half? Will the insurance company reduce its premium by half? The honourable member suggests that I cannot explain the justice of the scheme. If the pensioners think these things out, they will see the justice of an extra pension for single pensioners, whatever the general pension rate might be. Most single pensioners are single because they have lost their partners, not because they have chosen to be bachelors or spinsters. It is hard enough to lose a partner at a very late stage in life, without",36,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

100,Pensions For Mr Fox,"1 have the time to explainthe Government giving the survivor another kick in the teeth by saying to him: ""You are now expected to live on half the pension you got previously "", That is why the Government introduced the special rate for single pensioners. This is the thinking behind the introduction of the rent allowance, which is paid only when one pension is coming into the home. I hope the Government will see fit to extend the rent allowance to pensioners who own their own homes, so as to help them pay the council rates, the water rates and to meet the cost of maintaining their homes in a good state of repair. I have already referred to this. It is to no-one's advantage There the position under the vigorous and to have property deteriorate. I believe that the Government could help to maintain pensioners' homes in a good state of repair either by paying the rent allowance to pensioners who own their own homes and are not paying rent, or by making money available at very low rates of interest, or at no interest at all, to enable pensioners to carry out repairs and maintenance. Such advances could be recovered against the estate after the death of a pensioner, or, in the case of a married couple, after both pensioners had died. I hope the Government will give this suggestion serious consideraing these schools in Victoria in 1955 was tion. I hope also that married pensioners and pensioner organisations will have second thoughts about their opposition to this special rate pension for single pensioners. The day may arrive when they also will be grateful for the special rate which is paid to single pensioners. The Leader of the Opposition says the schools in that year whereas this year there Budget fails to recognise the serious crisis are 222 and others are being built. In 1955 in education. Over the past year, we have there were 857 student secondary teachers all heard a great deal about the crisis in in teachers training colleges in Victoria; education, about the shortage of teachers, this year there are 3,878. the overcrowded classrooms and so on. Only last week I happened to come across an old report book of mine from the Melthing on the education front is so good that bourne High School. It goes back 40 years, it could not be improved-and greatly and shows that 40 years ago the number of improved, I will concede-ther e is far pupils in the intermediate form at the Melfrom a condition of crisis in Victoria. The bourne High School was 40. As a matter Government's efforts to solve what I gather, of interest, I telephoned the Melbourne from all I have read, including statistics, High School last Friday to ascertain how to be virtually a world problem, bears commany pupils there were in intermediate parison with the efforts of most orher grades this year. I was told that there were countries. eight grades handling intermediate students and that there were 306 pupils doing interHaving told honourable members of many mediate studies. The smallest class conthings in this Budget of which I heartily tained 33 students and the largest 40. The picture today is not a great deal difierent from what it was 40 years ago. If anything, it has improved slightly. So if we have a crisis today, presumably there was just as great a crisis then. In his Budget speech, the Treasurer pointed out that expenditure on education will exceed S141 million dollars this year. This is almost three times the amount that was provided by the Commonwealth Government five years ago and represents an increase of more than $30 million on last year's expenditure. I can speak only of education in my own State of Victoria. progressive government led by Sir Henry Bolte is not one of crisis but of very striking progress. I have here a table of enrolment statistics for Victorian secondary schools. It does not include technical schools. This table was prepared by the Victorian Department of Education earlier this year. For my purposes I have selected two years, 1955, which was the year in which the Bolte Government came to power in Victoria, and this year, 1966. I have taken three lots of pupils. The total number of pupils attend53,409; this year the total is 138,773. In 1955 those studying for matriculation numbered 1,095; this year they number 6.912. In 1955 the number of leaving certificate pupils was 3,031, whereas this year it is 14,422. Just as a matter of interest I also ascertained the number of high schools in Victoria in 1955. There were 84 such Whilst no-one would claim that everyI have not a great many minutes left. approve I should like to make some reference to two or three matters which I should have liked to have seen dealt with in the Budget, and which I hope will be dealt with by the Government as part of its policy when it is returned to office on 26th November. First, I believe it is time that the permissible earnings of persons employed in sheltered workshops were greatly increased. Earlier this year the Government departed somewhat from the principle of relating earnings to 85 per cent, much as we say we do I believe that we incapacity. I understand that a person is now deemed to be eligible to receive an invalid pension on medical evidence alone rather than on the basis of what he is able to earn. But there is still a proviso that if that person is able to earn more than $8 a week he is not considered to be 85 per cent, incapacitated. Persons employed in sheltered workshops are severely handicapped, some of them physically and some of them mentally, and there is no doubt that medically all would qualify as being 85 per cent, incapacitated. If they are able to make themselves useful members of the community, thereby adding to our national production, instead of sitting at home and drawing an invalid pension for doing nothing, they ought to be permitted to earn substantially more than they are permitted to earn now. It would be a compensation for their incapacity. Yesterday I directed a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Supply. I asked whether the Government would consider introducing legislation similar to that which exists in the United States, which guarantees small businessesand sheltered workshops are includedat least a 10 per cent, share of all government contracts, where these contracts are divisible, and where the small business is able to handle the work at a competitive price and produce quality workmanship. There are many jobs which persons in a sheltered workshop could do satisfactorily, such as packing Army rations. I understand that one sheltered workshop some years ago was given a contract to do this type of work. I hope that the Government will give consideration to the suggestion I have made. I want to make two brief references to income tax. The first concerns education expenses for students whose training does not cease at the age of 21. There are many professions, such as medicine, science, engineering, and education itself, where we need all the qualified people we can get, and where training goes on up to 25 or 30 years of age. Even if these students are able to earn during their leisure time they are unable to claim a deduction for their own education expenses. Their parents are unable to claim a deduction after they have turned 21 years. If we need these skills as ought to be doing everything we can to enable parents to keep their children at universities, and I believe that we ought to permit deductions for education expenses for dependent children up to, at least, 25 years of age. The final matter to which I wish to refer is the age tax allowance which was introduced by this Government to place persons of pensionable age who do not receive the pension in no worse a position as regards taxation than are pensioners. In other words, these people are permitted to earn an amount equal to the joint pension of a pensioner couple, plus permissible income, tax free. Under the terms of this Budget the figure is now $37.50 a week. In my opinion this concession does not go far enough because pensioners receive many fringe benefits, not the least of which are those under the pensioner medical service to which I have already referred. They also receive concessions in relation to radio and television licences and telephone rentals. I believe that it is time that this age tax allowance was extended. Persons who provide for themselves after retirement should not be disadvantaged merely because they have done so. I think that we could do something to help them by reducing the tax rate of 45 per cent, which they have to pay on the excess of their income over $37.50 per week. I believe that Budgets should not be judged on what they give by way of increased social service payments or reductions in taxation rates. It is the function of a Budget to create a climate and produce a blueprint for prosperity and progress. By all standards this Budget meets that requirement. That there is nothing wrong with the Government's fiscal policy is obvious when one studies the "" Monthly Review of Business Statistics"". During the past year Australia has produced more coal and steel than ever before; we generated more electricity than ever before; there are more persons in employment today than ever before in our history, and only 1.2 per cent, of Australia's work force are registered for employment. Deposits in savings banks have never been higher than they are now. All sections of the community-the manufacturers, the primary producers, the wage earners and the pensioners-hav e all done well under this Government. I believe that the Budget will maintain the extraordinary rate of progress which this country has made under Liberal and Country Party administration. 1 have much pleasure in supporting it. amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) highlights the failures of the Treasurer's first Budget. The amendment demonstrates the Labour Party's humane and determined approach to national issues. It reads as followsThe House condemns thc Budget because1. It fails to recognise the injustices wrought upon wage earners because real wages have fallen as prices have risen faster than wages. 2. It makes inadequate adjustments to social service paymenis. 3. It fails to recognise the serious crisis in education. 4. It does not acknowledge the lack of confidence on the part of the business community in the future growth of the economy. 5. It does not recognise the need of further basic development, public and private, in addition to the need for adequate defence, and that balanced development can only lake place by active encouragement to Australian industry and co-operation with the Stales. 6. l l does nothing lo relieve our dependence on a high rate of foreign investment to finance the deficit in our balance of payfrom 1950 to 1965 amounted to $4,288 ments. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) has just criticised that amendment. After listening to the honourable member I can only say that he must have lived a cloistered existence in the last two years. Whilst he gives great credit to the Government for its approach to social services, education and various other matters in the national economy, people from pensioners organisations. parents and teachers organisations, manufacturers organisations and various other bodies have been continually coming to members of the Opposition complaining about these things. Either the honourable member has hidden himself in his office in his electorate or has gone out of his electorate so that the people might not be able to see him. The amendment was moved by the Leader of the Opposition in order to point up the failures of this Government in the economic situation that exists in Australia. I intend to devote some of my time to the sixth point in our amendment. On many occasions my good friend and colleague, the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters), has raised in the House the topic of overseas investment in Australia. I think it is true to say that for a number of years the honourable member for Scullin has been warning the House and the nation of the dangers of uncontrolled inflow of foreign capital. He has been supported by some strange bedfellows, one in particular being the Minister for Trade and The Minister has sounded off on one or two occasions on this topic but, unlike the honourable member for Scullin, the Minister seems to do all his fighting outside the ring. He rarely talks on the subject in the House. The Government's policy indicates that he says very little on the matter in Government circles or in Cabinet. He is a powerful, influential and experienced member of the Government, but whilst he criticises the uncontrolled inflow of foreign capital he is unable to make any definite changes in the policy. The honourable member for Scullin. on the other hand, continually raises this subject in the House. I have great pleasure this afternoon in supporting him in his endeavours. Private overseas investment in Australia million. In the same period our exports exceeded imports by $2,045 million. However, with the addition of invisibles, such as freight, insurance and interest, costing $6,445 million, the final picture shows an overall deficit of $4,400 million. It is obvious that we are able to balance our import and export operations only by allowing a huge inflow of uncontrolled overseas capital amounting to $4,288 million. Added to this we borrow",37,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

What we must appreciate is that the greater the overseas investment in Australia, the greater the amount that has to be repatriated from Australia by way of dividends. In 1965 the sum of $261 million was payable as dividends and most of this amount went overseas. The dangers in our dependence on overseas investment are obvious to anybody who cares to look at the picture. One danger is that if the United Kingdom or the United States of America shuts off the flow of capital to Australia we will have to meet dividend and other payments on previous overseas investments but we will have no incomings, only outgoings. Undoubtedly bankruptcy will be in sight. With such a huge amount invested in Australia, overseas investors have a strong say in our economy. Many of our industries are in overseas hands. The overseas investor can manipulate, amongst other things, employment opportunities, manufacturing potential, prices and the wage structure in the industries under his control. We are becoming more and more dependent on the overseas investor and more and more at his mercy each year. Professor Karmel and Miss Maureen concentrated in the urban areas. ManufacBrunt have estimated that one third of Austuring industries have more than doubled tralian manufacturing industry is highly output since 1948 but the increase by rural concentrated.

These include, to mention only a few, the motor vehicles industry, the chemicals industry, the petroleum products industry, the aluminium industry, the tobacco industry and the soap and paints industries. All of these are controlled overseas. Government supporters often say that ours is a free enterprise economy, but because of the monopolisation of our industries, both by Australian companies and by overseas owned or controlled companies, our economy is no longer a free enterprise economy. It can be clearly demonstrated that our economic growth under the system permitted to operate by the Government is far from satisfactory. Our national income has increased by only 4 per cent, a year since 1948. That is a slower rate of increase than the rate experienced in Japan and West Germany. National income per head has increased by only 1.5 per cent, per annum. One of the most obvious features of our lopsided development is that since the war years growth and development have been a deleterious effect on rural industries. As To stress further the lopsided development of our economy under this Government let me quote figures taken from the will place much less reliance on overseas capital. We agree that we must have some capital from overseas, but the inflow of capital from overseas will be controlled. The next Labour Government will insist on an Australian component being retained in all our industries. Takeovers of existing industries will be curbed and industries will be encouraged to decentralise, lf the Labour Government does not act from the beginning of next year, it may be too late. 1 have been speaking about a subject thai i regard as our most dangerous internal problem. I now turn to vvhat I regard as our most explosive external probiem, and 1 do not mean Vietnam. Vietnam is not our responsibility. We are there against the wishes of a large proportion of the Australian people. But we are in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea with the blessings of ail Australians. Auslralia has accepted foster-fatherhood of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and of its people. Papua has been our responsibility since 1906 and New Guinea since 1914. All sins of omission and commission since then are our responsibility; we are to blame entirely. I believe that the time is fast approaching when Australia will have to answer for its administration. Post war history is dotted with examples of countries that have been granted freedom from colonial bondage. Papua and New Guinea is one of the few countries that is not self-governing. I want to make it clear lhat 1 have a deep appreciation of what Australia has done in Papua and New Guinea. I compliment the Government on increasing the grant for this year to $70 million. This is an increase over the amount for last year of some $8 million. I speak on this topic today merely to warn that all of us appear to be much too complacent about the situation in New Guinea. We must face the facts and we must face them now. The criticisms of our administration in the United Nations and other world forums will continue and indeed will increase. The criticism will encourage dissension in the urban areas of Port Moresby, Madang, Lae and Rabaul. I must admit that there are plenty of grounds for dissension and dissatisfaction amongst the indigenous people. For instance, wages are too low, food is too dear and housing is extremely difficult to obtain. But the dissension in these places is likely to show out in a very few years, perhaps even in a few months, in a riot in one of the urban areas. The riot will receive much more publicity internationally than the provision of a further $70 million as a grant for this year would ever receive. The good that we do in Papua and New Guinea will not receive nearly the same amount of publicity as will dissension or the riot that might occur amongst the people of the Territory. Our Asian neighbours have all been granted their independence in the post war years and naturally they will support vhe efforts of the indigenous people of Papua and New Guinea to obtain their independence. Whatever we may say or do will be overshadowed by the general implication of a colonial relationship. The emphasis of all our critics will be on exploitation, racial prejudice, discrimination and injustice. We must remember that only 25,000 Europeans, mostly Australians, and more than 2 million New Guineans live in the Territory. All our motives will be suspect. We will be trying to convince individuals and nations in the United Nations and other world forums of our good intentions, while they will approach the discussions with the attitude: "" My mind is made up, do not confuse me with facts "". I do not think that we can win in New Guinea, whatever we do, but this should not stop us from trying to relinquish our responsibilities, whether early or late, while retaining good relations with the people of the Territory. As I see it, we can follow one of three courses. The first course is to try to hand over our responsibilities in the Territory to the United Nations or to some United Nations administration agency. We should try to do that now. In other words, we should put up an umbrella and get in out of the rain, because we will be the subject of criticism whatever we do. The second course is to set a target date for self-determination in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea for, say, the year 2000. But if we do this, we must have the nerve to see it through. We must be prepared to protect law and order-ou r law and order-in the Territory, either with a United Nations peacekeeping force or with Australian garrison troops, because I do not think we can survive to the year 2000 in the Territory. The third course is to speed up our plans now for development and self-determination, and in speeding up our plans we should hope that internal and external pressures will give us more time than I now anticipate. I favour the last approach, and I think we should err on the side of speed, if we are to err at all. I believe that we have a much better chance of preserving our good reputation in New Guinea if we demonstrate with action our good intentions. I stress that we should make it very clear to the people of the Territory that economic assistance and civil aid will continue after the decision on self determination has been taken. Promises of economic aid and civil aid to various Asian countries have been bandied about this House for the past few weeks. To me it is most important that by far the largest slice of aid should go to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. What other action would a good foster father take than to look after his foster child? This is our responsibility. We have controlled Papua since 1906 and New Guinea since 1914 and it is not logical to suggest at this stage that we should look at other Asian nations and grant them aid when right at our doorstep we have more problems in developing the Territory of Papua and New Guinea than we have ever had since the beginning of our nation. Despite the troubles that I am certain lie ahead, our aims should be those that were expressed by Sir James Plimsoll in the United Nations Assembly in October 1961, when he saidOur objectives . . . are . . . self determination and a recognition of the right of the tion of taxes, looking at the situation in people to choose their own form of government and their own association. I hope that by good administration, with the support of all Australian people, self determination can be offered to the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in a very short time and that when they get their independence they will regard Australians as their friends and not as their enemies. am glad to follow the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart), who in the last few minutes of his speech devoted his attention to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. I do not propose to speak on this subject tonight; I shall do so when the estimates for the Territory are before us. However, I was very interested in his remarks. I think this is a problem that the Parliament has been rather inclined to sidestep and not to face directly. I do not agree entirely with the honourable member's comments, but I agree with him in general. It is heartening to find that at least some Opposition members have an interest in the future of the Territory. Though this will be my last speech on a budget, I do not propose to devote it to discussing the Territory. However, I believe it is tremendously important that we look clearly and coldlyI emphasise the word "" coldly ""-a t what the future of our relations with the Territory may be. This is, as it were, Sir, the moment before an election. The next general election is only a few months away. Perhaps this could best be described as a time that induces a sense of tenseness in every person in this House who is not retiring, as I am. When I look at this Budget, I am bound to say that I do not find it spectacular. However, on examination, I has presented to the Parliament a fairly sensible kind of Budget. It is not spectacular, because it does not provide for any spectacular increases in social services, though, most certainly, it does provide for some increases in benefit rates. This Budget is not spectacular, also, because it does not provide for reduced taxes. When the provision for defence is of the order provided for on this occasion, one cannot think of reducing taxes. It is probably true that the electors of Australia did not expect a reducthe light of the commitments of the Government, which means of the whole of the people of Australia. This country cannot have a commitment in Vietnam and in Malaysia, though our commitment there is reducing, and not pay for it. Our problem is to pay for the commitments that we must undertake as an insurance for our nation and its people. May I now deliver an aside, as it were, about my last Budget speech, Sir. I gather that last week one newspaper asserted that last Wednesday I spoke in this debate. The speech referred to was in fact made by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon). It was a very good speech but,",40,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
103,Mr Falkinder (Franklin) [5.24],I,43,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
104,Find That The New Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon),"regrettably for him, it was ascribed to me. I hasten to assure everybody that this is my first speech in the debate on the present Budget, and I add that it will be my last speech on a budget. I would hate to think that the honourable member for Corangamite believed that somehow I had done him out of his opportunity to speak in this debate. On 28th September, it will be exactly 20 years since I entered this Parliament. In the time. I have been here, a vast change has come over Australia and, indeed, over this Parliament. When I entered it in 1946, Australia was just emerging from the difficult conditions of war. For the first three or qualities have played an important part in four years after the war, Socialism was acceptable to the people. It appeared to Australians then to be guiding them out of regimented wartime conditions. Since 1949, there has been a dramatic change in the scene and this is now a free enterprise society. Free enterprise has dramatically built up the economy and standing of this country and made us a challenging and important nation. Indeed, we could justly describe ourselves as the most important nation in South East Asia. Before the 193945 war, Australia was little more than a minor nation. I believe that it is now an important nation that is regarded by the rest of the countries of South East Asia as mature. The fact that we have become mature as a nation is of great importance in our relations with South East Asia. We are almost the only European nation in this region. We live with this fact and we believe in our heritage. Before the war, we were little more than an incidental factor in this is that whilst there may be some good in part of the world, but now we are a highly important factor. We are, in the true sense of the term, an important and mature nation. This enhancement of our status has derived from the fact that since 1949 we have had a stable government. A stable government such as we have had engenders trust in other nations. Because of this trust sion on which I shall speak in this House based on stability, we have received a large inflow of capital from the United States of America, Britain and other countries. I say bluntly that were our Government characterised by the instability of the present Opposition, we would not have received that inflow of capital. In my mind, there is no question about the importance of this factor. A country so young as ours and having so small a population would not have won from other nations the trust on which we have built ourselves up had it not been for the stability of our Federal Government and the complete confidence that it has inspired in other nations. All this has not been done by the Government alone, Sir. The Federal Government, of itself, cannot work miracles. Australian industry has contributed greatly to what has been achieved. One of the great things about Australian industry is that it exhibits true Australian characteristics based on forthrightness and go ahead determination. These enabling us to achieve what we have attained. On visits to other countries, notably Britain, Canada and the United States, in the last year or so, I have been dismayed lo find them affected by a kind of lethargy. In Australia, however, to our great advantage, there is a tremendous capacity for go ahead thinking. Had we not exhibited this capacity, we would have been by now just an appendage of South East Asia. But, on the contrary, we are an important nation of this region. In it. there is expressed in many ways a great deal of confidence not only in our technical skills, which are important, and our go ahead determination, but also in the complete stability of our Government and our economy. I refer again to the fact that had we had Socialism over this period we might well have been in the doldrums because Socialism is in the discard. One thing that the Australian community has woken up to SocialismI would be the last one to deny it-it has a retarding influence on the progress of a country. It is a happy circumstance and a very good thing for Australia that we have remained to be a government which has its belief in private enterprise and the free will of the people. This being perhaps the last major occaI propose to say a few simple things that I believe and perhaps a few blunt words about the policy of the Government. FirstI believe that there is one thing on which my friends on the other side of the chamber will agree with me: We have never really attempted to tackle the problem of the abolition of the means test. I have been one of those who have believed that this is not only a possibility but also a practicability. From the first time that I came to this place in 1946 -ther e was then a Labour Governmentit was said that we could not abolish the means test because the cost would be too great. It has since been said by ourselves as a government, and said rather more recently by the Opposition, that the means test will gradually be abolished. But the fact is thaf although we have had a committee of the Parliament and committees on both sides of the House which have looked thoroughly at the proposition of the complete abolition of the means test, this has not come to pass. Nobody has ever really had the forthrightness and courage in the short term to get up in this Parliament and to say: "" I move that the means test be abolished "". I know that what I am saying is terribly simple, but the fact is that there never has been, from either side of the House, a direct attack on the problem of abolishing the means test. For that we-al l of us, on both sides-ar e at fault. We all know by reason of our own experience, and most of us from long experience, that many individuals in Australia incur great loss because of the means test, yet we refuse to face up to this problem. I am not dissociating the Government from this for one moment because it is one problem that we have never really attempted to tackle completely. There has always been the cry that abolition of the means test is going to cost too much. If the Government or honourable members opposite eventually have to face this problem, which I believe will have to be faced, the cost, if that is the question, will have become higher and higher. Therefore, the sooner this problem is tackled properly the better it will be. This is a kind of problem of which we are all very much aware, but words-eve n the words that I utter about this-ar e unimportant unless all of us, the Government and the Opposition, are quite determined to tackle it. In short, mere words mean nothing-no t a darn thing. In short, we have not been game really to tackle the problems of the means test. There have been many good things to the credit of the Government and, previous to that, to the credit of the previous government in alleviating certain aspects of the means test, but it is idle to take up little bits and pieces of a problem of this kind instead of tackling the principle of it. That leads me to my next point. In Australia we have a national health scheme which is working well and is to the great advantage of many people. The only disadvantage is that some people have not insured themselves under this scheme. However, there is one scheme which weI use the word collectively-hav e not attempted really to look at. I refer to a dental health scheme. It so happens that in many States most school children are given dental checks by school doctors or dentists and this helps, but the fact is that many people -fathers , mothers and children-d o not go to the dentist because they simply cannot afford it. I believe that this is a blot, if I may use that word, against the Government and against the Parliament. Although we have done very well for general health, we have not tackled dental health which has become a very expensive problem. I do not understand why this proposition should not be dealt with on the same 'lines as medical health and why we should not have, in exactly the same way, provision for dental health. I intend to turn now to another problem which has worried me over the years-in fact, for the 20 years that I have been a member of this Parliament. I was very interested to listen to the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) last night on his approach to what is wrong with the relationship between the Parliament and members of Parliament, or, to make it more precise, between the Executive and the Parliament. This is one of the things which I believe over the years has been, in a slow but sure and measured fashion, militating against the democracy of the Parliament, if one can call it that. This is not a novel process. It was not unknown when the previous Labour Government was in office, and it is by no means unique now. But the fact is that we have a Cabinet, a Ministry, the members of which now believe and have believed for some time that in some kind of sense there is a divine right not of kings but of Cabinets. True it is that we frequently have discussions in our party meetings on both sides on bills dealing with matters of concern to us, but the fact isI look around this chamber and see how empty it is, a condition for which I take full blame at the moment-that there are few of us who really take any part in deliberations concerning the country's business. 1 am not going to point ""the bone at the Opposition siae, because the position is very mucb thc same on this side. A bill may be presented to a party meeting and agreed to after some kind of discussion. I underline the word ""' some "". Then it comes into this Parliament and we allegedly have a debate on it. In my experience of this place, it is a very rare occasion when any alteration to a bill is made. I remember that in the three years from 1946 to 1949, when the present Opposition was on the Government side, only one amendment to a bill was made, and that was on a simple technical matter. 1 am afraid 1 have noi found any great difference in the situation in the 17 years in which 1 have been on the Government side, because it is rare indeed for any change to be made in a bill. This I'arliament is surely not made up of a lot of buffoons, of people who simply sit here and say Aye"" when they are required to say so and vote when they are required to do so. People in this Parliament are here for a purpose, and in my view the purpose is quite simply to form part of the legislative process of the Parliament. So long as we accept the proposition that we are here merely to elect certain people to be Ministers or to sit on ihe front bench on the Opposition side we are simply fools, because we are refusing to accept our own responsibilities. I am sorry if some honourable members believe 1 am trying to lecture them on this point. The fact is that this is something that has impressed me very deeply since .1 have been a member of this Parliament. It has appeared to me that we have gradually, slowly but surely, given away our rights as individuals to have an expression in what becomes law through this Parliament, through the combined individual votes of all members of this Parliament. When1 look around this place and see the individuals in it I sometimes wonder what they think. I know that on both sides of this Parliament there are people with individual minds who think deeply and are prepared to express themselves. But of course the simple trouble is that members sublimate their own opinions to the wishes of the Party, and this is not good for a Parliament. I believe the honourable member for Bradfield was right when he said that Parliament as such has lost its real touch and its ability to be a law-making forceand I do not use the word "" force "" in any coercive sense. AgainI look around and see some members here who, to be quite frank, could not care less about this matter; they are here for the numbers, and that is about all. I believe that this Parliament has a duty to perform, that it is not quite doing it and that it is time it did. port the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). Usually when I rise to speak I engage in some form of debate with the speaker who has just preceded me. but on this occasion I certainly do not intend to do so. I learn from the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) that this has probably been his last speech in this Parliament, after 20 years of service to it-and honourable service at that. I want to put on record that it was my privilege last year to travel with the honourable member to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Ottawa and subsequently to the West Indies. I learned to respect him as a colleague and as a good travelling companion representing our Parliament in other lands. I pay tribute to the service the honourable member has rendered this nation, both to his distinguished war service and to his application to parliamentary responsibilities during the last 20 years. I would like to tell the House of a little incident that occurred after we returned from overseas. I had a few fleeting moments of pride one day when I received a letter from Geneva addressed to "" Squadron Leader J. C. L. Sexton, D.S.O., D.F.C, M.P."". The sender of the letter had, of course, mixed up the Australian delegates in his mind and given me the titles and the distinction that rightly belonged to the honourable member for Franklin. I wish him good health and goodwill in the years that lie ahead. Before discussing the particular clauses of the amendment I wish to make a few general observations. The Budget was eagerly looked forward to by many thousands of Australian citizens because Budget provisions have such an important bearing on the economic and financial well-being of our nation. It was received in silence. The Press of Australia sought to",43,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
105,Mr Sexton (Adelaide) [5.51],"I supinject a little ginger into it with headlines saturation point, and we hear daily reports and sub-headlines, and as the effects of the Budget became clear there developed a mounting volume of criticism from all quarters. Even some of the Government's leading supporters openly criticised it while others damned it with faint praise. Some public figures, such as the Premiers of Vicour present Government. The history of toria and New South Wales, fiercely attacked the Budget. They rightly claimed that the Federal Government was running away from its responsibilities and passing the odium of increasing taxes to the State governments. While this is a political fact of life, a more important fact is that the expansionary nature of the Budget will inevitably be cancelled out by the deflationary measures of State governments which will be forced to obtain additional revenue from taxes in order to continue to maintain their existing growth and expansion programmes. No responsible body of people would agree that the States should cut down on their growth with all the attendant evils inherent in such a policy. Grave concern is justified when we note the indifference shown by the Treasurer to State Government claims for a greater share of taxation reimbursements in order that they may continue a progressive programme of development. The State Premiers were the first to realise the implications of faster than wages. There has been no the Budget, and their public hostility and criticisms are understandable. Within the next few weeks vve will learn of increased taxes imposed by State Budgets and, of course, this will expose the falsity of the expansionary claims of the Treasurer. One does not have to be a Rhodes scholar to realise it will be the same Australian taxpayers who pay these increased State taxes and, at the same time, button up their belts because of the new imposts they must bear. All this adds up to a cowardly approach in the Federal Budget, with the Treasurer trying to infuse a favorable climate in his domain when he presents a mildly inflationary Budget without increasing taxation. Another disturbing feature about the Budget is that it has not provided a much needed stimulus to commerce and industry. It is well known that many industrial firms have been stagnant during the past year, and we can see evidence of stockpiling of manufactured goods. Today many industries have reached of dismissals and retrenchments. These are gathering momentum and we can expect to see within the next few weeks dramatic announcements of a slowed down economy. The blame for this regrettable state of affairs rests squarely on the shoulders of 1961 shows signs of repeating itself. In 1961 thousands were thrown out of work through thefinancialpolicy of this Government. It may present itself in a different form on this occasion, but the end result will be the same. No doubt the constant rise in the prices of goods and services plays a prominent part in the present economic confusion. The people buy less consumer goods with their available resources. This, in turn, lessens the demand for manufactured and raw products. Only today we read of an alarming buyer resistance in respect of clearer leather footwear. Many employees in the industry have been retrenched and more dismissals are contemplated. I turn now to the clauses in the amendment. The first seeks to condemn the Government for its failure to protect the real value of wages by allowing prices to rise attempt by the Government even to discuss curbing price rises much less act on this important phase. The history of wage and salary rates is recognised. For years wages have been chasing prices. This has been described appropriately as akin to a dog chasing his tail round in a circle. This process will continue until such time as we get a government which has the courage to face up to the problem of price regulation. The last beneficial period of price control was during World War II when the cost of living was stabilised to a point where the only variation in the cost of living was Is. a week in a period of two years. The controls were exercised under wartime powers, certainly, but this is no excuse today for saying that vve have no power. If the case for regulation of prices were submitted to a referendum of the people and they had a full knowledge of its importance to our economy I am confident the people would approve. In the recent long drawn out application by the Australian Council of Trade Unions before the Arbitration Court evidence was presented to show that ordinary people do not get a fair share of the wealth that they produce. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. of the sitting I was pointing out that wages and salaries are always chasing price rises and the higher cost of services. I instanced how the Labour Government during the war years used its wartime powers to contain increases in prices and the cost of living for two years to the extent of ls. a week. After the war we had to return to our peacetime powers. Subsequent governments have claimed that they have no power to regulate prices. I continue my remarks by saying that the Australian Council of Trade Unions These are strong words coming from the decided, after careful deliberation, to apply RSL. Unfortunately, its criticism of this to the court for a substantial 'increase in Government is justified. the basic wage so that workers could share in some measure in the profits earned by their affluent employers.

Last week not sufficient. These amounts have long I received a letter from Brigadier T. since been eroded by rising prices and Eastick, President of the South Australian Branch of the Returned Services League, urging me to support the League's claims for increases in repatriation and social service benefits which he said had declined steadily since 1950. He was expressing the unanimous view of the Federal Executive of the League. In one part of the letter he saidIt is incredible to believe that the Government would allow such depreciation in pension values without making some genuine move to arrest the situation. . . . The South Australian State Branch solidly backs the appeal by our National Executive in Canberra this week for the Government to introduce a supplementary Budget to correct the injustices at present imposed on the ex-servi -e section of the community.

106,Mr Sexton,"Before the suspensionhigher costs for services. Pensioners know to their discomfort that the purchasing power of their pensions has deteriorated. In plain terms, despite a few increases the pensioners have gradually fallen behind in their standard of living. The Treasurer is using them up by this Budget. The increase of SI a week in the pension is supposed to stimulate the economy regardless of the effectiveness of the pension in enabling pensioners to live as ordinary citizens in our civilised community. Apparently the theme is: Stimulate the economy and do not bother about a comfortable contented life for the elderly section of our community. One could list the various categories of pensioner and point out deficiencies but experience has shown that our pleadings, together with the pleadings of pensioner organisations, fall on deaf ears. The housing conditions of pensioners in some areas are shocking. These people are exploited by greedy landlords who charge rents that eat substantially into their income with the result that they do not have enough left to buy the ordinary food and clothing necessary lo keep body and soul together. There is no outcry from the Parliament about these conditions, and the elderly suffer in silence and accept whatever charity may come their way. We now have an increased population of old people and new needs are developing. These should receive the attention of our social service authorities. Many social workers could give testimony and help in Ihis direction. There is also a great need for an extension Federal Government the need for more of the supplementary pension to cope with financial assistance from our national the varying problems of many pensioners, resources to expand our education including the rent problems of married as programme and facilities. well as single pensioners.

During the last seshome units for the elderly, in which they sional period, I sought assurances from the may live under hygienic conditions and Prime Minister that the needs of our Slate enjoy some of the comforts that have come to be considered the standard in this day and age. The question of concessions for pensioners is one that is constantly brought under the notice of honourable members, aud it is surprising to learn how some people fail to qualify for these concessions. This is true particularly of some widows rearing families when the eldest child commences to work. A pension entitlement for a wife when the breadwinner becomes a pensioner is another problem needing attention in our social services structure. These and many other social service problems will receive early and urgent attention when the electors vote our party into government. They will have an opportunity to do this on 26th November. The next point in our leader's proposed amendment is that the Government has failed to recognise the serious crisis in education. This subject is paramount in the thinking of our citizens. For some years now our education organisations have been united in their appeals to governments to face up to the challenge of our education needs. The inadequacies of our education system are appalling. The State Governments have strained their Budget expenditures, the proportion devoted to education now being approximately 25 per cent., in playing their part to cope with this crisis. They have joined in supporting education authorities and voluntary organisations in their endeavours to impress upon the An examination of the position discloses tertiary and university levels. This is good in itself, but assistance must filter down ance, too. for teacher training in order to education systems would be met. He evaded the issue then, and in the present Budget he realised, and today a hard line is developing. continues to evade the issue, although more money for this purpose is urgently needed. Obsolete and insufficient building impose further burdens at the education level. Because the structure of our society is changing due to technological development, our educational needs become more pressing. The old order is being replaced by an orcier in which technical knowledge is essential. With the development of automation, the old craft and process workers will be replaced by people with technical knowledge geared to meet the changing circumstances. The Budget holds out little but despair for those organisations which are striving to meet our educational needs. The next point of criticism of the Budget this undesirable situation? The people ceris that it does not acknowledge the lack of confidence on the part of the business community in the future growth of the economy. We surely could have expected the Government to learn from the lessons of the 1961 credit squeeze, when the financial policy it adopted destroyed all business confidence and near chaos developed in the economy. That period was a striking example of how Government policy can destroy confidence. Furthermore, it highlighted the important part that confidence plays in the commercial world. This can be understood when we know that most commercial enterprises are based on credit transactions which involve considerable overdraft bank finance. When confidence is destroyed in these circumstances, it follows that business chaos will programme of national development that be the end result. The Government appears to be completely indifferent about the matter. Only today I read in a newspaper an article in which the Minister for Air( Mr Howson) admonished business people and told them to get on with the job. I am sure the business people would like the Minister to explain to them how to get on with the job when there are not sufficient customers to purchase the goods on offer. Sales and turnover are basic to a buoyant commercial economy. Unless the producer can expand his trade, stagnation follows. For over a year now, many manufacturers have been hanging on. stockpiling their products in the hope that business will improve. After studying the Budget, they see no encouragement that their hopes will be Rumours of retrenchments and dismissals are gathering momentum. Already some reductions have been announced. It borders on the fantastic to read of 2,500 employees in one firm engaged in the motor industry in Sydney taking their Christmas holidays now. Unfortunately, this'is not the end of the story. We can expect further unpleasant announcements in the motor industry in the not too distant future. All this adds up to the destruction of that confidence which is so necessary in the everyday life of our trade and commerce. The Government must accept a large measure of blame for this situation. The question now posed before us is: How long will the public put up with tainly have it in their hands to alter things on the next election day-26t h November. The fifth point in the Opposition's proposed amendment is that the Government has failed to recognise the need for further basic development in the private and public sector, together with active encouragement of industry based on co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. There has been constant agitation for the planned national development of Australia for some years. This Government tries to defend its policy on national development, but we see precious little action in this field. Apart from approving the construction of a few beef roads in northern Australia, the Government cannot point to any spectacular would help in making our country safer against outside aggression. Admittedly the Government recognises the urgent need of increasing our population, but once migrants arrive here they are on their own so far as their future is concerned. How much better it would be if we could see migrants integrated into a long range plan of national development that would help our country to rise to greater heights. The sixth and final point of criticism ln our leader's proposed amendment is that the Government does nothing to relieve our dependence on a high rate of foreign investment to finance the deficit in our balance of payments. It is frightening to realise that, slowly but surely, the ownership of Australia is passing into foreign hands. This foreign ownership has an innuence on the conduct of the economy, and we can expect little consideration of Australia's national needs when pressures exert themselves in this sphere. Since foreign investors are concerned with profit motives only, our national aspirations must suffer. Today thousands of square miles of Australia are in foreign hands and most of our major manufacturing industries are foreign owned, or partly so. The Government has failed to provide that a stipulated Australian content shall be included in all foreign owned projects in Australia, and in that sense it is guilty of disloyalty to the cars could not buy the petrol to run them nation. I recall that the only interest that this Government has shown in curbing overseas investment was some years ago when an English company, which supported the Labour Party, sought to buy an Australian radio station. The Government acted promptly on that occasion to prevent the sale and purchase, but only, of course, for partly political reasons and not in the national interest. We now approach the end of the Budget debate. Some Ministers have already displayed in their Budget speeches a measure of arrogance. This leaves the impression that the Government is unmoved by the suggestions which have been made during this debate. The Opposition has played its part by highlighting the deficiencies of the Budget, and the people of Australia should study the excellent contribution made by the Leader of the Opposition in his penetrating analysis of the Budget. Falkinder) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. for Territories) [8.21] -The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Sexton) is, I believe, a sincere and honest member of the Australian Labour Party. He has expressed the sort of views one would expect from the Labour Party. them. Obviously he looks with a great deal of reverence on the war years, when we had war time controls over prices and wages. The honourable member would like to take us back to those years, when we had petrol rationing, when one could not even buy a shirt with a reasonably long tail, or build a decent house. All the controls, including price fixing, that operated then resulted in a shortage of essential goods. Manufacturers endeavoured to increase the production of only those items that were not subject to price control, and consequently there were desperate shortages. What is more important, Sir, is that the Labour Party, in office in those days, said that there was no chance of relief from those controls because we would not have the goods to supply. One could not buy a motor car, and those who had motor more than a few miles. Unfortunately the community has forgotten about this sort of thing because the economy has developed tremendously since then. you are giving to New Guinea. does not like to hear these things but I am going to continue to mention them. We are a very fortunate people. Right up to the end of the last war we enjoyed a great deal of security. Every night when we went to bed we knew that the British Navy was there to protect us. Today we are an outpost of western civilisation in the south west Pacific area. We have to stand on our own feet in a very difficult environment, with hundreds of millions of people to the north of us on a low standard south. We are a nation of just 12 million people-and it is thanks to the measures adopted by this Government that our population is as great as it is. We have to sustain ourselves in this environment. Obviously we need considerable industrial development to sustain a population of 12 mlilion people with a high standard of living. We need strong friendships in this situation, because a community of 12 million people with hundreds of millions to its north has no hope in the world without friends. The policies of this Government have given us the friends we need. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Sexton) said that one reason this Government should be thrown out at the next election was its neglect of the pensioners.",48,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

114,Mr Barnes,"That is accurate hi'story.Pensioners have never been better off than they are under this Government, and the improvement in their position has been made possible only by the tremendous expansion of our economy. I point out that the Welfare Fund provision in this Budget for the nation amounts to $757 million. It is only just exceeded by the whole of the estimated receipts from company taxation. That is an extraordinary sum to be voted to a welfare fund in a community which has a vast continent still to be developed. It is a tremendous slice out of the Budget, but nevertheless we are developing the continent, too. I remind honourable members that up to the end of the First World War Australia was a primary producing nation. We had no secondary industry. In 1920 we had a population of about 5 million, and the experts in those days estimated that possibly we would be able to approach the 10 million mark. We realised then that if we were to be a substantial nation v/e had to embark on a policy tory of the motor industry. If these people of industrialisation, and we set about to do that.

I think that since Federation the Labour Party has been in power for a period of only 15 or 16 years. very much doubt that figure. I would say 16 years, but I will concede the honourable member hisfigure.The present Government has been in office longer than that.

Speaker. I was carried away by the interjections. The honourable member for Adelaide comes from South Australia, where there is a considerable automotive manufacturing industry. He has said that employees have been dismissed from the motor industry. Unfortunately that is the case, but I point out to the honourable member that the motor industry has expanded tremendously over the years and is still expanding. One of the reasons for these dismissals is the cut throat competition in the motor industry. Despite the tremendous increase in turnover, profits are lower because competition is so keen. This is a factor with private enterprise. It always faces competition and the community benefits from cut throat competition. This has been the hiswrongly assess that the community will be able to absorb far more vehicles than in fact it can, that is a business judgment and I do not see why the Government should be asked to pick up the pieces and get the manufacturers out of their difficulties. What is happening in Australia is no different from what happens in the United States of America. between the two situations. This optimism exists in the motor industry. The honourable member for Bonython spoke of these matters. We must face facts. Each year we are absorbing increased quantities of motor vehicles produced in this country. If Labour's allegations about the state of the economy are true it is strange that we are attracting so much overseas investment. Overseas investors are not fools with millions to invest. They see great opportunities in Australia. The honourable member for Bonython referred to foreign interests investing money in the Northern Territory and northern Queensland, including Cape York Peninsula. We welcome these investments. As Minister for Territories I welcome these investors because they bring with them to this country know how and experience.

Should we tell overseas investors that they must not come to Australia and assist us lo develop the country? We have a high standard of living which the Government is determined to maintain. Not only must we maintain our economic growth but also vve must build our defence forces. One of the most remarkable features of the Budget is that we have increased defence expenditure by 34 per cent, over last year without increasing taxes, lt must be remembered also that we have been experiencing one ®f the worse droughts in our history. As well as providing increased finance for defence commitments we have provided assistance to people who have suffered from the drought.

If we are realists vve will admit that this is an extrabeen supported by the Australian Labour ordinary Budget. said. honourable member for Watson will speak next. down this Budget. To maintain our standard of living we must have a strong economy. We must also have a defence force adequate to defend us. But with our population of about 12 million people we could not defend ourselves against 100 million people to our north. In this respect we need a considerable number of friends. This is why it is important that we should be fighting alongside the Americans in Vietnam. port of the Americans will pay off. If we relied on the defence policies of the Australian Labour Party we would be in a difficult situation. able member some reasons. After the Second World War the Americans sought the permission of the Australian Government to retain a base on Manus Island. Any ex-serviceman who served in the New Guinea theatre will remember what happened. The Americans had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Manus Island. It was a massive base. But when they wanted to retain the base the Australian Labour Government would not allow them to do so. What would be the situation today if the Americans had been allowed to retain their base on Manus Island? The existence today on Manus Island of the tremendous base which the Americans proposed to establish there would have provided us with quite a degree of relief from attack. But, unfortunately, in those days Australia had a Labour government in power. Again, when the Americans approached Australia seeking permission to establish a base-onl y a communication base-a t North West Cape, the proposal was condemned by the Australian Labour Party. Any effort to build up Australia's defences has been opposed by these people. Any effort to assist our enemies in Asia has Party. Yesterday the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) spoke in (he debate. If we are to believe Press statements, he is in the running to be a leader of the Australian Labour Party. The best that could be said about his speech yesterday is that he gave comfort to our enemies. He said that we should not be involved in Vietnam; that we should withdraw our forces from Vietnam. AllI can say about his remarks is that if he is not for us, he is agin us, because he gave comfort to our enemies. We face, as I have said before, a serious situation. We have had to meet Communist aggression before in other parts of the. world than ours. The world's hot spot is no longer Europe. A few years ago the centre of aggressiveness was Berlin. We met the Communists there and stopped them by the massive air lift to keep West Berlin neutral and part of West Germany. The Communists made another attack in Malaya. Australia, New Zealand and Britain sent troops to Malaya. The Australian Labour Party opposed this effort to keep Malaya independent. We had to meet the Communist threat in Korea.

We must respect the opinions of Asian people in these matters. We must respect the people who are prepared to defend their country. Let me say something now about my home State of Queensland. 1 have devoted some time to the situation that existed in Australia under a Labour Government. Recently Sir Alan Westerman, Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry, addressed in Brisbane a meeting of the Export Development Council. He said that Queensland had fallen behind the other States in industrialisation. This is true: Queensland has fallen behind the other States. Queensland is still a primary producing State. I mention this as a warning to people who may listen to our Opposition friends. The present situation is extraordinary when you bear in mind that Queensland is the second largest State of the the wealthiest in natural resources. I point out to honourable members that in a period of 42 years Queensland was governed for 39 years by Labour, which introduced Socialist policies. The people who governed Queensland then were completely brash. They were thoroughly sincere but were indoctrinated in Socialism. When they took over in 1915, they believed that this was an opportunity to take over the whole State. They had State stations, State sawmills, State hotels, State coal mines, even State butcher shops and all the rest of it. They even combined v/ith the British Government on a Peak Downs enterprise and it was just as unsuccessful as all the others were. Mr J. R. Fraser -The people of land have now realised their error and have returned the present Government for nine years without the loss of a single member. The people of Queensland .now realise how they suffered. Queensland has not yet recovered from the situation that was created by Labour, despite the efforts of the Nicklin Government. The honourable member for Adelaide, who preceded me in this debate, outlined Socialist policies. The Labour Government of Queensland followed these policies and discouraged large companies from establishing themselves in that State. The Labour Government did not want investment to come to Queensland from the south and imposed absolutely prohibitive taxes on industries that tried to establish themselves. I will read out the State tax scale at a time when the States had the power to impose these taxes. I will do this for the record, because it is important. We do not want to gloss over these facts, because if we do people may be misled. I will give the company tax in Queensland when Labour was in office. was 21d. plus 20 per cent, supertax. In addition, the tax was 3d. for each additional 1 per cent, of profit over 6 per cent, until it reached 19 per cent., after which the rate was 63d. in the £1. This was the State tax; the Commonwealth tax was an additional impost.

However, he did not tell the House that Queensland spends less per capita on education than is spent in any other State in the Commonwealth. He does not know what he is talking about when he alleges that bad Socialist Labour governments have allowed standards to decline. I suggest that he have a cup of tea with Senator Gair, who was Premier of Queensland for some years, and tell him that. I doubt whether the Minister would shout the senator a cup of tea. However, they would doubtless have margarine on their sandwiches. I now turn to the Budget, which the Minister did not find time to touch on during his half hour speech. Prior to the presentation of this Budget, newspaper editorials and leading spokesmen in business, unanimously claimed that the economy urgently needed stimulating if steady growth was to be maintained. However, this Budget, we find, is uninspiring and completely negative. It certainly does not instil confidence in Australia's future. In addition, it displays a callous disregard of the real needs of social service beneficiaries, as evidenced by the niggardly increase of only $1 a week for single pensioners and 75c a week for pensioner married couples. The purchasing power of child endowment is not commensurate with that of 1949 and the rates of maternity allowance have remained unaltered, despite Sir Robert Menzies' solemn undertaking to the people of Australia that he would maintain the full value of social service benefits when his Government assumed office in 1949. Let us examine some social service benefits. I shall deal first with age and invalid pensions. To illustrate how paltry the increase proposed in this Budget is, I read an extract from the editorial published in the Sydney ""Daily Telegraph"" on 17th August last. It is in these terms. . . on one important welfare issue, the needs of pensioners, the Government has been niggardly-J l is simply not enough. The Government has also been most unfair and unrealistic in putting the rate for married pensioners another SO cents behind that for two single pensioners, thus aggravating an already inequitable position. I may add that this newspaper is recognised as the principal mouthpiece of the Liberal Country Party coalition. It is noted for its prejudice and bias against the Australian Labour Party. Nevertheless, one cannot deny that in this instance it is right, l f any Minister or Government supporter wishes to refute that statement in the editorial, let him rise in his place and attempt to do so. 1 issue that challenge believing that it will not be accepted. It is beyond my comprehension how the majority of pensioners exist with the present exorbitant living costs resulting from the high prices of essential, every day commodities. Pensioners certainly cannot live in comfort or enjoy even a reasonable standard of living. I now turn to the permissible income of $7 a week for a single pensioner and $14 a week for a pensioner married couple. The limits were last adjusted in 1954 when the pension was $7 a week for each penindustry and commerce sioner. Despite the higher pension rate of today, the permissible income remains stationary. This reacts unfavorably, unfairly and unjustly against superannuitants who before retiring were wage or salary earners. I have noted with a great deal of interest that in this debate several Government backbenchers have advocated the complete abolition of the means test. We realise what arrant humbug their advocacy is when we recall that these same members support a government that for 12 years has refused point blank to liberalise the means test applicable to permissible income. Probably, these same Government supporters would give to their local newspapers for publication, especially just prior to an election, extracts from the "" Hansard"" reports of speeches in which they have made themselves out to be martyrs in the cause of people on fixed incomes. issue? cite a case that was brought to my notice a few years ago when the pension was $10 a week. The person in question received the equivalent of $9 a week in superannuation as a former employee of the New South Wales Government. He received also an age pension which was limited to $8 a week because at the time the maximum allowable income was $17 a week.

The same percentThat comparison amply and forcibly illustrates the manner in which mothers wage or salary bracket find it economically impossible to raise an average size family, Holt refuses to accept the responsibility then the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Calwell, certainly will. NowI shall touch on the maternity allowance which is more popularly known as the baby bonus. In monetary terms this benefit has remained unaltered since the Menzies Government took office in 1949, despite the fact that the average basic wage has increased by 148 per cent, in this period of 17 years. In assessing the real value of the maternity allowance, let us examine this fact. Recently the Bolte Liberal Government in Victoria applied new hospital charges. The charge for public wards was increased by $14 to $70 per week; in intermediate wards the increase was $21, which took the charge to $94.50; the charge for semi-private wards increased by $24.50 to a minimum of $105; and private ward charges increased by $28 to a minimum of $126 per week. In addition, Liberal Premier Askin in New South Wales has announced that his forthcoming budget will contain provision for increased hospital charges. Finally on the subject of social services I shall touch on the pensioner funeral benefit. This scheme was introduced by the Curtin Government and became operative on 1st July 1943, the amount then payable being $20. The average basic wage at that time was $9.50. The only alteration to this benefit since 1943 occurred in the 1965 Budget when the amount was increased to $40. This benefit applies only in the case of a spouse receiving it upon the death of the other partner in marriage; it does not apply to the person who has paid or is liable to pay for the burial cost of a single or widowed pensioner. This is a scandalous injustice, particularly when $20 is not enough to purchase even the cheapest of coffins anywhere in Australia. I propose now to refer to inflation which is prevalent in Australia today. This brings to mind those famous vote catching words uttered in 1949 by Sir Robert Menzies: "" I'll put value back into the pound."" There was so little left of the pound when Sir Robert retired that the Government changed over to decimal currency. Now it is making quite a start on that currency. Inflation is like a thief in the night: It robs stable. the value of one's money in a bank, the value of one's life assurance policy, the value of one's wage or salary. It makes one pay ever increasing local government rates, ever increasing water and sewerage rates, ever increasing transport charges to and from work, ever increasing costs to build a home and ever increasing costs for essential foodstuffs and clothing. And, of paramount importance, it makes it much more difficult to sell our primary products and manufactured goods in highly competitive world markets. It is interesting to note that the inflationary spiral commenced shortly after the defeat of the referendum in 1948 when Mr Chifley sought Commonwealth power to control prices and charges. Mr Chifley stated then that if the referendum failed it would be a case of the dog chasing its tail. In other words, there would be the never ending process of wages chasing prices. Every word of that prediction has come true. That cannot be denied. Sir Robert Menzies, who was then Leader of the Opposition, and his Liberal and Country Party colleagues strongly opposed the referendum. Sir Robert said that the States could effectively control prices. He went on further to say that private enterprise and healthy competition would keep prices stable. That was a beauty! Did honourable members ever hear anything like that? The only competition that I know of in Sydney at the present time is to be the semi-final football match between Balmain and St. George to be held next Saturday in Sydney. Despite the rising prices over the years, that much maligned group of people whom we know as bookmakers are the only ones who have not increased their prices since this Government came into power. Now let us analyse the way in which wages have been chasing prices. Tn May 1948 the average basic wage in Australia was $10.90. By November 1951 it had increased to $20, and by August 1953 to $23.60. This was when the quarterly adjustments were abolished. By June 1956 the average basic wage had reached $24.60. In June 1959 it was $27.60. Bv July 1961 it had increased to $28.80. It was $30.80 in 1964 and it now stands at $32.80. These facts knock sky high the assertion of Sir Robert Menzies that private enterprise and healthy competition would keep prices This unhappy inflationary trend poses the question: Where is it ail going to finish? I believe that question is unanswerable. In five years' time the basic wage could be $40 or more a week, with prices much higher in proportion. If this is the caseand it cannot be denied that this is likely to happen-the n we must ask another question: What can we do about it? To this second question there is a ready answer. We can hold another referendum seeking Commonwealth power to control prices and charges. I am sure that such a proposal would receive overwhelming support because the people are sick and tired of inflation and they certainly would not make the same mistake they made in 1948. I find it difficult to understand why the Country Party does not advocate Commonwealth price control, because the primary producers are seriously affected by inflation. However, to suggest that the members of the Country Party should support Commonwealth price control would be asking too much of them. They believe in supporting wealthy monopolistic combines, just as the Liberal Party does, and certainly if Commonwealth price control were introduced, as it would be if the Labour Party had the power to do so, it would restrict the power of the monopolistic combines. The members of the Country Party are not allowed to voice an opinion in favour of price control because if they did they would not get any money for their funds at election time. I shall devote the remainder of my time to some remarks about conscription for overseas service. The conscription of our 20 year old youths for overseas military service is indeed the most important and controversial issue that has confronted the Australian people for many a decade, particularly when we consider that no declaration of war has been made by the Government. The Federal Labour Opposition has constantly pressed the Government to hold a referendum on this issue, because we believe that the people of Australia should and must be given the democratic right to vote and express an opinion on such a vitally important and contentious matter. The Labour Party would most strongly advocate a "" No "" vote, but if the referenwere and are compelling, unable to join my two dum proposal were accepted by the people we would accept the verdict without question. It is interesting to note that the present Prime Minister, in an endeavour to find an excuse to justify the unwarranted action of his Government, says that the Curtin Labour Government introduced conscription in 1943. That is perfectly true, but what the Prime Minister omitted to mention was that in 1943 Australia was in a declared state of war, fighting for its very survival, with the Japanese hammering away at our front doorstep. Yet despite the desperate situation in which we were then placed, no conscripted personnel were required to serve north of the Equator. In other words, John Curtin, Australia's great wartime Labour Prime Minister, was concerned with the defence of Australia and its Territories. Now let me say a few words about our former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, Knight of the Thistle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, whose main duty is to gather any dead whales that may float in with the tide on the English beaches. This gentleman was responsible for introducing the legislation making provision for conscripted servicemen to serve anywhere in the world. Incidentally, Sir Robert was strongly criticised in the Commonwealth Parliament by the late Sir Earle Page because of his failure to volunteer in World War T. I shall read an extract from "" Hansard"" of 20th April 1939. This is what Sir Earle Page had to sayI come now to the third incident: Some 24 years ago the right honourable member for Kooyong That was the gentleman who later became Sir Robert Menzieswas a member of the Australian Military Forces and held the King's Commission. In 1915, after having been in the military forces for some years, he resigned his commission and did not go overseas. In fairness I think 1 should read Sir Robert's reply. He saidI was in exactly tbe same position as any other person who at that time had to answer the extremely important questions-I s it my duty to go to the war, or is it my duty not to go? The answers to those questions cannot be made on the pubhc platform. Those questions relate to a man's intimate, personal and family affairs, and, in consequence, I , facing those problems, problems of intense difficulty, found myself, for reasons which brothers in the infantry of the Australian Imperial Force. I personally offer no criticism of Sir Robert Menzies because of this refusal to go. the Opposition? jumping the gun again. 1 say thai 1 do not offer any personal criticism. I am merely quoting what was said about Sir Robert Menzies by Sir Earle Page at that time. When Sir Robert Menzies refused to enlist it was after he had been given the opportunity of saying "" Yes"" or "" No "", and it was at a time when we were in a declared state of war. But at a time when, we are not in a declared state of war wp find Sir Robert Menzies denies the people of Australia the right to vote at a referendum and say whether their boys should go overseas. boys themselves. Australia the opportunity that he had during the First World War. There were two referendums held on conscription during the First World War, one on 28;h October 1916 and the other on 20th December 1917, and in both cases the referendum proposals were defeated. Sir Robert Menzies was born on 21st December 1895. He did not have a vote in the first referendum but he did n the second, and although I have not backed a winner since Lord Fury won the Melbourne CupI am willing to bet that he voted "" No"" in the second referendum. This is the kind of thing we have to put up wi:h from a man who had the opportunity of saying "" Yes"" or "" No"" when he had to make a decision for himself, but who denies a similar opportunity to the people of Australia today. say this when he was here. under the skins of honourable members opposite. We find this Government telling us from time to time-no t so much in this House as through other public channelsthat Red China is our enemy. I have one of the Government's pamphlets here. If Red China is our enemy then this Government, the Prime Minister and every member of the Government are guilty of an act of treason, because one does not trade with an enemy. At the present time we are selling wheat and wool to Red China, wheat to feed its army and wool to clothe its army. We are selling metals to Red China which could be used against us in the future. Yet these hypocrites on the other side talk about Red China being our enemy, although they are selling them wheat on the time payment basis, and they are selling it on better terms than they sell it to one of our fellow members of the Commonwealth, India. Yet these people opposite are the ones that get up at election time and in their usual hypocritical manner talk about the Labour Party being pro-Communist. How ridiculous it is, and what a lot of humbugs these people are in regard to this matter. Let me make a final remark. Marshal Ky has said-and also Lieutenant-Colonel Precce who has returned to Australia after being in charge of the first Australian force that went to Vietnam-that this war could go on for many long years. Marshal Ky has said that it could go on for more than 20 years. If that is the case there are many boys going to school today, and who are in their teens, who could eventually be fighting in Vietnam. There are many young boys sitting in the gallery here tonight wbo could eventually be fighting in Vietnam, and who will be fighting there unless there is a ; change of government, as everyone with any common sense hopes there will be at the end of this year. General) [9.20] 1 have listened with considerable interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Watson( Mr Cope) about the Budget. I was interested during the last seven or eight minutes in his reference to what he terms conscription and his remarks about a re.erendum. I assure him that the Government will give him the opportunity and the people of Australia the opportunity to vote on 26th November. I think everybody on this side of the House knows what the result will be. I hope that he will be true to his word and will accept the people's verdict. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) spearheaded the attack on the Budget. I think all members of the Opposition who have spoken have criticised some aspects of the Budget. I think the public would be particularly concerned with their references to insufficient spending in many areas and with the indication that the Australian Labour Party will increase expenditure in",57,Speaker Mr Of Living Casting Envious Eyes At Us In The

168,Mr Hulme (Petrie,"Postmasterthose areas. They are too numerous for one to remember them all, but I have been through the "" Hansard"" reports and I shall give a list for the record. According to Labour spokesmen there will be an increase in all pensions. The means test will be abolished. There will be increases in child endowment, maternity allowance, education grants, superannuation, housing grants, external aid and grants to the States. There will be grants to the States in relation to teachers' salaries. One member of the Opposition made the unique suggestion that there will be a subsidy for small businesses of $200 million to $300 million a year to take care of basic wage increases, perhaps in the hope that increases in prices will be avoided. There was one other commitment made in speeches of members of the Opposition, namely that there will be an increase of $2 a week in pensions. However, not one member of the Opposition gave the slightest indication of what would be the cost of the increase in each of the items I have mentioned-n o indication of the estimated cost in to to. Therefore it is left to members of the public and to members on this side of the House to make some estimate-mor e than a guess; a real estimate-and then to look at where funds might be raised to provide for these benefits. The estimate that I have carefully made is that these increased benefits would require an increased expenditure of $800 million per annum by the Commonwealth. Most honourable members realise that we think we must accept that there will not be get our revenue from two main sourcesfrom loan moneys and from taxation. Of tion says there will be an additional expencourse, there is a third method of getting diture of $800 million. money to which the Opposition has referred from time to time, namely the inflationary method of issuing treasury bills. I think the would be expected to provide the additional speech made it quite clear that this year it taxation to be received this year from pay was estimated that we would not receive as you earn taxation and from taxation on more than about $150 million from loan private Individuals and companies will be money. It may be that this will increase a $2,664 million. I point out that 1 per cent, little, it may be that it will be a little less of that is $26.6 million and 10 per cent, but at least it would be an infinitesimal is $266 million. From indirect taxationpart of an additional expenditure of $800 that is, customs, excise, sales tax, pay roll million. So to get that $800 million it tax, estate duty and gift duty-the total to would be necessary to increase taxes or issue be received is $1,737 million. One per cent, treasury bills. As to increasing taxation, let of this is $17 million and 10 per cent, is us be sure that we understand completely about $174 million. If we take these two what the situation is in relation to Budget sources together we find that a 10 per cent, expenditure. The total expenditure, if we exclude business undertakings-and they, of course, provide revenue which is an offset to the expenditure on them-is no less than $5,567 million. Of that, $1,000 million is for defence, and this represents 18 per cent, of the total. An amount of $1,861 million, or 33.4 per cent., will go to the States for revenue grants and for works and housing. The National Welfare Fund will account for $1,020 million or 18.3 per cent.; repatriation for $249 million or 4.5 per cent.; and Commonwealth capital works for $471 million or 8.5 per cent. Then there are items such as debt charges; special expendituresthese include wheat stabilisation schemes and subsidies to primary industries and so forth; amounts for the Territories, and War Service Land Settlement expenditure. These tota] $629 million or 11.3 per cent, of the total. This accounts for 94 per cent, of the total expenditure. If the Opposition proposes to find any part of an additional $800 million from the present Budget then I put to it the simple question: What section of the Budget will be reduced? Does the Opposition propose to reduce the amount provided for defence? Does it propose to reduce the amounts provided for the States? The answer must be "" No "", because honourable members opposite have requested increased amounts in these categories. Does the Opposition propose that there should be a reduction in Commonwealth works expenditure or in repatriation benefits? I notice that there is a complete silence, so I a reduction in those areas; but the OpposiI think we can take it that taxation increase in all direct and indirect taxation",61,Speaker Mr Of Living Casting Envious Eyes At Us In The
169,Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) In His Budget $800 Million Of Revenue. The Total Direct,"would produce $440 million. To get $800 million it would be necessary to double that percentage. I am pleased to inform the Australian public that this is the plan that the Labour Party has if it wins the next election. There will be an increase of not less than 20 per cent, in all taxation. Perhaps it would be split up in some way so that there would be higher taxation in one area and lower taxation in another. It was only a year or two ago that the Leader of the Opposition said that when a Labour Government increased taxation it would increase it on incomes in excess of £3,000 a year. The latest figures that I have are the figures that were distributed with the Budget papers, and they deal with the income year ended 30th June 1964. It is interesting to look at the situation concerning incomes over $6,000 or £3,000 per annum. The number of taxpayers in this category was 177,000 or 4 per cent, only of the total taxpayers of Australia. Their total income was $1,460 million and their total deductions amounted to $232 million, which gave a net income of $1,228 million or an average income of $6,940 for each of those taxpayers. The tax payable in 1964 was $437 miUion. I remind honourable members that there has been an increase in taxation of 2 i per cent, in each of the last two years. An additional $800 million added to this total of $437 million would give a total taxation of $1,237 million from this section of the community. This happens to be $9 million more than they actually earned. Is this the proposal the Labour Party is putting to the Australian people in relation to taxation? Of course it could not be. Let us go down a little further in the scale Queensland enjoyed virtually a bonanza. and consider those who have an income of only £2,000 or $4,000 a year. This is not, I suggest, a tremendously high salary. There are 500,000 taxpayers in this group or 11 per cent, of the total number of taxpayers. That leaves 89 per cent, of the taxpaying public not accounted for in this area. Their net income would be $2,085 million and their tax $831 million. Add to this tax the $800 million additional which tlie Labour Party would want and we have a total taxation revenue of $1,600 million. This would leave 500,000 taxpayers a total of $485 million or an average of $970 or £485 each per annum with which to maintain themselves, F.9056/66 -R -[24 ] their families and their homes. Is this the proposal the Labour Party is putting before the people in this Budget debate? Is this part of the programme the Labour Party intends to put before the electors in the campaign prior to the election on 26th November? So far 1 have said nothing about development alihough we bave heard a good deal from the Opposition about development generally and development of the north in particular. My honourable colleague, the Minister for Territories ( Mr Barnes), referred a short time ago to the period when Labour was in oflice in Queensland. As a Queenslander, 1 am entitled to refer to the record of the Labour Government, which was in office in Queensland for so many years, in the field of northern development. 1 believe that Labour Government made not one worthwhile gesture in all thc time it was in office in that State. Eventually it got around to building the Burdekin bridge. This took eight years in the planning and building, and 1 think it is fair to say that it was nothing more than an electoral gesture. Of course the honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson) would desire to bury completely the history of Labour in Queensland. Because of a new found interest following a job he obtained in the Department of National Development, he believes all sorts of things should be done in Queensland. Let us have a look at only two aspects of the activities of the Queensland Labour Government. During the war there was a substantial influx of people into Queensland, particularly American troops because Queensland was very close to the Coral Sea and the theatre of war. The State railways were working to the maximum and there were tremendous surpluses of money. These were put into trust funds. Unfortunately, when a State comes to the Australian Loan Council for funds the amount to which it is entitled is related to the average it received in the five previous years. While Queensland was enjoying the bonanza the Labour Government said to the Commonwealth: "" We do not want from the Loan Council the maximum funds to which we are entitled. We will use money from our trust funds"". When these funds were exhausted and Queensland approached the Loan Council for money it was told that the amounts it had used in the five previous years had been so small that its entitlement for the following five years would be considerably below what it otherwise would have been. Because of the actions of the Labour Government. Queensland has suffered in this respect until the present time. Jt was only last year that the Commonwealth Government was able to devise some scheme to ease the situation by granting an additional £1 million in the first year, £2 million in the second year, £3 million in the third year, £4 million in the fourth year and £5 million in the fifth year of the Agreement. All honourable menibers know the size of Queensland. Despite that size the State today receives less loan funds per head of population than does South Australia which has a very much smaller area from a development point of view. Then, as was mentioned by the Minister for Territories, the same Queensland Labour Government had a taxation policy which discouraged secondary industry establishing itself in Queensland. In fact, not only the Labour Government's taxation policy discouraged secondary industry. Mr Forgan Smith, the Premier, said on one occasion that Queensland should not be a secondary industry State; it should remain a primary producing State. The Minister for Territories mentioned company tax. In Queensland companies paid the maximum 5s. 3d. in the £1 plus 20 per cent, super tax, whereas in Souih Australia the rate of tax is 2s. in the £1. Commonwealth company tax is also 2s. in the £1. How could anyone expect secondary industries in Queensland to develop as they have developed in the other States? Is it any wonder that Queensland was backward until 1957 when the present State Government came into office? I have mentioned how the State suffered under Labour. Now let me refer to what has happened in Queensland as a result of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the present State Government. I could mention a formidable list of objectives which have been achieved in Queensland and in the north of Australia in the last few years. First, there is the Mount Isa railsidering what was done in the 30 or 40 way. I think it is almost impossible for honourable members to appreciate the tremendous additional production which has come out of Mount Isa following construction of the railway. Then there is the development of the brigalow lands. Sections1 and 2 of the project are almost completed and an agreement has been entered into by the Commonwealth to finance the third section. We must remember the tremendous steps which have been taken in the movement of beef cattle following construction of the beef roads, not only in Queensland but in the Northern Territory and Western Australia as well. The development of Gladstone has also resulted from co-operation between the two Governments. When Queensland was unable to provide funds for the construction of wharf facilities at Gladstone for the shipment of Moura coal to Japan, this Commonwealth Government made the funds available to the Gladstone Harbour Board. Then there is the development which is taking place in the production of alumina, first of all at Weipa in the Gulf, and secondly, in the construction of a huge alumina plant at Gladstone. This Government contributed quite substantially to the cost of constructing the Weipa wharf from which bauxite is shipped to Gladstone. Funds provided by the Commonwealth have built the Derby and Broome jetties. They have also played a substantial part in the construction of the Exmouth township in Western Australia. What has been done with the Ord River has been done with funds provided for Western Australia by the Commonwealth. In the field of civil aviation I need mention only the airport extensions at Derby in Western Australia and Cairns in Queensland. What has happened in the extension of communications? Only a few weeks ago a microwave link between Brisbane and Cairns was opened. This enables people in the northern cities of Cairns and Townsville to have subscriber trunk dialling to Brisbane and through Brisbane to other States. Then there is the extension of health services and expenditure on defence projects in Townsville, particularly, and at Shoalhaven Bay. These things, I suggest, represent a real contribution to the development of the north, but they are forgotten by the Labour Party. It should think of them when conyears of Labour rule in that State, when, at times, we also had a Labour Government in Canberra. The next matter to which I refer is research by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. I believe that the beef and pastoral industries, willing to come to Australia. In addition particularly those sections in the coastal parts of Queensland, will receive tremendous benefit from the research undertaken by the CSIRO. in, for instance, the development of tropical legumes and of grasses for those areas. Those who really know the coastal sections of Queensland will always be ready to applaud this remarkable organisation for the work which it has done. Those are only some of the things which have been done by this Government to assist northern development. While those that I am about to mention are not applicable solely to Queensland, they nevertheless have a percentage application. I refer to such things as wheat stabilisation, our contribution to wool promotion, the payment of subsidies on fertilisers, the petrol prices plan under which people in the country are able to buy petrol at no more than 4d. a gallon above capital city prices, subsidies generally for primary industry, and the oil search subsidy. I suggest that it would not have been possible to find in Australia the money which has been used in the search for oil in this country. I do not say that we should be satisfied with what has been done; what I do say is that what has been done is an achievement with which the people of this country, and the people of northern Australia in particular, are delighted. The members of the Labour Party, of course, continue with their catchcries of "" A population of one million in the north in ten years"" and li Use the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority"". However, they have not any concrete proposals to put before us. They have no real estimates of the cost or of what might be involved in producing the results about which they speak. We could do more if we had two things. a higher income bracket: "" When you get The first of these is manpower. Let me on higher income we will take more and remind the House that the number regismore away from you for the purposes of tered for employment at present represents government"". 1 do not believe it is the only 1.2 per cent, of our total work force. privilege of government to take away from Therefore, is there a work force available the public as much as it possibly can. I at present to undertake substantial addibelieve that we should make money from tional work in this northern area, or indeed, the public for the essential services which in any other part of Australia? We have only governments can provide, but we pursued a migration programme which has should leave with the public the maximum been almost as big as it possibly could be. We are taking virtually all the people from the old country and from Europe who are to manpower, of course, we must have money. I was interested when, only a few weeks ago, it was announced that American interests were going into the Cape York Peninsula area to take up substantial leases and there was a tremendous outburst of objection from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). He objected to foreign capital coming in. He said that these people were buying up the lands of Australia. Let me point out that they have only a 30 year lease of this area and that some of the land has to be surrendered at the end of 15 years. All that they will be entitled to at the end of 30 years is one living area. The rest of the leased land then will come back to the Crown for use by Australians or other people to whom it might be allotted. If we all adopt the attitude adopted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-that we are not to have capital from overseasI believe it will be impossible to do anything really worthwhile in northern development, having regard to the other matters to which 1 referred earlier. We need more capital. We can get thnt capital only from outside Australia. It is impossible for us, with a territory which is as large as the United States of America and with a population of only 11 million people, to generate the capital which will do all the things which need to be done in this country. 1 wish I could get over to members of this House and to the public of Australia the message that we cannot afford to do these things on our own unless we increase taxation, unless we say to those people who should be thrifty within the community, those who should be undertaking higher education and those who should be endeavouring to get into amount possible so that they themselves can exercise their own judgment on their investment and spending. We know-the history of Australia shows this quite clearly -that these people will in fact generate as much capital for reinvestment in Australia as they reasonably can do, but this still will not be sufficient and I believe it is necessary for us to have capital from overseas. I hope that I have said something about the Budget tonight, because I believe that in a Budget debate we should deal with the Budget, not with a lot of extraneous items. 1 conclude by merely repeating that our analysis at the conclusion of the debate must disclose that the demands which the Labour Party will make on the Australian people will require an additional §800 million of their income. This will necessitate an overall increase of at least 20 per cent in taxation, whether it is direct or indirect. I say to the Australian people: "" Be careful lest you fall into a trap if you lost his income. Let me remind the honorare inclined to accept the Labour Party and its proposals when you go to the eleciion which will be held in only a few weeks time "". Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) [9.48] fhe Minister for Territories ( Mr Barnes), who spoke earlier in the debate, paid a very fine tribute to the Australian Labour Party. 1 do not think that the honourable gentleman meant to pay a tribute to the Australian Labour Party. I do not think he meant what he said as a tribute to the Party. But he did make a great point of the fact that, in the 65 years of federation, the Australian Labour Party has been in office federally for only approximately I 6 i years. It is, therefore, amazing to look back over the record of achievements of Australian Labour Party Governments in so few years of the life of Federation. It is worthwhile recalling that Labour Governments wrote practically the whole of our social services legislation. The Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Freeth) laughs. This is the first time. I have heard him laugh in this debate. WhatI have said is completely true. I ask him to look through the book which his own Government has published and see which government introduced all the major items of social services. The maternity allowance was introduced by the Fisher Government over the opposition of the anti-Labour parties. What was the basis of the opposition of those parties? They said that it was immoral, that it was shocking, that it would encourage baby farming, that women would have babies simply to collect the baby bonus. That was the type of opposition put forward by the anti-Labour parties. The invalid pension was introduced by a Labour Government. Even in rhe years when this country was struggling vigorously in the prosecution of the war, the Curtin and Chifley Labour Governments saw the need to make provision for the better years that would come after the war, and they introduced widows' pensions for the first time ever jn the Federal sphere. Whoever before had cared how a widow supported herself and her family? Again, Labour Governments introduced unemployment and sickness benefits to give aid to the man who, through either sickness or unemployment, able member who is interjecting that for almost a quarter of a century before Australia's entry into the war in 1939 this country had been governed by anti-Labour governments under various names. They were Nationalists, then they were the United Australia Party, and now they are the Liberals. They had been in power for practically the whole of 25 years, and there were always men in this community who could not get a job under these anti-Labour governments. There were always men waiting outside the factory gates for employment. Mr Kevin Cairns -The record of the Labour Party in this was pretty poor, you know. Mr J. R. FRASER -Just a moment and I will tell the honourable member something. Some of the young men who enlisted in this country in 1939 got their first regular job by enlisting to fight for a country which up to that time had not been able to provide them with employment. That is something of the record of the type of government of which the honourable member is a supporter. It was during the war years that John Curtin, as Prime Minister, and Ben Chifley, as his lieutenant, determined that these things would never be again, and for the first time in the history of this country a Federal government adopted full employment as a national policy and took the steps to implement it. At the same time it made provision for the men who. either through sickness or some other cause, lost their income through becoming unemployed. It provided unemployment and sickness benefits. Mr J. R. FRASER -It got thrown out. But let us look back. We are accused of being unconcerned about the defence of this couniry. Mr J. R. FRASER -Al l right. Hear,:! hear"", says the Minister for Shipping and Transport. We are accused of being unconcerned about the defence of this country. Who was it that established the Royal Australian Navy? A Labour government. The Royal Australian Navy was established in spite of the opposition of the anti-Labour Party, whose members said that was treachery. They said we were giving away the Mother country. They said: "" Great Britain will defend us. The British Navy will look after us. We have no need of a navy "". It was the Labour Party in government that determined that we should have a navy of our own and which established the Royal Australian Navy, which now has a proud record through two world wars, It was an Australian Labour Party government that established the Royal Military College at Duntroon. l t was an Australian Labour Party government that established the Commonwealth Bank and that gave Australia its own note issue, thus establishing an Australian currency. Honourable members opposite talk about Labour governments being in power for only 16± years altogether. Look at the record of achievement of those governments for the advancement and development of Australia. We have heard about a Liberal government building a bridge over the Burdekin River and building a pier at Derby. A Labour government built the Trans-Australia railway and established Trans-Australia Airlines. Are these major achievements or minor achievements? A Labour government established the Australian National Shipping Line which this Government would like to sell if it dared to, just as it would sell T.A.A. if it could. ment started the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme. Mr J. R. FRASER -Yes, a Labour government started the Snowy Mountains scheme, and when the official ceremony to open that great scheme was taking place, what happened? A ll the members of the Opposition in those days-the members of the Country Party and the then United Australia Party-boycotte d the opening Mr J. R. ERASER --With the exception of one man, the late Bernic Corser, who was the member for Wide Bay. He was the only one who had thc courage to go along to the opening. along. Mr J. R.

Party. Mr J. R. FRASER A very different Labour Party, says the Minister. Is that the only answer the Minister can find? I remind honourable members that it was the Australian Labour Party in government that founded Australia's aluminium industry. It was the Australian Labour Party in government that fostered Australia's automobile industry. It was the Australian Labour Party in government that expanded thc shipbuilding industry and the aircraft industry in this country. It was the Australian Labour Party in government which established the Australian National University. That action was criticised at thc time by the former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies. His criticism is on record in "" Hansard "". These are some of the achievements of Australian Labour Party Federal Governments in so short a period as this.

But these are not the only ways in which this Government treats pensioners in this Territory. The pensioner who through the years has saved and acquired a home in Canberra occupies his home on land leased from the Commonwealth. From time to time, the Commonwealth revalues this leasehold land. Recently, valuations have increased land rent by more than 700 per cent, in many cases. Many pensioner owners of properties in Canberra find it quite impossible to pay land rent increased sevenfold.

184,Mr Nixon,"What did Labour do aboutfor pensioners. After the defeat of the Chifley Government, because pensioners were coming here from various parts of Australia in order to get housing, this Government introduced the rule that nobody could have government housing in Canberra unless he was employed in Canberra. I think that answers the honourable members question, Mr Deputy Speaker. I say to this Government and to people who may be listening to me-to members of the Government parties-that it is no good talking about how much you do for pensioners because here in your own Capital Territory where you have complete and unfettered control, this is what you are doing to pensioners: You are demanding that they pay in full. If you increase land rent by 700 per cent., the pensioners still must pay infull. They must pay their rates to the CommonweaUh Government in full. There is no opportunity, as there is in municipalities and shires in the State adjoining this Territory, for a pensioner to have payment of his rates waived and for the council to be reimbursed a moiety of it by the State Government. This matter too has been nnder consideration for 16 months. Is there anyone here who will tell me that there are not officers of the Commonwealth who could come up with an answer to these problems in less than 16 months? If these problems had been looked at with a sense of urgency, kindness and fairness, the answers would have been found by now. If ihese problems had been looked ai by officers under thc control of a Minister who had said: "" Come up with the answer "", they would have the answer by now. But, no. The Commonwealth says to the pensioners here in its own Territory: "" You must pay: you must pay all the way here; no matter how uv increase the charges you must pay them"". That is how the Commonwealth deals with pensioners in its own Territory. It will deny to them any right to any type of government accommodation. They cannot even put their names on the list for a one bedroom flat unless they are employed in Canberra. They cannot put their names on ihe list for a two bedroom cottage. Suppose the Government relented and said: "" Yes, you may put your names on the list "". Is the waiting time 2h years or 3 years said: "" No, you cannot do that. You cannot for a single bedroom Hat? It is anybody's guess, because the Government has cut back -deliberatel y cut back-o n its home building programme in Canberra. A former Minister for the Interior, who now sits on the front bench as Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall), might recall that when the recent moves of the Department of Defence to Canberra were proposed, he, as Minister for the Interior, gave an assurance that the housing to be provided for those to be transferred from Melbourne to Canberra would be additional to the houses provided under the normal programme. I know that he gave the assurance in good faith and I know that he gave it believing that Cabinet would carry out the assurance that it had given to him. Mr J. R. FRASER -It did not. The Minister went a step further. He said: "" The transfer of departments to Canberra will not mean that the waiting time for houses in Canberra will extend. In fact, it may well be reduced"". Those were his words. In fact, it was not reduced. In fact, the housing programme has not increased and, in fact, today the Commonwealth is building fewer family dwelling units than it was building ten years ago. The figures are available to the Minister or to anybody else who wants them. I suggest io the House that the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the Australian Capital Territory are in essence a budget within a budget. The most disappointing feature of the budget for the Australian Capital Territory is its failure to provide funds to allow for any increase in the Government's home building programme in Canberra. It is true that over the past 12 months the waiting time for housing in this city has dropped. It was at about the three years mark, but it is now down to 29 months. But it is down to 29 months for one reason only and that is that, for the past 12 months, there have been no mass transfers of public servants from Melbourne and other places to Canberra. When some years ago I suggested to thc then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, that the Government should either increase its home building programme or declare a 12 months' holiday from the mass transfer of public servants from Melbourne lo Canberra, he just turn these things on and turn them off.""",69,Speaker Mr Of Living Casting Envious Eyes At Us In The

We should then be capable of establishing our own education authority and of implementing national education policies here in the territory. I give this promise, that the Australian Labour Party will establish a teacher training college here. honourable member's time has expired. Sir (Chisholm) |'I0.18| I was very interested in the speech of the honourable meniber for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser), especially in the first half of it, when with his very best election voiceI almost said street corner voice-h e was obviously trying very hard to make up for what he believed was the dreadful position into which the Party to which he belongs has fallen. He was so disgusted with the disunity and the disreputable state of the Party that he turned to distant history to recount at some length ancl, as I say, in a very loud voice, what the Australian Labour Party had done in the past. was very good, but I thought he should have finished with the well known couplet of Byron on the ancient GreeksShades of the Mighty, can it be That this is ail remains of the? That is the position with the Australian Labour Party today. I had intended to make a request to the Government to have an independent, objective inquiry into the whole workings of the Financial Agreement, as it is now 40 years since it first began. But as the Opposition has apparently thrown down the gauntlet and turned this debate into a preview of the election picture, as television commentators would say, in which defence and foreign policy are to be the two main subjects for discussion, I am quite prepared to pick up the gage. All the big guns of the Australian Labour Party-the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) Watson. honourable member for Watson and various others who have spoken in this debate trained their heavy artillery on these two features. But they did not seem to be very well synchronised or very accurate. Some seemed to be firing in one direction and some in another. Eventually, some of these big guns began firing on their own artillery pieces. Let us follow matters through and and what a disreputable policy it has. The only conclusion that one can come to is that some Labour members have a still small voice of conscience. It seems to upset them because they know what is right when they try to follow their policy on defence and foreign affairs, which they know in their own hearts is wrong. Unfortunately, most of them seem to lack the courage to say within the ranks of their Party vvhat they really think or to criticise what they believe is wrong. As a result, they engage in all kinds of contortions and convolutions that suggest the tortured reasoning of disordered minds as they discuss present state of the nation, the forthcoming general election and the disarray in which the Labour Party finds itself. They contradict one another. They even contradict themselves. The honourable member for Yarra, when he was in South Vietnam or just after he came backI forget which-sai d that the projected elections there would be rigged in favour of the Government. While1 was there, one of the Buddhist leaders told me that the Buddhists could control 70 per cent, of the vote. I do not know who is to do thc rigging or in what way it will be done, but the honourable member for Yarra stated that the elections would be useless because they would be rigged in favour of the Government.

194,Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes,"Th ein this debate on 30th August, be turned round entirely on that display of form and said that the elections in South Vietnam might do some good by producing a government that might be able to negotiate. His exact words wereThe elections of 1966 in South Vietnam may do something to provide the other negotiating party. If they did-and it does not matter how they did it-that would be a justification for them. On another point, he said that the Vietcong, which he called the National Liberation Front, using the Communist name, must have a share in the government of South Vietnam. That is good Communist policy. Whether or not the honourable member knows it, this is one of the definite terms that the Communists have laid down. But, in almost the next breath, the honourable member went even further and askedWhat will happen if negotiations come and a ceasefire and some settlement are reached and the National Liberation Front then has a big share of power in South Vietnam? In other words, he advocates the policy that brought the Communists to power in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the other countries of Eastern Europe. Why does he advocate this form of Communist policy? Or does he not know that it is Communist policy? Why does he not mention that nobody but Communists has any voice in the government of North Vietnam? According to his distorted reasoning, apparently the Communists should be given a voice in the government of South Vietnam. The honourable member went on to discuss what he called, in effect, the lesser of two evils and he dealt witb the question of whether one should escalate the war or surrender. On this point, he saidBut when one has taken the position of playing God That is a new role for the honourable memberin a situation like this and has to decide how many deaths there are going to be on one side of the scale and how many there will be on the other, this is the kind of decision that one has to make. He was dealing with the decision that would have to be made if one considered that the greater number of deaths would result from fighting for principles that most people believe are those that make life worth living at all. Having had three and a half years as a prisoner of war I can say that some people do not seem to understand the freedoms that they have inherited and how lucky they are to enjoy them. PerhapsI might recite to the House a verse I wrote on V.P. d a y Freedom, the image in the mind Distorted by the poor purblind And foolish folk who do not know The substance from the shadow show. What is this sort of reasoning that we get from the honourable member for Yarra? Did he mean what he said? Was he serious? l f so, he should go back to South East Asia, make further inquiries and not come home quoting Wilfred Burchett, the Communist turncoat from Melbourne, as the one authority. The honourable member went on to deal with what would happen if a peaceful settlement were obtained under these conditions. He declaredThe International Control Commission and supervision of South Vietnam after a ceasefire could do much, but it would need to be greatly strengthened. I do not. know whether he knows the history of the Commission. The fact is that its members are not allowed into Hanoi and that it has been virtually a sterile body since it was constituted, because the Poles will not co-operate in any way. Often, both the Indian and the Canadian members have come to a conclusion and issued a report, but it has not been a report of the Commission, because the Poles evidently have had strict instructions that there is to be no criticism of the Communists. The honourable member stated that the International Control Commission could do much, but about six sentences later, referring to North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front, he saidWhile it is beyond doubt that they would hinder supervision and convert aid to their own purposes, I am sure that supervision and aid can reduce the harmful consequences of a settlement. . . . I do not think that any other member of this Parliament will agree with that sort of reasoning. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also spoke at great length on the war in Vietnam and on South East Asia. He advocated that we pull out Australian troops in accordance with this weird policy that the Labour Party has enunciated. He said that we should concentrate on massive aid and trade. But what did the honourable member for Yarra say? He declaredI think thc war in South Vietnam has to come to win the election for the Labour Party. to un end before aid and development can achieve anything . . . in one sentence he destroyed all this alternative policy that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went to South Vietnam to discover. I do not know whether Labour members have really worked out this policy.

I return now to my remarks on Vietnam. Not only did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Yarra go overseas but also the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) went overseas at his own expense. Again, I congratulate him for being so interested. Why the honourable member for Wills should have thought that the people in Hanoi were so foolish as not to know that he was on the reserve list or the retired list of officers of the Australian ArmyI do not know.

The honourable member for Wills is not as popular with the Communists as he thought he was and that, again, is to his advantage. An interesting thing that I should point out is that the honourable member for Yarra and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition disagreed on what could be done with regard to the aid programme. Then the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) also came into the party and pointed out that if we had a battalion of people giving economic or technical aid we would, in present circumstances, need two battalions to defend them. PerhapsI should advise the honourable member for Yarra that it is not wise to give a copy of his speech to the Press if he does not make the speech in full.

I refer now to the honourable member for Batman( Mr Benson). I did not want to say anything about this before, but I can say it now. The honourable member for Batman, in a very courageous speech-whethe r one agreed with it or not, it was a courageous speech-tol d him exactly why we are in the Vietnam war. We are there both for national preservation and because of the treaty obligations which we are bound to fulfil.

Now we find another country in a does not the honourable member pay attensimilar position and through treaty obligation to what Nai Thanat Khoman, one of tions we are involved.

Treaties and who said: ""This is the age of regional pacts"". The Government is to a very large extent following the Curtin-Chifley-Evatt policy and the Leader of the Opposition does not even know it. After all, what is the difference between the fall of Singapore, and our appealing then to America for help, and the fall of Saigon-that is, if such a thing should happen? The two places are not so very far apart and the results for Australia would be very much the same. while the other was the result of territorial expansion. the honourable member had better go back to a teach-in somewhere. If he does not believe that there is very little difference between the two situations, why not ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) what his friend, and to some extent my friend, the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, told him? Why not read it again in the speech of the honourable member for Batman, which I am not going to repeat? When six members of the Opposition went over there as guests of the Prime Minister of Singapore, invited by him, he told them very definitely what the position would be if South Vietnam was allowed to fall into the hands of the Communists. honourable member for Hunter and the honourable meniber for Yarra get up and tell us that there is nothing in the domino system. would not know who he is.

Now that the tide has begun to turn against the aggressors whose economy and national resources are strained to thc breaking point, the problem has become even more complex for all of us.

216,Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes,"Youwittingly or otherwise seek to undermine the Free World's position at the time when the enemy faces one setback after another. He is absolutely correct, and the appeasers today, although they do not know it, are the world's worse warmongers. They are just building up the morale of the enemy and helping them to cause further casualties amongst Australian and allied troops. If that is what honourable members opposite are proud of, well, I have misjudged most of the members of the Labour Party. WhatI feel has happened is that most of them have been brainwashed in this psychological war without realising it. military dictatorships. honourable member for Wills is one who was brainwashed in the first place. Has he learned nothing from Hitler's "" Mein Kampf"" or of the danger of disregarding plain statements when we have Mao Tse Tung's Mein Kampf. "" Blueprint for World Conquest"", put before us? yes, you are a friend of Peking. The Leader of the Opposition today declared himself on the side of the Peking Communists against Moscow. He gave the position away at question time. He is one of Ted Hill's men, as was apparent at question time today. If the honourable member for Wills will not believe me perhaps he will believe a well known and respected journalist who writes for a newspaper which usually supports the Labour Party. was Douglas Brass writing in the "" Australian"", today's issue. This is what he said in the last paragraph, after giving a lot of advice to the Labour PartyAH we have, sad to say, is a Labour Party which is sulkily burying its head in the sand and displaying a posterior ingloriously decorated with a single white feather. will get back to the Budget, Mr Deputy Speaker, and not become involved in this battle of Vietnam. The Budget this year has been described not by me but by most of the leading newspapers in Australia as a stand-still or a stay-put Budget, and 1 am sure there are many people in the community today who wish they could use similar descriptions for the cost of living, which is racing upwards at a very fast rate. I have perused the Budget very carefully and all the papers that go with it, and I am satisfied that there is nothing in the Budget to stabilise the economy or that would be even likely to achieve that end. Before the Budget was framed businessmen in every sphere, as well as other people in every sphere, were urging the Government to do something to stimulate consumer spending. 1 am certain that many people who were expecting something to happen along those lines are now very sadly disappointed. The only section of the Budget likely to have this result was that which provided for a small increase in pensions. It is not very much, amounting to about S60 million in all. This amount will certainly be spent because it will be put in the hands of people who at present have not half enough to live on, but it will not be enough to stimulate the economy. This year's Budget is the largest, in terms of money, that has ever been presented to this Parliament, but 1 believe that in terms of what it will achieve it is probably the smallest. The estimated expenditure is $5,930,394,000, which is about $550,684,000 more than last year. Most of the revenue to cover this expenditure is to be raised by taxation, and the amount mentioned in the Budget is $4,420,500,000, or $273,553,000 more than last year. The Government is making great play of its claim that it is budgeting this year for a deficit of about $275 million. One can see that by the time the next Budget is prepared the planned deficit for this year will have been overtaken by increased collection of taxes. It is also interesting to examine the field of taxation and see who is to pay. As I have said, total estimated tax collections will be $4,420,500,000. Of this amount $2,525,200,000 will come from direct taxation and $1,895,300,000 from indirect taxation. There are many people in the community who do not concern themselves with the difference between direct and indirect taxation. It is well to remind them that direct taxation is levied according to a person's capacity to pay, and the higher",76,Wilfrid Kent Hughes See Just How Disunited The Labour Party Is

223,Mr Costa (Banks) [10.46],"I think Ithe income he has the more taxation he pays; rightly so. The Government is obtaining a greater return from indirect taxation which is imposed on consumer goods and which is collected from sales tax, excise and customs duties. This can be called a painless extraction method, because people do not realise when they have a glass of beer that they are contributing to the taxation yield. Indirect taxation accounts for 54 per cent, of all taxation receipts and direct taxation for 46 per cent. It is easy to see, therefore, that indirect taxation accounts for the greater portion of taxation. The pay as you earn taxpayer provides the greatest portion of the direct taxation, which is estimated this year at $1,185 million. Those who pay provisional tax-and in this category are people with high incomes, those who reap the greatest harvest, including bankers, stockbrokers, doctors, dentists, farmers, graziers, manufacturers, property owners and persons involved in big business-wil l pay $613 million. It is plain to see that the wage earners pay the greater amount of direct taxes. When the field of indirect taxation is analysed it can be seen that the wage and salary earners-commonl y known as the wage plugs-pa y most of it. Some indirect taxation is shown in the Budget under the heading of excise, which is only another word for taxation. This is levied on beer, spirits, tobacco, cigars and cigarettes, motor spirits and petroleum products, diesel fuel and miscellaneous. I do not know who "" Mr Miscellaneous"" is, but he is contributing $6 million odd, which is a fair lump of money. Excise from beer this year is estimated at $325,850,000, which is $23 million more than last year. We know that beer is the working man's drink. The estimated receipts from whiskey and other spirits is $25 million, or $2 million more than last year. Of course, working men and women may not drink as much Scotch as people in the more affluent section of the community do, mainly because it is too costly for them-ove r 20c for a small nip -so the workers stick to beer. Taxation on tobacco, cigars and cigarettes is estimated this year at $228 million or $11 million more than last year. A smoke and a glass of beer are relaxing for men and women after a hard day's work, but they have to pay dearly for these pleasures by way of indirect taxation. As I pointed out earlier, it is painless extraction. Few people realise when they drink a glass of beer-and it does not matter whether it is a middy, schooner or pint-that about five eighths of the cost goes in taxation. It is estimated that beer is costing the workers about $400 million a year. Sales taxation this year is expected to amount to $399 million or $30 million more than last year. My comment on sales taxation is equally appropriate to the indirect taxation on beer, namely, that it is not a graduated tax like income tax, and the pensioner-the person with the smallest income-pay s as much as does the multi-millionaire. I believe that indirect taxation should be altered. The honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) said that it was time this field of taxation was closely examined. Customs duty this year is estimated at $288 million. This is another tax on commodities. I am not always against this form of taxation, because it provides protection for our own manufacturers. However, it is an indirect tax which is not graduated, so the poorest people in the community pay the same as the richest. It is estimated that payroll taxation this year will total $179 million. According to the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) it is proposed that the salaries and wages paid by privately run schools which cater for students up to secondary education level and which are not conducted for profit will be exempt from payroll taxation. This exemption is estimated to cost about $60,000. I heartily agree with this proposal. 1 believe that any concern that is not run for profit and which renders a service should not be subject to payroll taxation. It is estimated that taxation on motor spirits this year will amount to $240 million compared with $204 million last year-a n increase of $36 million. Indirect taxation, according to the Budget, will total $1,184 million. I claim that at least 80 per cent, of indirect taxation is paid by wage and salary earners who also pay most of the direct taxation. According to the Treasurer's statement this group pays 56 per cent, of direct taxation. 1 believe that if we add what they pay in direct taxation to what they pay in indirect taxation it will be seen that they pay about $2,272 million as compared with $862,770,000 paid by those in the higher income brackets. The Labour Party believes that there should be a redirection of taxation; there should be more direct taxation than indirect taxation. 1 wish now to bring to the notice of the Government the parious financial state of local governing bodies in Australia. They are drifting towards bankruptcy. At the present limt their accumulated debt is about $700 million and the interest they must pay each year on this debt amounts to about $35 million. Rate charges are so high that many owners are being forced from their homes. Proof of this is to be found in the fact that in many cases arrears of rates owing to municipal and shire councils have reached astronomical heights. Recently a list published in the daily newspapers showed that some councils had outstanding rates amounting to $800,000. This is typical of most municipal and shire councils. In fact, I do not think there would be one council in Australia which was not heavily in debt. To deal with this situation some councils Lord Mayor of each of the six capital have set up special debt collecting departments to concentrate on the collection of unless they had unanimous support of all arrears. However, I understand that the maintenance of these departments is absorbing most of the arrears collected because Apparently quite a number of the State the collectors must be paid and very often couvt proceedings have to be taken. A similar tion. However, the association has asked situation exists in the Postmaster-General's Department which has outstanding telephone accounts amounting to £1 million. Holt) to discuss with its representatives However, the Department felt it was better to write olf this amount rather than to set them. up collecting agencies, the cost of which would absorb all the money collected. 1 mention these matters to illustrate how the mate of collections this year is $240 milold rating system for financing local governlion, which is $36 million more than last ment operations has completely failed. In year. As we know, tax on petrol was first my opinion, a chaotic stage has been imposed for the purpose of providing funds reached. To illustrate this further I shall repeat roads. All of the sum collected, not just some figures which I mentioned during the some of it, was to be used for this purpose. Budget debate last year. The local goPetrol tax is collected by the Commonvernment portion of the national debt rose wealth and should be returned to the States from $282 million in 1953 to $622 million to enable them to build and maintain roads. in 1963. In other words, over 10 years But the Commonwealth usually retains this debt increased at the rate of about one-third of the sum collected. I do not 12 per cent, per annum. If this debt know what the relevant Bill to be brought continues to increase at the same rateand it must unless a different formula is at this stage that much more money will be devised-in 10 years the local government collected in petrol tax this year than was debt will be $1,368 million plus $68 million collected last year. interest. I cannot see how local government bodies will be able to carry on because they will be so heavily in debt. It is interesting to note that the States* debts are increasing at the rate of 9 per cent, per annum, so the six States are not much better off than the local government authorities. While the States' debts are increasing at 9 per cent, per annum, the Commonwealth debt is decreasing at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum and is improving. The Liberal Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria have been squealing about their badfinancialposition. Can one wonder at that? We can understand why States which badly need funds for construction works are complaining. They are feeling the pinch but their counterparts in Canberra could not care less. Two years ago the Commonwealth association of local government authorities wanted to interview the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, about the position. The cities asked bim to see them, but he made the excuse that he could not see them State Ministers for Local Government. Liberal Ministers willingly co-operated with him and he dodged seeing the deputathe present Prime Minister( Mr Harold this important matter of local government finance. Something will have to be done for Now let me turn to petrol tax. The estifor rhe construction and maintenance of down this year will contain but I do know thirds of the sum collected. thing of the kind. two-thirds. it built military roads and the all-weather road from Adelaide to Darwin. It spent many millions of pounds on roads. This Government keeps a large slice of the tax collected and uses it for purposes other than road making. If the Commonwealth Government returned all this money to the State Governments they would be in a stronger position to help local government bodies. The local government authorities in Australia are responsible for 75 per cent, of all roads. This is beyond their financial resources. If local government bodies used all their revenue on roads they would have nothing left for necessary services for which they are responsible, such as libraries, home nursing, public health centres, clinics for the prevention of disease, senior citizen centres, recreation grounds, swimming pools, kerbing and guttering, drainage and many other things. Properly, the Commonwealth should return all this money collected from the petrol tax to the States which bear the great responsibility of providing roads. The Australian Labour Party will do this. We promised it in our last policy speech and have done so on several other occasions. If we are elected to office, as I am sure we will be on 26th November, we will cerlainly implement that policy. It will be in our policy speech. The payroll tax will yield $179 million. As I said earlier, the Treasurer intends to exempt from the payroll tax all schools up to secondary level conducted by non-profit organisations. The Labour Party at the two previous elections said that if elected it would extend this exemption to all local government bodies who render service to the people in the field I have mentioned. The Australian Labour Party would do this if elected. Bankstown is a big district with by way of income tax. in my electorate and last year payroll tax cost the Bankstown Council $50,000. Most councils are similarly affected. In our last policy speech we said we would exempt local government bodies from payroll tax as they certainly do not function for profit. I want to refer now to the rise in prices following the recent increase in the basic wage. Since the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission announced an increase of $2 in the basic wage, the higher cost of living has already absorbed the benefits from that rise. I have kept a record of some of the increases that have taken place and it is possible I have missed some. Milk has gone up one cent a pint. Train, tram and bus fares in Melbourne have risen by 25 per cent, and the Liberal Government in New South Wales is contemplating a rise in fares when it introduces its Budget in September. Motor vehicle insurance has been increased as much as 25 per cent. As was stated by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Sexton) today it is expected that the price of motor cars will rise. Private cartage rates have been increased by 5 per cent, and private parcel deliveries by 6 per cent. A wide range of building materials cost more. This is sufficient to add $400 to the cost of an average home, and puts a house completely out of the reach of the ordinary working man. The price of cigarettes has increased by lc a packet. As was pointed out to the Prime Minister recently, the price of copper increased by $380 a ton. I understand from a letter I received today that it has since dropped by $100 and the overall increase now is $280 a ton. The price of lubricating oil for motor vehicles has increased by ls. 9d. a gallon. As we saw from a recent announcement, the price of steel rose by between $2 and $4i a ton. Further, hospital charges have increased by from 20 per cent, to 30 per cent., and only yesterday an increase of from 6 per cent, to 10 per cent, in shipping freights was announced. I think it was the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. J. Harrison) who quoted figures which showed that, in addition to having to meet heavy increases in prices, the average wage and salary earner, because of the $2 a week rise, will have to pay more in income tax by reason of being placed in a higher income bracket. He pointed out that some married men with one child will pay $26.2 a year It can be seen, therefore, that the average worker would be in a better position if the increase had not been granted, because, although the basic wage has been increased by $2 a week, his actual purchasing power",77,Wilfrid Kent Hughes See Just How Disunited The Labour Party Is

227,Mr Costa,"When Labour was in oflicehas dropped by about S3 a week. The basic wage increase announced last July has already been absorbed by price increases. I venture the opinion that if those who granted the increase were reassembled tomorrow they would find it necessary to increase the basic wage by another §2 or $3 a week to bring it up to the level necessary to meet the increases that have taken place in the cost of living. A government that allows this farcical situation to continue is, to say the least, irresponsible. I know that Government members will argue that the Commonwealth Government lacks the constitutional power to control prices. That excuse is not good enough. This Government has the right to seek the necessary power, by way of referendum, and, having regard to the way things are, I am quite certain that the majority of people in Australia would give the Commonwealth power to control prices and costs. In any event, when the Labour Party is elected to office on 26th November next it will give the people this opportunity, and I am certain they will grant us the necessary power. I am sorry for the invalid and age pensioners, the widows, the repatriation pensioners and the superannuitants. In all there covered by the amendment moved by the are over one million people on fixed incomes in Australia. I have received numerous letters, as I am sure other honourable members have, from superannuitants complainadjourned. ing about the detrimental effect thc rise in prices is having on their incomes. One retired schoolmistressI am certain that she is very old now because she retired 20 years ago-complaine d to me and pointed out that at the time she retired she was receiving £11 a week by way of superannuation. She is still receiving only £11 a week. At the time she retired, that £11 was £5 greater than the basic wage. Today it is £5 below the basic wage. She complains that after paying municipal rates, water rates, the cost of repairs and of keeping the home together, she finds it difficult to carry on. When she retired many years ago she was comparatively well off on her superannuation. I mention this to illustrate how people have been detrimentally affected by this Government's policy, under which inflation has been allowed to spiral. I come now to the age pensioners. In 1948-49, when Labour was in oflice, the age pension represented 38 per cent, of the basic wage. Today, the pension represents only 35 per cent, of the basic wage. So, honourable members can see that the value is running out of the incomes of the people on fixed incomes. The same thing could be said about every other recipient of social service benefits. Mr Speaker, I will not have time to go into all of the matters Leader of the Opposition but I support that amendment wholeheartedly.

What action is intended to provide adequate dental services without charge to the Australian people? Dr. Forbes -The answers to the honor1. International comparisons relating to dental health are very difficult to assess because of a paucity of reliable and comparable information on a world-wide basis. The incidence of dental decay among Australian children is believed to ..492 be approximately similar to that which exists ..531 among children in other advanced countries in ..555 the world. . . 564 2. From time to time investigations have been made into the possibility of introducing a voluntary dental insurance scheme to provide financial assistance towards meeting the cost of services rendered by dentists. However, there are a number of real economic problems inherent in the operation of any such scheme and until satisfactory solutions can be formulated, it has ..118 not been considered advisable to implement a . . 143* dental insurance programme. ..140 3.

Arrangements have been made for a detailed survey to be made of the proposed route. Gold. (Question No. 1894.) Mr Webb asked the Treasurer, upon noticet. Did he reject a request from the Western Australian Government to appoint an economist to prepare a case for an increase in the price of gold? lf so, why? 2. Has he accepted the firm opposition of the United States to an increase in the price of geld? special 3. When was the price of gold fixed a* the under present price? at the 4. Is this price detrimental to the Australian to an gold mining industry? 5. Does he intend to take steps in an effort to secure an increase in the price of gold? honourable member's questions is as followsThe arguments for an increase in the price of gold are well known and this Government fully recognises that maintenance of the world price at thc level set in 1934 has caused major problems for the Australian gold mining industry. I would remind the House that this Government first introduced a subsidy scheme for the gold mining industry in 19S4. Subsidies to go'd producers under the Gold Mining Industry Assistance Act (1954) and the now expired Gold Mines Development Assistance Act totalled Si6.9 million up to 30th June 1966. In the current financial year, payments of subsidies to gold producers are expected to total around $3.3 million. However, it has to be recognised that an increase in the world price of gold will not occur unless the major western countries, and the United States in particular, agree that this is a desirable course of action. The United States Government, for its part, has declared on many occasions that it is firmly opposed to an increase in the price of gold. This situation has not deterred representatives of the Australian Government from speaking in support of the gold mining industry as opportunities presented themselves. We have gone on record in this respect at several annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and elsewhere. The Government will continue to urge that the future of gold and its role in -the work monetary system be given full consideration in international deliberations and I have no doubt that a suitable opportunity will arise at the forthcoming annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund to put our views forward once again.",84,Answers To Questions Upon Notice
