A number of legal problems came up greater understanding and greater willingness to about it, especially insurance.

The Bill is makgeneralities but about particular sets of ing the commissioners automatons. It denies circumstances. them the opportunity to say: 'We will make an award in circumstances that we believe apEven though a variety of fair minded people, propriate'. What it is really saying is: 'Whatever on and off the Bench would agree that that was the circumstances, your hands are tied'.

To intrude by legislation to give a ations by way of conciliation or arbitration. direction to the Commission and to admit in the marginal note on this clause that it is a limitation I again make the point that I think this clause on the powers of the Commission makes it clear goes beyond the constitutional power of this that this power is beyond the constitutional Government.

If it to speak. The point I make is that this clause attempted to do so, in my opinion that would be invalid and assumes that employers are never wrong. OfI think that (the) provisions inhibiting the Commission from acting in a certain way, is probably invalid too. The power to course they are. In 1978 some 25.6 per cent of conciliate and arbitrate is not vested in the Commonwealth. disputes are on the record as being caused by It is vested by the Constitution in the Commonwealth only in managerial policy.
