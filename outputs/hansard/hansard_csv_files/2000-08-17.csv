It being 6 p.m.,19320 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 Thursday, 17 August 2000 ----Alcoholic Essence Mr O’KEEFE (Burke) (9.54 a.m.)-I was very concerned to learn some time ago about the death of a young boy in my electorate which resulted from him having access to alcoholic essence which was bought off a supermarket shelf. The whole question was raised about the manufacturers and the supermarkets retailing an alcoholic essence that is not covered by the normal alcohol and excise laws. This is a matter under coronial inquiry in Victoria, so I am limited in what I can say. I raised the matter with the Minister for Health and Aged Care. In answer to a question on notice on 26 June, he gave certain assurances about the process that was under way between the Commonwealth and the states via the ANZFA labelling agreement and also via measures that the Taxation Office was taking to deal with this issue of essences that are available from supermarket shelves. The father of the boy wrote to me yesterday, drawing my attention to an extract which he had just taken off the Internet which is available generally to university students. In general, it is quite a humorous outline written by a university student on how to enjoy university life on a whole range of issues, including things like drinking. When one goes to the section on drinking, one finds that this university student has given the full recipe. Under the heading ‘How to make cheap piss’ it says, ‘Purchase some Hoyt’s alcoholic essences from the grog section of Jewels family supermarket for only AU$5.99.’ He goes on to outline the way in which you can make up your own bulk brew of highly alcoholic beverage. You can use coconut-it is called Malibu. You can have vodka-Stolichnaya. You can have coffee, peppermint and aniseed-all of these flavours of essence which can, by a very simple process, be converted into bulk grog. I take this opportunity to express my concern to the parliament that both the minister and the Treasurer and their respective departments have clearly got to move more quickly on this issue. The fact is that we do have a problem with teenage drinking in Australia. It is very clear that, even though this issue is being given attention by the federal and state governments, there is still access to bulk alcohol via the supermarket shelves for young people. I want to draw that to the attention of the parliament. Employment and Unemployment: Sunshine Coast Administration) (9.57 a.m.)-I rise today in the Main Committee to pay tribute to the business people of the Sunshine Coast, having regard to the confidence they have shown in creating more jobs for local people. From June 1999 to June 2000, more than 2,000 fewer Sunshine Coast people are receiving unemployment benefits. This is a tremendous result in an area of rapid population growth with a history of high unemployment. In fact, much of our problem on the Sunshine Coast is imported, as people who are unemployed in southern parts of Australia move to what is the most wonderful part of the country in which to live. The most recent Department of Family and Community Services data has built on this result. Over the last month alone, 288 fewer coast people are on the dole. This is a great result for those people who have found work. It is a great result for the Sunshine Coast economy. It is a tremendous reflection of the confidence enjoyed by Sunshine Coast business people and the community at large following the introduction of our new tax system on 1 July.",103,Family Law Amendment Bill And Parenting Of Children Access And Child

209,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andThursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19321 Nationally, we now have the lowest unemployment rate in 10 years, at 6.3 per cent. This is a tribute not only to the success of the government’s policies but also to the small business community which is the engine room of the economy and which creates a very large percentage of new jobs. The latest figures also represent another failure on the part of the opposition leader, who predicted on 1 July that the sun would not come up. He has egg on his face. He has a party that is divided and a party which opposes the GST so much that it is going to keep it. The small business community on the Sunshine Coast and in the nation as a whole need to be reminded that the Australian Labor Party and its union backers are not supporting unfair dismissal reforms which would provide more confidence and more jobs. Ms Gambaro-Shame! is holding the country back because of the fact that it is in bondage to the union movement. The Howard government is on the right track. We are doing what needs to be done. It is a pity that the opposition is not prepared to take some firm steps to create job opportunities for unemployed people. We all remember the disastrous dole queues-almost a million peopleunder Labor. Yet when this government is prepared to be proactive, is prepared to bring in real and meaningful reforms, is prepared to create an environment in which jobs will be created, we continue to be opposed by the troglodytes in the Australian Labor Party. the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. Related Measures) Bill 2000 gives effect to changes announced as part of the government’s 2000-01 budget. I am not sure that some of the measures in this bill will translate into good law and, while not declining to support the bill, we will be reserving our position on these measures and, if necessary, amending them in the Senate. We support the measure which will ensure that Abstudy scheme payments are generally excluded from the income test to achieve equity of treatment for scheme recipients and their partners with that of other income recipients. We also have no problem with the extension of the period for data matching of income details between the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink from two to four years. Labor introduced the concept of data matching and, unlike the punitive measures that make up the government’s zero tolerance family policy and its breach first, ask questions later approach to mutual obligation, data matching is a fair way of ensuring that the integrity of the social security system is maintained. There is also a beneficial measure in this bill which seeks, after the social security agreement with the United Kingdom is terminated, to preserve access to entitlements for migrants who became Australian residents on or before 1 March 2000. We support this measure but register our concerns about the impact of the termination of the agreement. Another measure in the bill proposes to allow for 75 per cent, instead of the existing 50 per cent, of the value of a person’s interest in farm and business assets to be disregarded under the youth allowance family assets test.

213,Mr Swan (Lilley) (10.00 A.m.),"The Family and Community Services (2000 Budget and19322 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 Bill 1999. I might add that, at that time, the government argued that a more modest version of this measure was too generous and would lead to the children of families with significant assets getting youth allowance. Given the government’s opposition to a proposal that would have allowed the discounting of farm assets only during the debate on the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill, it is difficult to understand their rationale for this measure, which discounts not only farm assets but business ones as well. The inclusion of a business assets discount will cost a further $41 million to the budget and, arguably-according to the government’s own argument-is not well targeted to those who might be truly asset rich but cash poor, such as farmers. We are therefore reserving our position on this measure. This bill contains a measure that seeks to extend child-care services, for which child-care benefit may be available to include in-home care. While we will be supporting this measure, I would like to make a number of points. The additional funding contained in this measure does not compensate for the funding cuts to child care implemented by the government since 1996. I note that Senator Newman, in all the media last night and today, is perpetrating the lie that there have been no child-care cuts under this government. Peter Costello’s budget papers show that child care has been cut by this government to the tune of $850 million, leading to a crisis in the affordability of child care and putting substantial barriers in the way of many welfare recipients attempting to move from welfare to work. So, while the government is desperate to give the impression that it is increasing funding for child care, that is simply not the case. As I said, there have been savage cuts to child care totalling some $850 million, and that has reduced flexibility in the child-care system, as some services have responded to the fall in subsidies by restricting their opening hours and so on. So there are real problems in child care, and this government cannot get away with the fiction that they have no history of savage cuts in this area; they do, and that is well known in the Australian community. The government has not explained why it has introduced in-home care before the completion of its child-care pilots and before the commencement of quality accreditation for family day care. The government is yet to explain how this new care can be affordable if it is to be provided to single or very small groups of children at the same funding level that applies to in-service care with much larger, and therefore cheaper, groups. Of course, Labor supports flexible care subject to quality controls, but we think that a lot more work needs to be done in developing this program, and the government needs to show a great deal more heart-which, to date, has certainly been missing from this government-if it is to make up for the savage cuts it has made to child care generally. While this measure will no doubt be beneficial for some parents, it is simply a drop in the ocean in addressing the lack of affordability of child care in this country. The inclusion of measures in this bill relating to families and to fraud control also provides an opportunity to discuss the government’s approach to the administration of family payments. This approach is now completely one of bludgeoning average families, while ignoring tax evaders at the big end of town and other malicious social security fraud. I think it is a signature policy of a government that is certainly weak on the strong, but very strong on the weak. The government’s family payments system now forces families to estimate their income to the exact dollar. If they are wrong-that is, if they underestimate their income by just $1-a debt will be raised by this government. That is a zero tolerance family policy. Prior to 1 July, there was a margin of error of 10 per cent. That allowed for the normal fluctuations in family income that come from unplanned overtime or part-time parents being asked to work more hours than usual. But now there is no margin for error. The zero tolerance family policy is a reality. That is why the zero tolerance family policy will be one that, in the Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19323 coming years, will hurt families on modest incomes who find it very hard to predict their income a year in advance. This is going to cause an enormous amount of pain and distress in the community. A number of these families were on A Current Affair the night before last, explaining their position, because these people are branded as welfare cheats by the government. The figures that it uses in its propaganda about saving money on welfare fraud include the recovery of these overpayments to honest, hard working families. This measure is one that every member of the government is going to come to regret, because their offices, like my office, will be flooded with complaints from people who are going to be hit by this zero tolerance family policy. While these new zero tolerance rules will have an impact on nearly every family receiving family payments, they do nothing really to pick up genuine cases of fraud. The government’s own figures show that only 0.1 per cent of the millions of people receiving payments each year who are audited are convicted of fraud. The last half-yearly report showed that there were 1.1 million reviews undertaken. Of the total reviewed, there were 114,523 payment cancellations or reductions-about 10 per cent. These, as I said before, are mostly due to incorrect payment levels as a result of inaccurate income estimates by recipients or Centrelink errors in the calculation of payments. There are those, however, who deliberately set out to defraud the system. What are the figures when we get to deliberate fraud? From the 1.1 million reviews, there were just 1,347 convictions for welfare fraud, representing 0.1 per cent. In other words, 99.9 per cent of all those reviewed were not rorting the system. I note that a prominent Liberal backbencher, Petro Georgiou, has pointed out that more people win first or second division Tattslotto each year than are caught defrauding the social security system. Who are these debts raised against? Who are the people that are being reviewed and having debts raised against them, that the government brands as welfare cheats and welfare frauds? With respect to the vast majority, it is usually a result of failing to provide an accurate estimate of their earnings. As payments are income dependent, even small variations in incomes result in significant debts. Let us look at the customer groups that Centrelink deals with and the proportion who have debts raised against them. When you come to families, 40 per cent-27,734 families-have debts raised against them. They are the people that are being branded as welfare cheats and frauds. And more of them are going to be caught in the system because of the government’s zero tolerance family policy. The average debt raised for a family is $1,057. Many families, even though they have been diligent in advising Centrelink of changes in their circumstances, are still having debts raised against them, and they are branded by this cold-hearted, callous government as welfare frauds. That is what the government thinks of honest, hard working families. The fact that only 0.1 per cent of all those reviewed are convicted of fraud has not stopped the government implementing a punitive and bureaucratic system that catches hard working families-and that is what I mean by the zero tolerance family policy. So the savings that the government claims come from cracking down on fraud are really paid off the back of honest families who simply cannot comply with a system that in many ways is designed to deceive them or to catch them. The government is simply using its zero tolerance rules to brand families as welfare rorters. And we are not talking about small change. The average debt raised by the government is about $1,000. That is a lot of money to a family struggling to buy milk. It is a hell of a lot of money for a family struggling to pay for basic school excursions and so on. What is even more absurd is that the repayment of the debt is compulsory in cases where the mistake is Centrelink’s-and they can go back three years to demand that the money be returned by the 19324 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 family. This is a cold-hearted measure from a cut throat government and it is going to cause very much distress across Australian families. This approach is matched by the government’s current approach to the breaching of the unemployed. The government’s new Preparing for Work Agreement will save $212 million over four years, and this is being achieved not through finding the unemployed jobs but through a punitive system that will likely see one in every two unemployed people breached this year. Basically, this is a US style time limit approach to welfare. We have already got it here. It is already here; the government just does it through its breaching policies. Mr Causley interjecting of that? Excellent. Very good. We know that the government believes passionately in this policy and we have had it confirmed by the member for Page. Departmental officials have confirmed that the savings are almost wholly as a result of imposing breaches rather than assisting people to work. Figures provided to the community affairs committee in May revealed 1,500 would be deterred from ongoing benefits, 1,800 would find work sooner and a massive 48,000 would be breached. Like the government’s zero tolerance family policy-also supported by the member for Page-this breach first, ask questions later policy with job seekers penalises many honest unemployed people. The government has a trigger-happy minister for employment who shoots first, breaches first, asks questions later. So now it comes in and expects us to think that its intentions might be honourable when it moves to take mutual obligation into disability support pensions and to lone parents when it has this breach first, ask questions later policy for the unemployed. That is the danger in the course that the government may take coming out of the McClure report. What we have is a trigger-happy government that has been more concerned with putting people down than lifting them up. That is why, after four years, there are now 100,000 more children growing up in families where neither parent works. To listen to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business over the media in the last 24 hours, you would think that nothing had occurred in welfare except that things had been reduced, that the number of people on benefits had gone down, that there was some great record of reform. What we have actually had is an explosion in welfare under this government. The benefits of growth are not going down to the bottom because of the government’s removal of all the essential capacity building programs-the abolition of the training programs, the cuts to the JET scheme, the cuts to child care. That is why there are now 860,000 children living in families where neither parent works. When you look at the NATSEM report that came out the week before last, using three different measures of poverty in Australia, you find at least another 100,000 children living in poverty in our community and a substantial increase in the number of people living in poverty who are working for very low wages. That is the government’s record. The government have not explained why this should be occurring during a time of strong economic growth. Their solution is to get this trigger-happy, breach-first, ask-questions-later type policy rather than to actually go to the core of the problem and make some investments in the programs that will enable people to move from welfare to work. The other thing that is absolutely obscene about the government’s approach is that they say that people on high incomes deserve incentives-I think that is probably right: like everybody else, they deserve incentives-so they will drop the top marginal rate of tax to give them",105,Representatives Main Committee

216,Mr Swan,"So you think it is fine to breach one in two, do you? You are fully supportiveThursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19325 incentives. But when it comes to the people on the lowest income, it seems that they do not deserve incentives. They just get punishment; that is what they get. Do people on high incomes respond to incentives and people on low incomes respond only to punishment? After the tax package comes in, there will be the ridiculous situation that, if you are an unemployed person living in Page and you go and work part time, you will be taxed 90 cents in the dollar for every additional dollar earnt. It seems that you do not deserve any incentive. When the government look at the McClure report, they say, ‘We will consider it all,’ but what does the McClure report recommend? It recommends tax credits, incentives for people to move from welfare to work to keep more of the extra dollars they earn. The funny thing is that the minister, after the interim report came out, ruled out tax credits. He came out and said that they were hopeless. Yesterday, in the parliament and in the media, the minister said, ‘We have an open mind, and we are going to consider implementing all of these measures.’ Tax credits were an absolutely essential part of the McClure report, and they have already been ruled out by the minister. I think that gives you some indication of what the government is really up to. The problem we have here is that the government has a trigger-happy, punitive approach when it comes to families and the unemployed. The government expects us to turn around and believe that this approach will not then be transferred to disability support pensioners and lone parents. I certainly hope it is not, because the consequences of its policy in the two areas I have just spoken about have already been very dramatic. Labor has long been on the record for putting forward a positive program of welfare reforms. Tax credits have been essential to that; so has the commitment to training so that we can actually build those bridges from welfare to work. It is very interesting to see that the McClure report also recommended, in addition to tax credits, the work bonus-another policy that we put out that the government rubbished. When you read the McClure report, it is also important to see that it does chronicle the government’s responsibility over the last four years for this substantial growth in the number of children living in jobless households and so on. It chronicles the fact that there have been substantial cuts to child care. It talks about the need for investment and capacity building programs, all of which have been taken away-or substantially taken away-in the last few years. They are all important parts of the McClure report, and they do not reflect well on the government. For our part, we will be delighted if the government have some conversion to principles of investment and so on, but unfortunately a leopard does not change its spots. What we want from this government when it comes to welfare reform is an absolute commitment to do the whole package. If they do that, they will have our wholehearted support. and Community Services (2000 Budget and Related Measures) Bill 2000 this morning. I will go through some of the matters raised by the shadow minister later on, but I now want to talk about the 2000 budget and the raft of measures introduced by the government to assist families. MightI say, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, that this government has been a very familyfriendly government. The budget includes an amount of $240 million for the strengthening families and communities strategy; we have introduced tax reform; there is an early intervention, parenting and family relationship support initiative targeting rural and regional areas; and there is $32 million for Vietnam veterans and their families-and I will return to that later on.

There is",108,Representatives Main Committee

As a result of our wide ranging tax reforms, ordinary families, working Australian families, battling Australian families, are more than $40 to $50 a week better off. There is simplified family assistance-12 payments reduced to three. We have streamlined the process and made it easier. And there is an extra $2.5 billion in family payment benefits, plus $12 billion worth of personal income tax cuts. I am utterly amazed when I hear the shadow minister speak either in this chamber or in the one downstairs. He constantly runs scare campaigns that are designed to affect the most vulnerable in our society. He has not come up with one constructive policy since he took over that position. You cannot articulate policy integrity, as he tries to do, if you have not got any policies. The opposition is absolutely bereft of any policies at all in relation to child care or family assistance-any policy at all-and nor has it any policies in any area. I am sure the honourable member for Page will agree with me that we just sat back and listened in utter amazement to their so-called national convention, conference or talkfest. I do not know what it was called, but I know that it was spectacularly unsuccessful. There was nothing articulated about regional and rural Australia. No policies were articulated at all. Indeed, the opposition candidate in my electorate put out a press release saying that she welcomed the policy renewal of the Labor Party and said, ‘We now have a comprehensive plan to introduce a comprehensive range of policies.’ That was what came out of the national convention. came out of that conference at all. If you notice the way the member for Lilley addresses these matters, he will say, ‘We do not disagree with any of this,’ but then he goes on and starts nibbling away and attacking. He will pull little bits out, but when push comes to shove Labor will not articulate any policy at all. It is very interesting to hear the member for Lilley confirm-and he articulated it again today-that the Australian Labor Party does not believe, as the great bulk of the Australian community does believe, that those who are ripping off the system should be dealt with appropriately. The Labor Party supports welfare fraud, and it does it in two ways. Mr Sercombe interjectinghad a bit more substance than that. They support fraud in two ways. One is their past record in relation to welfare fraud, and everything they have said since then quite clearly indicates that they do not believe that welfare fraud should be a matter taken on by this government. They have articulated again today that they certainly will not do it in the unlikely event that they ever get back into power. Mr Zahra interjectingproblems down there. In relation to the question of funding for child care, we have allocated considerably greater funds than the Labor Party. Indeed, there will be $5.3 billion spent over the four years during the period 2002-03.

They originally said that they opposed the removal of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres but they did a little backflip that they did not want to tell people about and they now support it. From June 1996 to December 1999, around 22,000 additional long day care places have been funded by the government. As honourable members will be aware, this bill proposes to broaden the choice of child-care services for which the child-care benefit may be available to include in-home care. The more flexibility and choice in child care initiative will improve families’ ability to access and choose child care that meets their needs. It has been a long time coming. It was not delivered under the Labor Party. It is being delivered under this government. For example, shiftworkers, families working non-standard hours and those who have a sick child or live in rural and remote areas without access to care will particularly benefit from this measure. The choice of child-care services will be increased by making inhome care more accessible than it is at present. Indeed, 7,700 new in-home places will become available over the next four years. It is part of the $65.4 million more flexibility and choice in child care initiative under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy which was recently released by the government. I will go back to the question of welfare rorting. Despite what the member for Lilley said, the great bulk of the Australian people believe in giving people a fair go. But they are also acutely aware that every single dollar that goes out of the system to someone who is not entitled to it is a dollar that is not going to some place where it is deserved. The Labor Party can have a whispering campaign and say, ‘We actually don’t support any crackdown on welfare rorting.’ The simple fact is that it is designed to ensure that we have got the funds to do the sorts of things that are in this bill and that were in this year’s budget. The Labor Party thinks there is a magic pudding out there. Isn’t it a case of history repeating itself-the sort of rubbish that we have heard coming out of the mouths of the opposition leader and shadow ministers in the last week. Then we heard the shadow Treasurer bragging, ‘We’re going to have a bigger surplus than they have.’ The Labor Party have got to realise that it is now the year 2000. While they might have been able to pull the wool over people’s eyes in the eighties in their approach to government, there is now a very discerning electorate which is not just going to take at face value something that is said. It is amazing the number of people who are now talking about the fact that the only outcome of the last two months of this policy vacuum, apart from some unfunded promises that have no direction, is that taxes will rise. I refer honourable members to an article by Terry McCrann on Monday or Tuesday in the Herald Sun and, I presume, in some of the affiliate papers, about what the promises of the shadow Treasurer are going to mean. They are going to mean an increase in taxation. So the tax cuts that have been delivered by this government are going to be ripped away by the Australian Labor Party. During the 1998-99 financial year, for which the most recent figures are available, Centrelink compliance activities resulted in savings to the Australian taxpayer of around $20.9 million per week. That is not money that is put in a little pot. That is money that actually goes into providing funding for health, roads, schools, hospitals, welfare for those people who genuinely need it, child-care centres, and allowing regional and rural Australia to share in the opportunities that their metropolitan colleagues get. It is about having access to proper medical health services; it is about having access to radiotherapy services; it is about having access to medical specialists. 19328 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 The Australian Labor Party is still citycentric; it still has no understanding of the requirements in regional and rural Australia. That is why, at the national convention or conference farce, there was no mention of regional and rural Australia-no mention at all. Opposition member interjectingno idea how life operates outside Melbourne. Indeed, I am very surprised that the member interjects in relation to health, because under the federal budgetMr Zahra interjectinginterjecting. Maybe he does not want radiotherapy services in Gippsland. If you do not want a radiotherapy service in Gippsland, say so now. You don’t? You are nodding your head-you do not want it. All right, I will let your constituents know that when you were asked the question you nodded your head; you do not want a radiotherapy service. All right, we will remember that. The difficulty is that when you have people who, for example, have to travel 200 or 300 kilometres to get radiotherapy services, it is not just the person involved, it is their families, it is their workplaces, it is the cost, it is getting out of the car and vomiting five times on the side of the road before you get home after radiotherapy services. The honourable members on the other side laugh about this and interject about it. Well, I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the people who have pulled over on the side of the road travelling from Geelong to Ballarat or Geelong to Horsham do not think this is funny. This is about taking money and putting it where it is required. Cracking down on welfare rorting is not about putting money into a little bag; it is about making sure we have got the funds to provide decent services in regional and rural Australia. Indeed, in my own electorate some $253,000 a fortnight is being put back into the public purse where it can be properly utilised. It is not about taking money away from those who do not deserve to get it taken away; it is about those who are taking money out of the pockets of their fellow Australians by abusing a system that is designed to assist people in need. I heard some very interesting comments before about welfare policy. It is very interesting to look back in history and see who has been responsible for major reform in this country. Indeed, as the member for Hinkler will know and greatly supports, it was the government that commissioned the McClure report to see how we were going to take this country forward in terms of the welfare system in the new millennium. Indeed, as you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, what has come out of that, the broad thrust of the recommendations, has been supported by the government. The government will now look at it in great detail and will make announcements in due course. This is not just one isolated instance of the government taking the lead in relation to welfare reform. Indeed, the coalition and its political antecedents have been responsible for most of the major reforms in this country. I can go back to Alfred Deakin in 1908 who was the first to introduce an old age and invalid pension. The years of the Menzies government were a period of concerted, ongoing social reform. The Child Endowment Act was introduced, war pensions were made exempt under the income test, the restrictions on the eligibility of Aboriginal people for special benefits were removed, and a pensioner medical and free medicines program was introduced. The three coalition governments of Holt, Gorton and McMahon produced a number of additional important social reforms. These included: assistance for deserted wives, the introduction of the tapered means test, assistance for Meals on Wheels, the introduction of",110,Representatives Main Committee

Between 1975 and 1983 the Fraser government was responsible for some of the most important social security reforms seen since Federation. The most notable of these was the replacement of child endowment with a family allowance system. Other reforms included: the automatic indexation of pensions, the abolition of state and gift duties, replacing the means test on pensions with a simpler income test, and the introduction of a new pensioner housing scheme. Indeed, if you look at what has happened under this government in just a short time you will again see that policy reform has taken place-sensible, targeted reform; long-term reform, not dictated to by special interest groups.

230,Mr Ronaldson,"In the very short time that is left, I want to speak about the youth19330 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 responding, at least in part, to some of the comments made by my colleague the member for Ballarat. The truth is that the people of Ballarat have had a lot of time to get used to what local Liberal parliamentary representation means. That is why at the last state election they voted overwhelmingly Labor. They have had Ronno for so long over there that they know better than any other constituency in Australia just what local Liberal representation meansthat is, getting nothing from the government; getting pathetic, fawning, weak representationand they have decided they are going to do better and that they deserve better. That is why the good people of Ballarat now have six state Labor MPs. This is why the member for Ballarat is so rattled. He knows the Labor Party has preselected an outstanding Labor candidate in Cathy King. He knows that, for the first time, he has a real fight on his hands and he knows it is a fight that he cannot win. When the member for Ballarat said that he had only a small amount of time left, he was not just talking about the 50 seconds or so he had left in the debate; he was talking about the small amount of time he has left in this place. As I have said to him before: Cathy King, Labor candidate for Ballarat, is coming for him and she has his measure already. Having dealt with that, I will now deal with the provisions of the Family and Community Services (2000 Budget and Related Measures) Bill 2000 which we are here to discuss. When it comes to talking about families, we hear a lot of rhetoric from the government. I always find that the actions of the government speak far more eloquently about their real commitment to people in rural and regional Australia and, in the context of this debate, particularly families in rural and regional Australia. In the time that I have this morning, I want to speak in particular about dairy families in my constituency of McMillan. I know there has been a lot of talk about the $1.8 billion dairy restructure package which has been announced by the Howard government. Whilst we in the Labor Party had some concerns about the size of the package, particularly the size of the dairy regional communities program, we did not act to stop this package going through because we did not want to deny those dairying families any money that might be coming to them by way of compensation for the impact of dairy deregulation. I have some concerns about the way that this program has been administered. Recently, I received some correspondence from Warragul Regional Newspapers in the centre of my constituency. Basically, they service the West Gippsland part of my electorate. They sent me a copy of a letter, which they sent to the Dairy Deregulation Authority, for my attention and action. It is addressed to Mr Patrick Musgrave, the Chairman of the Dairy Deregulation Authority. I will read it to the Main Committee because I think it is important that people are aware of the very real concerns we have about the way that the dairy restructure package has been organised. This is what Brian Hopkins, Managing Director, Warrugal Regional Newspapers, writes-and I think it is important for us to reflect on his comments. He says: Dear Mr Musgrave, To our dismay, we understand there is no specific press advertising targeting major dairying areas such as Warrugal and West Gippsland in Victoria. It appears the Victorian coverage will be the Weekly Times which will carry the main thrust of the communication, supported by press advertising in the Mildura Sunraysia Daily (fruit and sheep area), the Ballarat Courier (urban/industrial/sheep/crops), Bendigo Advertiser (urban/industrial/sheep/crops), Geelong Advertiser (urban/industrial/sheep/grapes), Warrnambool Standard (urban/sheep/beef/ dairying), Shepparton News (urban/fruit/dairying), Albury Border Mail (urban/beef/sheep), Horsham Wimmera Mail Times (urban/sheep/crops), Bairnsdale Advertiser (urban/tourism/beef/sheep/small dairying), and Latrobe Valley Express-",113,Representatives Main Committee
231,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (10.39 A.m.),"I cannot let the opportunity go by withoutThursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19331 which is also in my constituency, but he makes the point in brackets ‘industrial’. Mr Hopkins goes on: I understand the argument for these centres is based on them being population centres, into which dairy farmers may have retired. Dairy farmers generally tend to retire in the township that serviced their farm. Hence, a West Gippsland dairy farmer would most likely retire to Warrugal ... not Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Mildura, Horsham, Albury et cetera. I think the campaign is a farce and makes a mockery of the government’s stated policy of “servicing regional Australia”. I hope the campaign “works” for the sake of dairy farmers, and our newspaper has certainly tried to assist through publishing appropriate editorial. However, I fear it may fail. Yours faithfully, Mr Hopkins has made a very good point. As today is the last day that people can apply for assistance under the dairy adjustment package, it is important for us to note his very sensible criticism of the government’s approach to this issue. The West Gippsland district in my constituency is probably one of the richest dairying areas not just in Victoria but in Australia. It really does speak volumes for the competence of those people administering this program that the West Gippsland district has received no specific advertising at all in relation to encouraging people to take up this program which the government has put in place to support people and compensate them for the substantial and significant changes they are going to experience as a result of dairy deregulation. I encourage the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry as strongly as I can to consider targeting a special campaign for the farmers in the West Gippsland district to make sure that they are aware of what is available to them in assistance from the dairy adjustment package. He should consider, as part of that campaign, putting at least a small amount of money into advertising in the Warragul Gazette and the West Gippsland Trader, which are well-read local newspapers in that area, to make sure that all of the people who could benefit from this program are, at the very least, aware of the program so that they might apply and have their application considered on its merits. I sincerely hope that the minister takes up this appeal on behalf of the people who are dairy farmers in West Gippsland in my constituency. On dairy deregulation again, I will take a minute or so to deal with another matter which affects families in my constituency. the bill before the House is the Family and Community Services (2000 Budget and Related Measures) Bill 2000 and he should direct his comments to that bill. families who are not dairy families. They deal with all families in Australia, which includes dairy families-those people who draw an income from the dairy industry. That is why my remarks thus far have concerned those who make up a great many thousands of people in my constituency. Another issue that has affected these people has been the closure of the Bonlac dairy processing plant in Drouin in West Gippsland in my constituency. Some comments have been made by Bonlac’s chairman, Bill Hill. In the Warragul Gazette on 25 July this year, he said: The closure of Drouin’s Bonlac plant is not the result of dairy deregulation ...",114,Representatives Main Committee
232,Mr Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),I remind the member for McMillan that,115,Representatives Main Committee
233,Mr Zahra,"I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. The provisions of the bill do not deal with just19332 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 I have to say this is not consistent with a letter which he sent me on 28 April. In relation to the announcement to close not just the Bonlac plant but also two other plants in Australia he says: Both announcements are significant steps in ensuring that our Company is positioned in the best possible way to meet the challenges ahead as the Australian dairy industry deregulates ... It is probably as clear as that, but I did not want to let it go unremarked. It is pretty much an open-and-shut case. That is exactly why that campaign which the government has initiated to try and draw the attention of dairying communities towards the dairy adjustment package it has announced needs to be targeted to West Gippsland. Not only do they have a very large community dependent on the dairy industry for their main source of income but they have also seen the closure of a dairy processing plant has put some 170 people out of work. Once again, I call on the minister to deal urgently with that issue and respond as quickly as he can to my call for him to make sure that people in West Gippsland are aware of the assistance offered through the dairy adjustment package and to introduce some advertising and a campaign to make sure that the people of West Gippsland do not miss out as a result of the government’s incompetence in not putting advertisements in the Warragul Gazette or the West Gippsland Trader. Another issue, which is important to families, and to the community more generally, is that of domestic violence and, in particular, assisting men to get help in terms of adjusting violent behaviour they may have demonstrated. There has been a fantastic program in my constituency called the Men’s SHED project. SHED stands for self help ending domestics. This has been a fantastic project headed up by Chris Laming who has been the so-called SHED coordinator on behalf of the La Trobe Community Health Service. I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Customs who has carriage of this issue for the federal government and appealed to her to provide assistance to this group which is now experiencing difficulties in getting funding. I wrote to the minister on 2 March this year. I made the point in my correspondence that the Men’s SHED project is a great community based program which aims to address the incidence of men’s violence in Gippsland. This project uses a holistic approach to prevention of family violence and the promotion of the well-being of women and children in the local community. In my view it is an enormously successful program that for the last six years has used a collaborative interagency approach to family violence, an approach that is now being adopted elsewhere, which is something we can be very proud of. It is my view that preventive programs such as these not only generate very good social outcomes in regional communities such as my own but also prove to be extremely cost effective in the long term. It was on that basis that I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Customs and asked her to see if she could find a way for the Commonwealth to fund this important initiative to keep the good work going that the Men’s SHED project has been doing in my constituency. Unfortunately, I received a letter back from the Minister for Justice and Customs on 1 June where she advises the following: I note that the Men’s SHED Project is a worthwhile group and encourage them to continue with their work. However, the Federal Government is not able to provide general support funding for community groups such as the Men’s SHED project. She goes on to say: The Federal Government must give priority to programs that introduce innovation and have a clear relationship to crime prevention outcomes. I could hardly think of a program which gives more priority to innovation and to crime prevention outcomes than the Men’s SHED project. This is a great example of the Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19333 government being strong on rhetoric when it comes to supporting families and women, in particular, who are victims of domestic violence and those men who are trying to get away from domestic violence behaviour. Whilst the government are big on the rhetoric, when it comes to actually investing in programs which are about changing that type of behaviour they are very short on action. This letter demonstrates that. In the time that I have remaining, I want to speak briefly about Labor’s approach to family and community services, as has already been articulated very eloquently by my colleague and friend the member for Lilley. It can be best summarised in just a few words: Labor believes there should be a new front end to the social safety net, one that helps families from the start rather than just protecting them when they fall. It was only three or four weeks ago that the member for Lilley was in my constituency and we met with the program managers and staff of several community based organisations which deal with family and community services. We talked about the importance of putting government resources and priorities at the front of family assistance, and this was something which resonated a great deal with those people who are actually at the front line assisting families, in either community groups or who have roles within programs and organisations. People are sick of government money being spent only after a disaster has happened rather than early on when you can actually prevent a lot of the difficulties which families get into from happening-long before any difficult situation arises. That is why I support the Labor Party’s commitment to a national early assistance strategy which is a key element of Labor’s approach to family and community services. What it is all about is directing resources and effort to families when children are first born. We recognise that, by assisting parents to develop their skills to identify problems earlier rather than later and providing them with upgraded community information and resources, a national early assistance strategy would improve the circumstances of all Australian children. We on our side of politics are sincere when we say that we are about providing support for families to develop stronger resilience in dealing with the problems that they invariably face as they develop. What we are about is providing Australian families, which are the building blocks of the Australian community, with the strength and support that they need to help them get through the difficult times ahead. We are not just about being strong on what, in American political parlance, is called ‘family values’, which is all about pandering to religious rites as opposed to doing something constructive to support Australian families. On our side of politics we are very proud of our commitment to help families, rather than just saying that we are pro family. So let me make that point whilst I am on my feet today. When we were in my constituency, the member for Lilley and I met with people from various institutions, and some of those institutions are definitely worth mentioning and recording in the Hansard today. The good work done by the Cardinia Family Day Care group, which is run by the Cardinia Shire in the western end of my constituency, is a tribute to the hard work done by the program coordinator and all of her staff at Pakenham. Pakenham is a rapidly growing part of my constituency, which is forecast to grow by about 5,000 families over the next five years. That is a massive growth for a town that has around 10,000 people in it at this point. So that service, which is very professionally run and administered, provides an invaluable service to a group of people which is growing at an extremely rapid rate in that part of my constituency. Similarly, Parentzone in Morwell in my constituency provides parenting resource information to people right across the Gippsland region-from West Gippsland through to Mallacoota, to the border between NSW and eastern Victoria. They do a mighty job getting around a very large area of Australia and providing a level of support to parenting organisations and to parents directly. That support is aimed at improving the level of 19334 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 parenting skills in our community and providing support for families as they develop throughout their lives as parents-mothers and fathers. I commend the work which is done by Parentzone. A group that I should not fail to mention because it is made up of truly outstanding people who are leaders in their areas is the WECAN organisation in Warragul. The acronym stands for West Gippsland Early Assistance Program for Children with Additional Needs, and the organisation provides support for children and families with additional needs. The leadership and the committee of WECAN is an excellent model of how other organisations should be structured, and their commitment and hard work should be acknowledged by this chamber and by the people who make up our community in the McMillan electorate. Having said all that, let me conclude my remarks by saying how strongly supportive I am of Labor’s approach to family and community services. We offer the only genuine approach to family and community services, and I think that people in my constituency understand that. They certainly understand it more easily now, since they had the opportunity to speak to Wayne Swan, the shadow minister for family and services, during his recent visit to my constituency. I welcome Labor’s genuine approach to this policy issue. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.59 a.m.)-The Family and Community Services (2000 Budget and Related Measures) Bill 2000 does absolutely nothing to help ordinary Australians or their families. This legislation will definitely make it easier for the children of families that own farms and businesses, who are asset rich, but it will do nothing to make it easier for the children of Australian workers. In this legislation the government is increasing the asset exemption from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. This means that it will be much easier if you have got money: you will get more. And if you do not have it, things stay the same. So while the government is making it easier for the children of asset rich families to receive youth allowance, it has introduced a zero tolerance policy on Centrelink overpayments, has refused to exempt caravan park residents from paying the GST on their site rentals, has failed to deliver a $1,000 bonus to all Australians over 60 and is forcing unemployed Australians to pass the most draconian tests to receive a payment from Centrelink. And if these people make a mistake, they are punishedthey are breached, they are given less money to live on-and they still have to pass the same tests with less money to use for the job search that is often required with these tests. What this is about is a government that looks after its own, a government that rewards people if they have money, people that are advantaged, and punishes people that have to struggle, people that do not have money and are disadvantaged in some way. It is a government that will ensure absolutely that those that have money, those that have assets, that have wealth, have knowledge, will get more and those that do not will get less. Nothing demonstrates this more than what happened in the recent savings bonus debacle, where very few people in Australia, very few pensioners, received the money that they thought they would. My office, like the offices of most members of this House, was inundated with calls from people that did not receive the $1,000 bonus. In fact, they received much less than that. average does not reflect the amount that was paid to people in my area, which is not a wealthy area. Once again it is rewarding the people that have money at the expense of those that do not. The Prime Minister was not really up front with the Australian people before the election. I have only to refer to an interview he did with Howard Sattler on 22 August 1998. In that interview, the Prime Minister said:",115,Representatives Main Committee
234,Mr Neville,The average was $670.,118,Representatives Main Committee
235,Ms Hall,"Whilst there may have been average of $600-odd, that is not $1,000, and thatThursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19335 You get $1,000 bonus for all people over the age of 60. misleading. I had people coming into my office saying, ‘Why haven’t I got my $1,000?’ What does the Prime Minister say? He says, ‘Well, we did not really promise you that.’ And if you look then at the requirements to receive this $1,000, you will see how this government is rewarding people that have money. The people that got $1,000 were the people that got $1,000 interest. The people that got nothing were the people that had absolutely no moneythe people that battle, the people that really fight from week to week to put food on their table, the people that live in caravan parks, that have to pay rent. But I will talk more about that a little later. Like many others on our side of the House-and I am sure it happened on your side too-I received letters from pensioners living in my electorate. A number of them received the $1 and sent it back to the Prime Minister. There were others, like Irene, who took it a little further. Irene wrote to the Prime Minister. She registered her letter and sent it here to Parliament House. She also gave me a copy of her letter. She was one of the lucky ones: she did not get $1; she got $5. I will read a little of her letter. She says: I am sending you this $5 postal note from the Senior Pensions Scheme back to you thinking & hoping that it may be better off in your pocketthan in mine. She goes on to say: I am only an old aged pensioner & have nothing. She has nothing, and Mr Howard’s reward to her was $5. Irene made her postal note out in favour of John Howard. In her letter she also says: You will probably have a good laugh at this letter but all I have done is cry to think I could be so insulted ... She then writes ‘ENJOY’. My question to the Prime Minister is: what is he going to do with this $5-this measly $5 that he gave to Irene? Irene finishes her letter by saying that she hopes Mr Howard is not Prime Minister after the next election. My question is: will the Prime Minister be putting this $5 in his election fund for the next election? The postal note is not made out in favour of the government; it is made out in favour of John Howard. What is he going to do with this $5? Is he going to take this $5, this measly pittance he gave to this poor pensioner, and use it to help himself get back into power? I certainly hope not. It is just not good enough. the side to try to increase his resources. The whole point is that this was a very bad exercise by the government. It really disadvantaged those people who needed help. If the government were going to help people, if the government were going to give money to people, they should have helped those in the greatest need. Instead, this exacerbated their need and made them feel worthless. I was also visited by another lady who received $11. The reason I am referring to Gloria Fitzgerald and Arthur Fitzgerald is that they each received $11. Gloria was sitting with me in my office, and she was near to tears. She said, ‘This makes me feel like a second-class citizen. I feel dirty. It is as if the government does not even think I am human.’ They were her words. I wrote them down as she said them to me. I do not think the government can be proud of this exercise. It has caused great dissension within groups of people. There are friends who are not talking to friends. The fact is that, even",118,Representatives Main Committee

239,Ms Hall,"As the member for Werriwa said, he has probably been having a little bet on19336 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 when the payments were made, there were major errors. Many people who should have received payments did not, and I am fearful for those people who did receive payments and should not have. Old figures were used, and the government refused to let Centrelink revisit the issue. It took them a month to admit there had been a mistake. During that month, a lot of people suffered hardship and heartache. My office is working with volunteers who come into the office to do easytax, and the way that it had to be addressed was through the tax office. The volunteers working through my office saw a number of these pensioners who had to submit a tax return. We had one 93-yearold woman who had never had a tax file number in her life, and we had to help her apply for a tax file number so that she could access the savings bonus. If a mistake is made, a government should admit it and it should fix it up quickly. It should not allow the angst that came out of this mistake with the savings bonus to continue because it caused real hardship to a number of very vulnerable people. That advice I am giving is given with the best intentions. The other group of people who are affected very badly, and a lot of them fit into this pension category, are the people who live in caravan parks. Mr Deputy Speaker, as the member for Page you must know how much it has impacted on these people. These are people who have been forced to pay the GST on their rental, and the majority of them are either pensioners or self-funded retirees. They have chosen that lifestyle because it offers them security and it offers them a communal lifestyle. They are people who actually own their own homes. I always tend to use the example of the Park at Redhead-that is in fact the name of the park. It is a residential park where everyone is over 55 years of age. They all own their own homes. At the same time the GST was introduced, the residents had a rental increase. So, come 1 July, they had a rental increase of $18 a week. Only a very small percentage of those people could access an increase in their rental allowance. As we all know, only three per cent of 161,000 Australians who live in residential and caravan parks actually got the $1,000 savings bonus. So here we have an extremely disadvantaged group of people, the majority of whom are pensioners and rely on income support from Centrelink, who have not received any savings bonus, who have had an increase in rent and have had the GST placed on their rent. And because the only residents eligible for an increase in rental assistance are those receiving the maximum rent assistance, most of them did not even get the rent assistance. My heart bleeds for these people. We have got a government that just does not listen, that will not listen, to the people who are most disadvantaged in our community. These people need a government to protect them. They do not need a government that is going to attack them. They need a government that understands that they have got needs; that they are people, not pieces of dirt. They need a government that understands that, like somebody that lives in Vaucluse, or maybe in Valentine in my own electorate and has been lucky enough to save some money, these people need to be treated with respect too and given the same opportunity as those people that have money. The final issue that I would like to spend a tiny bit of time on relates to the requirements that are being placed on some job seekers in order to access their Centrelink payments. About a month ago we heard about job seekers being told that they had to apply for jobs on the Olympic sites. For those of you that do not know, the Shortland electorate takes in part of the Central Coast of New South Wales and the southernmost part of Newcastle. Centrelink, in their wisdom, deemed that people who lived in that area should try to access jobs at the Olympics. One of these people, Mr Lyle Lambeth, who lives at Budgewoi, which Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19337 would be between an hour and a half to two hours-maybe 2½ hours in peak hour-from Sydney by car, was told by Centrelink in July 2000: Between now and October Centrelink requires you to: travel to find work attend a Centrelink labour market information seminar target at least 50 per cent of your job seeking activities to Olympic jobs or Olympics related industries ... I thought I would touch on this matter because Mr Lambeth wrote me an excellent letter. In that letter he pointed out that he would have to get out of bed at 3.15 a.m., eat, dress and leave by 3.45 a.m. and walk to the bus stop by 3.55 a.m. He would arrive at Wyong station on the bus by 4.50 a.m. and then the train would leave at 5 a.m. He would arrive at the Olympic site at 6.50 a.m. and walk there, which would take 10 minutes. Total travelling time would be three hours and 45 minutes. All up, including the return travel at the end of the day, there would be about 7½ hours travel a day. He said that would give him very little time to do anything but sleep, travel to work and work. He said that his uncle, who was a prisoner of war on the Burma railways, had more time to do this. The cost would be $4 for a bus ticket, $59 for the train ticket, and his total costs were $94 a week. On an average wage of about $450 a week, that does not leave much for him to take home. If he drove his car, it would be a little quicker but it would cost him about $150 a week. The really interesting point is that not only is it going to cost a lot and take him a long time, but this gentleman is a 54-year-old carpenter who spent 20 years of his working life supervising on building sites. He has got 20 per cent disability from a back injury. In 1998, he was diagnosed with bowel cancer and underwent surgery to have it removed. He was back working again after three months. He has an excellent work history. He has even supervised the government’s Work for the Dole programs. He said to me that some of the requirements there were very draconian and that the government really did not understand the conditions of those people who are involved in Work for the Dole programs. During the time that he has been working, in January he was again diagnosed with bowel cancer. He has had more surgery and is currently having chemotherapy. He worked for four days a week while he was having chemotherapy, but just recently he has had to stop. What does he get from Centrelink? Here is a man with one of the best work histories that a person could possibly have, working in this industry, who has gone from job to job to job. He has met every requirement and has only used income support from Centrelink when he absolutely needed to. He has been undergoing chemotherapy. He has given his all and has always worked. He even supervised the government’s Work for the Dole programs. He has been given a letter telling him that, unless he travels to Sydney on a daily basis, he will not be getting any income support. Luckily for Mr Lambeth, his doctor gave him a doctor’s certificate and he does not have to look for work until the 30th of this month. This is a heartless government. Community Services should be used to provide community services and to support people. This government uses it to attack people, and to attack the most vulnerable in our society. Family and Community Services (2000 Budget and Related Measures) Bill 2000 but I found the presentation by the previous speaker, the member for Shortland, offensive. I do not think she addressed the real facts.

240,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.19 A.m.),"I was not going to speak in this debate on the19338 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 I would like to examine the savings bonus scheme that the honourable member spoke about. Let us go back to first principles. The savings bonus scheme was never intended to be a gift or a grant. That was made perfectly and totally clear from the outset of the scheme. It was meant to compensate pensioners by way of $1,000 and self-funded retirees by way of up to $3,000 for the loss of savings brought about by the inflationary effect of the introduction of the GST, mainly on their savings and investments. If we look at their incomes, the government promised a four per cent increase in pensions, which it has honoured. It said that if the CPI figures indicated that there was not a two per cent cushion above the real rate of inflation, it would top that up to the two per cent. So on the income side the government has honoured its promise. Right from the outset, from the very first day that this scheme was announced in the government’s package, it said that it was based on people’s savings and investments. In the case of pensioners, that could be savings in their building society or bank savings accounts. It could be a small annuity, an overseas pension, a superannuation policy-either put together by the pensioner at some earlier stage or from some institution for which they may have worked for some time-and it could be on small investments. It was very clear. It was spelt out in minute detail. It was a savings bonus. It was never, ever said to be a grant or a gift. With respect to the generality of one interview with the Prime Minister, the honourable member did not give the full quote. The Prime Minister was speaking in terms of the actual savings bonus. He was not, in the course of that interview, ranging widely. He was talking about the savings bonus. It could be inferred quite clearly that he was saying, ‘In the context of what I’m talking about, you’ll all get $1,000.’ He said that. But the honourable member did not bother to mention the preamble to what he was talking about. Leaving that aside, yes, some people did have that impression. I ask the honourable member whether she informed her constituents, in newsletters or press releases, of their entitlements-quite apart from the politics of it, after the election had been won and this was going to be implemented. When I was in opposition I always adopted the practice of working with the government of the day. You work with their programs. They have won the election; they have implemented their programs; and you try to get the best for your constituents within that program. SoI ask whether the honourable member really went out of her way to inform her constituents of their entitlements. In fact, I have had the opposite effect in my office. I have had people come to me and say, ‘I’ve only got this small investment which returns $1,200 a year, but I’ve just received $1,000. AmI entitled to it?’ You can pick a group of people who have not understood the program or who are in very difficult financial circumstances, or people-and I am not being pejorative-who have not kept Centrelink up to date about their earnings on a year to year basis. I have found several of these. The government has made a facility, as honourable members will know, for people to declare incomes and become eligible for the savings bonus. But some people clearly have not informed Centrelink of some ancillary income that they had been receiving. Because they have not, their automatic eligibility was not known to Centrelink. When you look at all those things, there has been no attempt to cheat or treat pensioners badly. That is quite wrong. Every person got a booklet in the post. It was very comprehensive and it spelt this out in intimate detail. In all our electorate offices we had information sheets explaining every program in the GST and the new tax package agenda. In the election document, again it was spelt out very clearly. And to say that the government has made some massive breach of faith as a result of the generality of one interview by the Prime Minister when he was talking in terms of the savings bonus is simply ludicrous, and it treats the public Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19339 of Australia and the pensioners of Australia as dolts. I am not prepared to be part of that. I think they are intelligent, sensible people, and those who read the documentation would have been very clear about that. Members of parliament had a responsibility to make sure in their newsletters and in their offices that people were well informed and were getting their full entitlements. SoI reject out of hand that sort of thing. I find offensive the idea that the Prime Minister would use the money in an election campaign or go down to the TAB. Even though it may not have been meant in a pejorative sense against the Prime Minister, the mere fact that you would say a thing like that is puerile. It lessens the standard of debate in this place and, to my way of thinking, it victimises pensioners and makes them a tool for political exploitation. It does that rather than come to grips with the problems they might have in your electorate office to get them their full entitlements. The other thing I would like to talk about is the matter of the GST for long-term residents of caravan parks and trailer home parks. The member made some extraordinarily sweeping statements there. For example, she said their rent had gone up $18 a week. Is she suggesting that that was as a result of the five per cent? If you take five per cent as a reverse fraction, it would mean they are paying rent of $360 a week. That is ludicrous. It may well be that the people in a particular caravan park did put up the rent by $18, but it was certainly not as a result of the five per cent GST. And if they did not put it up with good reason, I would ask the honourable member why she has not brought that to the attention of the ACCC, because clearly that was exploitation. If the case she quoted to us was on a weekly basis and it was purported to be as a result of a five per cent GST, then those people were exploited and I ask her what she did about bringing that to the attention of the ACCC. I certainly would. I would have no compunction about it, no compunction at all. I am not here to defend anyone who wants to exploit pensioners, not for a moment. If you step back and look at the situation of caravan parks, right from the outset of the scheme the government said that with that type of accommodation, with rental accommodation, there would be no GST charged but the proprietor would not be able to retrieve their GST inputs. That was made clear from the outset. No-one was misled about that. However, anyone with a knowledge of economics would know that over a period of time the owner of that particular caravan park, in not charging a GST yet having expenses such as mowing, asphalting, electrical repairs, hot water, plumbing, all those sorts of things that occur in a caravan park or a trailer home park, would, through rent, eventually pass on those costs to the tenants. That is obvious. It happened before the GST and it will happen after the GST. The government said, in allowing caravan park owners to charge a five per cent GST, that the owners could retrieve their inputs, but that in retrieving their inputs the pressure on further increases in rent would be minimised. Anyone who really wants to have a look at the economics of this in an honest way would know that was minimised. It is a pity that some modelling was not done on the caravan parks. There was modelling done on boarding houses which clearly showed that if you accepted the option of no GST and no inputs, although you got your rent a bit cheaper up front, over time you paid more. If you took the five per cent model, certainly you paid a little bit more up front but, over time, it minimised to an almost infinitesimal fraction. They are the sorts of things we should be looking for for these people. I understand people who are in caravan parks and trailer homes, in many instances, have been the deprived people of this society. I do not want to see them exploited, but to use them as some sort of victims in a pious, sanctimonious, obsequious attack on the government does the opposition no credit, nor does it help the pensioners. 19340 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I feel intense and angry about this. It does not elevate this debate to where it should be. Sure, there will be criticisms of some aspects of the savings bonus scheme and some aspects of the caravan park and trailer homes GST issue, but they could have been worked through in a constructive way to get a good outcome for people, rather than turned into a political argy-bargy. I am not prepared to do that. I try to keep the people in my electorate well informed and I find that, if you do, they are sensible-they are intelligent. They may not always like the outcome, but they will respond if they are treated properly. Keep them in the dark and treat them badly and you get that response back. I think the opposition can play a better role in this thing. If they are really concerned about those pensioners and getting them the entitlements, not just using them as victims in a political debate, then they should do something about it. and he always speaks with deep conviction, but I think in this case he is being a bit unfair to the member for Shortland. She seemed to be raising legitimate concerns placed in writing from her constituents. The member for Hinkler commenced his remarks by saying that it is not right to pick out a couple of victims and blame the federal government. I would say to the member for Hinkler, particularly when it comes to elderly Australians, a single victim is one too many. I can assure the member for Hinkler there is a substantial amount of confusion and distress among elderly Australians concerning the savings bonus. I too believe elderly Australians are intelligent and aware of their entitlements, but it is also true that they worry about their pensions. They worry about their entitlements during a time of economic change, such as the GST. Some of the information that has been sent out to them, quite frankly, is hard to follow. I have looked at the forms and found that they are complex. government member, that he should have a look at these forms and talk to the people who run the public relations for the government in these campaigns to see if there is a way of simplifying this information, because while elderly Australians have a keen awareness of their entitlements; they do worry when they get official material in the mail. When they see a form that is complex and confusing, of course they get distressed and of course they go to their member of parliament and raise these concerns. I have had them come to my office in the seat of Werriwa and these are genuine people genuinely concerned about their entitlements and their rights under this savings bonus. They find some of the material very confusing. If the member for Shortland has distressed elderly citizens in her electorate, she is entitled to bring their situation before the parliament and raise that as a matter of public interest. I say that a single victim in this case is one too many. If there is one confused and distressed elderly Australian, it is one too many and we should do something about it. The member could go back to the government communications people and have a look at these forms. He might find there could have been a simpler way of explaining this to provide more information simply expressed for elderly Australians. That would have been the right thing to do. It might just be a communication problem. There might be something in the detail that needs to be corrected, but I do not think we should doubt the sincerity of the member for Shortland in bringing these matters before the House of Representatives. With other members in this debate, I want to raise the general issue of welfare reform. The whole question of Australia’s welfare system is made topical by the release yesterday of the excellent report by the McClure committee entitled Participation support for a more equitable society. I join with the Leader of the Opposition in saying there are many good things in this report-many good things because they adopt Labor policy. It is a report that",121,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (11.32 A.m.),The member for Hinkler is an honourable person,124,Representatives Main Committee
242,Mr Neville,Let us make constructive criticisms.,124,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Latham,"This is a constructive criticism and I say to the member for Hinkler, as aThursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19341 combines the best of international practice with some of the quality thinking in the Australian political system. For instance, the report picks up the practice in Great Britain of introducing a common gateway for the assessment of the needs of welfare recipients. It picks up the practice in Britain of social entrepreneurial projects, where skilled people are making new connections, building partnerships and support in disadvantaged communities. They are combining the best of social practice with a capacity to take risks and bring entrepreneurial flair to the needs of disadvantaged communities. We had the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, in the House just two days ago saying, ‘Isn’t this outrageous that in the area of education policy Labor is picking up some of the best initiatives in Britain-the learning gateway program and the adoption of education action zones.’ Well, what is wrong with that? What is wrong with bringing some of the best of international thinking to some entrenched problems to try to find new solutions in the Australian context? So if Dr Kemp thought it was bad for the ALP to do that in education, he, for one, will be condemning this document in the cabinet because the McClure report picks up initiatives in Britain-the common gateway for assessing recipient need, and the programs that follow, and also the emphasis on social entrepreneurial projects. The minister, Dr Kemp, stands condemned for having such a narrow view of public policy. The report also picks up Kim Beazley’s wonderful proposals for improving the financial attractiveness of the transition from welfare to work. The idea of work bonuses, of trying to address the problem of high effective marginal tax rates are quality Labor ideas that are now reflected in the McClure report to the Howard government. I am strongly supportive of the report’s recommendations on mutual obligation. Some 12 months ago I raised the issue of the blow-out in the disability support pension-the fact that some 600,000 Australians have been placed on this passive, underfunded program. I raised my concern that the Howard government was using the disability support pension as a way of artificially lowering the unemployment rate, of moving people onto this program so they do not show up on the jobless figures. This issue seemed to trigger a reaction from the government that has led to this inquiry and now the report. I am pleased that McClure is recommending some serious and sensible policies with regard to mutual obligation. I believe there is a community expectation that single parents with teenage children-that is, children going to high school-would be required to look for work-that is, to set a good role model in the home, to value work and education in the home, to make sure that their children know that their best future in life lies in seeking jobs and skilling up their qualifications. There is a community expectation for that. And there was a survey that showed that single parents themselves believed that mutual obligation in that sense should apply to them. But it is important to understand that it cannot be just an obligation from the recipient. Single parents need improved child-care arrangements and a reversal of this government’s cuts. They need transport assistance, particularly in areas like ours in Western Sydney where private car ownership might not necessarily be strong or the public transport system effective. And they need training and skills programs to help them reconnect with the work force. The recommendations for single parents are sound and I believe reflect a sensible approach to the extension of mutual obligation. In the area of disability support pension, again McClure has got it right. He is saying that we should treat mildly disabled Australians seriously. We should back up 30 years of rhetoric that says, ‘Don’t write these people off, don’t stick them into passive, underfunded programs. Actually give them a chance to exercise their capacities to gain work, to be useful participants in our society. So don’t emphasise disability; emphasise the capacity that mildly disabled people have to work.’ McClure is recommending that mutual obligation be extended, through 19342 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 pilot schemes, to this area. I think that is right. For 30 years the rhetoric about helping disabled people has been a bit hollow because government has not backed it up with programs, has not backed it up with rehabilitation and training support. In my electorate of Werriwa there are several fine providers of assistance for the disabled community, but they are only able to cover a drop in the ocean in terms of the resources needed to get all mildly disabled Australians back into the labour force and active work. McClure also broadens the concept of mutual obligation beyond just welfare recipients and government. He is saying there should be a whole-of-community effort. It is almost like a policy of ‘all shoulders to the wheel’; that governments, welfare recipients, community organisations and corporate Australia need to do much more to provide worthwhile job opportunities for disadvantaged people. I have often raised in the House the fact that corporate Australia receives billions of dollars each year in industry assistance, sometimes called industry welfare. If we are to treat mutual obligation seriously, they have a responsibility to use that public money to provide improved job opportunities for disadvantaged Australians. In the case of disabled Australians, there is an acute need. Some nations have a scheme whereby there is an expectation that business needs to employ disabled people as a certain proportion of its work force. If they do not meet that proportion, they have to pay funds to government that are then channelled into training and support programs for the disabled. If the Howard government is serious about welfare reform, it should match that program; it should introduce those programs in this country. What we should be saying is that government needs to do more, communities need to do more, welfare recipients need to do more, but businesses also need to do more to help Australians to end the curse of long-term poverty and social exclusion. This needs to be a policy of all shoulders to the wheel. We need to impose mutual obligation on corporate Australia to make sure that they are providing worthwhile job opportunities for the most disadvantaged in our society. These are big issues that also have a philosophic underpinning. There is a bigger debate about the meaning of mutual obligation. I heard the former Victorian Premier Joan Kirner join this debate in Melbourne by making a few remarks a fortnight ago. She made comments that made me think very seriously about how these questions can be understood. She said that all women have the right to work and governments should assist this goal. Of course, that is true in its own right. She also said that all welfare recipients, particularly single mums, have the right to stay at home and governments should protect this right. I think this demonstrates that a rights-only agenda, an emphasis on universal rights without social responsibilities, starts to run into itself. How can you say that all women have the right to work and governments should support that, but all single mums have the right to stay at home and governments should support that as well? A rights-only agenda runs into itself, and in the end does not make a lot of sense in the social context. The rights of citizens are only worthwhile if they are matched by the responsibilities of citizens. To go down the rights-only agenda is actually quite a libertarian agenda. It is saying that people can be regarded as individuals only-individuals without a social context. It is an atomistic way of looking at society. I reject the rights-only agenda. I do not think it is a real Labor Party agenda. What the Labor Party has been about for 100 years is to say that rights are important but they need to be matched by social responsibilities, because it is only by people exercising their responsibilities that we end up with a cohesive society; that we end up with people connecting with each other, feeling morally obliged to do the right thing by other people; that we end up Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19343 with a society that is strong and cohesive. SoI support the agenda of rights plus responsibilities-an agenda of mutual responsibility, and this makes sense. A person can have all the money in the world but they are not free in our society if they cannot walk the streets at night with a sense of safety; if they cannot participate in society knowing that other citizens are going to be responsible for their own actions. A child is not free unless work and education are valued in the home because they will not have the best chance to realise their potential in life. SoI reject the view that rights, and rights alone, matter. It must be rights matched by social responsibilities. That is a socially cohesive or communitarian view of society. It is not a sort of left wing, libertarian agenda-libertarianism on steroids. I support the extension of mutual obligation under this report, and I look forward to the government taking its recommendations seriously. But, in the end, it is not so much the size of government spending that matters, it is the quality, and it is the whole-of-community effort to end the curse of long-term poverty. We often have a view in the public debate that government alone is responsible for these problems. Government alone is not responsible for the curse of social exclusion. It is an issue for all Australians, and we are all responsible. Whether it is a business manager, or people working in community organisations, or just plain households, and, of course, the work of government, we have all got to do a lot more. I believe that is the true meaning of mutual obligation. I am delighted that the McClure report at long last is bringing corporate Australia into the net of mutual obligation. This should not be a policy for beating up on the poor. The Minister for Employment Services has been condemned by his own side for some of this excessive rhetoric. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, often puts Mr Abbott down for use of language that clearly is trying to single out the poor and beat up on them in a political sense. We have to go beyond that narrow agenda and produce a whole-of-community response to poverty, and the McClure report is an excellent step in the right direction. As I said, it is not so much the size of government spending but the quality of the programs and the whole-of-community effort. I am always reminded of the debate that the British Labour Party used to have with the Thatcher government. They used to say, ‘You are cutting programs.’ In fact, the Thatcher government was doing what the Howard government is doing here: blowing out passive welfare programs. Spending was going up, because they were shoving people on to programs like the disability support pension as a way of driving down the official unemployment rate. The truth is that, under this Howard government, welfare spending is going up. But it is the wrong sort of spending. It is passive spending, putting people onto programs without a chance of getting training and job placement. In a political sense, if you are on the left of politics and you want results, you will condemn this government for putting people into passive areas and disenfranchising a whole group of Australians-for example, 600,000 on disability support pensions. If you are on the right of politics and you want value for money in the welfare dollar, you will condemn this government as well, because they are spending more and yet we know that long-term poverty and long-term unemployment are actually going up. The member for Lilley has produced some disturbing statistics about the number of young Australians who grow up in a household without work. There is no worse start in life than growing up in a household where work is not valued and where work is not the role model. My most distressing moment in public life was to talk to a school principal who said that when students come to him in careers counselling and are asked, ‘What are you going to do in life?’ they will say, ‘I am going to do what my dad does, I am going to do what my grandad 19344 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 has done, and that is that I will be on the dole.’ This is a social tragedy when people take that view and this reality is being played out in Australian homes. We need to do a lot better. This government should be condemned, because it is not getting results and value for money in the spending of the welfare dollar. I am glad that McClure has made these recommendations. I also support his emphasis on community development. In my electorate of Werriwa, in the poorer suburbs, the public housing estates, it is quite a paradox, because 90 per cent of the income comes from government. Ninety per cent of the assets and income in these suburbs comes from the public sector and only 10 per cent comes from the private sector. You often hear people say, ‘We don’t need market forces. We don’t need private enterprise.’ The big news in the poorest parts of my electorate is that we need 90 per cent of the suburb to function on private income and only 10 per cent from public, because only then will the suburb feel normal, that it is participating in the economy and gaining the same job opportunities and income potential as other Australians. The idea is to reverse the batting order: to go from 90 per cent to 10 per cent of public money and to go from 10 per cent to 90 per cent of private money. In that context, I always worry that maybe some of the recommendations about changing the payment system are really just reshuffling the deck. When 90 per cent of the suburb’s income comes from government, if you just reshuffle the way in which that money is paid into the suburb, maybe you are not getting the best result available. The real goal is to lift the proportion of private money and to get people into work. Often in these suburbs, the first task in welfare reform is a social task. It is to make the suburb normal. If you actually visit public housing estates and talk to the tenants, they will say, ‘My first priority is to make sure that I can walk down to the shops at night feeling safe or to know that the person next door is not the one breaking into my home.’ Their first priority is a social one-the social connections, the trust, the social capital between people, to get that right-and then to worry about the financial issues. Only when you live in a normal neighbourhood are you likely to think, ‘Hang on, I have a chance here to do some training and to get a job.’ McClure has put his recommendations about social development down at the back of the report, at item 5. I think they should be up at the front of the report, as item 1. The top priority is to rebuild communities, to rebuild social capital in this country, to make sure that people living in poorer areas feel part of a normal neighbourhood with normal connections and relationships between people. Again, I would reverse the batting order in this report and get the social issues up front. I am glad they are in the report, but they really should be the top priority. I was thrilled, though, to see that a project I have been working on in the public housing estate of Claymore in my electorate is featured at page 47 of the report as a role model for community partnerships and social integration. Claymore has been a great example and, through social entrepreneurial projects and a strategic role for government, this success can be spread throughout the country. McClure has set out a fine blueprint for addressing many issues from the adoption of international and domestic best practice, to the extension of mutual obligation, to the whole question of making communities strong and to making neighbours normal. But, again, as the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, it takes a government with a good heart to build on quality recommendations and turn them into decent social practice. We hear a lot of talk from the other side-and ‘Dubya’ does it in the US-on compassionate conservatism. Some people think that is a tautology, a direct contradiction in terms. If there is such a thing as compassionate conservatism, we have one guarantee in this country: it does not come from the Minister for Employment Services putting people down as job snobs; putting people down Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19345 with harsh rhetoric and an intensely political agenda. If that is compassionate conservatism, this government has got a long way to go. WhatI prefer, of course, is the thing that has worked well on our side of politics for 100 years, and that is social democracy: to treat people fairly, to build community partnerships and to make an effort throughout society to end the curse of poverty. That is what we have always been on about. I know for sure that if it were a Labor government introducing this report, the heart would be there to get it right. The Howard government is yet to be tested. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (11.51 a.m.)-In discussing the Family and Community Services (2000 Budget and Related Measures) Bill 2000, a number of people have had the opportunity to more broadly discuss welfare policy and issues concerning poverty. I will also try to address those matters. I might say, firstly, that I am following the member for Werriwa, who is always interesting in his general philosophical approach to these matters. Let me say that I also agree that we need to have an approach which goes beyond the individual and deals with communitarian issues. I have had occasion to commend the member for Werriwa for thinking about things along those lines. I do not always come to the same policy conclusions in relation to what needs to be done as he does, but that is something else. I think it is good that we should have some focus on the general goals, vision and philosophy that we have in these areas of policy. In that regard, obviously I, like others, welcome the McClure report as, I hope, stimulating national debate on these questions. I hope that we will have a genuine national debate on these issues and that we will not be subjected to some kind of pseudo debate, as often happens in politics. Having said all that, I want to make a comment about process in relation to this bill. The shadow minister made some very important comments, I thought, in relation to what is happening. I was a bit surprised that there was no second reading amendment, as far as I understand it, in relation to the bill and that the bill did not come up in the main chamber of the House but, rather, came up here in the Main Committee. It is quite clear that this is an issue of enormous importance, and I believe it should have come up in the main chamber. Earlier this week, I had occasion to move a consideration in detail stage amendment to a bill concerning education. I want to make it perfectly clear that, as an Independent, I am going to be moving consideration in detail stage amendments to these bills when I consider that they are inadequate. I have not had the opportunity to do so in relation to this particular bill, because we got the Bills Digest from the Parliamentary Library only a very short time ago. I think that, in providing members with the requisite information in relation to the background of these bills, we can do better than that. Rather than challenging the process in this particular case, I give notice that I intend to move consideration in detail stage amendments, perhaps with the support of Mr Andren, the other Independent, who has also, on occasions, had second reading amendments in relation to legislation of this kind. I notice the Minister for Community Services is in the chamber. Maybe he can answer some questions when he completes the debate. I am a bit confused about the impact on people of some provisions of the bill. Is the minister in a position to tell us what is going to happen to the spouses of Abstudy students? It appears that the bill gets rid of certain provisions that provided them with the dependent spouse allowance. It is not clear what is going to be available for them. I may be mistaken in this; even the Parliamentary Library is having difficulty sorting this out. Perhaps the minister or his advisers could sort it out. If an Abstudy student has a spouse-obviously the Abstudy student is not working-if the spouse is not working will the spouse be eligible for any kind of support from the government? If so, what kind of support? That is one issue. If 19346 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 they have children, I assume that they will be eligible for parenting allowance. How will that compare with the previous dependent spouse allowance in terms of the actual income that they would have received? I would like the answer to that question. If they do not have children, will they get any allowance at all in relation to this matter? I understand the government’s desire to make Austudy identical in terms of benefits. I do not agree with that. It assumes that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not in a disadvantaged situation in relation to education, which they are. It is not unfair, going to the principle of fairness, Minister, to give some specific provision, as we do in other areas of Commonwealth provisions for people of indigenous background, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I do not see why we have got rid of the Abstudy provisions. We might as well say that we do not really need Abstudy because we are going to give them the same as Austudy. What happened to the point that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are severely disadvantaged in terms of educational opportunities? What are we going to do about that in terms of the provisions for them? I am concerned that these provisions may have the unintended consequence of discouraging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from going into study. I believe that they need special support and provisions. In fact, some of them may actually end up more disadvantaged than Austudy people. Let us take an example of an Aboriginal young person who wants to go into a course of study in a remote area. If this were a typical Australian, a non-Aboriginal person, they would not be living in a remote area. Their spouse would be able to get some additional work to support the student. But, as the majority of Aboriginal people are living in these remote areas, it is very unlikely that their spouse will be able to get additional income. I do not think these measures have been thought through. There is a need to consider seriously what is happening in terms of income support for people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background so as to ensure an outcome. The outcome should be more of those people getting into education and being able to support themselves in the period when they are in education. The bill is very unclear about these provisions of support. I do not like the general principle, but I wanted some assurance from the minister in relation to what is happening in this case. I would have liked to have been able to say that, if Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are going to be disadvantaged by these changes, it would have been good for us to have had the opportunity in this parliament to move an amendment at the consideration in detail stage to prevent that happening. That is how I feel about it. The other provisions in the bill relate to youth allowances. Those provisions are primarily designed to have equity between people on youth allowances who are not studying and people on youth allowances who are studying. I do not see any problem with that. However, as far as the child-care issues are concerned, the shadow minister made a number of important points and this whole matter needs to be looked at. We do have serious problems with child care in this country in terms of the amount of child-care positions available, the affordability of child care for many families and a targeted program. It is all very well to say to people, when talking about the concept of mutual obligation, that they should go out and work, but if they have a number of children and they cannot afford child care what are they going to do? The provisions of child care in this country are still not good enough, especially for people living in poorer suburbs. I noticed that the minister’s new scheme is going to help boost private providers. That is all right. But, as the member of Werriwa was referring to, what about a scheme to ensure that the distribution of private providers is equitable in relation to the different suburbs? Why have more private providers in rich areas than in poor areas? We need child care in the poorer Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19347 areas, especially in our cities, such as in my electorate. We need them not just in my electorate but in all of that part of Melbourne and in the part of Sydney that your represent, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio. The government introduced an initiative for greater flexibility in choice in child care. Fair enough; there is nothing wrong with flexibility, Minister. But I am sure you would agree that, when we are seeking greater flexibility, we are seeking greater outcomes-not just flexibility for the sake of flexibility. We are looking at the attempt to get greater outcomes in this area. I would like to hear from the minister what outcomes he thinks he is achieving in relation to child care. Is he monitoring the situation with respect to different socioeconomic categories? How are child-care provisions being maintained or supported for those in poorer areas or income groups as compared to those in the richer income groups? I would not mind having a statement from the minister-even a ministerial statement in parliament. If he considers that he is doing some reasonable work in this area, why not get a statement that can be debated in relation to these issues? In the few minutes that are left to me I want to comment on the matter of the moment, as other speakers have done. I am referring to the McClure report and some of the provisions in relation to extending the principle of mutual obligation and the whole question of what is to be done with mature people who have not yet received the old age pension-mature workers or mature unemployed-and also the very difficult issue of the disabled and people who have mental health problems. I think it was one of the rare positive moments in the House yesterday when both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition said, ‘Let’s have a serious discussion about the McClure report,’ and I would welcome that. All too often we do not have serious debates. In my newly gained role as an Independent, I have been watching, for example, question time in parliament. I must say there is more hot air and personal attacks than there is anything else and very little attempt to answer questions. Even in the phrasing of questions, I think they are searching for information or at least for policy debates. So it was a rare moment in some respects and I was very happy to see that because I believe that this is what this House needs in this area. We need to have a debate not only about the McClure report but also about the whole general philosophy of welfare and provision for the poor and the disadvantaged. We need to address these issues in Australia. We have not been doing so. We have been sweeping them under the carpet. I think that we need to go to the fundamentals. We need to go to the philosophical issues and the general policy questions, then deal with the various recommendations from McClure to try and work out, if possible, a bipartisan approach but, if not that, at least an approach which deals with the fundamental question of poverty. Poverty in this country has increased in the last few years. The shadow minister was right to talk about how more children are now growing up in homes where both parents have not been employed for very long periods of time. Those parents are then setting a role model for their children. I have this situation in my electorate in some of the housing commission areas. I have seen this phenomenon. We tried to overcome this phenomenon through a concentration on encouraging the children of these families to stay at school and to look for career paths. I was very happy to report that in the last few years, from about 1989 to 1996, there was a dramatic increase in the number of students beginning year 7 and finishing year 12 in the high schools in the working-class areas of my electorate. But, in the last three years, this phenomenon has been reversed. We are now finding that the drop-out rate is higher than it was a few years ago. We had a situation where about 30 per cent or 35 per cent of children beginning high school at year 7 were finishing year 12. We went up to close to 80 per cent, and now we are 19348 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 dropping again. We have dropped in the last three years. This is very serious. It is not merely the lack of opportunities for the individual but, if you actually look at where those children come from, they come from families that are very poor and in which there is a tradition of unemployment for both the mother and father over a number of years. We need to concentrate on this phenomenon and we need action in this area-not merely the announcement of new bureaucratic arrangements but, while flexibility is one thing in programs, outcomes are what we are all interested in. I think that is true across the political parties: we want outcomes in these areas and we want value for money spent. We do not want money wasted in bureaucratic nonsense or in fighting between the federal and state governments or the federal and state bureaucracies, as so often happens. We want concrete outcomes. I would like to see more action in all these areas. (Time expired) member for Calwell for some of his comments. I hope to be able to cover some of those in my speech today. I also thank members on both sides of the House for their contributions, and particularly the member for Ballarat. It is slightly disappointing that many members opposite saw fit to talk about many other measures in the Family and Community Services (2000 Budget and Related Measures) Bill 2000, but there was certainly a hearty discussion on the McClure report and I think that bodes well for this parliament. However, I would like to return later to some of the comments made by the opposition and to speak now on the bill as it stands. This bill deals with measures announced in the 2000 budget. The measures in this bill are beneficial to Australians. The first of the measures exempts Abstudy payments from the social security income test. The measures remove the potential disadvantage of Abstudy social security couples compared with couples where both partners receive social security income support, because some Abstudy payments are assessed as income to determine the non-Abstudy partner’s social security entitlement. This measure will achieve equity in the treatment of Abstudy recipients and their partners with that of income support recipients. This measure will take effect from 1 January 2001. However, prior to this, ex gratia payments will be made available to protect any Abstudy social security couples currently disadvantaged. The estimated cost of this measure is quite small at $0.3 million each year. I reassure the member for Calwell that they certainly will not be disadvantaged. I take on board some of your genuine comments and if you would like one of the government advisers to give you some further information on that I would be happy to facilitate that. The second measure is an important one for families whose child-care needs fall outside the mainstream services. This bill extends the choice of child-care services for which childcare benefits can be claimed to include in-home care. I will also pick up some points that the member for Calwell mentioned as well. It is certainly not designed to provide differences in in-home care between poor areas and rich areas. Indeed, a lot of the evidence we have received on where child-care centres are located shows that there is not a strong correlation between more prosperous areas and less prosperous areas; it is where the demand is. With respect to the child-care benefit, I say to the member for Calwell that there have been quite substantial increases. What we are seeing in child-care centres, in all forms of Commonwealth funded centres, whether it is family day care, centre based care or after hours school care, is that the number of inquiries is increasing quite dramatically. There has been a substantial increase in payments to families, making it more affordable. Certainly over the last four years, from when the previous ALP government was in power, about 110,000 more children have gone into Commonwealth funded child care. I think the current figure is that about 577,000 children are in some type of formal care provided by the Commonwealth.",124,Representatives Main Committee
244,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister for Community Services) (12.11 p.m.)-I thank theThursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19349 The measures contained in the bill will fund 7,700 new in-home care places over the next four years. The measure is in response to community demand for more flexible child-care arrangements and supports greater participation in work, education and community activities. The whole basis of this is to increase our flexibility, particularly for families in rural and remote locations, parents working shifts or non-standard hours, or families with children who are regularly ill or have a disability. This certainly has not been the case ever since Commonwealth child-care funding has been in place. From memory, there have been about 64 children who have been funded in this way, having regard to the unique characteristics of families. So it gives more flexibility and there is a greater focus on quality. They have to be approved to operate in-home care, and will be required to meet similar requirements to those of the family day care service. The estimated cost is $48.5 million over four years. Another measure included in this bill is one that I know that farming families and families operating small businesses will be particularly interested in. In the 2000-01 budget, the government announced that 75 per cent-an increase from the current 50 per cent-of the value of a person’s interest in farm and business assets will be disregarded under the youth allowance family assets test. This measure will further increase the government’s support for families-in particular, families from rural areas. More young people will now qualify for youth allowance and fares allowance and the higher level of student financial supplement may be available if the young person is a full-time tertiary student. During the debate in the Senate on the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 the opposition supported a proposed amendment to increase the exemption to 75 per cent for farm assets. This measure goes further than that proposed amendment because it applies to all assets and not just farm assets. This measure will avoid discriminatory treatment between rural and urban businesses and farm and other rural businesses. The estimated cost of this measure is quite considerable-$123.3 million over four years. Of course, the real beneficiaries are families with young children, and particularly young people from rural communities. The bill also provides for the period for data matching of income details between the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink to be extended from two to four years. Presently, the matching of income details under the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 is limited to the two most recently completed financial years. This bill extends this period to the four most recently completed financial years. The Privacy Commissioner’s office was consulted during the development of this initiative, and all data matching will be undertaken in strict observance of the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. The people targeted by this initiative are those who have deliberately set out to defraud both the tax and social security systems. This measure will increase our ability to detect those people and protect taxpayers’ revenue. I know there are many Centrelink staff in Coffs Harbour, in the electorate of Cowper, the Deputy Speaker’s electorate, who do a very fine job. In 1998-99, over 178,000 reviews were completed under the data matching program, with over 70,000 debts being raised and $192 million in direct savings being achieved. The final measure in this bill provides for the protection of people affected by the termination of the social security agreement with the United Kingdom. In July 1999, the Minister for Family and Community Services announced Australia’s intention of terminating the social security agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom. Formal notice of the termination was served on the UK government on 1 March 2000, and the agreement will terminate on 1 March 2001. All people being paid under the agreement, in Australia and the UK, will continue to receive their payments after it ends in March 2001. In addition, this bill 19350 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 provides additional protection for those people who migrate to Australia on or before 1 March 2000, allowing those people to continue to have early access to an Australian age pension as if the agreement were still operating. In short, the measures I have listed here are beneficial. I will now address some of the comments made by members of the opposition. I did not have the chance to be in the chamber to hear all of them, but I would like to make some further comments. The opposition, especially the member for Lilley, are certainly fond of suggesting that the government is always punishing families. They are just simply wrong. They completely ignore the extra $2.4 billion assistance that we have provided to over two million families under the government’s new tax system. Over 2.1 million families have benefited. The complex and confusing system of payments and rebates that we inherited has been replaced by two simple payments: family tax benefit part A and family tax benefit part B. For eligible families, the new family tax benefit part A means an increase in assistance of at least $140 per year for each dependent child. For single income families where the youngest child is under five there will be an increase in assistance of $350 per year under the family tax benefit part B. Most importantly, we have relaxed the income test so that families can earn up to $28,200 before their payment is affected. That has been raised by in excess of $4,000. We have reduced to taper rates so that for every dollar of income earned over $28,200, families will get to keep 70c of their family tax benefit part A instead of the previous 50c. The new system gives families far more choice about how they claim their assistance: continue to receive fortnightly payments through Centrelink, or through reduced fortnightly tax instalments, or as a lump sum at the end of the year. For the first time, families will be able to receive a top-up of family assistance at the end of the year if they have overstated their income. This was not the case before, and this is something that families have asked for. In the area of debts, again contrary to what the member for Lilley says, this government does not treat Centrelink customers or families as criminals, nor does it have a policy of zero tolerance. In fact, the only zero tolerance policy that I subscribe to is having zero tolerance for anything that comes out of the mouth of the member for Lilley. Once again, the member for Lilley is, unfortunately, trying to put fear into people. I know that you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we certainly should not believe a word he says. He claims that people have no rights of appeal and that they will be chased for debts amounting to $1. That just does not exist. There are waiver provisions. Small debts under $50 are automatically waived. Any debts between $50 and $200 are waived if the customer is no longer in receipt of a benefit. If social security customers incur debts and it is found to be due to an administrative error and received in good faith, the debt may also be waived. The government is committed to ending fraud and overpayment in the social security system. That is what the community expects. Centrelink places a very high emphasis on debt prevention through a number of strategies aimed at preventing incorrect payment. There are 200 debt prevention and monitoring officers employed by Centrelink whose job is to focus on debt prevention activities. The government’s commitment to reducing fraud and overpayment is why we announced new measures in the budget to detect and prevent incorrect payment. On the broader issue of child care, we have not cut child-care expenditure. There has been total expenditure of more than $4 billion in the last four years, and that is 30 per cent more than in the last four years that the ALP were in office. Reforms introduced by this government since 1996 provide a wider choice to parents and have ensured that funds are spent to gain the greatest benefit for children. The expansion of in-home care, as I have discussed, is part of a commitment to flexible child-care services to meet the needs of families and to support Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19351 greater participation in paid work, education and community activities. The results of three pilots currently operating in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania have been used to inform the implementation of the in-home care scheme. It is not necessary to finalise the pilots to expand existing in-home care arrangements. Mutual obligation is not simply about a means of punishing the unemployed, as the opposition would have Australians believe. Mutual obligation is based on the premise that responsibility between the community and the individual flows both ways. Under the mutual obligation initiative, unemployed people aged between 18 and 34 may be required to undertake an activity in addition to looking for work. There is a wide range of activities that unemployed people may undertake to fulfil this obligation. It includes the government’s very successful Work for the Dole as well as part-time work, voluntary work, education and training, and, most importantly, literacy and numeracy training if it is required. Despite all the opposition’s rhetoric, mutual obligation is supported by the wider community. Indeed, I suspect they even support it themselves even though they have another name for it. In the area of preparing for work, Centrelink already has in place preparing for work agreements which assist unemployed people to focus on finding work immediately when they claim income support by identifying barriers to take up work and develop strategies to combat these barriers. This initiative is not about punitive measures or empty promises, it is about helping job seekers to focus immediately on what they need to do and what help they may need to return to work. It has been totally embraced by Centrelink employees. This is an upfront commitment to job seekers. I am very pleased to say that in the first four weeks of this initiative, from 1 July this year, 50,000 job seekers have signed a preparing for work agreement. The member for Lilley likes to talk about breaches. The fundamental issue here is that Australian taxpayers expect the government to ensure that unemployed payments go only to those who are genuinely unemployed and in need of support. Make no mistake, our system is a fairer system. Under Labor, any breach resulted in a non-payment period straight away. Now, most breaches result in a rate reduction. A non-payment period is only imposed if a person breaches the activity test three or more times in two years rather than just going straight off benefits, which was the case under the previous government. Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that the measures contained in the bill debated here today are beneficial to all Australians. I would like to thank the member for Werriwa for his comments. I thought they were certainly about the McClure report and how it is being welcomed, not just by the national media but even by many of the more clear thinking members of the opposition. I certainly urge the opposition to support not just the McClure report but also this legislation. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Motion (by Mrs Elson) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. 19352 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 Moore, Mr Peter unfortunate death of Peter Moore, a former CEO of the Canterbury-Bankstown football club. Peter was affectionately known to both those who knew him and to people in the wider Rugby League family as ‘the bullfrog’, His famous greeting to everybody was, ‘Matey, what did you think about that, matey?’ Peter was one of those people who was a legend in the Rugby League world, and he was certainly a legend in the Canterbury-Bankstown district, which is the centre of my electorate. His funeral was held at St Joseph’s at Belmore on 11 July and it was attended by over 2,000 people. The church was full and people were out in the street and in the area around the church. There were people from all over the Rugby League area and all over the district. There were politicians, sportsmen, businessmen, all the people that Peter had touched during his life. His funeral was certainly a celebration of a great life. There were eulogies and anecdotes. There were tears and there were laughs. His eldest daughter, Lyn, said that a condition of entry to the wake down at the club after the funeral was that you had to tell a story about Peter Moore that no-one had heard before. There were so many stories that you certainly would have had a great afternoon there. Peter had three loves: his church, his family and Rugby League. He was famous for going to mass before games and praying for the good Lord to support Canterbury. In a lot of instances he was successful, and I think in the years that Peter was the CEO of Canterbury, God was more of a Canterbury supporter than someone else’s supporter. Rugby League was his consuming passion. Marie, his wife, and his nine children and 12 grandchildren, shared his love of the game with him. Indeed, the Canterbury club became an extension of Peter’s life. In 1970, he and a group of players and officials, including Kevin Ryan, formed a reform group to take over the Canterbury football club. They were successful and Peter became the first secretary and then CEO of the club, a position he held from 1970 to 1995. He turned Canterbury into a professional club, and they were very successful in winning five premierships and playing in five grand finals. In the years that he was the CEO they were always in the semifinals or the finals. He was a great scout of talent and he brought many players from the country and from New Zealand to play for Canterbury. He took an interest in the young players and he was a great guide and mentor to them. He instituted a scholarship program for the club. One of the most famous people who came out of that program was Dr George Peponis, who was the captain of the club. He did his medical training at the expense of the club and became the captain of Australia. Peter Moore was so successful in making the club his life and an extension of his family that players for the club eventually married members of his family. Anderson and Folkes, for instance, married his daughters Lyn and Karen. He was a person who thought that the most important thing you could do in your life was to support your family and to support those who had supported you. Peter was a great player of the game. He was a utility back when he first started and a goal kicker. His career in Rugby League was only cut down by a woman running him down at a pedestrian crossing. He had to have a knee replacement because of that, and it put an end to his active playing. He was a very long-term official in Rugby League. He was the manager of the Australian team that went to Britain on a number of occasions. Even though he was on a different side from Ken Arthurson in the Super League war, the friendship that he and Ken Arthurson had on the Rugby League executive never broke down during what were difficult times for people who were Rugby League supporters and administrators. Indeed, at his funeral, Ken Arthurson said that he had never had a better friend in the world than Peter Moore, even though on the odd occasion in recent times they had had some difficulties.

245,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (12.28 P.m.),"During the recent recess we saw theThursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19353 death of Peter Moore, we have lost a great Australian, a person who was dearly loved by everybody who knew him, and who had a great effect on the district he grew up in. (Time expired) Job Challenge 10,000 National’s innovative new scheme, Job Challenge 10,000. As the name suggests, the national goal is to raise 10,000 job vacancies in two weeks-a tall order by any standard. On the Gold Coast we need to raise 250 vacancies from the four offices in our region: at Southport, Nerang, Palm Beach and Tweed Heads. In addition to boasting very worthy goals, the Job Challenge 10,000 initiative is also a great promotional tool to let employers and the Australian people know that there are organisations out there making inroads. Job Challenge 10,000 is a very clever initiative. Its aim is to remind employers of the range of services available to assist them to fill their vacancies. It has been said by more astute business people than I that good personnel are the key to a good business. Equally as important, it is also of enormous benefit to the unemployed. Hopefully, the challenge will give them an impetus to register with Employment National and take the first step on the difficult road to finding a fulfilling job. I think everyone knows how demanding and, at times, frustrating it can be to find a job. It is one of those periods in life when you face the prospect of rejection-often numerous times. So it takes a certain amount of motivation to get into the market and, hopefully, Job Challenge will provide that motivation 10,000 times over-a tough ask. Every industry needs a pioneer and I am pleased to say that Employment National has filled that niche in the recruitment service industry. With more than 160 sites across Australia, Employment National has come up with an ever-expanding range of services-many of which are tailored to the particular needs of certain communities. For example, the harvest program is of tremendous benefit to agricultural regions which previously had no real program to coordinate the labour supply on which they depend. So it is good to see that at Employment National both businesses and jobseekers do not have to fit into the existing programs. Instead, it is a case of tailoring their program to fit your needs. This sort of approach has achieved results and reaped the rewards. When the government handed down two contracts to Job Network, Employment National was awarded a huge 22 per cent of the total job matching contracts. It had proven itself to be effective the first time around. The federal government is determined to oversee a continued fall in the unemployment rate. National unemployment has hit a 10-year low of 6.3 per cent and the news on the horizon also looks positive, with this year’s budget predicting the lowest jobless rate in a generation by this time next year. It is clear that at the moment we are getting the formula right in this country. No government can achieve this sort of result alone. It is the Job Network providers such as Employment National that are out there at the local coalface finding people work. In Australia, we no longer have a one size fits all situation. Job Network providers recognise that the demands of both business and the jobless do vary based on geographical location and the type of industry supported in the region. On the Gold Coast, our labour market has its own unique qualities and Employment National has adapted to meet those needs. Being a premier tourism destination, our economy depends heavily on the hospitality and retail sectors, and the nature of those industries means that our labour market is more casualised. However, as a city, the Gold Coast is progressing and we are experiencing a diversification of the industry base. This is challenging and changing the nature of the local work force by creating more full-time and part-time positions.",136,Representatives Main Committee
246,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (12.33 P.m.),"Last week, I was privileged to launch Employment19354 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 The latest research from the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business shows that the rate has dropped in every single one of the 31 statistical local areas where unemployment is measured on the Gold Coast. In many areas the jobless rate dropped by two to three per cent in the last quarter alone. At the moment I believe the unemployment rate on the Gold Coast is around seven per cent. As is to be expected, this is still higher than the Brisbane metropolitan area, but it is significantly better than the 10 to 12 per cent unemployment we experienced just a couple of years ago. Of course, the reasons for the drop are many and varied, but a good proportion of it comes down to the government working to assist private enterprise and knowing when to butt out. We are at a strong point, both locally and nationally, a good climate in which to meet the goal of Job Challenge 10,000. I know the Gold Coast community will get behind the Job Challenge 10,000 and together we will rise to the task. Congratulations to Tony Frangou and Employment National on the initiative. Good luck in the next two weeks. East Timor: Australian Troops ANZAC DayI distributed a reminder to my constituents that some 2,000 of our Australian service people were still there. We received a wonderful response from the constituents of Melbourne Ports and their response was greatly appreciated by the commander of the Australian contingent in East Timor, Colonel Baker. I subsequently received a wonderful letter from the company sergeant major in charge of morale in East Timor from 6 RAR, one of their companies-in particular the Alpha Company. He had many of the soldiers in those units over there writing to constituents all over Melbourne Ports. I had some of the cards that I distributed to my constituents spare, so I gave them to the schools in my electorate. I want to pay tribute to the young people from St Kilda, Elwood, Albert Park and all over my electorate who have written thousands and thousands of postcards to the soldiers in East Timor. The schools include St Kilda Primary School; Wesley College; Caulfield Junior College, where my daughter goes; St Kilda Park Primary School, which is opposite my office; Graeme Street Primary School; Middle Park Primary School; Elwood Primary School, where I was a student; St Aloysius Primary School; St Kilda St Michael’s Grammar School; Yavneh College; and Albert Park College. In the remaining time, I want to read some of the extraordinary letters that some of these children, mainly from primary schools, sent to our troops in East Timor. There were three girls from one school-Tamara, Rebecca and Sarah-who wrote: We are 13, 11, 11 years old. We would like to know what it is like over there. Has anything bad happened? We think it is amazing how you sacrifice your life for other people. Please write back. Stuart Inglis from Wesley College wrote: A couple of days ago David Scott came to our school to collect a $5,000 cheque for the East Timor Relief fund. We got all the money by doing a Walk-athon. Shannon Jackway of Elwood Primary School wrote: You have great courage and guts. I don’t have the guts and courage like you. Keep up the great work. Some of the letters were very personal, telling our troops of things that the students thought the troops were missing back here in Australia. Rosa Roberts wrote to the troops in East Timor: The other day I went to a pop concert (the Vengaboys) and had a great time. The only problem was that my mum kept doing all this ‘oldies’ disco-dancing, which was sooo embarrassing!

Marshall’s letter continues: Keep up the good work. Thank you for such a dangerous job. Sorry about missing your family. But you are worth Billions of dollars. Hu Yan Shen from St Kilda Primary School also wrote to the troops. He said: Everyone in Australia is very proud of the Australian troops, who went to East Timor, and help people to find peace and Independence. Freya Mellor-Prior from West St Kilda wrote: I understand that most of you won’t be home for while but you should know that everyone is thinking of you. One of the other people who wrote was Emma Wang. She said: Keep up your good work.

I would like to congratulate you (and the other peacekeepers) on your efforts and success in East Timor. It is both fantastic and relieving to see East Timor getting somewhere in restoring their country and lives. Here in Australia, we have now realized just how lucky we are to live in such a safe environment and go to good schools. We see pictures of poor East Timorese children wandering the streets, with no where to go and no one to care for them. Please continue the good work and look after them for us. The troops in East Timor in the last few days have encountered some rough duty, but the people of Australia are still thinking about them. I am very proud of the young people in my electorate who have written to them. Forestry: Blue Gum Industry ‘Sustainable Future of the Bluegum Industry in Australia’ workshop, which was held over two days earlier in August at the CSIRO Plantation Forest Research Centre in Mount Gambier. Forestry is one of the most important and lucrative industries in the south-east of South Australia, worth approximately $1.9 billion a year with the pine forests alone. The opportunities for the burgeoning blue gum industry are quite boundless. In fact, it could at some stage overtake the softwood industry in the south-east-but not at the expense of that industry, I might add. This workshop was a landmark event for the industry. The workshop was the first of its kind to be held, and it brought together industry leaders from such companies as Timbercorp, Norgard Clohessy Equity Ltd, Forestry Enterprise Tasmania, Australian Plantation Timber, Great Southern Plantations, Woakwine, ITC Project Management and Australian Forest Growers, scientists from the CSIRO and members of the Forestry and Forest Products Division of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. These industry leaders represented blue gum interests in every state of Australia except Queensland which, through this government’s good policies, have been enabled to flourish. It came to my attention nearly a year ago that it would be necessary to convene a meeting of industry leaders to discuss matters of common interest and future directions for the blue gum industry.

248,Mr Secker (Barker) (12.43 P.m.),"It is with great pride that I report the success of the19356 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 might become a giant before issues of importance and concern to the local community, local government and industry participants could be addressed. My proposal to convene a meeting of multilateral scope with the CSIRO, government and industry leaders was met very well indeed. Both the CSIRO and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry worked hard in a short time to prepare discussion papers for the meeting. I thank the Minister for Forestry and Conservation,Wilson Tuckey, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, for their full support in helping to bring this group together. I also thank in particular Dr Sadanadain Nambiar from the CSIRO and Phillip Townsend from the department for their terrific efforts in putting it all together. I believe all the participants left this workshop with a positive outlook on the future of their industry and a commitment to fund the research that is necessary for a profitable future. As it turns out, the workshop could not have been convened at a more opportune time. Issues surrounding the industry had received considerable local media attention in the weeks leading up to the workshop and the news that industry leaders, government and scientists were to meet to discuss direction, focus and regional issues allayed some of the concerns held by the local community. The core objective of this meeting was to explore the opportunities for collaborative research and development into a sustainable future for the blue gum industry. Value adding to the industry was accorded high priority as was the identification of, and agreement on, priorities for research, and the identification of suitable themes for consortium, bilateral and precompetitive research. The development of strategies for joint funding by industry in seeking government support and developing an action plan for project development and implementation were also considered high priority issues. The value adding possibilities included a pulp mill, LVL, charcoal production and sawn timber of a hardwood variety. The sustainable and efficient use of water is of primary importance to plantation companies and the local community alike. It was agreed that a holistic approach to water issues should be developed and salinity credits were raised as a possible means of encouraging responsible and efficient management of water resources. Fire management is also a concern particularly considering the damage done during the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983. Many members of the workshop felt that the coordination of effective fire management strategies should be given priority over any research on fire fuel dynamics. The group also discussed issues surrounding pest and disease management, molecular breeding and paper, fibre and pulp evaluation. I believe that everybody gained a lot from this event and both the CSIRO and I have received much positive feedback. (Time expired) Goods and Services Tax: Charitable Institutions and Non-Profit Organisations Ms GERICK (Canning) (12.48 p.m.)-I would like today to draw attention to a situation facing many of the small charities that provide emergency assistance to needy Australians. I have been contacted by a number of charities operating in my electorate which were deeply concerned about the effects that the new tax system is having on their ability to provide services. Australians are generous people. They have shown time and time again their willingness to put their hands in their pockets to help others who are facing tough times. They have shown their willingness to help people they have never met in other parts of the world as well as people facing difficulties in their own communities. Australians are to be praised for that generosity that they show on these occasions and we need to be careful that we do not discourage this generosity. A good example of the difficulties facing small charities has been brought to my attention by the Hills Home Help Centre, which operates in Armadale, in my electorate, to provide emergency assistance to needy local families. Small charities like the Hills Home Help Centre Thursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19357 are in big trouble across Australia. They are faced with increasing demands for their services at the same time as they have to meet more and more bureaucratic and administrative requirements. The Hills Home Help Centre was started in 1992 by Louise Noble and her husband, Dennis, who run the centre with the help of a team of volunteers. Like thousands of other people working for small charities around the country, they are discouraged and fed up with the obstacles and hindrances that this government is putting in their way as they try to do their work. It is about time that they received some encouragement and help from the government, before they, like hundreds of other charity workers, decide that it is all just too hard. Australians expect that the money they donate to charities will go to help the needy, but there is evidence that the Australian public is becoming more wary of requests from charities for funding. Most Australians are aware of the research that shows that in many instances a large proportion of donations does not get to the intended recipients. Donors want to see their money being put into programs to help the targeted groups, not into the pockets of media consultants or professional fundraisers. How are they going to react when they find out that charities are lending their donations-intended for the help of needy Australians-to this government? The Hills Home Help Centre prepare up to 150 hampers a week for needy families in my electorate. The hampers contain food and essential personal items, like soap, toilet paper and nappies. The GST on these personal items is adding an average of $5.50 to the cost of every hamper. This means that this small, struggling charity is lending over $800 per week to the government. Of course, charities can claim back the GST, but Hills Home Help have been told that they will have to wait months for repayment. Another way of looking at this situation is to work out how much extra food could be provided for families with this money. The centre is able to obtain food for 50c a kilo from another charity. Therefore, the money lent to the government prevents the centre from providing up to 1,650 kilograms of food every week to needy families living in my region. Why is this government putting extra burdens on those members of the community that can least afford to bear them? Why is it implementing a tax system which takes a much higher proportion of the income of our neediest community members and a lower proportion of the income of the wealthiest? Increasing numbers of our citizens are having to turn to charities for help because they can no longer afford essential items. The new tax system means that-for the first time-there is a tax on second-hand goods, including second-hand children’s clothing. And we all know who buys second-hand children’s clothing. This is a clever tax gathering system: as children grow out of their clothes before they wear them out, the parents take them back, resell them and buy more second-hand clothes. This means that one item of clothing for a small child can be sold again and again, and every time it is sold the government gets its tax. The new tax system is causing misery and real financial hardship for thousands of Australians. This is resulting in greater and greater strain being put on small local charities like Hills Home Help, and more and more of the people that work for these charities are asking themselves whether their effort is worth it. The people that run these charities are some of the very best of Australians. They work selflessly and tirelessly for little or no money to help others. They are shining examples of what it really means to be members of an Australian community and citizens of a nation. The government should be encouraging and honouring these people, but instead it is forcing them to work even harder and for longer hours so that it can grab its tax and hang on to it for a few months before paying it back. The government should be ashamed. 19358 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 17 August 2000 Mahoney, Mrs Ruth Forde Electorate: Leadership Awards Forde Electorate: Canungra Lighthorse Brigade mine, Mrs Ruth Mahoney, of Beenleigh. With 300 of her friends and family, I had the pleasure of attending her 100th birthday last Saturday. What an amazing woman. On that day she shared with us her secret for her long life: keeping busy. She stated that she had been a busy woman all her life and that many years ago, when she felt she was getting old, she made up her mind not to sit in a chair for the rest of her life and look at four walls but to do something different. She said it was the best decision she had made, and that she now feels she can go on for some time before old age catches up with her. What a wonderful attitude for a 100-yearold person. Ruth has been involved in the Beenleigh Senior Citizens for over 40 years. She has made a very valuable contribution to that centre and they showed their appreciation last Saturday. Linda Rowan and her staff and members put on one of the biggest birthday parties we have ever seen in Beenleigh-Ruth had every civic leader there, all of the community leaders and all of her friends and family-and it was the best afternoon I have ever been involved in in this job. Ruth is sprightly and sharp as a tack. She has been a member of the senior citizens concert group for many years; she goes to practice twice a week and she is up on the stage entertaining people sometimes half her age. But also she goes around and entertains at nursing homes and aged people’s homes. Then-in her spare time, as she says-she knits, crochets and cooks to raise funds for the Senior Citizens Centre. I cannot dance or sing, but looking at this lady I know how I am going to spend my older years: probably causing a bit of misery among some people if I ever try to sing, but getting up on that stage and trying to keep myself active. At the other end of the spectrum, I would like to talk about another group in my area and that is a group of young people. Seven of the eight people come from Beaudesert High School and they were the recipients of the Caps leadership awards. Another very impressionable young man came from the rural Darlington State School. When I saw these young people on the night and gave them their awards, it went through my mind how lucky I was to be seeing our future in such good hands. These fine young Australians accepted the responsibility and they met many of the challenges that this leadership role involved. They had to extend their very involved time to reach the level set by Caps. They have my admiration and that of the community for this very impressive achievement. I would also like to thank John Gleeson, the coach of the Beaudesert Gymnast Club, for hosting this successful night. I would like to mention, while I have the time, these young people’s names. I am quite sure we are going to hear them on many occasions in the future. I would like to congratulate Sally Powel, Amanda Trace, Amy Rowlands, April Rowlands, Courtney Robertson, Laura Sergeant, Emily Walsh and that young and impressionable man, Reubern Franklin. I know he will go a long way in life. I wish them all the best for the future. In the remaining couple of minutes, I would also like to congratulate the Canungra Lighthorse Brigade. I had the pleasure of opening their education unit. I would like to thank our Minister for Veterans’ Affairs for the support that he has shown this group with grants over the years. They have set up a trailer with a horse and the Lighthorse Brigade have an information unit, a caravan, that they take around to all of our local schools to show the young",139,Representatives Main Committee
249,Mrs Elson (Forde) (12.53 P.m.),"I would like to talk about a very special constituent ofThursday, 17 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19359 people the many sacrifices that our Lighthorse Brigade made over many years. It is not to glorify war but it is to bring to the young people’s attention to the sacrifices that men and women made to this country so that they could live in the freedom that we see today. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Sergeant Peter Hilder and Corporal Ken Reese for the many hours that they give to this project and to the many delighted young people in my community. I see the look on their faces when the Lighthorse Brigade visits their schools. I would like to thank them on behalf of the Commonwealth government for the wonderful work they do. Main Committee adjourned at 12.55 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Commonwealth Funded Programs: Tasmania (Question No. 1543) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 11 May 2000: (1) Does the Minister’s Department administer any Commonwealth funded programs for which community organisations, businesses or individuals can apply for funding in Tasmania; if so, what are the programs.

The National Landcare Program supports on-ground action which will result in integrated and sustainable natural resource management at the farm, catchment and regional level and which contribute to an integrated program of sustainable management of land, water, vegetation and biological diversity. The National Rivercare Program is aimed at ensuring progress towards the sustainable management, rehabilitation and conservation of rivers outside the Murray-Darling Basin and to improve the health of these rivers. The National Rivercare Program seeks to encourage the development of strategic and integrated responses to address identified river issues. Its focus is on inland rivers. The Farm Forestry Program aims to encourage the incorporation of commercial tree growing and management into farming systems for the purpose of wood and non-wood production, increasing agricultural productivity and sustainable natural resource management. The Fisheries Action Program aims to rebuild Australia’s fisheries to more productive and sustainable levels through fish habitat restoration and protection; encouraging community participation in activities to improve fisheries ecosystems; aquatic pest control; ensuring that fishing by commercial and recreational fishers is sustainable and responsible; raising community awareness; and promoting related research encouraging integrated approaches to fisheries resources management and habitat conservation.

Illegal Immigration: Villawood Detention Centre (Question No. 1652) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 2000: (1) How many people are being held in detention at the Villawood detention centre in Sydney and how many of these persons are of (a) Chinese background, (b) Arabic background, (c) African background and (d) other backgrounds. (2) Have a number of the people held in detention been released on conditional bonds or assurances; if so, how many have been released and from what ethnic background are those who have been released. (3) Has the level of bonds and assurances required in the last two years increased from $3000 to more than $30 000; if so, (a) what is the justification for the increase in bond costs and (b) is the Government trying to make profits from the process of releasing refugee claimants in the community. (1) There were 326 people detained at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre on 30 June 2000. The Department’s records indicate that of the people detained at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre on 30 June 2000: (a) 58 detainees were from the PRC or Hong Kong SAR. (b) The data does not indicate the number of detainees who are of Arabic background, however the table below does provide details of the nationality of people in the Villawood detention centre on 30 June 2000.

Hence, the following figures refer to securities that could have been requested as a consequence of compliance field activity or from people detained at an immigration detention centre. During the 1998/99 year, securities were attached to 832 BridgingE Visas. In the 1999/2000 year, 800 securities were attached to BridgingE Visas. The top 5 nationalities granted BridgingE Visas with securities attached during 1998/99: (1) China 152 (2) Philippines 83 (3) India 71 (4) Indonesia 71 (5) Vietnam 63 The top 5 nationalities granted BridgingE Visas with securities attached during 1999/00: (1) China 175 (2) India 86 (3) Philippines 59 (4) Indonesia 41 (5) Malaysia 39 (3) The average security attached to a BridgingE Visa has increased from $4,822 (1998/1999) to $6,810 (1999/2000). (a) The department does not set guidelines regarding the amount of the security required; it is an individual decision based on the circumstances of each applicant. Securities can be requested as part of the BridgingE Visa decision making process. In considering the application, decision-makers should consider (in addition to whether the applicant satisfies the primary criteria for the grant of the visa): . what conditions, if any, the decision-maker considers should be imposed on the grant of the visa: . whether the applicant is likely to abide by those conditions; and . whether the prospects of the applicant abiding by those conditions would be significantly enhanced if they were to lodge a financial security. (b) Securities are forfeited when an authorised decision-maker considers that the visa holder’s failure to abide with a condition(s) attached to the visa is sufficiently serious to warrant forfeiture. Illegal Immigration: Woomera Detention Centre (Question No. 1653) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 2000: (1) What were the specific grievances and requests of the refugee claimants who escaped from the Woomera detention centre in the recent mass breakout. (2) Have any of these grievances or requests been met. (3) Will the Government make changes to its existing detention regime; if so, what; if not, why not. (4) Why is the processing period for so many of these refugee claimants so long. (5) Is the large majority of these claimants granted refugee status; if so, will the Government introduce a provisional mechanism to allow these refugee claimants to be released into the care of community organisations much more quickly, thereby allowing a more thorough examination of their refugee claims to be made and also reducing the suffering of these people. (1) The detainees who broke out of the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre were aggrieved by the length of time they had spent in detention. The unauthorised arrivals were misinformed by people smugglers about the length of time they would spend in detention. (2) When people arrive illegally, the Department needs to: find out who they are; where they have come from; why they cannot return to their country of origin; and carry out character and health checks. Many unauthorised arrivals dispose of documentation before their arrival in Australia. This practice only adds to the delays in processing times as we establish an individual’s bona fides. Members of my Department meet with detainees regularly to inform them of the legal processes in Australia and how their cases will be progressed. Significant resources have been assigned to manage unauthorised arrivals and the processing of applications as quickly as possible. However, detainees are only released when they have satisfied all relevant criteria for the grant of a visa. (3) The Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) undertook a review of detention arrangements in 1994. The Committee considered a number of alternatives to mandatory detention including the release of detainees into the care of community groups. The Committee raised a number of doubts about the feasibility of release into the community which included: . the ability of care and welfare groups to adequately tend released detainees in an environment where the government could not be responsible for them; . rejected the notion that the costs associated with release would be cheaper than the costs of maintaining detention facilities, particularly when indirect and direct costs, such as accommodation, clothing, food and other living, medical and health costs, were considered; . the significant possibility that unauthorised arrivals released into the community pending finalisation of their cases would breach the conditions of release and abscond. These concerns remain as valid today as they were in 1994. Mandatory detention was introduced in 1992 and continues to have bipartisan support. (4) The vast majority of unauthorised arrivals by boat have intentionally disposed of their identity documents en route. Many unauthorised arrivals have spent significant periods in third countries prior to arrival in Australia. Establishing the identity of these people can take considerable time, but is essential in order to determine whether Australia owes protection obligations to them and to ensure that people are not granted visas and released where they represent a real danger to our community because of security or criminal concerns. The Government has significantly increased its capacity to process boat arrivals. The number of trained refugee decision-makers more than doubled in the course of 19992000. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has also been continually reviewing all its arrangements to ensure that boat arrivals are processed quickly, without compromising the rigour and integrity of our inquiries. Nonetheless, these boat arrivals can expect to remain in detention until we have satisfied ourselves that we know who they are and that they do not represent a danger to the community. (5) All unauthorised arrivals, whether protection visa applicants or not, are required by law to be detained until they are either removed from Australia, or granted a visa. On current nationality compositions, a large number of unauthorised arrivals are found to require Australia’s protection. However, a significant number are found not to require it. Australia’s detention regime ensures that persons to whom Australia does not owe protection can be quickly removed. Importantly, detention also ensures that a protection visa applicant is readily available to assist in a thorough examination of their protection claims and resolution of issues surrounding their identity. Every effort is made to ensure that protection claims are examined and decisions made as quickly as possible, while maintaining the integrity of the system. Protection visa applicants in detention are provided with",149,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
255,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:publicly funded migration agent assistance to ensure that their claims are presented quickly and comprehensively. Refugees: Kosovo (Question No. 1667) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 22 June 2000: (1) What information has been made available to the Australian Government, either directly or through its diplomatic posts, about the living conditions and general circumstances of Kosovar refugees who were in Australia and were required to return. (2) Did Kosovar refugees defy the Government’s edict and remain in Australia; if so, (a) how many, (b) where are they being held in detention and (c) what progress has been made on processing their refugee claims. (3) Given that these refugee claimants were invited to Australia by the Government, why will the Government not heed Albanian Community Organisations and others and release this small number of people into the care or those community organisations until such time as their refugee claims are finalised. (1) Since the commencement of Operation Safe Haven in May 1999 the Australian Government has been receiving regular and detailed reports regarding conditions in Kosovo from many sources including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and various non-government organisations. The topic and level of detail in these reports has varied, however, they have covered issues such as the availability of food, shelter, utilities, health care and education in specific localities both within and around Kosovo as well as providing information regarding ongoing relief efforts. In addition, where appropriate, security, protection and human rights issues have also been raised. These reports have not, however, examined the individual circumstances or living conditions of the more than 3600 Kosovars who returned after being given temporary safe haven in Australia, to join the 900,000 persons from other countries, in the enormous task of rebuilding their lives and homeland. (2) Only those Kosovars that I found to have no demonstrated need for ongoing medical or trauma treatment and no prospect of success in meeting the requirements for a protection visa, were asked to return to Kosovo on special charter flights in April 2000. (a) While most of this group returned co-operatively, 45 refused to do so. These people became unlawful non-citizens when their visas ceased to be in effect. (b) Of the Kosovars who chose to become unlawful, most have been detained. Currently 23 are being held in immigration detention at Port Hedland, six at Villawood in Sydney and one at Maribyrnong in Melbourne. (c) None of the Kosovars in immigration detention have applications for protection before my Department. (3) Under section 91K of the Migration Act 1958 the holder of a temporary safe haven visa is not allowed to apply for any other type of visa while still in Australia. However, under section 91L it is possible for me to allow such an application to be made where I think it is in the public interest to do so. In April 2000, I considered some 500 claims from Kosovars in this context. As a result, everyone who had any prospect for success with a protection visa application was allowed to apply and 126 have done so. In addition, many others were granted further stay in Australia due to medical or trauma conditions. Officers of my Department are currently assessing applications submitted for protection visas and, while their claims are being considered, the applicants are living in the Australian community and receiving appropriate Government assistance.

Imports: Chinese Apple Juice Concentrate (Question No. 1669) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 22 June 2000: (1) Is he able to say whether the US Government recently applied backdated anti-dumping duties on apple juice concentrate imports from China under current WTO guidelines; if so, (a) why have the duties been applied and (b) why have they been backdated. (2) Has the amount of Chinese apple juice concentrate imported into Australia increased from 5,560,251 litres in 1993 to 14,277,851 in 1999; if not, by what amount have these imports increased over that period. (3) Has the dumping of Chinese apple juice concentrate led to the closure of processing plants in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales; if not, what impact have Chinese apple imports had on the Australian apple industry. (4) In light of the US’s decision, why is Chinese apple juice concentrate being allowed onto the Australian market without similar protection for the Australian apple industry. (5) Is the Government taking steps to consult the Australian apple industry about the impact of these imports; if so, what; if not why not. (1) On5 June 2000 the US Department of Commerce determined that anti-dumping duties would be applied on all unliquidated entries of certain non-frozen apple juice concentrate (NFAJC) from the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC). (a) The anti-dumping duties have been applied because the Department of Commerce determined that NFAJC from the PRC is being or is likely to be sold in the US at less than fair value (causing material injury to a US industry). (b) The anti-dumping duties have been applied to imports since the date of the Department of Commerce’s preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value, which was made on 23 November 1999. Cash deposits on affected imports of NFAJC from the PRC have been collected by US Customs since the date of the preliminary determination, in conformity with WTO guidelines, pending a final determination. (2) Available ABS data shows that the amount of Chinese apple juice concentrate imported into Australia increased from 922,400 litres in 1995 to 9,048,461 litres in 1999. (3) The Australian Apple and Pear Growers’ Association (AAPGA) advise that no processing plants have closed down as yet. However, it is the smaller processors who will have difficulty in maintaining competitiveness of their product against the cheap imported concentrate. Moreover, the use of cheaper Chinese juice concentrates by processors forces second grade Australian apples, which would otherwise be destined for processing, on to the domestic fresh apple market. This reduces buyer’s confidence and damages consumer perception of Australian product. (4) The AAPGA is taking a promotional approach to combating this problem. It is supporting the development of a Code of Practice to promote the use of Australian apple juice through labelling along the lines of “100% Australian apple juice”. The Australian Customs Service has confirmed that it has not received any approach from the apple juice industry in the past 12 months.",152,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

258,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) The Australian Customs Service maintains a Dumping Liaison Unit within the Trade Measures Branch. This unit provides assistance to local industry concerning the requirements needed to lodge a dumping complaint. If the apple juice industry wishes assistance in understanding the process and information requirements associated with a dumping complaint, this unit would be pleased to provide assistance. Illegal Immigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 1718) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 29 June 2000: (1) Did he announce that approximately 1,700 people, who have been held in detention centres, will be released as genuine refugees into the community in the next two months. (2) Has the Government prohibited Migrant Resource Centres and other bodies, directly or indirectly funded by his department, from assisting these genuine refugees; if so why. (3) Has he called on State Governments not to provide welfare assistance to these genuine refugees; if so, why. (4) What forms of assistance will be available to these refugees, especially if they cannot access English language courses and other settlement services. (1) I did indicate recently that approximately 1,700 persons currently in detention in Immigration Reception and Processing Centres may be released as Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holders over the next six to eight weeks. (2) My Department has written to organisations funded through various settlement related programs, including Migrant Resource Centres, to explain the Government’s approach to the TPVs. These organisations were informed that funding for programs they provi `de was directed at refugees and others who have been permanently resettled in Australia. Government funding for these programs was not to be directed away from assisting permanent residents to those who have been given temporary protection. (3) I wrote to all State Premiers and Territory Chief Ministers on 7 January 2000 informing them of the introduction of the new visa category for unauthorised arrivals found to have engaged Australia’s protection obligation. I suggested that while it would not be appropriate for these refugees to be denied any basic rights, it would be consistent with the Commonwealth’s intentions if State or Territory assistance was restricted to essential or basic services. (4) TPV holders can claim special benefit, have the right to work and are able to access job matching and Medicare. They are also able to access the early health assessment and intervention services funded directly by my department. English language programs have been available within the immigration reception and processing centres before release. The government considers it inappropriate to provide TPV holders with the more generous range of settlement services available to refugees and others resettled permanently in Australia under the humanitarian program. TPV holders are expected to take responsibility for their own living arrangements. They are being advised to seek further assistance from friends and relatives in Australia, or from relevant organisations within their own community.
