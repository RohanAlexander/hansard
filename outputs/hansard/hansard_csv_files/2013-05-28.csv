They will have to drop Labor in opposition promised that they their private health insurance because they would not touch the 30 per cent private can simply no longer afford to keep it. health insurance rebate. Nicola Roxon said in If people drop out of private health February 2009, plainly, simply and insurance, what does that mean? It does not unambiguously, very clearly: mean they no longer have health problems. The Government is firmly committed to retaining That is preposterous. What it means is that, the existing private health insurance rebates. instead of going to the private hospital, they Steve Lewis asked her, as health minister at go across to the public hospital. As you the time, on Meet the Press earlier: know, these public hospitals are already So you will not wind back that 30% private health stretched to capacity.

How are these public hospitals supposed promised through thick and thin that they to cope if even a small number of the people would not touch the private health insurance who are currently covered by private health rebate. They did so because they know how insurance drop their cover and then go into many people rely upon that rebate to make the public system? private health insurance affordable for them. When you look at the procedures that are This is another broken promise. That is what done in the private hospitals, it is quite these bills represent. incredible-78 per cent of knee procedures The Australian public is sick of broken are done in private hospitals, as are 81 per promises. They are sick of having the carbon cent of same day mental health treatments, tax which was promised to never come in.

There are two simple answers to this. There was not going to be good health for The first is that they have always had an those who could afford it and a poorer health ideological objection to the private health outcome for those who were less financially insurance rebate scheme.

There are, however, two powerful responses to this misleading claim and both of them are based commitment in a letter to the industry peak on data and evidence from the government's body: own regulator, the Private Health Insurance Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Administration Council, known as PHIAC. Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions The first response is that many Australians this year that Federal Labor is committed to responded to the changes introduced in 2012 retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate by prepaying at the old rates before 30 June and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older 2012; hence deferring the true effect of the Australians. changes introduced last year. In fact, PHIAC reported $1.2 billion of prepayments in the As the historical record shows, these specific June quarter of 2012 as Australians sought to commitments were abandoned last year defer the resulting premium increases. when the government, after previous failed Indeed, many policyholders prepaid for 12 attempts, passed legislation to break these months or more.

Indeed, PHIAC has found that, in afternoon are bad policy driven by Labor's the five years to 2012, 'exclusions and agenda of relentless hostility to private restrictions have become much more health insurance, because the measures prevalent' and the increased use of contained within both of these bills are exclusions, it goes on to note, 'may work designed to erode the value of the private against the policy objective of private health health insurance rebate to Australians. insurance in easing the burden on public The first bill before us is the Private hospitals'.

The measures in this bill bring with them After a few years, what this is likely to mean some very nasty side-effects. They add is that the base premium will be considerably further substantial complexity to the private lower than the actual premium. In turn, a health insurance system, and it is estimated rebate calculated based on the base premium that they will cause a further increase in will be less valuable over time in relation to premiums for 1.1 million Australians. the true cost incurred by the holder of the Indeed, they will be a disproportionate policy. increase in premiums for low-income earners The minister in her second reading speech because the means-testing changes which argued that this is necessary because the have already been implemented have already number of people with private health reduced and, in some cases, removed the insurance has grown and the rebate is costing rebate for higher income earners. It is too much. AgainI make the point that if the estimated that changes to the Lifetime Health minister were really concerned with Cover arrangements proposed in this bill will minimising cost to the Commonwealth over increase premiums by up to an amount as the long term she would be pleased to see the high as 27.5 per cent from 1 July 2013 and, growth in private health insurance, because troublingly, this is likely to have a direct the more people who have such insurance the impact on lower income Australians who more cost pressure is taken off the public have or wish to have private health hospital system. insurance.

It has always been the coalition's health insurance rebate, because, rather than view that there are good policy reasons to the rebate being calculated on the actual support private health insurance. That is premium paid by Australians each year, it what the coalition has consistently done. I will now be calculated based on a lower conclude by once again congratulating my amount called the base premium. The base constituents, who, in almost all cases, choose premium will be indexed annually by to pay for private health insurance and take responsibility for their own healthcare insurance but the measures will increase the expenditures. cost of living for all Australians and will I rise to follow a very good speech by my which are already suffering from Labor colleague and friend the member for government cuts.

A policy that a Parliamentary party has publicly Dr LEIGH (Fraser-Parliamentary announced it intends to seek to have implemented Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:44): after the election. Although this is a topic that I feel very It sounds broadly the same, but there is a strongly about, there is a large number of twist. In preparing its list of election policies, bills before the House so I will speak briefly Budget Honesty they will be caught in the today. The Parliamentary Budget Office was noose of the Parliamentary Budget Office's established on the recommendation of a joint post-election audit. It is a guarantee to the select committee of parliament including Australian people that they should have support from all parties. The aim of the PBO costed policies put in front of them. But the is to ensure that elections are fought around Australian people are not yet seeing that values, so that there are two well-costed sets from the opposition. The opposition have, on of policies which face the Australian people. their own admission, a $70 billion gap. That The alternative to the Parliamentary Budget is not my number. That is a number which Office is what we saw in the 2010 election was first put forward by the member for where the coalition avoided the Charter of North Sydney on the Sunrise program on 12 Budget Honesty, a charter set up by Peter August 2011, when he said: Costello, and then went to the election Therefore finding $50, 60 or 70 billion is about offering policies which instead had been soidentifying waste and identifying areas where you called 'audited' by a private accounting firm. do not need to proceed with programs. That accounting firm was later fined for On Meet the Press the member for Goldstein professional misconduct because they had said: not conducted an audit. We had the farce of We came out with the figure, right? the member for North Sydney claiming that they had conducted only a small 'a' audit. That was on 4 September 2011, and on Unfortunately, audit only has a small 'a'. The ABC's AM, on 12 August 2011, the member coalition were, needless to say, embarrassed for Goldstein said, 'It's a case of simple by this, embarrassed by the $11 billion hole arithmetic.' They did regret it a little later, in their costings which Treasury exposed. with the member for North Sydney saying on We saw some deeply disappointing scenes in 8 February 2012, 'Okay, I shouldn't have said here when members of the opposition any figure because it was part of a debate criticised former Treasury secretary Ken and now it has been taken as a statement of Henry for doing his job and simply fact.' But the cat at that stage was well and scrutinising coalition costings. truly out of the bag. But what the Parliamentary Service We have that significant costings hole on Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) the coalition side and the coalition now Bill 2013 will do is now place the role of a suggesting to the Australian people that they post-election audit in the hands of the will do the mathematically impossible, that Parliamentary Budget Office.

The reason for this approach was commitments the PBO then reasonably simple: political parties should be believes will have a material impact on the accountable and responsible for telling the budget.

As I responsibilities with the PBO's post-election mentioned before, this could be due to the report.

I want to speak about and pay tribute to ASIO. Looking around the world in recent times-and I am not just talking about last week but over many years-we have seen great internal threats to Western nations, threats which have come from radical followers of Islam who interpret the religion to give them some justification for attacks on civilians-terrorism by any other name. As is the nature of terrorism, they are acts designed to create fear, acts designed to elicit a media response, which is always quite successful, and nevertheless acts designed to push a philosophy which is inconsistent with Western values and Western thinking. Looking particularly at the recent event in Boston, people who had come from Chechnya were responsible for the attacks which took lives at the Boston marathon. They were people who had sought a better life in the United States but then, having taken all the advantages offered by the West, they chose to find such fault with those systems and attacked innocent, undefended civilians, taking lives for a political cause in the name of religion. Similarly, in Stockholm an immigrant population is resisting the rule of law. In Paris, the attack on the soldier in the metropolitan area was by a member of an immigrant population which has chosen not to be part of the mainstream or to benefit from the opportunities provided to them, but instead to find fault and try to change the nature of the country which had so willingly and generously provided them support and protection. What happened a week ago in London shocked us all. We heard the matter of fact manner in which one of those murderers, having run down the innocent soldier Lee Rigby, then set upon him in the worse, cruellest and most violent way. He justified his actions in such a broad English second-generation accent. He justified the killing, the ambush and the murder of that young soldier on the basis of aggrievement by what happens in, as he described, 'our lands'. He defined himself as no longer a citizen of Britain and owed his allegiance to a higher authority in his mind-that being his interpretation of his religion. Again, he was aggrieved by perceived injustices in a foreign land.",163,Fedral Leader Of The Nationals Warren Truss Environment Told The Senate That The

Those people come to find so much fault with that society-the society that has given them succour-that they then choose to attack it. It is a philosophy that we struggle with and one that I find difficult to comprehend. Here in Australia the reality is that we too face exactly these problems. The arrests that have taken place in the last few years-such as the planned attack on Holsworthy army barracks-these are exactly the same threats that other countries face. High-profile cases seem to be focused in Melbourne and Sydney, but I can tell the parliament-in tribute to ASIOthatI was approached last year by a person who had been a Christian, converted to Islam and came out of Islam to find Christianity again. This man witnessed and heard the conversations of young Islamic men in a mosque in Perth discussing the political benefits and value of attacking infrastructure in Perth. Having heard this, I contacted ASIO. I was very pleased to have seen that man who had come to me several weeks or so later at a public event-I did not wish to follow up with ASIO to make sure they did their job-and he told me he was up to his third interview with ASIO. I am very grateful that this country is so well protected by such a dedicated group of professionals as ASIO. While they are completely different organisations, ASIS and the Office of National Assessments are other organisations in which we should have great faith. The only trouble is that there has been a very severe increase in workload, coupled with an unfortunate series of cutbacks in their budgets, and this has added pressure on organisations like ASIO. When a professional and a highly competent organisation such as ASIO is faced with a mountainous workload, we cannot have faith that the best interests of the country are being served-no matter how good they are. As we know, since the 2008 changes to the border protection policies brought in by the Rudd government and furthered by the Gillard government, there have been some 40,000 illegal arrivals by boat who have come from places where there has been fighting, who may possibly be terrorists or used to fighting and who may have causes that are unlikely to be in the best interests of this countr When we are faced with that sort of incoming group of people, the need for ASIO to do a security assessment on them obviously is paramount. But if you are faced with a reduction in your budget, not enough staff to do the job, and pressure from some media and some irresponsible fringe parties such as the Greens, then there is always a risk that people will slide through. When you look at some of the people that have been arrested in this country for terrorism related charges then there is obviously a history of people having slipped through. That is a terrible situation. The incident that I referred to before, which I reported to ASIO-again I pay tribute to the quick and very effective manner in which ASIO responded to that-was a counterterrorism security matter. I understand that there has been an 11 per cent rise in counterterrorism security assessments that have been required. When that is coupled with, in recent years, 34,000 in visa assessments, there is a big strain for ASIO to do their job. They do not have enough staff to do that job. When we look at exactly what has happened around the world, we must know that the threat is as real here as it is in other places. There might be different numbers per capita of immigrant populations in various places around the world, but the reality is that we, too, have that sort of threat here. I have heard from one of my constituents of that threat. There is no doubt that we are facing a problem in the future and a problem right now. At the start of 2011, in a speech I made-this fact was well reported at the time-it was said that in the four months leading up to February 2011 there were some 22 Australian citizens that had effectively disappeared in the Middle East trying to enter terrorism training camps in Yemen. I am sure those 22 Australians were all from immigrant backgrounds-first or second generation. An honourable member: Are you sure? one of the murderers in London, Michael Adebolajo, who was arrested in Kenya. He was part of the al-Shabaab movement, which is an al-Qaeda linked terrorist organisation. That suspect-one of the murderers in London-pretty much falls into the same sort of category as some of those 22 Australians that have entered training camps in Yemen. What we see is that there is a very real threat to the security of this country posed by Australians-or people who are now Australian citizens-and in that context we should be very careful about undermining or rendering less effective the great job that ASIO can do. When we have ASIO and other security organisations within this country-organisations that serve the interests of our nation-hamstrung by a reduction in their budget and further challenged by a massive increase in their workload due to the policies of government, then that threat becomes worse and worse. The job of any government-the job of those of us who serve the nation in this place-is to make sure that our country and our people are safe, first and foremost. We are not lords of the manor here. We are not VIPs. We are merely the chief servants of our electorates and of our nation. We should keep in mind always to not increase the dangers or limit our ability to keep safe our population. What needs to change in the future is that we make sure that ASIO, that great organisation, is properly resourced for the benefit of all Australians. great pleasure for me to rise to speak on the 2013 appropriation bills. I have spoken on many budgets since being elected to this House in 1998, in opposition and in government, but this is the first time. I have been able to do so as a member of the executive, as the new Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts. SoI am delighted to be able to say that this is an excellent budget for the arts. The credit for that goes to many people, including the former Minister for the Arts Mr Crean, and the current minister, Mr Tony Burke. Above all, credit goes to the arts sector itself. SinceI have been in this job, and for a long time before that, I have been impressed by the dynamism, imagination, enthusiasm and vision of the people who work in Australia's arts sector. That includes the arts practitioners themselves-Australia's visual artists, writers, classical, jazz and contemporary musicians and film and theatre people-as well as the dedicated administrators who manage the myriad of arts organisations. This budget rewards their talent and their commitment. The fact that, despite difficult economic circumstances, we stayed with our budgetary commitments to them shows that the Australian government does value their work.",168,Bills

249,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports,"Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts) (12:25): It is aThere is a perception in some sections of the community that government funding for the arts is a luxury. Recently, the Institute of Public Affairs think tank, which is the ideological spear point of the Liberal Party, and which seems to get such a free ride in the media, published an article by John Roskam, Chris Berg and James Paterson called '75 radical ideas to transform Australia'. No. 62 of these radical ideas was: 'End all public subsidies to sport and the arts.' Last week I saw an example of what it would mean if this radical anti-government agenda were to be put into practice. At Glenorchy in Hobart, I had the pleasure last Friday of opening stage 2 of the Glenorchy Arts and Sculpture Park, locally known as GASP. This project has transformed a rundown industrial area into nine hectares of recreational and environmental reserves, including a bird sanctuary, boardwalks and educational facilities, as well as a showplace for art and sculpture, linked to the legendary MONA gallery, making that whole area into an arts precinct. GASP will provide direct employment for many people in Glenorchy, but it will also bring more visitors to Hobart and stimulate growth and employment in tourism and related industries. This was all made possible by $2 million of federal funds. If the IPA has its way under a future coalition government, arts projects like this will become much more difficult to fund, perhaps impossible. Australia, and particularly regional Australia, would be poorer if that were to happen. Our most important arts funding organisation is the Australia Council for the Arts, founded by the Whitlam government in 1973. New funding is now being provided for the Australia Council. This investment by the Australian government will respond to the 2012 review of the Australia Council, giving it greater flexibility to meet the challenges of rapid change in music, performance, art, literature and emerging arts and increasing its base funding by $75 million over four years, or more than $18 million per annum. As the new Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts, I had the opportunity to introduce that legislation, my first. That was a great honour and this is a great development for the Australia Council, its first reform in 40 years. New funding of over $20 million will also be provided in this budget to our national elite arts training organisations such as the Australian Ballet School and the Australian Youth Orchestra. This will sustain and increase training available to students and ensure that these organisations continue to provide leadership in the performing arts and creative industries. New funding of over $9 million will also be provided to six major performing arts companies: Bangarra Dance Theatre and Belvoir (Company B) in New South Wales; the West Australian Ballet and the Black Swan State Theatre Company in Western Australia, and the Malthouse Theatre and Circus Oz in Victoria. This initiative will secure the financial bases of these companies. It will ensure that they are able to meet the standards of excellence, creativity and innovation expected of major performing arts companies. It will enable them to continue to deliver their core program of activities while increasing access for Australian audiences to their high-quality performances and educational services. This government is committed-and I am personally committed-to supporting the growth of Indigenous art in Australia. I recently opened a wonderful exhibition of Indigenous women's paintings from Western Australia and the Northern Territory at Alliance Francaise in St Kilda in my own electorate. The budget includes continued funding of over $11 million over four years to support and strengthen the Indigenous visual arts industry. This supplements the government's already significant investment in this area. There is new, additional funding of nearly $14 million over four years to develop community driven digital and multimedia language resources and activities as an extension to the Indigenous Languages Support program. I am particularly pleased that $8 million has also been provided in the budget to the Creative Young Stars program. This is a program that will encourage, support and celebrate creative young people up to 25 years old, funding available in every federal electorate. This is a completely non-partisan program, which I hope all members of the House will take part in. The great trumpeter James Morrison, when I was inducting him into the Hall of Fame at the Bell Awards recently, explained to me that 3,500 young Australians were that weekend in Mt Gambier participating in jazz training with all of the leading jazz musicians in Australia-3½ thousand young Australians out of a population of 23 million. It does say something about the yearning for creativity in this country. Arts policy in Australia has generally not been the subject of partisan controversy and I do not wish to make it one, but I think it is fair to note that the opposition has committed itself to budget cuts of something like $70 billion. That was the figure put on it by the honourable member for North Sydney. Would the arts sector be immune from these cuts? It is hard to believe they would. Has the opposition given a commitment that would not cut arts funding? Not so. As I noted earlier, the IPA, which is becoming increasingly the theoretical arm of the Liberal Party, suggests cutting off funding to the arts, taking us back to the 1930s. I do not expect the opposition would go that far, but the IPA's radical agenda gives us an indication of where conservative thinking on arts policy-and, indeed, on other policy-is heading. It is headed back to an era where only the wealthy had access to the arts, when artists were solely dependent on patronage. I am pretty sure that that is not where the arts sector wants to go and not where the Australian people want to go. I want to reflect on some of the comments made just briefly by the member for Cowan, talking about the excellent work that ASIO does and some critique of my dear old friend, the member for Holt, the 'M', the chairman of the intelligence committee, in the budget. Within its budget it is true that ASIO does excellent work. We have had seven groups of people arrested, charged and convicted-jailed-for attempting terrorism within Australia. There have been no effective attacks in mainland Australia. Of course, 88 of our countrymen were foully murdered in Bali. But ASIO is doing an excellent job and there is no evidence-the member for Cowan was talking about ASIO's checking of overseas people-that any of the people who were involved in these terrible potential crimes against the Australian people were boat refugees. It is absolute nonsense. Of course, the major threat to the activities of ASIO comes from the very ideological zealots in the Institute of Public Affairs that I have pointed to time and time again and who should really have been the focus of the intelligence committee's report to this parliament, because the ideological zealots in the Institute of Public Affairs are very influential in the Liberal Party, very influential on people like Mr Ciobo and Mr Turnbull-some people would even suggest Senator Brandis-who have said that they do not support the security services' concern about the fact that they are 'going dark'. This is an expression which explains the security services' concern with the fact that they have less and less ability to intercept telephones and telecommunications compared to what they were able to do in the past when we all had more primitive forms of technology-one telephone line, one fax line. If the security services are not able to fulfil their tasks because of the influence of the IPA and its influence on the Liberal Party that will be the real reason, Member for Cowan, why we cannot prevent attacks on mainland Australia, as we have successfully to date. That will be the real reason. Be assured that, if I am the only person in this place who remembers these facts, I will slate it home to the Liberal Party and the IPA for their wilful neglect of the requests of all of the different security services to have the ability to see that there is a fair policy of data retention. Any serious person interested in the issue of privacy, unlike the ideological zealots of the IPA and some of the people in the coalition who are influenced by them, would know that in New Zealand and other countries there is a piece of legislation called 'data breach legislation'. If you are really concerned about privacy you could pass legislation with the extra ability of the security services to retain data and examine data under warrant with the same kinds of conditions they are forced to undergo now. You could safeguard against commercial people or terrorists accessing Australians' private data by having a severe program of data breach, which exists in other countries. There are fair ways of addressing privacy. There is a severe interest in the ability of the security services to continue to perform their tasks and to keep Australians safe, but it is not being addressed by the IPA through the great influence they have over the Liberal Party. If anything happens in this country as a result of the security services not being able to intercept these people before they commit their act, the blame should be slated home to the people preventing this legislation. That is the issue which the intelligence committee should have been primarily concerned about, and I hope the government will take it up. In the remaining time. I will make some comments about the budget as it affects my electorate. The government and I are proud to present the fully funded National Disability Insurance Scheme, DisabilityCare. Around 1,980 carers in Melbourne Ports will now receive a $600 carer's supplement boost to assist with financial pressures associated with caring for a loved one. Those who care for a child with disability will now receive an extra $1,000 per year. Over 1,600 local people with disability may be eligible for Labor's DisabilityCare Australia scheme, giving people with significant disability and their carers lifetime support and the care they need. We recognise working parents for how much they put into their families; working, caring for children, managing cost-of-living pressures and often supporting ageing parents. We are making sure that new families can spend time with each other through the Dads and Partner Pay initiative, providing two weeks leave to spend time with the new child and their family. Indeed, someone in my office has had the opportunity to experience that program, and I congratulate Sean Carroll and Natalie on their baby, Duncan. Mazel tov from all of your friends in the office: well done. Also, 6,170 local families will benefit from the childcare rebate, which will deliver up to $7½ thousand a year to assist with the cost of full-time child care. We are also looking after older people on fixed incomes and those with disability, as well as their carers. More than 9,200 local pensioners in my electorate are now benefiting from the biggest increase in the pension in 100 years. We have over $200 more being received per fortnight. This budget will keep the economy smart by making investments in education. More than 2,850 eligible families in my electorate, with 5,000 schoolkids, will get help with Labor's Schoolkids Bonus, with $410 per primary school kid and $820 for each high school kid. Of course, Mr Abbott has pledged to abolish those assistances to families with primary and high school students, and this will affect 5,000 children in my electorate. Labor's balanced approach supports both jobs and economic growth with real local rewards such as the one I have outlined. The budget is about making the right choices for Australia's economic growth while keeping Australia fair and supportive of those most in need. The average Australian family with a mortgage of $300,000-not an enormous mortgage these days-is $3½ thousand better off in annual interest rate payments than they were in the last days of the Howard government. That is a measure of which the Treasurer and this government can be very proud. It is a budget which I am proud to present to Melbourne Ports with a government I am proud to be part of. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (12:39): It is a very important principle to have budgets in balance over the economic cycle, something that the Labor Party have been completely incapable of delivering. We have seen Labor go from temporary budget deficits to, now, a string of six budget deficits and budget deficits to come as far as the eye can see. One seasoned Canberra observer described it as the worse budget since 1974. Ross Gittins described it as the strangest pre-election budget he had seen and that any of us were ever likely to see. It is a budget which confirms that the government is in chaos. It is a budget which delivers more debt, more deficits, more taxes, more broken promises and more uncertainty. Families who are struggling with rising cost-of-living pressures will get no reprieve from this budget. In fact, they have already had snatched away from them what was promised in last year's budget. To read last year's budget papers and what was promised then and see what we ended up with is illuminating. Only last year, the Treasurer forecast a surplus of $1.5 billion this year. What he has delivered is a $19.4 billion deficit. Gross debt is likely to exceed $300 billion, and we will be borrowing almost $50 million every single day. The major concern is that those opposite have a spending problem. Every excuse under the sun has been given about revenue, but the problem is a spending problem. Revenue in 2013-14 is almost $80 billion higher than in the last year of the previous coalition government; however, spending is $120 billion higher. This is a government that has lost control of its spending and has spent more than it has earnt from the very first day that it occupied the government benches. Families understand, households understand, the importance of living within your means. As I move around the electorate, I hear a lot of wise heads saying they have seen all this before: Labor will wreck it and the Liberals will come in to fix it. The coalition's real solutions plan will take pressure off households and strengthen our economy so that over time there is more to go around, for everyone. The coalition will abolish the carbon tax, but we will retain the income tax cuts, fortnightly pension and benefit increases associated with it. So, under our plan, people including families will have tax cuts without a carbon tax. We will keep interest rates low by ending government waste, paying back the debt and balancing the budget. We will undertake a commission of audit in government to identify the waste and ensure that government is only as big as it needs to be. A strong economy is the fundamental responsibility of an Australian government. It is key to everything. It means more jobs, higher wages, more government revenue, better services and, eventually, stronger and more cohesive communities. We will cut government red tape by $1 billion per year to give small business and everyone else a break. I would like to focus on some of the specific announcements made in this budget-firstly, the GP MBS freeze. The government will realign the indexation of the MBS fees to the financial year. The indexation, currently on 1 November each year, will now be on 1 July each year. The last indexation date was November 2012 and the next indexation date is 1 July 2014, so there will be no indexation of their schedule fees for 18 months. This is a demonstration of the fact that this is an emergency budget situation. This is a budget in crisis. There is real chance we will see increased out-of-pocket costs for patients. By doing this, the government are pocketing $664 million over four years. It is not a change which will lead to improvements in health care-it has been driven by the budget emergency and by fiscal desperation. This is the end result of years of wasteful government spending and it is the only reason the government have had to make this change. The government have also announced in the budget $10 million for a communications campaign to 'inform Australians about the benefits of Medicare Locals', and $6½ million will be spent in 2012-13. That means that in the next 33 days or so there will be $6½ million spent on informing Australians about the benefits of Medicare Locals, and $3½ million will be spent in 2013-14, presumably by 14 September. At a time when we have a budget emergency and with the sort of budget deficit that we have seen, this is an outrageous waste of taxpayers' money. Just think what $10 million could have done in front-line services; instead we have a $10-million vanity program from the government. I want to touch on South Road in Adelaide. The Leader of the Opposition last month announced that the coalition will support the continuing upgrade of the North-South road corridor in South Australia. This is a $500 million commitment for South Australia and it is a stretch of road that the state and federal Labor governments have been promising to fix since 2006-specific promises, costed promises that have not happened. The coalition understands the importance of a proper non-stop North-South corridor from Darlington to Wingfield. In August 2007 John Howard announced that South Road, south of Sir Donald Bradman Drive, would be added to the National Road Network. The North-South corridor is the RAA's biggest priority in South Australia. It has been understood in South Australia since 2006 that one of the major priorities to address was the South Road-Sturt Road intersection. The RAA's Towards 2020 report said this: Inclusion of this section on the national road network ensures that federal funds can be allocated to major works complementing the State Government's own funding and forward commitments for the upgrade of the ANZAC Highway and Sturt Road intersections. These two locations are the two busiest intersections and most congested on the corridor. The next largest intersection, Grand Junction Road, is located at the far end of the route and has also been identified for improvements in the short term. In this report from 2009, the RAA assumed that the state government and the federal government were going to fix Sturt Road. The South Australian government, in their own discussion paper to update their infrastructure plan, made it very clear that the biggest cause of delay was ANZAC Highway, which was dealt with by the Gallipoli Underpass. The roads coming equal second were Grand Junction Road and Sturt Road. Grand Junction Road has been dealt with by the Superway. After seven years of being in the state's own infrastructure update plan, only two weeks ago-at five minutes to midnight-the federal government announced what they would like to do post-2014 on a different section of the road. According to the RAA, in their traffic surveys, none of the major north-south arterial roads in the south meet minimal, acceptable standards for travel times during peak travel. In 2012, the RAA said that motorists are opting to take Goodwood Road, which is also slow and congested, as an alternative to South Road. The upgrades to South Road need to be completed to reduce the pressure on Goodwood Road and ease congestion around the city. In the latest RAA traffic survey, they found for a commuter who travels from Majors Road, O'Halloran Hill, all the way down Main South Road, Ayliffes Road, Fiveash Drive and Goodwood Road into the city that nearly all sections of this road fall far below minimum standards, but the section between Majors Road and Flinders Drive is the worse with cars inching forward at just 11 kilometres an hour during the morning peak. This is followed closely by the stretch near Sturt Road, which averages 14 kilometres an hour. When you look at the Southern Expressway, for someone travelling from Morphett Vale into Bedford Park-this is a 100-kilometre-an-hour expressway-the slowest sections during the afternoon are before Sturt Road and also between Sturt Road and Flinders Drive. Here vehicles slow to just 25 kilometres an hour-well below the acceptable level. In the morning, traffic generally moves at an acceptable speed, but with major congestion around Sturt Road. Unfortunately, the announcements by federal Labor on South Road in this budget will not address this traffic congestion. What we see is a whole lot of roads-Marion Road, South Road, Goodwood Road, Belair-Unley Road and Fullarton Road-falling below the threshold level of 30 kilometres an hour during peak times. Completing the entire north-south corridor upgrade will benefit residents right across metropolitan South Australia. A failure to invest in infrastructure over decades has seen increasing traffic congestion and transit times throughout Adelaide. The RAA have been advocating for a true north-south corridor for years. They have stated that improving the South Road corridor will greatly decrease traffic pressure on other arterial roads like Marion Road, Brighton Road, Goodwood Road and Belair Road. The stretch of South Road at Darlington is the most congested part of South Road that is yet to see any upgrades. This is outlined in the state government's strategic infrastructure plan discussion paper. This state government document clearly identifies Darlington as the next priority for the north-south corridor upgrade. The north-south corridor upgrade needs to be done in stages, and Darlington is clearly the next step. The coalition has committed $500 million for reconfiguration of South Road between the Southern Expressway and north of Sturt Road, to expressway standard, for underpasses below Flinders Drive and Sturt Road, and for connection of the Darlington interchange with the Southern Expressway to provide for two-way flow. We have not just plucked this out of the air. These were actually Labor Party promises at a state level in 2006 and 2010,and federal Labor promises in 2007. They promised them, they costed them; they just did not do them. In addition, the coalition will work with the SA government to develop a business case for this project and for the remaining sections of the north-south corridor over time. We understand that the entire north-south corridor upgrade is a major project that will take many years, but we will work with the SA government to make it happen over time. We expect construction to begin with in the first term of a future coalition government. This is something that, on behalf of my constituents, I have been fighting for since 2007. I am proud to say that a coalition government will follow through on its commitment and upgrade the stretch of South Road at Darlington near Flinders University and Flinders Medical Centre. This will make a massive difference to traffic congestion and to commuters in the south. Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (12:53): I speak in support of the appropriation legislation. This legislation is about making Australia stronger, smarter and fairer, and making the Ipswich and Somerset regions in south-east Queensland stronger, smarter and fairer. We are supporting jobs and growth-I will outline how that happens in the budget-and we are also making it smarter, through our historic investments in the national plan for school improvement, and making it fairer by delivering DisabilityCare Australia to 3,800 people with disability in the Blair electorate, and 4,300 carers who care for them. In really challenging times-at a time when revenue write-downs have made a huge impact on the budget-this federal Labor government has made a very big commitment to jobs, growth and economic development. We have seen the economy grow by 13 per cent-five times faster than the US and Germany-since we have been in power and since the global financial crisis. We have seen 960,000 jobs created while the rest of the world has seen about 28 million jobs lost during this time. We have a AAA credit rating and have kept inflation low. And people in my electorate are paying, on average, about $100 less in terms of interest payments every week than they were under the coalition government led by John Howard. So this government has been economically responsible but has invested strategically in Ipswich and Somerset as well is in Queensland generally. I will talk about a couple of portfolio areas before I talk about the local issues in my electorate. First, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-GeneralI am pleased to see the increase in legal aid funding. The previous coalition government gutted legal aid funding in this country. Everyone knows it, they know it, the law societies know it, the bar associations know it. The impact on disadvantaged and disabled people, Indigenous and low-income Australians was felt very tragically and the systems in the courts were clogged as a result of the coalition's attitude to legal aid. We have reversed this in large part. In our first budget we put in about $53 million extra in legal aid funding in 2008 and we have increased legal aid funding in this budget. We have increased legal aid funding over the next two years to legal aid commissions by an additional $30 million on top of the $420 million already allocated. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services received a $12 million boost, and it was a great privilege to call Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander services around the country to advise them of that increase and to speak with people like Shane Duffy from Queensland, to talk to him and see the impact that that is going to have on the services they deliver not just in Queensland but throughout the country.",170,Bills
250,Mr Neumann (Blair,"Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing andCommunity legal centres will be boosted by $10 million over four years, and this is in addition to the $32 million they received this financial year and the $160 million since federal Labor came to office. The contribution of 138 community legal centres to this country cannot be underestimated in creating a fairer society. Sadly, in my home state of Queensland the LNP state government under Campbell Newman has seen fit to cut funding to legal aid, to legal services and to community legal centres, to get rid of the drug courts, the Murri courts, to get rid of funding to organisations that help those in need. They reckon they are tough on crime but they are not tough on crime, they are not even tough on the causes of crime. They are more interested in boot camps than they should be and they are obsessed about those sorts of things. At the same time they are happy to boot out tenants in Housing Commission facilities across Queensland and in low income areas in my electorate like Riverview and Redbank Plains and elsewhere. That is what they are doing at this time. We have budgeted for an increase in funding to those types of services, having to step in last year with $3 million. We have stepped in again with $2.5 million at a time when Liberal governments around the country do not have a problem with this, nor do Labor governments' tenancy advice services, but the Campbell Newman government did. So we have provided funding recently in relation to this budgetary item. I am very pleased to see what we have done in that regard. I am also pleased as Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing to see the commitment that we have made in relation to two independent clinical registers for cardiac devices and breast implants, a $5.1 million commitment. We have got several successful clinical registers run by medical craft groups, professional organisations. These are in relation to jointsshoulders, hips et cetera-and these registers we are going to create follow in the footsteps of the National Joint Replacement Register established by the Australian Orthopaedic Association in 1998 with the help of the Australian government. That is a budgetary item of about $5.1 million and I am pleased to see that happen. I am pleased too that we have followed up the commitment we announced on 7 April this year in supporting what is now known as paid leave for living organ donors. It is a $2.6 million commitment. It means that if you wish to donate, say, a kidney, and 90 per cent of living donors donate a kidney, or partial a liver, you will get paid to employers six weeks of salary support to be passed on to the donor, who usually gives that kidney to a loved one or a close friend, often to a child or spouse or partner. This is the commitment over two years and we will review and consider outcomes of the trial in early 2015. Living donors make an incredibly generous offer. We believe this act of kindness should be financially supported. Clinicians tell us that the six-week period is appropriate, that it will be paid at the minimum rate of pay, the national minimum wage, which is $606.40 a week. I reject the headline on the Sunday Telegraph which talks about 'Cash the kidneys'-it is completely erroneous. The six-week period is for two weeks of pre-surgery evaluation and four weeks for the convalescence. Living donors will be able to apply to the Department of Human Services and the funding will be paid to their employers by the DHS. I am very pleased to see those sorts of items. We have also provided another $800,000 to the Food and Health Dialogue, which I chaired at a roundtable this morning. That money will continue the good work done to take about 2,200 tons of sodium out of our food on staples such as bread and cereals. The work being done by the Australian Food and Grocery Council, the Australian Heart Foundation, other health providers and other interested parties is making a difference. That $800,000 has been budgeted for as well. We have a record amount of funding for health and hospital services, particularly contrasting the LNP government in Queensland, which sacked 4,140 public servants, frontline doctors, nurses and clinicians, and gutted $3 billion out of the health system. We are increasing funding to Queensland a record $3 billion, an extra $1.1 billion across the forward estimates to hospitals in Queensland. At a time when the coalition in Queensland sees fit to defund services, we are increasing services to Queensland and nothing contrasts more to Queensland in the budget we have produced compared to the LNP government in Queensland, and more so to those opposite. Let me give a couple of illustrations of that. In my electorate we have a number of rural towns. We have a little town called Esk at the heart of the Somerset region where there is a civic centre opened with $2 million of federal government money, through the Regional Infrastructure Fund. Those opposite opposed itthey opposed every last cent. We see in this budget $500,000 for the Kilcoy show grounds upgrade. Those opposite opposed it. We have just announced another $500,000 for the Toogoolawah arts and cultural project to the Summerset Regional Council, which will revitalise Esk, Kilcoy and Toogoolawah. Those opposite claim they support regional and rural areas, but they oppose the funding for them. When it comes to road funding, the budget contrasts what we say compared to those opposite. Election after election, vote after vote, those opposite have opposed the Ipswich Motorway upgrade between Ipswich and Brisbane-every election. They went to the last federal election with a policy to stop construction on the Ipswich Motorway. That is what Warren Truss, the Leader of the National Party, announced: stop construction and put 10,000 jobs in south-east Queensland at risk. This budget, having provided $2.5 billion or more in previous budgets, we have provided for the last section of the Ipswich Motorway $279 million. The first instalment, the down payment, is on the Darra to Rocklea section, all in the electorate of the member for Moreton and a bit in the electorate of the member for Oxley. My electors in Blair use it every day on their way to and from Brisbane. Those opposite have not said a word about this. The LNP candidates in Blair and Oxley are hiding from the media. That is what the Queensland Times records on their front page. The LNP candidates in Oxley and Blair are hiding and will not make one cent of a commitment. It took the Leader of the Opposition five years, six months and 16 days to come to the electorate of Blair. He does not announce a dollar in his budget reply speech to our community. He does not even tell the local media he will be there so that you will look at the transcript of what happened. There is nothing on local issues, no commitment to the Ipswich Motorway and no commitment to Kilcoy, Esk or Toogoolawah. Nothing there. But in the budget, we provide those sorts of things. What a contrast between those opposite-who could not care less about regional and rural Queensland-and us. What about important rail projects in Queensland? What about the Brisbane Cross River Rail? Having agreed with the LNP Lord Mayor of Brisbane, the Brisbane council and the LNP Queensland state government, and having signed up memoranda of understanding, with letters back and forward, we agreed to provide money in the budget. We provided $715 million towards the construction of this core project-10 kilometres of new underground tunnel-from Yeerongpilly to Victoria Park. There will be four new underground stations that will help increase the capacity of the Brisbane rail network. And the member for Brisbane opposes it. The LNP members opposite oppose it. They claim they support Brisbane and South-East Queensland. This is a rail project for all of South-East Queensland-for members in Oxley, Blair, Moreton, Brisbane, Griffith, Ryan and Bonner. But those opposite oppose it. They need to get onto their colleagues and comrades in Queensland and tell them to not bother turning up to the events when we are announcing it. We agreed with the Queensland government to do it and we put a record amount of funding into road projects. All the opposition leader can say is that he will do parts of the Bruce Highway. They put in $1 billion in 11½ years for the Bruce Highway in Queenslandwe put in over $8 billion. Look at a map of the Bruce Highway and a map of Queensland. There is project after project done by this government. Those opposite are opposed to one of the most important projects currently under construction in South-East Queensland: the Blacksoil Interchange. It is the most important project, said the mayor of the council of southEast Queensland. It is a $93.4 million project and the federal government put $54 million into it. Those opposite voted against it again and again. It is now under construction. There are 100-odd jobs being created by Fulton Hogan, the construction company. That is the difference between Labor governments and conservative governments. We invest. We believe in jobs, growth and economic development in Queensland-those opposite oppose jobs, growth and economic development in Queensland. We believe in disability care-those opposite have more positions than you could poke a stick at. We believe in national improvement in schools-those opposite believe in school autonomy and class sizes going up. That is their only answer. We believe in making sure that every kid gets an opportunity and every child, whether they be from a working-class background in Ipswich or a rural community in Somerset, gets a chance in life. This budget is all about jobs, growth and economic development. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame that they oppose so many budget measures. They oppose everything that is for the benefit of Queensland, everything that is for the benefit of Ipswich and everything that is for the benefit of the Somerset Region. Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (13:08): The electorate of Forrest has not been well served by the 2013 Labor budget. But then for the last six years it has not been well served by the Labor government, by either the Rudd or Gillard Labor governments. We all know that the budget has a number of very questionable and rubbery fiscal predictions, but none more so than those on the carbon tax. The Labor Party has had a reality check on its carbon tax, which was effectively the EU saying, 'Tell 'em they're dreaming!' Following the set carbon price next year of $29 a tonne, the reality of forward estimates shows an expected carbon price of $12.10 from 1 July 2015, based on EU carbon-trading price predictions. That is in the budget figures and is another questionable assumption. We all know-certainly in my electorate-that the carbon tax is a major cost for business and industry. Collie is one of those great centres of industry in the south-west and a place where a fair proportion of the electricity for Western Australia is produced. The annual carbon outputs of the major electricity generators in Collie are, for Muja Power Station, five million tonnes of CO2; Collie A, 2.2 million tonnes; and Bluewaters 1 and 2, 2.6 million tonnes. That is a total of 9.8 million tonnes. With Labor's carbon tax high of $29 a tonne, this puts the Gillard government carbon tax cost to the Collie industries at $284 million in the 2014 financial year. They are costs that have to be recouped. Even with the cost expected to come down to $12.10 per tonne in 2015, the impact on the power generators in Collie will still be $118 million. A coalition government will provide the best savings for Collie industry and for people throughout my electorate of Forrest by scrapping what is an altogether punitive and ineffective carbon tax. The reality of linking the Australian and EU carbon prices is a great big $6 billion black hole-at least, and countingin Labor's budget. I would have thought that a $6 billion budget black hole would have left the Treasurer red-faced. Of course, with the government's duplicitous approach to aged care, there should actually be more than one red face. The government's changes to aged-care funding which came into effect on 1 July last year, under the misnomer Living Longer Living Better, shows that they have no understanding of the issues facing small regional aged-care service providers and clearly no intention of trying to understand the additional costs of providing a quality aged-care service in regional and rural areas. When the Labor government unveiled their plan last year, they deliberately failed to tell the Australian people that this program is in fact an attempt to claw back $750 million from the aged-care sector over the next 2½ years-another short-term budget fix. The real result, as opposed to the misrepresentations of the government, is that residential aged-care providers will get less funding for new patients than they got for patients last year. The 2013-14 budget alone will see $500 million of ACFI funding ripped out of a sector that is already doing it tough. In aged care, as it has in child care, the Labor government has sought to enhance union control and government interference. It offers more money for wages, but to get it can cost providers more than they receive. Aged and Community Services WA estimates that an agedcare provider who operates a small 31-bed regional facility would be eligible to receive $17,000 under the workforce supplement principles but, in order to receive this, would have to commit to an additional $30,000 in wages. The Labor government's response to the crisis in aged care is to provide less support and simply more union bosses in control. So who are they looking after? Is it aged Australians or union leaders? As I said, their response to child care appears to be the same. Again Labor is prepared to sacrifice, in my view, our children's opportunities for the sake of union leadership. The budget for natural resource management has also taken a hit from the Labor government in 2013, and as a very passionate advocate for practical, effective environmental management, and certainly for the issue of biosecurity in the south-west, I cannot believe that we have seen more funding disappear from the flagship for local cooperation on environmental outcomes, a key part of delivering outcomes on the ground and developed by the Howard government. That is another $145 million taken out of the NRM budget to be redirected into pet projects picked by the government, which you would have to question. Either way, it shows that the Labor government has contempt for the good works and community engagement that the NRM actually was developed to deliver, and does. I know that about 96 per cent of farmers have historically been actively involved with NRM groups. With issues like Phytophthora dieback still not adequately addressed in my region and many others, the contempt Labor shows for the environment cannot pass unremarked. Dieback response is a critical issue for the south-west of Western Australia. Beyond this one pathogen, the issue of climate change adaptation needs to be better addressed, and it is the NRM groups on the ground in regional Australia that will be best placed to manage that adaptation. Preparing for changing rainfall patterns and managing invasive weed and pest species are best handled at the local level on the ground, as is bushfire control. The Howard government understood this and invested heavily in regional capacity through the NRM process. It is not the time to be undermining that investment given the issues on the ground. I want to touch on the issue of cybersafety, which is quite relevant here today. We know that 2.4 billion people in the world are on the internet and one billion are on Facebook. There is probably no greater threat to the safety of our citizens, especially our young people, and, more broadly, the business sector than the misuse of this great resource. The internet is not just a great asset; it may also be a great risk factor. This is why cybersafety is such an important issue. We know that cybercriminals are becoming constantly more sophisticated. We need an Australian population that is much more cybersavvy than we are now. As the reach of the internet expands and develops, with constantly changing IT and faster speeds, the threat grows proportionately. This is why it is so important to educate Australians on how to protect themselves and their families. According to Telstra, Aussie kids aged between 10 and 17 are online for an average of two hours a day, amongst the highest internet usage rates in the world. We need to address whether this is two hours a day of safety, enjoyment and learning or two hours a day of risk. This is a national problem that needs a national, coordinated solution. I know first hand that education is the key. I believe it needs to be part of the national curriculum. The only way to assist people, particularly young people, is to help them to protect themselves. I see that happening as a key part of the school curriculum, so that current and future generations will know how to protect themselves. I have delivered countless cybersafety presentations in schools across the length and breadth of my electorate in the past three years. I recognised early the risk and the threat to our great young people. I want them to be aware, alert and better prepared to protect themselves. I see the need as so great that I am prepared to spend as much time as I can in helping to educate them. I want to teach them how to be safe. EquallyI want to help parents-and I do-to help their children to be safe. I believe that young people are part of the answer in managing the risk. They are great ones to educate their parents and their grandparents as well as subsequent generations. This should be an Australia-wide activity. The only way to deliver cybersafety is to put in into the national curriculum. It is impossible to look at cybersafety without looking at the provision of internet services more generally. In regions like mine, the government is playing catch-up to the coalition's broadband policy, which will bring better broadband sooner to everyone in the south-west of WA, including Margaret River, Augusta and Cowaramup residents. We have been waiting six years so far and nothing has changed. It is totally unacceptable that many regional peoplesix years after Labor's first election promise-are still unable to connect to broadband or are extremely frustrated by slow internet speeds. People tell me constantly that all they want is a decent internet speed. They just want to have access, for a start. People will receive better broadband sooner under a coalition government. By the end of 2016, everyone will be able to enjoy speeds of at least 25 megabits per second and certainly better mobile coverage. The right thing to do for the people of the Forrest electorate is to get the speeds up to a level that at least enables people to do everything they want to, whether it is at home or at work. We know the government never even did a cost-benefit analysis of the NBN. We will do that, and I am positive that will show that regional areas like mine will benefit from improved broadband under the coalition. We will offer a mix of fibre to the node, wireless and satellite, and the cost will be about a third of Labor's at least $94 billion cost. That was the figure that early on was exactly what those who worked in the industry were telling the engineers and others. The system will be flexible enough for upgrades. Constantly, as technology improves and demand increases it is going to keep changing. It is not going to stay the same. We know that the government's NBN is going to bypass communities like I have with less than 1,000 premises. That includes a lot of small towns in Forrest. This group of communities will rely on wireless and satellite connections with their slower connection speeds. In contrast, our plan will deliver fibre to the node and direct connection by a copper cable to many of these residents, and-a really important and critical thing for people in my electorate-we are actually going to improve mobile coverage at the same time. How often is this raised with me? It is a constant issue. So many small regional communities will be much better off under a coalition plan. This will be the legacy of a coalition government, amongst other things, if we are lucky and fortunate enough to be successful in September. I look and think of what Labor's legacy will be: we do know that this will be a legacy of budget mismanagement, budget deficits and what will be intergenerational fiscal debt, without any question. They are going to leave a total gross debt breaching the $300 billion-debt ceiling within the forward estimates. We have structural deficits now. They will leave record net debt of $192 billion-$192 billion! That is $35 million a day in interest alone. And, of course, record deficits over five years and at least two more deficits to come. There is no credible pathway to surplus in what we have seen from the Labor government. Unfortunately for Australia and Australianspeople in my electorate-this will be the legacy. There is going to have to be a significant amount of consistent surpluses to go anywhere near paying off at least $300 billion in debt. $300 billion! People have got so used to hearing the word 'billion' that they actually do not think a much it is, and how tough that is to pay off. Of course, no amount of spin can erase the impact that this debt legacy is going to have on future generations of Australians. What do you need to deal with this? Labor has not dealt with it in the last six years. You actually need a fair bit of discipline. You need some experience and you need to put a lot more confidence back into people; people and businesses on the ground and people in my electorate-whether they are in families or small business,. No matter what business you are in, you need some confidence. We have not seen any confidence on the ground with people, and no wonder when you look at what we have seen: just a chaotic process throughout this government. But as I said: when you think of people looking back on this Labor government, what will they see? They will see a debt ceiling of over $300 billion breached. The debt and deficit are just unbelievable. They are really unbelievable! When you actually talk to people about this they cannot believe that there is no plan, that Labor has no plan, 'We actually ran up the debt but we have no plan to pay it off'. Here we are, six years on with a Labor government, and there is no plan to pay off a debt and deficit that they have created in this time in government. (Time expired) reminder that the economic debate in this country has become so forced and fake. We get unmerciful spin from the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, at the member for North Sydney, the shadow minister, rather than a serious contribution to economic debate in this country. Of course, unfortunately, that unmerciful spin from the opposition drives the government I think by necessity, to enter into the spin game. The general public out there must be wondering what in the hell is going on in the Australian economy and what is going on in terms of fiscal management. Never these days do we hear the opposition leader take up the fight in some ideological sense; a debate about where we want our country to be in 10 or 20 years time both in economic terms and in terms of our social fabric-what will be the key drivers of increases in economic wealth and how we can best evenly distribute that wealth throughout our community. The Leader of the Opposition does not want to have that debate. It is called a small-target strategy. That is what the opposition leader has embraced. He wants to roll himself up in a small ball, say nothing controversial and ride the wave into government. Well, we have other plans for him. He does, of course, go down the path of ideology on the rare occasion. The most obvious standouts come to the surface when he is talking about the carbon price and the mining tax. Why? Because these are articles of faith for the opposition leader. These are policies which from our perspective are responsible and make absolute sense in public policy terms but from his perspective are just another weight on some of the largest companies in this country. It is his ideological position to always oppose any additional responsibility on those big companies. But, other than paid parental leave, the baby bonus and superannuation, we are not really having a serious economic debate in this country. We are not, because of the small-target strategy adopted by the Leader of the Opposition in not having a serious debate about where we want this country to go. All the opposition leader can do is attack the Treasury on the forecasts it delivers to the government-forecasts which the government relies upon when framing and shaping its budget-and then time after time after time again talk about the level of government debt, which of course by international standards is very low and is a direct consequence of the stimulus initiatives this government put in place post the global financial crisis to successfully keep this country out of recession. We have a plan to retire that debt. We have a solid plan to return the budget to surplus and to retire that debt. This has been a responsible budget. That plan is a slow and steady plan, one which puts us back on the path to surplus without taking a sledgehammer to the",177,Bills
251,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (13:23,"The contribution from the member for Forrest is aAustralian economy, not acting on a way which is going to be a brake on further growth, which would impact negatively on the economy and therefore affect jobs in the economy. I have said in this place many, many times that, when I was first elected here, 17 years ago, I coined the famous Neville Wran-the former New South Wales Premier-phrase: 'There are only three issues in politics. They are jobs, jobs and jobs.' I have been very proud of the fact that since I have been representing the Hunter electorate we have gone from an unemployment rate of about 13 per cent to something like 3½ per cent. MaybeI should repeat that, because it is pretty hard to believe: from 13 per cent to 3½ per cent. At the moment it is rising, and these are challenges for us. It is mainly rising because the heat has come out of the mining boom, so we are going from 3½ probably back up to what might be described as our natural rate of unemployment-I would like to think so, because that is very low still, but we are going back to a higher rate of unemployment. This is what makes it so important that at this point in the economic cycle we do not take that sledgehammer to the Australian economy. The Leader of the Opposition says he would have us return to surplus more quickly, yet he is going to abolish all the revenue which flows from the carbon price. He is going to abolish the mining tax. And let us not forget that, while the mining tax is not raising what Treasury had originally predicted it would raise, it is still raising a significant amount of money. Some of that money, I am very happy to say, is being returned to my electorate in the form of infrastructure expenditure. There is no magic pudding here. You cannot say you are going to spend more and take less in revenue and say you are going to go back to surplus more quickly. If he is going to go down that path, he is going to put a big brake on the Australian economy. That would be bad news for my constituents at a time when unemployment is creeping back up to around five per cent. I should be very happy that the election of Tony Abbott is not a fait accompli. I do not believe it is a fait accompli. I believe that, as we approach the election, people will have a look at what this Labor government has achieved and give us some credit for it. Let me talk about the Hunter electorate. The $1.7 billion Hunter Expressway is something that I have been fighting for since the early 1990s, a project which was on track when we lost government in 1996 and which stagnated for 12 years under the leadership of John Howard and his government. Having had a Labor government plan it, it took a Labor government to fund it and build it, which it did, thankfully, in 2008. By Christmas this year, Hunter residents and others will be driving their vehicles along that Hunter expressway. In the most recent budget, we got $45 million to address a very serious problem in Scone in my electorate, a significant town with a major highway through itridiculously cut off by a level railway crossing for up to eight minutes these days because of the length of coal trains-a very welcome investment in my local electorate. All members in this place, including the member for Barker, have had their schools refurbished. We have all been to the school openings-I have done more than 80 of them. These are facilities which cannot be described as wants of the communities; these are needs. I had classes sitting on the floor in school halls, and many in unacceptable demountable buildings, before we embarked on this investment program in our schools. I have a new TAFE college, new trades training centres, new science labs and new community colleges. The list goes on and on and on. We have had a huge investment in social housing. These are projects which were on the books of the state governments but would never have been funded if it were not for the stimulus package put forward by this government. We are also investing in housing infrastructure, like roads in inner Maitland to allow the council to open new building blocks for affordable housing-something they were not able to do previously because as a developer they were not able to meet the infrastructure costs. We have more money for all of our local hospitals. We have more GPs than ever before. We have new GP clinics in Lochinvar, Greta and Denman, and we are about to have one in Kurri Kurri. The list goes on and on and on. This is a government with a deep-seated commitment to economic and social infrastructure in this country. These are projects that people have been crying out for for many, many years, projects John Howard could have funded in 12 years of government because he had rivers of gold in that first phase of the mining boom but projects he did not address. In not doing so, he had a deep impact on productivity in this country. Whenever you hear Tony Abbott try to explain how his magic pudding is going to work, he goes to productivity, but he never explains how he is going to lift it-but we do get a hint of Work Choices in there. There is no doubt about that. He goes to the cutting of Public Service jobs and more efficient running of government. We have heard that before. John Howard did that in 1996. He took a knife to the Public Service, only to have Public Service employment restored to a higher level three years later. There is no magic solution in this budget, and I believe this budget got it absolutely right. This is a message for both sides of the parliament and for the broader community. Beginning with John Howard, when we were in that first mining boom, we started to give people more and more of what they wanted. He did not do anything like the investment in infrastructure we have done, but there was money spent on infrastructure. I think there was an increase in infrastructure spending, particularly on the national highway network. We were awash with middle-class welfare. Since his days, we have had pension increases, healthy wage rises and significant increases in public expenditure. Most of that expenditure, of course, has been welfare. On the other side of the equation, there is a growing expectation of smaller government and smaller taxes. So everyone wants more money spent on everything, including health and education, but they want the government to take less money, they want the government to tax them less. I am talking about individuals and companies. At the same time, in response to community expectations, we have put a constraint on the economy in terms of the carbon price-an initiative begun by John Howard. If you recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, John Howard had a policy to put in place an emissions trading scheme, Malcolm Turnbull had one, Brendan Nelson had one. In fact. Tony Abbott has one now with the same commitment to a greenhouse gas reduction target as the government. So we have all got this commitment to a carbon constraint. Why? Because the community has been making it pretty clear that a carbon constraint is what it wants. But at the same time we want to compensate everyone for any consumer impacts of the carbon constraint; indeed, we are compensating industry as well and, in fact, we are subsidising the renewable industry to meet these community expectations. These are not initiatives that give us a net income stream; they give us a net outflow. I do not see anything ahead which suggests a huge increase in our population. We have an ageing population, like most Western countries, so there is no great hope of any windfall in terms of population or demographics. We do not have any magic solution, despite what the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, might say on the productivity front, albeit we should always be working for greater productivity, and we do. But there is no magic solution ahead for us and so the community, while it calls for a more efficient government-as it should-is going to have to decide what it wants. Does it want more expenditure or does it want lower taxes? There is no magic pudding. It is no different from the family budget: only so much income is coming in and only so much expenditure can go out-unless, of course, you want to continue to rack up debt, and that is unsustainable in the long term. That is why the government has a plan to retire debt. The community has to come with the political parties on this question. We have developed an expectation that we can have our cake and eat it too. The reality, in this global environment in particular, is that there are no easy solutions. We cannot expect growth to accelerate dramatically any time soon, particularly given the very long period it is going to take the Europeans to come out of recession, given the sluggishness of the US economy and given the relative sluggishness of many of the Asian communities, more particularly China. This is all part of the reason we have to ensure that in communities like those I represent we take maximum benefit from the opportunities that serve us now. That means doing all we can to allow the mining companies to stay afloat through this difficult time and to take the new opportunities like the coal seam gas industry which I spoke about in the House yesterday, an industry which has the potential to bring great wealth to our communities with a minimal footprint. There will be some projects that might not be appropriate because of threats to watertables, for example, but there will be projects that can bring significant wealth to the Hunter and create many jobs in the Hunter with minimum, if any, environmental impact. We should not close our eyes to those opportunities. Some would have the coal mining industry and the CSG industry closed down in the Hunter. Well, what fools they are. Our unemployment rate would go through the roof overnight. It is important to our local economy and we all need to be standing behind it. interesting issue: people expect more services, more products, more government help but they also want lower taxes. We all know that does not add up. What we really have to try and do is achieve the best use of taxpayers' money and more efficient use of taxpayers' money and not throw it away on things like pink batts, which this government did. I hasten to say also that I think you will find this election will be unusual in that there will not be a lot of promises out there for huge extra parcels of funding. I think in some ways that is a good thing. It is a good thing that people are starting to realise that we cannot keep up the continual spending of money that this Labor government has done in the nearly six years it has been in power. He raised another point, about subsidising green industry. But unfortunately we have the perverse result, now, of poor people subsidising rich people, who can afford to put the solar panels on their roofs. That is one of the perverse results of subsidising industries. Those who most need the help to reduce their power costs-which have come about as a result of the carbon tax and other policies of this government-are not helped at all.",184,Bills
252,Mr Secker (Barker,"Opposition Whip) (13:38): The member for Hunter raised anI was very disappointed with Labor's budget, but I was not alone in that. In my lifetime I have never seen such little and poor comment about a budget as we had this year. It was a very interesting phenomenon that we did not have much comment. I think there was not much expectation. Certainly the feeling I get out in the electorate is: 'The sooner we can get rid of this government the better. We have made up our minds; let's just get to the election as quickly as possible.' This budget is in deficit for the fifth time in a row. The government promised last year that they will finally deliver years of surpluses-in fact they said they were delivering surpluses this year and the next three years-and we never thought that was achievable by this government, and we have been confirmed correct. It just further confirms the government's inability to manage money. It confirms that Labor's financial and budget management is in complete chaos-a stark contrast to the Howard government's strong economic record and consecutive surpluses. We achieved that through careful management. In my lifetime I have seen three Labor governments. We had the Whitlam government from 1972 to 1975. I certainly remember their attempt to borrow $4 billion outside the normal constraints of government borrowing. That was nearly 40 years ago. I have not done the sums of what $4 billion would be worth today, but it would have to be something between $30 billion and $40 billion. The Whitlam government was trying to borrow that money outside the normal way. In fact, they tried to borrow it from the Baathist Party, of all places, which was Suddam Hussein's Party in Iran. The Whitlam government racked up debt and spending, and that is certainly in the DNA of Labor whenever they have come to government. The second Labor government that I lived through was the Hawke and Keating governments. I point out to a lot of people that from Federation, in 1901, to 1991-in that 90 years-the government accumulated $16 billion of debt. We had to fund two wars, and as we all know they take a lot of extra funding that you would not normally spend. We had other skirmishes along the way. We built Canberra. We built the law courts, and certainly the federal government had to spend a lot of money over that 90 years. In fact, there was $16 billion accumulated debt over 90 years. But in the next five years the Hawke-Keating government repeated that 90-year block of debt every year for the next five years, so that when we came into government there was $96 billion worth of debt. That was a record debt, until we got this government. We are already up to $176 billion of net debt. We have a gross debt which is going to go well over the $300 billion mark. Certainly that is a record in anyone's history books, by a long, long way. That is the problem with Labor: they do not know how to manage the budget. They promise surpluses but deliver deficits. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, recognises that like families and businesses we have to live within our means. And it is with this guiding principle that we were able to deliver surplus after surplus when we were in government. It will also be the guiding principle for any incoming coalition government. interrupted. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for a later hour.

It being approximately 1.45 pm the debate isTax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. indicate our support for this bill. It is, as members would be aware, a bill that comes before the parliament after each budget each year. As the Assistant Treasurer pointed out in his introductory remarks the day after the budget, it is important to amend the Medicare Levy Act to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds in line with the consumer price index. Otherwise, as he pointed out, it would be the case that those who were exempt from the Medicare levy in the previous income year without that adjustment-without that increase in line with inflation-would not continue to remain exempt. As the Assistant Treasurer is probably also aware, he and I have discussed this legislation most years when it has come in, and so when people look back at the record of the parliament in a hundred years they will think that the member for Lindsay and the member for Casey were experts in the field of the Medicare levy threshold. This has happened every year: it happened under our government. I will correct myself there: it did not happen one year, I recall, and that was when inflation was negative and there was no need for any adjustment. We support this piece of housekeeping legislation. (15:32): I would like to take the opportunity to thank the member for Casey for his contribution not just today but for all of those Medicare levy bills that have seen the threshold increased to ensure that low-income earners do not have to contribute to the Medicare levy until such time as they reach that threshold. The Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy) Bill 2013 amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold for families in line with the consumer price index. The families threshold amount is to be increased from $32,743 to $33, 693 so that families in this cohort do not pay the Medicare levy when they do not have a tax liability. For each dependent child this threshold increases, and the amount this threshold increases will also change from $3,007 to $3,094. The amendments to the Medicare levy lowincome thresholds apply to the 2012-13 year of income and to future income years. The Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and pensioners have already been increased for 2012-13 as part of the Clean Energy Future Plan Household Assistance Package. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of members of the Penrith Christian School, from my electorate, who are visiting Canberra today and to welcome them as they get an insight into the way in which important legislation is passed through this place.

255,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. This tax law amendment bill has eight schedules. Some of those schedules the coalition supports. Some of those schedules we will not be opposing. As a consequence, I say at the outset that the coalition will not be opposing the passage of this tax law amendment bill. On behalf of the shadow Treasurer, I will run through the relevant schedules, six of which relate to tax and two of which relate to superannuation. Schedule1 deals with the definition of 'documentary' for film tax offset purposes. The schedule amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to define 'documentary' in accordance with the Australian Communications and Media Authority guidelines and to restore its intended meaning. 'Documentary' in tax law, for film tax offset purposes, becomes 'a creative treatment of actuality that is not an infotainment or lifestyle program or a magazine program'. As the explanatory memorandum and the detail of the bill make clear, the schedule also clarifies that the exclusion of light entertainment programs from film tax offset eligibility does extend to game shows. This is done by adding game shows to the list of light entertainment programs explicitly excluded from film tax offset eligibility. The offset is designed to encourage Australian investment in film production. These amendments are a response to litigation-the decision in the Lush House case-where the taxpayer successfully argued that their infotainment-like production Lush House, a six-part television series, qualified as a documentary for film tax offset eligibility purposes. As this judicial interpretation was wider than the intention of the original policy, amendments were proposed to make the legislative boundaries clearer around documentary and game shows and restore the original intent and the integrity of the offset. This proposal was announced in the budget of 8 May 2012. The amended definition applies from 1 July last year. The coalition considers these amendments-primarily a response to the decision in that case that I mentioned-to be sensible integrity measures that better target eligibility for, and access to, the key film industry tax concession. Schedule2 of the bill deals with ex gratia payments for natural disasters and amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax any ex gratia disaster income recovery subsidy that was received by individuals who lost income, whether as an employee, small business person or farmer, as a direct result of the floods that occurred in Queensland from 21 January this year. It also exempts from income tax the ex gratia payment for the eligible New Zealand special category visa holders, equivalent to the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment, made in relation to the natural disasters occurring across Australia in the financial years of 2011-12 and 2012-13. These exemptions apply to payments relating to disasters occurring in those financial years, and the coalition supports these amendments in schedule 2. Schedule3 deals with the GST instalment system and amends the goods and services tax law to enable entities that are paying their GST by instalments and subsequently moving to a",189,Bills
256,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (15:35,"I rise to speak, on behalf of the shadow Treasurer,net refund position to continue to pay their GST by instalments, albeit a zero-instalment amount if they choose to. The purpose of this is to address an issue in the current law which leads to otherwise eligible entities being excluded from the GST instalment system, when they move to a net refund position, and therefore lose the compliance-cost advantages of submitting their BAS, their business activity statement, annually. It otherwise has to be submitted quarterly. This amendment will allow entities that use the instalment option and move into a net refund position to choose to continue to pay their GST instalments and therefore retain the compliance-cost advantages they see in annual reporting. Somewhat ironically, the choice to remain in the GST instalment system provides the entity with compliance-cost advantages with not having to complete a quarterly BAS. The amendments result in those entities that decide to remain in that system receiving their refund after they have submitted their annual return. The option for GST instalment payers to elect, where it suits them, for a lower BAS compliance cost is available from 1 July, after royal assent. It gives those businesses the choice in that system. It will benefit only a small proportion of businesses and not-for-profit organisations. It will reduce compliance costs for electing entities, in an ongoing sense. There will be some transitional costs by those that elect but presumably they will choose the overall benefits to outweigh those costs. The coalition supports these amendments, albeit quite technically and narrowly applicable ones, but they have our support. We do note that this was announced two budgets ago, on 10 May 2011, and we do wonder why it has taken the government two years to deal with this. Schedule4 is a regular schedule that appears in these tax law amendment bills. It amends the Income Tax Act of 1997 to again update the list of deductible gift recipients by adding six entities: the Conversation Trust, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples Limited, the National Boer War Memorial Association Incorporated, the ANZAC Centenary Public Fund, the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project Incorporated and Philanthropy Australia. We are told from the explanatory memorandum that the financial impact of these listings will be just under $10 million over the forward estimates-in fact, $8.6 million I think is the figure. Schedule5 is one of the schedules I highlighted at the start that deals with superannuation and it amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, known colloquially as the SIS Act, to expand the duties of trustees of particular superannuation funds to establish and implement procedures to consolidate accounts where a member of a fund has multiple accounts within a fund and consolidation is in the member's best interests. This measure will facilitate a reduction in the number of unnecessary accounts, boost superannuation balances by ensuring members avoid paying unnecessary fees and insurance premiums on multiple accounts and, at the same time, reduce the number of lost accounts. This proposal was announced in September 2011 by the minister. It is a measure that has the coalition's support. It will lead to greater efficiencies and less red tape, in an ongoing sense. I should point out that the industry raised several concerns in the hearing of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, inquiring into unclaimed money late last year and its likely interaction with the consolidation process. In particular, there were comments that the requirements of the unclaimed money bill were likely to lead to increased double-handling and complexity in this accounts autoconsolidation process; that the unclaimed money time lines could have been better chosen-in other words, delayed to better dovetail with this consolidation process, instead of the haphazardness and haste of the bill, just to help the government meet an unlikely cash surplus target for 2012-13 which it abandoned only two months later; and that all parts of the consolidation process should be stipulated before systems are designed and automated, otherwise the costs and risks of getting things wrong will mount. Those are some of the concerns that were raised. With better coordination, consultation and policy processes, systems to automatically consolidate accounts can be designed once and holistically, with double-handling costs and risks kept to a minimum. I turn to the last three schedules. Schedule6 is the other schedule dealing with superannuation, and with it the Gillard government is again seeking to quietly reduce the Howard government superannuation co-contribution scheme for low-income workers. It will halve the government's maximum co-contribution under the scheme from the current $1,000 down to $500. Under the Howard government, the government super co-contribution for lowincome earners was up to $1,500. It also, again, reduces the government's co-contribution matching rate by half, from the current dollar-for-dollar rate down to 50c for every dollar put in by the low-income earner. It was originally $1.50 for every dollar. It also halves the income band across which the co-contribution phases out or tapers. Instead of the higher-income threshold being set at $30,000 above the lower-income threshold, as it is currently, it will be reduced to $15,000. Lastly, indexation of the lower-income threshold, which has been frozen for two years, since the 2010-11 budget, will be frozen for another income year, 2012-13. These amendments will commence from the date of royal assent and apply from the 201213 year. The financial impact of these amendments is around $330 million a year on assessment, once matured. The government asserts that the compliance cost impact of these amendments will be minimal. Once again, it is necessary to point out the hypocrisy of the government on superannuation. This is yet another example of the government not living up to their word to not change superannuation, 'not one jot, not one tittle', and it is another illustration of the tendency of those opposite to run a class war in the lead-up to elections and then cut benefits for lowand middle-income earners when they need to plug their budget black holes. After this sixth change to the government's super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners, the current government, by the time they are finished, will have cut those benefits by more than $3.3 billion. Schedule7 rationalises and consolidates the dependency tax offsets. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to create new consolidated dependency tax offsets for taxpayers maintaining certain classes of dependants who are genuinely unable to work; it amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to preserve the existing dependency offsets for taxpayers eligible for the zone, overseas forces and overseas civilian tax offsets; and it amends the 1936 act to reflect the impact of the consolidation of the dependency tax offsets on the net medical expenses tax offset. To provide a bit of history and context, the rationalisation of numerous dependency tax offsets did have some merit, but I cannot help thinking this government is only doing so to feed its massive spending addiction. As described in the Henry review of 2010, the dependent spouse tax offset in its original form had become somewhat outdated. It was often holding back participation in the workforce. The Gillard government's announcement in 2011-12 restricted that, of course. All in all, given the state of the budget, the coalition will not be opposing this measure-as I said, because of the state of the budget. The last schedule deals with the taxation of financial arrangements, known as the TOFA regime, and, again, this is another regular entrant in the tax law amendment bills that come before this chamber. Like a few before it, it seeks to clarify and refine the operation of certain aspects of the regime. They are largely of a technical and housekeeping nature. They flow from ongoing monitoring of the implementation of the TOFA reforms and they have been developed in consultation with the industry. The government argues these amendments refine and clarify the operation and provide lower compliance costs and additional certainty for affected taxpayers. These proposals were announced some time back, in June 2010, and apply from the commencement of that regime. The coalition supports these amendments to the schedule which appear generally beneficial to taxpayers with compliance costs unlikely to be significant at all. So the coalition will not be opposing the passage of this legislation. As I have noted, the government's change to the super co-contributions will be the sixth change and that will mean the cuts to benefits of those low-income earners will be more than $3.3 billion. As I noted with the other schedule, given the parlous state of the budget handed down a fortnight ago, where a $1 billion surplus forecast only six months ago for this financial year is now a $19 billion deficit, the coalition will in this instance elect not to oppose the passage of this bill through the House of Representatives. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (15:51): There are many improvements to our tax and superannuation systems that are enabled by the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. Among other things, this bill provides certainty to those small businesses who use the GST instalment system and in schedule 3 we have amendments that will reduce compliance costs by allowing taxpayers to estimate their annual GST liability, allowing them to pay by instalment and submit an annual activity statement rather than quarterly or monthly activity statements, which is a great relief for many small businesses. This measure arose from a suggestion made by a member of the public to the Tax Issues Entry Scheme, which allows the public to put forward suggestions for minor policy changes. So it is great that it has been responsive to actual needs and suggestions from the public. The bill also ensures that tax offsets will continue to encourage Australian documentary, film and television production and it furthers the government's ongoing efforts to reduce the number of lost superannuation accounts. At June 2012 there were almost 32 million superannuation accounts in Australia, which is almost three accounts for every worker. This measure has been released for public consultation twice, in March 2012 and also August 2012. The bill is part of a broader package of superannuation measures that are aimed at reducing fees on unnecessary superannuation accounts, protecting members' retirement savings from being eroded by those fees and charges. All these improvements are very worthy and very worthwhile for small businesses and the general community and will be of great benefit to the individuals they affect. However, there is one particular aspect of this bill that I want to speak about today and that is the listing, as a deductible gift recipient, of the National Boer War Memorial Association. Members would be aware that I have an interest in the Boer War and that I support the works of this worthy association. Just yesterday we were talking about the Boer War and the memorial, which I will touch on later. From memory, it was one of our fellow members in the House who had just come back from a function on the weekend wearing a rather loud tie commemorating some Boer War functions. Last year I spoke in this House to mark the 110th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the second Boer War. I spoke then about the importance of remembering this war, which is often referred to as the forgotten war. For Australia the Boer War is particularly significant because in many ways the Boer War marked the beginning of Australia as an independent nation and it played a pivotal role in forming our national character. At the start of the war in 1899, Australia was six self-governing Crown colonies in the final stages of forming a federation and in June 1899 the people of all colonies except Western Australia had voted in favour of federation-and in 1900 Western Australia would join them. By then Australians, including our first servicewomen to serve overseas, were already serving alongside Britons, Canadians and New Zealanders as part of the imperial forces. The British commanders particularly valued the Australians for their horsemanship, their bush skills and their initiative. The Australians were becoming known for a special type of mounted infantry which would become the light horse of the First World War. For the first time, Australians and New Zealanders fought together, as they would in future conflicts, a tradition that has bonded our nations in the most exceptional way for over 100 years now. The Australian tradition of raising specific volunteer forces to serve overseas was also established. As would happen later in the 20th century, men were recruited from individual states, but they fought together as Australians. In all, some 23,000 Australians, including 60 women, served in the Boer War. Unfortunately, 589 lost their lives and 1,400 sustained serious wounds. Australia also lost its first servicewoman when Sister Frances EmmaFanny-Hines died of pneumonia in August 1900. It is sobering to think that almost half of all deaths were from disease or accident. The National Boer War Memorial Association is a very important association in commemorating our role in the Boer War because, while the Boer War was the first war to be commemorated by public memorials in many small towns across Australia, to date no specific national memorial to the war has been built. About a month ago, I was up in Norfolk Island for committee work, but prior to that I was also there with the minister for territories, and I had the opportunity to visit the Norfolk Island RSL and speak to them about a $2½ thousand grant that they had just received from the Labor government that will help them build a memorial in their RSL: a cabinet to house their memorabilia. The National Boer War Memorial Association has been campaigning tirelessly to rectify the need for a specific national memorial, and now, more than 110 years after the event, preparations for the building of such a national memorial are well and truly underway. The site for the memorial is on ANZAC Parade in Canberra and was dedicated on 31 May 2008. The design was unveiled by CDF, General David Hurley, in Canberra on 1 March 2012. The listing as a deductible gift recipient of the National Boer War Memorial Association will enable the raising of much-needed funds to pay for this important memorial. The timing of this legislation could not be more fitting, because 31 May, which is this Friday, will mark the 111th anniversary of the end of the Boer War, and across Australia commemorations will be held. There were some on the weekend, and there will be some in Canberra this weekend. In Canberra we have a service and wreath laying at St John's church in Reid, which is just behind the intended site for the memorial; a dedicated closing ceremony at the Australian War Memorial; and an official observance at the site of the future National Boer War Memorial on ANZAC Parade. TodayI ask that we all remember the brave men and women who served in Australia's first national war, the Boer War, and I look forward to one day being able to commemorate an anniversary of the Boer War at a beautiful National Boer War Memorial. The site that is dedicated is a beautiful site, but what is even more stunning is the actual design, with the men on horses and the tufts of grass that surround it that look like little puffs of dust rising up behind the horses as they ride. It is a very active and quite passionate representation of a scene from the Boer War. It is a stunning memorial, and I really look forward to seeing it in place in the near future. Fortunately, the association has received a seeding grant of $200,000 from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and that will go some way towards getting us to the final stages of this beautiful memorial. I commend the bill to the House. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (15:59): CanI also join the previous speaker and make my comments about the Boer War Memorial. In my electorate, I have the Lancer Barracks. The Lancers are the oldest and most decorated unit in the Australian military. They, of course, were a cavalry regiment in the Boer War and are very strong advocates for the Boer War Memorial, as am I. I am speaking once again on one of the TLAB bills, in this case the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. I think I have said in this house a number of times how much I enjoy the TLABs. This one is actually a tax and superannuation law amendment bill, which is called a TSLAB, so we now have two versions of these bills that cover a range of things to do with tax laws. I have been accused at various times of having a character flaw for enjoying speaking on TLABs and TSLABs, but for me they bring together in one bill a whole range of things that government is doing and indicate the complexity and sometimes the fine detail of work that goes on behind the scenes when you deliver a major policy. In some ways they follow along behind, clean up, fix and adjust things that change in major policy areas. This bill has eight schedules. If you are a small business person, you earn less than $35,000 a year, you are in film or you like Australian film, this one has something for you. In fact, probably just about everybody in the country would find something in this bill that relates to them. I am going to mention briefly all of the schedules but I am going to concentrate on a couple of them more than others. The first one is one that I am going to spend a little bit of time on. It amends the film tax offsets to restore the intended meaning of 'documentary' and clarifies that game shows are not eligible for tax offsets. Income tax law provides tax offsets to encourage expenditure on films in Australia if certain criteria are satisfied. The producer offset, for example, requires a minimum level of Australian expenditure. It varies for different genres, but the level required is lower than for documentaries, and this schedule is specifically about documentaries. Screen Australia is the film authority that administers the producer offset, which involves assessing whether or not a film satisfies the criteria set out in division 376.65 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, and I will not repeat the name of that act. This includes determining whether a film is a documentary and calculating the amount of QAI, which is qualifying Australian production expenditure. Documentaries are an evolving form. If you consider what you see on television at the moment, you see the growth of reality television and the new forms of game show. Over time, the new forms that emerge weave their way into other forms. In a very short period of time we have seen a rapid change in the ways that documentaries tell their stories. At the moment in the act there is not actually a definition of documentary so Screen Australia has been using the definition from the Australian Communication and Media Authority's guidelines in order to administer the producer offset when it comes to documentaries. Not so long back, in 2011, a series was made called Lush House. It follows a householder management expert, Shannon Lush, working with a different family or household in each of 10 episodes to improve their household management. The program satisfied the conditions of 376.65 of the tax act for the offset but failed as far as Screen Australia was concerned in respect of the documentary requirement, based on ACMA's guidelines. So the producers of Lush House disagreed with the decision and went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. They ruled that there was no definition in the act. They used a different definition and ruled that Lush House was in fact a documentary. I will say upfront that documentary is such an evolving form that no matter what definition you have producers are going to push against it and the form is going to push against it. It will continue to move very quickly in Australia and internationally. It is a highly competitive form, so being at the edge of it in terms of selling your work is incredibly important. But what schedule 1 does is reinstate the definition which Screen Australia was using by inserting that definition from the guidelines into the act. So it reinstates, if you like, the situation that was in place before Lush House went to the Administrative Review Tribunal. This is one of those decisions which will always be controversial in a highly emerging form. It is incredibly important that Screen Australia continues to liaise with the industry to make sure that the definitions that they are using continue to be responsive and interpreted within the rapidly emerging concept of what makes a documentary-but it is a particularly interesting schedule. Schedule2 exempts from income tax the disaster income recovery subsidy paid to individuals, small business persons and farmers who lost income as a result of ex-tropical cyclone Oswald and related flooding in Queensland. Every time the government provides disaster income recovery funding of one form or another in the community following any of the disasters we have had in recent decades, the tax law is amended to make sure that those recovery payments are not taxable. Schedule2 makes sure that the disaster income recovery subsidy payments for Oswald and associated flooding in Queensland are tax-exempt. Schedule2 also exempts from income tax the exgratia payments equivalent to those payments for eligible New Zealand non-protected special category visa holders who were affected. It is a very complex language but basically it makes sure that New Zealanders who were affected by the disaster and who received the payments in Australia had the same tax treatment as Australians. You get used to this sort of language of TLABs and TSLABs. Ultimately underneath it there are some very common sense things. That one is simply making sure that payments that people receive to help them recover from a disaster are not taxed. It is a perfectly fine and logical schedule. Schedule3 relates to the GST instalments system. It amends the GST act to enable those small-business taxpayers who are paying their GST by instalments and who subsequently move into a net refund position can continue to pay their GST by instalments if they wish to do so. It provides certainty for those small business entities that use the GST instalment system and it ensures that as their business moves from doing well to doing less well they will be able to continue to use the instalment system they are familiar with. It is a logical change. It came about because a member of the public asked for it through the tax issues entry scheme, which allows the public to put forward suggestions for major policy changes. This is community consultation at the most grassroots level working. It is a very good change and has been quite welcomed by number of small businesses in my area. Schedule4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include a few more organisations on the list of DGR's, deductible gift recipients, which allows tax deductibility for donations. Is that what it means? An honourable member: Tax deductible. Ms OWENS: I knew it was something like that. I knew what it did. The Conversation Trust is a charity that publishes analysis and commentary on current affairs from the university and research sector. It delivers directly to the public through its website, Twitter and Facebook. That one is backdated to 21 November 2012. The National Congress of Australia's First Peoples Ltd, which is a national representative organisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples also goes on the list. The National Boer War Memorial Association goes on the list. The ANZAC Centenary public fund, which collates donations to fund a range of ANZAC Centenary initiatives and projects as agreed by government goes on the list. The Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Fund Project Inc., which seeks donations to build a memorial on ANZAC Parade in Canberra to recognise the service of Australians who have served in peacekeeping missions goes on the list and is also backdated to 31 December 2012. Philanthropy Australia, which is the national membership body for the philanthropic sector primarily servicing Australia's philanthropic trusts and foundations also goes on the list. Almost every TLAB or TSLAB has a number of organisations of that quality and calibre added to the DGR list. Schedule5 relates to the merging of multiple accounts in a superannuation entity. Most people would know that the Labor government has engaged in a number of reforms designed to make superannuation more transparent and simpler to manage. We found ourselves in a position in this country of people having many superannuation accounts, sometimes being unaware that they do. As they moved from one employer to the other over the past decades it was sometimes easy for superannuation account to be left behind somewhere and for it to be eaten up in fees. We have done a considerable amount of work through the lost super, MySuper and other reforms to reintroduce people to their lost accounts. This one deals with a particular set of circumstances where a person will have more than one account with the same superannuation entity. As of June last year there were almost 32 million superannuation accounts in Australia-that is almost three accounts for every worker. We all know that if an account sits there for a while it is possible for fees and insurance costs to start to eat up the account. So this one places a general duty upon superannuation trustees to identify members with multiple accounts within their fund on an annual basis and to consider whether it would be appropriate to merge them, having regard to the best interests of members. This will apply regardless of the balances of the accounts concerned. There was considerable consultation in the early days of putting this policy together. A number of kinds of accounts have been exempted from this, but it is a very good measure that should result in a more rational approach to multiple accounts within superannuation entities. AndI will point out that a number of the major entities have already begun the process of finding ways to join accounts where it seems clear that the person has two accounts either without their knowledge or because that is the way it happened at the time, without a conscious choice. Schedule6 deals with the superannuation co-contribution and, again, it is part of a larger reform. The federal government has introduced a new way to contribute to the superannuation savings of eligible lowand middle-income earners. It was announced in the 2010-11 budget and is called the low income super contribution. It provides a payment of up to $500, not indexed annually, into the superannuation accounts of low-income earners. By the way, the schedule I am talking about is not about the new contribution; it is about the old one, which I will get to in a moment. The purpose of this new one is to compensate low-income earners for the fact that when they contribute to their superannuation account they do not receive the same tax benefit as a person earning a higher income receives. Essentially, the payment of up to $500 compensates a low-income earner and gives them a reasonable tax advantage for putting money into super, which those on higher incomes get automatically. Part of the change is that we are reducing the contributions that made through the Howard government's superannuation co-contribution, which was introduced in 2003. Under that scheme, individuals were matched at a 100 per cent-dollar for dollar-rate up to $1,000 for people with incomes up to $31,920. Unfortunately, only about one in five people who were eligible to claim that actually did. The views of the industry were quite clear in the submissions they made on this bill: they preferred the low-income superannuation contribution, which went to all low-income earners, rather than the co-contribution, which was only being claimed by one in five. I am nearly out of time so I had better be very fast. Schedule7 consolidates eight existing dependency tax offsets into a single streamlined offset and schedule 8 deals with the TOFA arrangements to clarify the operations, with lower compliance costs, and to provide additional certainty to affected taxpayers. So there are eight schedules-sorry I did not get enough time on 7 and 8-with very interesting amendments to tax law covering a broad range of areas. Again, there is something in there for everyone. Superannuation Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill. In particular, I would like to speak on schedule 4, which amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, to update the list of deductible gift recipients by adding six entities, which are the Conversation Trust, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples Limited, the National Boer War Memorial Association Incorporated, the ANZAC Centenary Public Fund, the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project Incorporated, and Philanthropy Australia Incorporated. I note that the member for Canberra took the opportunity to speak about the National Boer War Memorial Association Incorporated. I would like to speak about the ANZAC Centenary Public Fund, and in particular the ANZAC Day celebrations that will be coming up in the",190,Bills
257,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (16:14,"I would like to speak very briefly on the Tax andnext two years. I note in the schedule that the donations collected in the ANZAC Centenary Public Fund will be used to fund a range of ANZAC centenary initiatives and projects as agreed by government for the commemoration of the ANZAC centenary and Australia's involvement in World War I-1914 to 1918. I certainly support the inclusion of the ANZAC Centenary Public Fund as a deductible gift recipient. We are approaching a most important ceremony-the commemoration of ANZAC Day in two years time-and I know that many of the communities around Australia are now actively working towards the celebrations that will take place on that day. My electorate of McPherson is certainly preparing already. We have four RSLs in that community-Coolangatta-Tweed, Currumbin, Mudgeeraba and Burleigh Heads-and I am sure that many people around Australia would be aware of the ceremony at Elephant Rock on the Gold Coast every ANZAC Day, and particularly the dawn service that is held there. I know that the Currumbin RSL will be working towards making the centenary celebration an event which we will all remember-as will many of the RSLs throughout Queensland and Australia, particularly the four in my electorate. Having the ANZAC Centenary Fund included in the deductible gift recipients gives many people the opportunity to contribute to that fund. Having it tax deductible is absolutely wonderful, because it gives us the opportunity to recognise and publicly demonstrate our commitment to those people who have served in Australia and overseas, and who have done so much to support our nation in the past, and to support those who will continue to do so in the future. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (16:18): I rise to speak on the legislation before the House, and to support it. I would like to make some comments with regard to four of the schedules that are before us this afternoon. Firstly, I would like to comment in relation to the taxation treatment in terms of film tax offsets. One of the great joys of being an Australian is to be able to travel around the world and know that people have seen our country and have some understanding of our quirky sense of humour through the films that we produce. I know, from my own children's viewing habits, that documentaries about places are a really important part of their education about the world. This particular offset is established to encourage expenditure on films in Australia if they meet certain criteria. It does not seek to define the term 'documentary', but we are responding to ensure that when this tax offset is applied it is genuinely for pieces of work that are documentaries. I doubt that we could ever say that a game show would constitute a documentary in the same sense that you and I might understand the normal use of that word; however, I understand that this piece of legislation ensures that the offsets that we are hopefully going to put through the parliament with the passage of this bill will encourage the sorts of film and television programs that they were intended to encourage rather than genres that were definitely intended to be excluded when the legislation was first put before the House. By our doing so, those who watch us from afar will be able to find out what Australia is really like and get the flavour of Australian documentaries. The third schedule of the bill is a very significant improvement which answers to a point so often raised in my conversations with local small businesses in my area-that is, the burden that they have carried ever since they were asked, with the imposition of a GST under the Howard government, to become tax collectors. This schedule seeks to amend the GST act to enable those small-business taxpayers who are paying their GST by instalments and subsequently moving to a net refund position to continue to use the GST instalments if they wish to do so. At the moment, small-business taxpayers who are not using the instalment option and are already in a net refund position remain ineligible to pay their GST by instalments while they remain in the refund position. The change we are proposing will allow taxpayers who move into a net refund position to continue to access the instalment system and to retain the accompanying compliance cost advantages of submitting their BAS statement annually if they choose to do so. The great thing about this proposed change is that it has come from the suggestion made by a member of the public through the Tax Issues Entry System. Never let it be said that an Australian with a brilliant idea is unable to participate in the fine processes of this place. Putting ideas forward, looking to the future and solving some of the problems that face our small businesses in order to improve our productivity and the life of those working in small business are all very worthy activities. This government has responded to suggestions from the public for minor tax policy changes. In the fourth schedule before us in this bill, I, like the member for McPherson, am very pleased to see the ANZAC Centenary Public Fund listed. In my own electorate preparations for the centenary of ANZAC are well underway, and the $100,000 grants from the federal government to each of the electorates around this fine country will enable a broad vision of how we want to celebrate. We are beginning a collective journey as a community in our unique and different ways across this country. The ANZAC Centenary Public Fund's receiving DGR status will allow those who make contributions to the fund a certain degree of tax deductibility on their contributions. The conversation trust is also listed in the fourth schedule of the bill. The trust serves a very important public purpose in analysing and providing written commentary by the university and research sectors on current affairs. In a 24/7 cycle of news, of which were all aware and sometimes victims, it is very important that there be those who can stand back, make some considered and sensible observations and contribute their observations to the public space for consideration. Another listing in the fourth schedule of the bill is for the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. I do not think there would be any objection to the listing of this agency, which states as its goal a movement towards the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights and towards securing a better economic, social, cultural and environmental future. The National Boer War Memorial Association is listed here with DGR status, which will be provided from 1 January 2013, and so is Philanthropy Australia. Philanthropy Australia is a national membership body which pulls together philanthropic agencies, and it is very helpful for members of our community who are seeking to do good works in the community to be able to find out where they might seek philanthropic grants. Philanthropy Australia is serving a vital role in pulling the goodwill of the larger community together into a place where it becomes more accessible for people right across the country rather than perhaps just people in cities who might, by happenstance or friendship or networks, be able to access the good offers of Philanthropy Australia to improve our national well-being in a range of ways. I am more than delighted to see the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project Inc. there. It will create a memorial on ANZAC Parade in Canberra for Australian peacekeepers. People who have served this country in international peacekeeping operations will be provided with proper recognition of their service to this country and the cause of freedom and peace around the world. I am in my electorate privileged to know a number of these peacekeepers. Indeed, one by the name of Milan Nikolic approached my office the year before last with an idea to honour and acknowledge all those men and women who have served, by providing a badge of honour for their family members to wear. This was a great initiative. It is like the reform we were talking about before, when an individual Australian saw a way to cut red tape for Australian business, brought it to the government and we put it forward. Milan approached me and asked for my assistance in moving forward. I was able to take it to the Prime Minister, and last year, I am delighted to say, we were able to provide an ongoing recognition, in the form of a badge, for the family members of all of those who have served or are serving in our forces. So the kids whose mum or dad might be serving away will be recognised in their school by their teachers and by their friends as doing their own sort of service by doing without their mum and dad. It is similar for the brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers and partners of those who are serving. I am pleased to have spoken in this place on many occasions about the very significant reform that this government has undertaken in superannuation. We are the party of superannuation. I grew up in a working-class family. Happily my father was able to start his own business. He worked very hard and became quite successful. But I can tell you we did not have many conversations about superannuation around the kitchen table. Those conversations were certainly happening in other houses around the country. The advantage of careful saving for the future and putting that money aside is obvious to all of us now, with trillions of dollars sitting there as the wealth of this nation and an investment for a dignified retirement. The reality is that, for many people, superannuation was not even a word that they knew about, let alone a reality that they could experience and have the comfort of in their later years. The amendment in this schedule will place a general duty upon superannuation trustees to identify members who have multiple accounts within their particular fund. They need to do this on an annual basis and consider whether it would be appropriate to merge them, having regard to the best interests of the members. This seems like such common sense. If you are a trustee and you are in charge of making sure that somebody's retirement nest egg grows, it would be a terrible thing to find out that moneys were kept in separate accounts with the deliberate intention of increasing revenue flow to the superannuation company at the cost of the people whose money they were supposed to be looking after. This schedule means that the 32 million superannuation accounts in Australia-roughly three for each worker-should begin to reduce in number. With that reduction in number, there should be an increase in the benefit to those account holders as their money is gathered to one nest egg, under the trustees' guidance, which should grow in value without constantly being eroded by servicing fees. There are a number of other amendments in the schedules before us. Essentially these amendments refine and clarify the operation of the taxation of financial arrangements regime. They collectively lower the compliance costs and they provide additional certainty to affected taxpayers. They are the outcome of ongoing monitoring and implementation of the taxation of financial arrangements, and they have been achieved in consultation with the industry and the Australian Taxation Office. I commend the bill to the House. (16:29): I acknowledge those who have contributed to this debate, in particular the member for Casey, the member for Canberra, the member for Parramatta, the member for McPherson and most recently the member for Robertson, and I thank her for her genuine interest in these matters. Schedule1 of the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 makes some amendments to ensure that the meaning of 'documentary' in the film tax offset provisions is consistent with the meaning explained in the Australian Communications and Media Authority's guidelines-that meaning applied for tax purposes until the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2011-so that these amendments restore the previously understood meaning. Restoring the original meaning ensures that the taxation incentives for the production of film and television in Australia continue to encourage the sorts of productions the Commonwealth intends to support. Schedule2 exempts from income tax certain disaster relief payments. This includes the ex gratia payment equivalent to the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment made to New Zealand special category visa holders and the Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy. In the wake of recent disasters, it is important that these payments are tax free. Exempting these payments from tax maximises the value of the payments so that people can get on with the job of cleaning up after the floods and fires and, hopefully, get on with their lives. Exempting these payments from tax also ensures consistency with previous disaster relief payments that were also tax exempt. It also ensures the New Zealand special category visa holders who have been affected by recent disasters receive the same support as Australians. Schedule3 allows small business taxpayers using the GST instalment system to temporarily move into a net refund position to continue to use the instalment system if they choose to do so. These amendments aim to assist such entities that consider the compliance cost advantages of submitting their business activity statement annually outweigh the cash flow cost of delayed refunds. The amendments will ensure greater certainty for those small business taxpayers who use the GST instalment system. These amendments will apply in relation to GST instalment quarters starting on or after 1 July, following royal assent of this bill. Schedule4 adds six entities to the list of named deductible gift recipients in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. Therefore, DGR status will assist these bodies in attracting public support. The new DGRs listed are the Conservation Trust, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples Limited, the National Boer War Memorial Association Incorporated, the ANZAC Centenary Public Fund, the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project Incorporated and Philanthropy Australia Incorporated. Schedule5 to this bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to require trustees to establish procedures for consolidating multiple superannuation accounts they hold for the same member on an annual basis when it is in the member's best interests. Defined benefit interest accounts, accounts supporting an income stream and first home saver accounts will all be exempt. The measure will commence on 1 July 2013, with the first round of consolidations to occur by 30 June 2014. This will apply regardless of the balances of the accounts concerned. The amendments will contribute to a steady reduction in the number of unnecessary accounts in the superannuation system. This measure was developed in",198,Bills
258,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)consultation with industry and was released as an exposure draft on two occasions prior to introduction, with the views of stakeholders being incorporated at each stage. Schedule5 provides a flexible regulatory framework for a process that many fund trustees are already undertaking. The amendments will simply ensure that the process is an industry-wide practice. Schedule6 of this bill will freeze the income threshold above which the maximum contribution phases down at $31,920 for 2012-13. The income threshold above which no cocontribution is payable will be reduced to $15,000 above the lower income threshold-that is, $46,920 for the 2012-13 income year. These changes are supported by the low-income superannuation contribution. From1 July 2012 the low-income superannuation contribution allows most people with income up to $37,000 to effectively pay no tax on their super contributions, by providing a benefit of up to $500 a year. This is better targeted, more widely available than the current co-contribution and does not require individuals to make additional after-tax contributions. The opposition has publicly stated that it will discontinue the low-income superannuation contribution. This will result in 3.6 million low-income earners effectively paying more tax. The co-contribution scheme continues to be generous and provides a significant incentive for low-income individuals to make voluntary contributions into superannuation. The government is deeply concerned by these attempts to cut away at this important concession that has been reducing taxation levels for low-income earners. Schedule7 consolidates eight separate tax offsets for dependants into one new tax offset that is available to taxpayers who maintain a dependant who is unable to work because of invalidity or carer obligations. The eight tax offsets to be consolidated are the: carer spouse, invalid relative, parent, parent-in-law, child-housekeeper, child-housekeeper with child, housekeeper, and housekeeper-with-child tax offsets. Consolidating the dependency tax offsets removes out-dated barriers to dependants seeking employment. It builds on the government's participation agenda and allows the government to target more assistance to dependants who are genuinely unable to work. Schedule8 refines and clarifies the operation of the taxation and financial arrangements regime. The amendment's lower compliance costs provide certainty for effective taxpayers. The amendments respond to issues raised by industry and the Australian Taxation Office as part of ongoing monitoring of the implementation of the taxation and financial arrangements regime. The amendments have been developed following extensive consultation with industry. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment Corporations and Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. coalition to speak on this Corporations and Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. Let me say at the outset that the coalition will not be opposing this bill. As was made clear in the introductory speech and in the explanatory memorandum it deals with a number of issues that largely flow from the global financial crisis, where the G20 endorsed a global transition of over-the-counter derivatives and products that are currently traded through bilateral agreements towards recognised exchanges or trading platforms, where appropriate, in order to boost market transparency. The G20 also agreed that certain trading activities should be cleared through a central counter-party to reduce systemic risk and should be reported to trade repositories in order to enhance market information. The key measures are intended to:  assist central counterparties (CCPs) in managing defaults of clearing participants;  improve the allocation of resources by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in assessing the compliance of Australian market licence (AML) and clearing and settlement facility licence (CFSL) holders with their legal obligations;  allow certain Australian regulators including the RBA to exchange protected information with other entities in Australia and overseas in the execution of their duties subject to appropriate safeguards; and  allow ASIC to gather and share protected information with regulatory entities overseas for supervision and enforcement purposes; and require ASIC to report on the use of those powers. The bill is divided into seven parts. Part1 deals with the payments system and netting, and seeks to amend the Payments System and Netting Act 1998, the PSN Act, in order to provide a range of protections and carve-outs for certain retail payment systems. The amendments within this bill to the PSN Act allow client positions and associated collateral of a defaulting participant in a clearing facility to be ported to another, solvent participant regardless of obstacles presented by other legislation, including the insolvency provisions in the Corporations Act. The amendments will also ensure that central counterparties can enforce they security they hold over all types of assets, including dematerialised securities. Part2 of the bill deals with a review of licences. The amendments will enable ASIC to focus on reviewing some aspects of a licensee's operations each year, with a full review taking place over a number of years. Reviewing licences in this way may allow for a more comprehensive examination of their operations. These amendments seek to reduce the misallocation of resources that results from the requirement to conduct annual assessments on all licences and will allow ASIC to allocate resources to assessments in which they will be more effective. Part3 deals with international business regulators. In this section, the bill will amend the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. The proposed amendments to both acts will bring panEuropean regulators such as the European Securities and Markets Authority, and the European Systemic Risk Board into the definition of 'foreign regulator', and thereby put beyond doubt ASIC's ability to render assistance in their administration and enforcement of foreign business laws.",202,Bills
259,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (16:38,"I rise on behalf of the shadow Treasurer and thePart4 deals with reporting on ASIC's information-gathering powers. The amendments address concerns raised back in 2010 in the Senate economics committee about the lack of reporting by ASIC in relation to its use of information-gathering powers. So these amendments seek to formalise ASIC's reporting commitments by imposing a statutory obligation on ASIC to report annually, and insert a provision for Treasury ministers-such as the parliamentary secretary opposite-with notice given to ASIC, to request that ASIC report additional information if required. Part5 of the bill deals with the disclosure of information by the Reserve Bank. The amendments relate to section 79A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and contain a number of provisions relating to the sharing of information by RBA officers. The intention of these amendments is to provide permission for the RBA to share protected information and documents to a person approved by the RBA governor or prescribed delegates in writing. A similar provision was previously in the Reserve Bank Act but was automatically repealed under a sunset provision; it is now proposed to reinstate it. A further amendment allows the RBA to impose confidentiality restrictions on persons to whom protected information is provided. Part6 of the bill deals with consequential amendments relating to derivative trade repositories and arises from the passage of the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Derivative Transactions) Act 2012-that is, the act that provided the legislative framework for implementing Australia's G20 commitments in relation to over-the-counter derivative reforms. It contains a number of consequential amendments to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 and the Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011 that have become necessary, according to the government. As members in this chamber are aware, the coalition remain opposed to the government's carbon tax. In government we will repeal the carbon tax. Whilst these measures are linked to this government, the passage of this legislation does improve the framework in which these products are traded. So we will repeal the carbon tax and, given the overriding importance of this legislation, we will not be opposing these amendments. The last section seeks to rewrite section 1317E(1) of the Corporations Act, which lists those provisions in the act which are the subject of the civil penalty provisions of part 9.4B, in order to simplify the legislation without changing its substance. In conclusion I point out that the parliamentary secretary, on introduction, pointed out that ministerial council approval-that is, MINCO approval-had occurred with respect to the ASIC changes in the bill. Secretary for Small Business) (16:45): In summing up on this bill, the Corporations and Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill 2013, I want to thank all the honourable members who have shown interest in this particular area. I want to particularly mention the member for Casey, who has made some brief comments in relation to this bill and shown support for the good things that are being done with these amendments. I also want to note that the member for Robertson was due to speak on this bill but, being in the chair, that is not quite possible so at least I wanted to note that she would have made a contribution because she has an enormous interest in all these bills and in the corporations and financial services sector as well.",204,Bills
260,Mr Ripoll (Oxley,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and ParliamentaryThis bill delivers a number of very important measures to improve the functioning of our financial system. While many of the amendments in the bill may seem highly technical in nature, they have a very real impact on the work of our financial markets and our regulators. They will also complement the existing legislative framework to implement our core G20 commitments in relation to over-the-counter derivatives. Passage of the bill will provide crucial protections to clearing facilities, which are critical parts of our financial system. These important reforms will allow our clearing facilities to better protect themselves against a default by one of their participants. The work of clearing facilities is at the heart of our financial system and the reforms in this bill are therefore important in guaranteeing market confidence in the stability of the financial system, which ultimately benefits the economy as a whole and ultimately everyone in Australia. The reforms in the bill will also allow ASIC and the RBA to better focus their resources on supervising those licensed markets as well as clearing and settlement facilities, which pose the highest risk to our system and to retail investors. Finally, the bill will provide appropriate powers to our regulators, allowing them to cooperate as required with other regulators and official bodies. This in turn will facilitate the business activities of our financial industry in overseas markets. These important reforms are part of the Gillard government's broad agenda to promote Australia as a leading financial services hub and boost our reputation as one of the most attractive investment destinations in that world. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Statute Law Revision Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. bill corrects technical errors caused by drafting and clerical mistakes, repeals obsolete legislation and makes other technical corrections. Bills of this nature are traditionally noncontroversial and receive the support of parliament because they are regarded as an essential tool in the process of keeping the Commonwealth statute books accurate and up to date. The acts to be repealed relating to air passenger ticket levies imposed as a result of the collapse of the Ansett group are self-evidently obsolete. The levy was discontinued in 2003 and all of the mandated distributions have been completed. Of the acts to be amended, most of the proposals relate to spelling, grammatical and technical errors. A small number of obsolete provisions will be repealed. The bill also proposes amendments to provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, which have been rendered redundant by other enactments. This bill is clearly of an exceptionally technical nature. It does nothing that we would regard as remotely controversial, apart from essentially tidying up the statute books. I hope that the next speaker is in the parliament-I think she is. So, on that note, I can conclude my remarks.",205,Bills
261,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (16:48,"I rise to talk on the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012. ThisMs ROWLAND (Greenway) (16:50): I am delighted to be able to make a contribution to this Statute Law Revision Bill 2013. As you may well know, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, I have a very healthy obsession with the proposed statute stocktake legislation as and when it comes before the House. As any practitioner would know, it is always a source of great angst to be attempting to interpret provisions in legislation and to advise clients when there are things like grammatical errors and incorrect cross-referencing. Often this has the potential to change the meaning of the intention of the parliament itself. Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, as you would well remember-you were in the chair when I made my last contribution on this matter in August 2012-I specifically discussed Ireland's statute law revision project, which identified more than 3,225 statutes that required repeal or amendment, which is probably the largest single repealing process that has ever been enacted. Thankfully, because we have such excellent people in Australia looking after this area, such as the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, we do not have such a requirement, and bringing on these regular statute law updates means that we are in a constant position where we can update our statute law in a most timely and robust way. I want to talk about a few thing to do with this bill. Schedule1 has a very diverse list of principal acts that are to be amended, ranging from the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Industry Act, the Competition and Consumer Act, the old Trade Practices Act, the Native Title Act, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act-a very diverse range. Some of the items that are being amended are to do with things that are redundant-redundant section items, items that are consequential on previous items that may have been made redundant, incorrect punctuation, updating of references, grammatical errors, incorrect crossreferencing, and incorrect concepts and spelling errors. SoI think it is very appropriate that we should be amending legislation to account for things such as these. I would note that it is very useful that we have in the bill itself some notes to state why certain things are being amended. It is something that goes to an issue that I will talk about in a minute-consequence clauses of legal complexity. It is a real tribute to the drafting quality that we have in Australia that we have these very useful notes. I would also like to point out schedule 2 of the bill, which goes to misascribed or redundant amendments or errors contained in amending acts. Again, it is very appropriate that we look at the wide range of issues that can arise and the unintended consequences that can often arise from such errors. I want to look to some of the guidance that is given by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, specifically the issue of causes of legal complexity and strategies to address them. There are some very useful documents that I think all members of this place and anyone who is tuning in and is interested in the development of statute law would be interested in some very useful documents published by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that are very readily able to be accessed. I will give some examples of the causes of legal complexity because I think they are instructive for all of us. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel states some of the drivers of complexity in legislation and gives some common examples, which I think are useful to quote. The examples are:  unnecessary complexity in the underlying policy  a tendency to respond to events with legislative changes even when legislation is not necessary to address the issues  pressure to prepare legislation in constrained timeframes, so that the focus becomes getting the legislation drafted rather than making it clear  an aversion to principles-based legislation leading to a tendency to have rules that accommodate very small variations in circumstances Principles based legislation is the underlying mantra of the Westminster system. They go on:  an aversion to judicial discretion, so that the courts are not left to evolve detailed rules in a commonlaw fashion, and  an aversion to official discretion, so that officials are not left to evolve administrative practice. I think it is also very useful to look at a couple of the strategies the Office of Parliamentary Counsel outlines to address the causes of complexity. Again, I think these are useful universal rules. They mention things such as consulting drafters early in the policy development process; making sure legislation is comprehensible-enabling people to read bills-making sure instructing officers have access to the necessary training and guidance materials; and, where it is necessary, review entire legislation. I think it is very important to note, particularly since we are looking at some problems that have been caused by amending acts, that amending legislation often makes patchwork amendments to existing legislation, and in some cases more than one area of the same department may be working on several items of legislation that amend the principal legislation, and a lack of coordination would have detrimental outcomes. I also think it is useful to examine some of the techniques that have led to where we are today in terms of a strategy for statue law revision. I took the time to have a look at an article by Jonathan Teasdale in the European Journal of Law Reform. I will give the citation because I know people are very eager to read it. It is in volume 11, No. 2, page 157. Teasdale makes some really good points. He talks about how statue law revision started systematically in the United Kingdom in the 1860s, and it had two aims: to remove from the statute books enactments that had ceased to be enforced or that had become unnecessary, and to produce a revised edition of what they called live statutes, which I think today would equate to a consolidated version of a particular statute. I agree with the conclusion that is set out very succinctly in Jonathan Teasdale's abstract. His conclusion is: … statute law 'revision' delivers more than the sum of its parts … I think that is a very apt description of what this particular bill before us does. I would like to take the time to quote, because I think it is really important for us to remember that we in this place are lawmakers and we should look at some of the principles of statute law. Teasdale says that statute law is enacted so that society can have access to it, which means that it must be physically accessible, reliable and in a format which is comprehensible. He says that the user needs to be able to access a statute book which has integrity, which is up to date, and which makes sense. These are minimum requirements for a society which is governed through representative and binding democracy. I think that it is useful for all of us to remember, and to remind ourselves, that we are lawmakers in this place-as I said-and to look at things that might help us become better lawmakers when it comes to legislative drafting. One of the other very useful items that I find from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, is its excellent summary on plain language. One of the most valuable legislative techniques, I believe, is the ability to draft in plain language. I know I have regaled this place on many occasions with my expeditions in the Pacific, the Middle East and South-East Asia drafting laws and regulations, but I think it is very useful to remember that one of the reasons Australians are often called on to take up consultancy or advisory positions-and why the government is called on to provide capacity-building to other countries to develop their legal systems-is that we do it so well. AndI think it is important for us to pat ourselves on the back. And the Office of Parliamentary Counsel note that they use the term 'plain language' rather than 'plain English' because they believe it covers a wider range of techniques and practices. The OPC quotes a landmark paper given to the Emerging Trends in Legislative Drafting conference in Dublin, where Professor Ruth Sullivan of the University of Ottawa gave a description of plain language. She said: Plain language drafting refers to a range of techniques designed to create legislation that is readable and easy to use by the relevant audience(s) for that legislation. At the level of vocabulary, plain language drafters try to use words and expressions that are familiar to everyone … At the level of syntax, plain language drafters try to create sentence patterns that are easy for the average person to process. ……… Plain language drafters also draw on the research and insights of experts in document design. They pay as much attention to fonts and white space as they do to choice of words. They try to devise methods of presenting material visually that will assist the reader to use the statute book effectively, and with minimum effort. Finally, plain language drafters try to provide information that will help readers to interpret the text. Such information typically takes the form of purpose statements, explanatory notes, examples, summaries, overviews and the like Taking all that into account, I would like to conclude with what I think is a very practical example of the accessibility where statute law intersects with technology. There is a great example of innovation in Australia, as I have been talking about, in our legal practice. I want to mention the launch earlier this year of the telco iPad app by my good friends Gilbert and Tobin lawyers in Sydney who have launched Telco Navigator, an iPad app that provides a one-stop shop for all legislative and regulatory documents for people in the telco industry. As anyone who has worked in this sector knows, there is a lot of legislation and a lot of regulation. It is a co-regulatory scheme so not only do we have the hard regulation in the form of acts and also regulations arising out of those acts but also codes of practice, standards and many other elements in between. I think what is so innovative about the design of this is that I do not know of any other such apps. It is available for free. You can access it from the Apple App Store. It also has a function which enables push-up dates so that legislation can be updated automatically. As I said, I think it is an excellent example of innovation and of accessibility. I did happen to mention Peter Waters, the lead partner in this project, in one of my previous contributions on the statute law revision measures last year in the context of drafting the first competition law in Hong Kong. I congratulate Peter and everyone at Gilbert and Tobin who was involved in the development of this app. I would encourage anyone who is listening to check it out if you are interested in telecommunications law. I know you will be interested in this, Mr Deputy Speaker Symon. It has a very detailed design which covers the transition from copper world to the NBN fibre world. I am sure you will enjoy it very much. I commend the bill to the House. Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (17:03): I thank members for their contribution to the debate, particularly the member for Greenway for her insightful and interesting speech. I used to make a lot of those speeches myself on statute law revision. Lest anyone think that this particular piece of legislation is uninteresting and has no impact on Australian life, its economy, its community and society let me say this Statute Law Revision Bill 2013 deals with areas such as financial framework, telecommunications, corporations law, aviation and transport, FaHCSIA, native title, fishery management, exports, excise, farm work, farm household support, superannuation industry supervision and many other pieces of legislation that impact on Australian life each and every day. Statute law revision bills perform a vital service in improving the quality of Commonwealth legislation. The regular review of legislation by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel enables minor errors in the Commonwealth statute books to be efficiently addressed and improves the accuracy and usability of Commonwealth acts. It also enables the repeal of obsolete and otiose provisions in acts. The member for Greenway was talking about a number of things that were done like getting rid of sections and subsections that were no longer relevant and legislation that has previously gone, replacing wrongly placed semicolons with full stops, modernising language to use the word 'authorise' in a more contemporary way rather than authorize and changing divisions which were wrongly placed. These things sound unsexy but they are very important. They make the comprehension of Commonwealth law far easier for Australians. These improvements complement the government's commitment to creating clearer and more accessible Commonwealth laws and the bills are prepared at the initiative of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I commend the office on the quality of this bill and its commitment to maintaining the accuracy and clarity of the Commonwealth statute book. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be returned to the House without amendment. Not-for-profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill 2013 Second Reading (17:08): I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move: That this bill be now read a second time.",206,Bills
262,Mr Neumann (Blair,Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and,210,Bills
263,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)The Not-for-Profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill 2013 will promote ongoing positive engagement, together with open communication and debate, between the federal government and the not-for-profit sector. The bill will prohibit and invalidate clauses in Commonwealth agreements that seek to limit or restrict not-for-profit entities from advocating on Commonwealth policy issues. An unfettered not-for-profit sector is essential to building a democratic and inclusive community. Other governments have mandated 'gag clauses' in agreements with the not-forprofit sector, preventing them from advocating on government policy. This bill will prevent this from occurring at the Commonwealth level. The Commonwealth government recognises that a strong, independent and innovative notfor-profit sector is essential to building an inclusive community. The not-for-profit sector is made up of around 600,000 organisations and accounts for approximately eight per cent of employment nationally. Providing Commonwealth funding to not-for-profit entities or entering into other agreements should not prohibit the sector from engaging in policy and debate. The bill will apply to all Commonwealth agreements with the not-for-profit sector, regardless of whether they were entered into prior to the commencement of the legislation. The bill specifically addresses circumstances where, despite current Commonwealth government policy to the contrary, there may still be 'gag clauses' in existing Commonwealth agreements with the not-for-profit sector. The bill will invalidate any such clauses in existing agreements. This will ensure that notfor-profit entities are not disadvantaged due to clauses in existing Commonwealth agreements that should not have been included. The bill will also prevent any clauses in future Commonwealth agreements that purport to 'gag' the not-for-profit sector. The bill will operate retrospectively, and includes a clause relating to compensation. This is intended to cover the highly unlikely circumstance where a party suffers loss because a 'gag clause' in a pre-existing agreement is invalidated by the legislation. In that rare and unlikely situation, the Commonwealth will pay 'reasonable compensation' to that person. This bill should be supported as it protects the rights of the not-for-profit sector and notfor-profit entities to engage in debate and advocate on Commonwealth policy. It recognises and supports the critical role that the not-for-profit sector has in developing public policy and advocating on behalf of the community. to Advocate Bill 2013. This bill seeks to introduce provisions which would prohibit and invalidate clauses in Commonwealth agreements with the not-for-profit sector that limit or prevent not-for-profit entities from advocating on Commonwealth law, policy or actionsincluding so-called gag clauses. The bill would prevent an agency from including specified prohibited content in a Commonwealth agreement. Prohibited content is defined broadly to enable the not-for-profit sector to advocate freely on the breadth of Commonwealth law, policy or practice. This freedom to advocate should be read to include the release of nonconfidential information. Parties to the agreement must be able to justify why particular information is confidential.",210,Bills
264,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (17:11,"I rise to speak on the Not-for-profit Sector FreedomThe government's approach to civil society is entirely disingenuous. Unlike Labor the coalition understands civil society-we get it-and I am pleased that last year I announced the coalition's approach to civil society. Despite introducing this bill into the parliament, the government has done nothing to unwind the great big new bureaucracy it has created to increase the regulatory burden on charities and not-for-profits. I put my remarks, therefore, in this broader context. Under the pretext of simplifying and easing the regulatory burden on civil society, the government has established the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission. Unfortunately, what was initially promised and what has emerged from the bureaucracy and since been legislated are poles apart. A primary concern of the current government's reform was that the new commission should reduce administrative compliance and duplication of reporting by agencies, so enabling them to direct more of their limited resources to charitable and related activities. Yet the final product of the legislation fails to meet this objective. It has become yet another great big new bureaucracy focusing on assessing compliance rather than streamlining it. Furthermore, the commissioner has been vested with a range of powers to interfere with and remove responsible office-bearers in a manner which is simply unprecedented. As things stand, the government is still yet to satisfactorily make out the mischief which it sees and which would warrant such extraordinary regulatory overreach. In contrast to the current government, the coalition will not seek to treat charities and notfor-profit agencies as arms of government. The coalition supports transparency and accountability of public funds. We also support simplicity and efficiency. The charity and not-for-profit sector has a long history in this country of responsible governance and management, and the coalition will continue to respect this fact. We recognise that there is a place for a national body to enhance the role of institutions of civil society. Accordingly, we will support a small organisation as an educative and training body and will work with the sector to ensure that the body represents the sector. Indeed, we will work with the sector to transfer responsibility and governance of the commission, or of the new body to replace it, to the sector over the next few years. Under the coalition, the independent body will provide education and support services to registered charities, provide information to assist with the process of registration of new charities and not-for-profit agencies, act as a one-stop shop for information on charitable organisations and agencies operating within Australia, advocate for the rights of charities and not-for-profit agencies, represent the interests of charities and not-for-profit agencies to government, help facilitate the interaction between government and the charitable and not-forprofit sector, undertake research and cross-sector evaluation on issues of concern to the sector and help to foster innovation within the sector. We will also work with the new body to coordinate with the sector, the Commonwealth, states and territories to propose a new common financial and other reporting standard that will negate the practice of numerous reports being prepared each year for different funding and regulatory bodies. We will return the regulatory powers which existed in the ATO, ASIC and other similar bodies to those bodies. Until and unless there is harmonisation of various Commonwealth, state and territory laws, the proposed commission simply adds yet another layer of regulation and bureaucracy on the sector. We will respect the role of the states but we will work with them to achieve harmony in relation to the fundraising codes and other various regulations. Secondly, we will retain the current common law definition of 'charity' and maintain the public benefit test. This is consistent with evidence-based reviews of the 2001 charities definition inquiry, the 2008 Henry review and the 2010 Productivity Commission report. We will examine any particular issues that are the cause of concern. For example, it has been suggested that the charity sector needs review and regulation because the sector receives substantial tax concessions. Arguments about tax concessions for charities and not-for-profits do not belong in the consultation formation of policy on the definition of 'charity', the ACNA, not-for-profit governance arrangements and charitable fundraising. The issue should not be conflated. Instead, tax reform should be considered in specific responses such as the unrelated business income test and the 'in Australia' proposed reforms. Consistent with this approach the coalition will work with the sector to address any particular issues that arise regarding the taxation treatment of charitable organisations. We will not use discrete taxation issues as a Trojan horse, to impose a burdensome new regulatory system on the sector. When it comes to civil society, there is a clear choice between Labor's approach and that of the coalition, between Labor's complex, burdensome regulation and bigstick approach, which includes a new regulator and between the coalition's approach, one where the government treats civil society with the respect and the trust it deserves. In closing, I am pleased to advise that the coalition supports this bill. I only wish that the government supported our broader approach to civil society as well. (17:17): I thank the member for Menzies for his contribution and for his indulgence a little earlier. The Not-for-profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill 2013 will introduce provisions that would prohibited and invalidate clauses in Commonwealth agreements with the not-forprofit sector that restrict or prevent not-for-profit entities from advocating on Commonwealth law, policy or action. It is an important bill given that we have recently seen Liberal state governments across Australia prohibiting community and not-for-profit organisations from speaking out against their savage cuts. For example, the New South Wales government has recently followed in the Queensland government's footsteps by proposing to introduce gag clauses into funding agreements with community legal centres. State Liberal governments are making their approach to the not-for-profit sector clear. They cut to the bone and then they try to silence any criticism. Insulting gag clauses, I am afraid, are a part of the Liberal Party's DNA. They clearly have no respect for the independence of the not-for-profit sector. They used gag clauses when the Howard government was in power and it took a Labor government to remove them in 2008. If the opposition genuinely values and recognises the independence of the not-for-profit sector and the contribution it makes to policy debates, then the Leader of the Opposition must publicly condemn the use of gag clauses by his Liberal state colleagues. Indeed, I noted with interest the comments of the member for Menzies about the suggestion that, when it comes to the not-for-profit sector, 'they get it', to quote him. If they do get it, I would suggest that he should, at the very least, pick up the phone and call Premier Newman and Premier O'Farrell and ask them to overturn the positions they have implemented which have sought to gag the not-for-profit sector, to silence their opponents, people who have stood up in defence of a range of organisations, from community development organisations through to domestic",211,Bills
265,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)violence services, organisations which have sought to speak out against cuts to government programs. The response of those respective Liberal governments has been to impose gag clauses, to silence their opponents under the threat of withdrawing any remaining government funding that they may be entitle to. That is what the not-for-profit sector could look forward to if the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition were to be elected. I commend the bill to the House. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 17:20 to 17:35 Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014 Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. more specifically, talk about Labor's budget that was delivered-and what a budget we saw. Let us start with the Treasurer's speech on that Tuesday night. He started by introducing his budget as a budget for growth and a budget for jobs, yet ultimately in the end what did the detail of the budget show? It showed quite clearly that this budget for growth and this budget for jobs actually did the opposite. It showed that growth was going to diminish. It showed that unemployment was going to increase. So our growth and jobs budget turned out to be completely the opposite. As we continued to go into the budget we started to see that the Treasurer had been laid bare, that his rhetoric over 5½ years had come to nothing. This idea of being an economic conservative, this idea of being able to deliver proper financial reform for this country, was laid bare as being absolutely hollow. This idea that the budget would be returned to surplus over a period of time was seen to be absolutely flawed, absolutely fundamentally wrong. Being kind, I would say that the Australian people have been misled and misled and misled by the Treasurer ever since the Labor government came to office. What we saw with that budget was that all the chickens had come home to roost. All of a sudden we had a Treasurer having to be honest. The facts had caught up with him. There was no surplus to be seen. As a matter of fact, what we have seen both from the Parliamentary Budget Office and then from the Treasury is this. Since 2007 Australia's finance have deteriorated to the extent that we now have a fiscal imbalance, a structural deficit to the tune of around $16 billion. So in 2016-17 our budget, if it continues on this trajectory, will hit a deficit of $16 billion to $17 billion if all other things stay consistent. As we know with this government, sadly, that is not the case. What this government has shown beyond any other thing is that it is addicted",213,Bills
266,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (17:37,"I rise tonight to talk on these appropriation bills and,to spending. It cannot help but spend, spend, spend. That is its answer to everything. At some stage the spending has to stop. I think the truth of the matter is that the Australian people will get the chance to make the decision come election time. If Labor is re-elected history tells us that the spending will not stop. What did the budget also show us? It showed us that gross debt, which is at $250 billion, will hit $300 billion. Yet the Treasurer will not have the honesty to go to the Australian people and say, 'Through my forward policies, through my spending addiction, I will lift the gross debt ceiling.' They are going to leave it to a future government. Once again, we are seeing budget dishonesty. Why not admit to the fact it is a mess? Why not say: we realise we have got a mess, now we are going to have the honesty to say okay, although it is too late, we are going to admit that we got it so wrong. What happens to the budget in this financial year? Sadly, we are going to see a budget deficit in the vicinity of roughly $19 billion. And if history over the last few years shows us anything it shows us that that will be a conservative estimate. It is likely that $19 billion potentially could hit $30 billion if not $40 billion. It also adds to the fact that we have had the five largest budget deficits in a row in Australia's history. What a record this Treasurer will take when he leaves this parliament. He has never delivered a surplus although he promised to deliver one well over 100 times. He will leave gross debt over $300 billion. He will have delivered the five largest budget deficits in Australia's history-what a record. It is going to be interesting to see how this record is tried to be buried, how this record is tried to be changed. It is practically indefensible. The sad thing is where is this going to leave the nation? We are currently seeing a lot of problems within the Australian economy. We are seeing them in our manufacturing sector, we are seeing them in our agricultural sector, we are seeing them in retail and there are no solution to these problems in the economic plan which was set out by the Treasurer in the budget. It is very interesting to contrast that with what the Leader of the Opposition had to say on the Thursday night because he did set out an economic plan, a clear economic plan of what a coalition government if elected would do for the Australian economy. Business confidence, consumer confidence would be restored. We would get rid of the carbon tax but keep the tax cuts. I will repeat that because it was a very important message from that Thursday night. Get rid of the carbon tax but keep the tax cuts. I think you are going to hear that said long and loud between now and election day because it is a key component that really goes to the heart of our ability to manage the economy. Cut the taxes, cut the carbon tax and deliver tax cuts. You will hear it between now and election day. Prepare as you can to try and combat it because it is a powerful message. To back it up, we have our record in government of reducing debt, cutting taxes and making sure the budget surpluses are delivered. Boy oh boy, do we need to make sure that we get the finances of the nation back in order, because the spending addiction we have seen has been like no other spending addiction any government has overseen. This one has the five largest budget deficits in Australia's history-the $300 billion debt ceiling having to be lifted again, but the political courage is not there for this government to do it themselves. They are going to leave it as a legacy to the next parliament. The Treasurer will have delivered more than $25 billion in higher taxes over the next four years. Chaos, debt and spin. Fortunately, there is an alternative plan. It will see the Australian economy set a trajectory of growth, will see unemployment decline and will see our key industries-agriculture, manufacturing, retail and services-have the confidence to grow. This is because we will reduce taxes and make sure that those taxes that are hurting our economy, most particularly the carbon tax, will go. It was an outstanding speech by the Leader of the Opposition because it was honest and frank with the Australian people. It was a speech that called the Labor government to account. It revealed all the warts that were presented by Wayne Swan on the previous Tuesday night and started the process of saying, 'There is a better way that we can manage this economy.' It was backed by the shadow Treasurer at the National Press Club the following week, laying out detailed plans of how we will find the savings within the budget to make sure that we live within our means. Done properly, it will not be that difficult. It will be about having a serious economic discussion with the Australian people, laying out the plans, showing where the Commonwealth spends its funds and saying, 'Okay, if we're to tighten our belts, this is how we will have to do it.' We cannot say to the Australian people: 'We want you to tighten your belts during these times' and not have the government do the same itself. That is the clear message we will be delivering. If we are to get rid of this structural deficit-which will hit $16 billion if nothing is done about it-we have to take action. That action was laid out there for everyone to see. We will not make shock decisions. We will not make radical changes of policy. We will have a consistent approach to running the nation's finances. That is all the Australian people are asking for, at this stage. They just want a government that will deliver them some certainty, a government that has a philosophy about the way it will run the nation, a government that will not focus on the opposition and the opposition leader, and a government that will focus on running the economy and running the country-and doing so in the interests of all Australians. That is what you will get from us, if we are elected at the next election. We will forget the spin. We will start to address the debt. We will start to address the deficit. We will give business confidence, we will give consumers confidence and we will get the economy tracking where it should be. We need to do it if we are to have an economy which can live and operate in a globalised world. We have to make sure that production costs come down and that businesses can compete globally, because whether you operate in the domestic environment or whether you export and operate in the global environment, you do so in a globalised world. You have to be able to compete. One of the fundamental things that the Treasurer and the current Prime Minister have never, ever understood is that we are not isolated; we do not live in an incubator. We actually have to operate now in a globalised world, and this presents real challenges. It means that we have to keep our costs down if we are to compete with what is occurring in the US, where we are seeing a new energy source providing a cheap form of input to their industries. If we are to compete with that, we have to make sure that our input costs are kept down. That is why the carbon tax, when it comes to electricity prices, has hurt so much. I give one example: Murray Goulburn, the dairy processor. Their carbon tax bill is $14 million annually. That makes it a lot harder for them to compete internationally. You can run through industry after industry after industry and the same thing is happening. We have to keep our costs down so that we can compete. It is no longer okay to say that we are going to put up some sort of protective blanket around our economy and that we will be able to survive. In a globalised world that will get us nowhere. We have to be able to compete. We have to make sure that our industries are able to compete. That is the key to our retail sector, to our services sector, to our manufacturing sector and, most importantly, to our agricultural sector. The opportunities are there with the growing middle classes in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. There are opportunities there for the Australian economy, for Australian businesses, but we have to be able to compete to make the most of those opportunities. Sadly-and I wish I could say otherwise-the budget that was delivered does not do that. But there was a budget reply on the Thursday night which showed a clear direction on how it can be done, and I commend that budget reply to the House. (Time expired) and says, 'Let's cut the spin,' and then spends 15 minutes spinning around like a top. It is almost unbelievable that you could give a speech about the economy and history of the Rudd and Gillard governments and not actually mention that a global financial crisis happened somewhere in there. We just heard a contribution that went for 15 minutes and did not mention that there had been a global financial crisis. Come on! You want to talk about spin, you want to talk about economic credibility, let us get a little bit real. The previous member tried to talk about global comparisons. Give us one where Australia does not look far superior to every other country in the world in terms of economic growth, unemployment, inflation, productivity, debt and deficit. What measure are you on? You want to have an argument on spin and you want to have an argument on economics-well, argue the economics. Do not argue the spin. Really, what a pathetic contribution we have just heard. In my contribution on these appropriation bills, I am going to be critical of the government in relation to some of their management over the past six years, but they are going to be real criticisms; they are not going to made-up ones. I am not going to be in fairy land. I am not going to pretend things did not happen. I am not going to not talk about what happened around the world in terms of the global financial crisis. If you want to have some credibility in economics, you have to talk about what occurred and what the situation was in Australia. I think this most recent budget was perhaps the Treasurer's most honest budget and, taken in isolation, a very good budget. The problem for the government in terms of where they are with their messaging is not that they have not responded to the global financial crisis but that they have tried to do too much. If we could just imagine for a second-and I know this might cause shivers for the Deputy Speaker-that it had been John Howard who was the Prime Minister for the last term, what we probably would have seen would have been no spending on any social and important issues such as education, the NDIS, health and those sorts of things. That is an approach that he could have taken and it might well have seen us get closer to a budget surplus. Alternatively, you could set out a program of social reform, a program of trying to address issues that are important to Australians. Either of those approaches is possible and you could debate their merits. My criticism of the government was that they tried to do both, and clearly that has not worked. That is where I do agree with the previous speaker about the issues in relation to",214,Bills
267,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (17:52,"It always amazes me when someone gets upgoing on about a surplus for year after year when clearly the program that this government was on was about improving people's lives through a range of social measures. They should have said for the last number of years: 'Look, these are the things that we want to do and it is going to take us longer to get back to a surplus. But, compared to the rest of the world, look how well we're going.' I think if they had taken that approach they would have taken the Australian community with them. That is my major criticism of the government in terms of the way in which they have dealt with these issues. Yes, there has been spin from the government, but not nearly as much spin as we saw from the previous speaker in his contribution, because you have to look at what the issues are. There were two alternative approaches, but you could not do them both-and this government tried. I want to talk about some of the local initiatives that were in this budget and in previous budgets, since the previous speaker has set the scene of putting this budget, quite rightly, in the context of previous budgets. Most importantly for the people of the Central Coast, where I live, and the seat that I represent was the commitment to fixing the missing road link between the F3 and the M2, where 21 sets of traffic lights create a logjam as more than 45,000 commuters from the Central Coast travel down to Sydney and back every day. This is called the missing link because it is something that governments should have done years and years ago. This budget has finally got there, and the government should be commended for that, as should the state government for agreeing to pay its share for this vital piece of road infrastructure. But the budget went further in terms of roads for my electorate: to widening the F3 pretty much from Tuggerah right up to Doyalson. We have three lanes for most of it, but the significant part of the F3 that goes through my electorate is two lanes each way, again causing the very difficult commute that 45,000 people from the Central Coast do every day to be that much more difficult. So these are really important, real commitments that happened in this budget, because spending time at home with your family is what it is about for most people, not sitting in traffic jams on freeways because the infrastructure money has not been spent. Those are concerns for everyone. CanI say with some pride that that is the second missing link that I have been responsible for in terms of fixing things in my electorate. The first, and I think the most significant, was a missing pipeline link in our water system. The Central Coast almost ran out of water just a few years ago-we had less than 10 per cent water. We were able to secure over $80 million to build a pipeline to help harvest the water from the catchment area and take it up to the storage dam. We have just celebrated our dam having more than 50 per cent water for the first time in 30 years. This would not have occurred without vital infrastructure being paid for and delivered on the Central Coast for the first time, and I will come back to the importance of water in my contribution. In looking at the budget over a period of time. I did a comparison between the previous six years in my electorate and the six years that will be up later this year. You can characterise it in a number of ways. We have gone from flagpoles to libraries. We have gone from cutting health budgets to super GP clinics and our own area health service for the Central Coast, something we have been after for years. We have gone from drought to drought-proofing. We have gone from the infamous rort of money for Tumby Creek to significant millions of dollars in terms of an environmental program to help fix up Tuggerah Lakes. We are in the process of going from copper wire to fibre with the NBN. These are stark differences between what happened when there was a coalition member in the seat that I occupy and what we have been able to achieve in the last six years. These are things that make a difference to people's lives, and that is what budgets are primarily about-they are about making sure there are resources going to the right places. I want to briefly go back to the issue of our water supply because it is being threatened at the moment by mining interests. We have a catchment area in the Wyong valleys through which this pipeline goes and we have a proposal for a mine. For the last two or three state and federal elections, the major parties have come along and said, 'There will be no mine; we are going to stop the mine,' and then, as soon as the election has ended, the mine has been back on the table. The reason that we have a real issue with this is that even the miners themselves are estimating that there will be more water lost in a day through this mine than the average rainfall for the area. The experts have said that it will take 200 years, if it will happen at all, for the aquifers to be refilled to supply the water for the Central Coast if this mine goes ahead. Significantly, in relation to government investment, we have a pipeline that has droughtproofed the Central Coast that could drop by over a metre with subsidence and crack, meaning all that important drought-proofing that has taken place in relation to infrastructure investment in the Central Coast would be for nought. It is an issue. It is the No. 1 issue on the Central Coast and it is something that we need to continue to fight for. I also wanted to say a few things about the coalition's candidate in the next election. The Liberal Party have made an interesting choice of candidate. The Central Coast candidate's husband ran in the last election, and, like her husband, this candidate was also not preselected by the Liberal Party rank and file-someone else won the preselection. Apparently, on the Central Coast, if anyone other than a McNamara wins the preselection you have to kick them out and put a McNamara in. So for two elections in a row we are going to have a McNamara. One of the really interesting things about the current candidate is that two years ago she wanted to join the Labor Party, surprisingly. So we have a candidate who actually did not want to be in the Liberal Party--she wanted to be in the Labor Party-and whose husband ran as the Liberal Party candidate last time. She has decided that she will have a shot at it anyway. You look at what she stands for, and she does not really stand for terribly much, so probably the label did not mean that much to her. Her main supporter on the Central Coast is the current mayor, Mayor Eaton. It is very interesting to look at his policies because the current candidate has wrapped herself around this mayor. This is the mayor who came up with a terrific idea-they should get rid of green bins! Who really wants to recycle? It is bit of a cost for council so we should get rid of green bins! He opposed the super GP clinic that I was able to secure for the electorate. He opposed it vehemently, as did the last Liberal candidate for Dobell-'Oops! that is the present candidate's husband. Again, those are the sorts of policies they are looking at. He actually supports a mine under the catchment area even though the council does not support it. The Liberal Party candidate cannot bring herself to say, 'The issues for the community are more important than what my mayor instructs me to say as a Liberal Party candidate.' He wants to transform the Central Coast into a Chinese theme park. That will be a great success-we can see Chinese tourists flooding over to look at imitations of what they have in their own country. We are sure that will be a remarkable success. The crowning moment for the mayor and now his Liberal Party partner was a much more novel idea than mine-I was able to secure $20 million to help fix up Tuggerah Lakes. Their idea was to drain the lakes, cement them up and have them catch water to help us with our drought problems. Some of the policies this mayor has and this Liberal candidate has tied herself to are quite crazy. The government has, in the last six years, really got its messages wrong about what it wants to do. But it cannot say it is going to deliver surpluses when it embarks on a different social program. It can say: 'We're going to have a social program and we're not going back into surplus,' but they cannot say both. That is the great shame and the great story that the Treasurer is going to have to live with. In relation to my electorate, The choice and the difference for infrastructure, investment and quality of life that investment has made over the last six years compared to the previous six years-when the coalition was in government and had a coalition member in the seat of Dobell-is so stark that no one on the Central Coast wants to go back to those days, when we missed out on vital infrastructure that changes people's lives. People on the Central Coast appreciate that we have been able to secure more money and investment in infrastructure in six years than the previous years that this seat has been in existence. That is something that everyone on the Central Coast can be proud of. As the member for Dobell, I am certainly very proud of that record over the last six years. (Time expired) This is the budget that was framed against the background of the Treasurer's opening statement a year ago. That opening statement was to the effect of 'TonightI deliver a budget which will deliver four successive surpluses.' A year later, there are no four surpluses in evidence. The year that was to have been the first of those years had a $19 billion deficit. The second of those years had an $18 billion deficit, and then an over-$10 billion deficit. Then, in the final year, we have an $800 million notional surplus-which is an entirely fictional figure. Why does all of this matter? It matters for two reasons, because somebody has to pay back the debt. Somebody always has to pay back the debt. Every family knows this. Every smallbusiness owner knows this. Every farmer knows this. And every responsible government knows that somebody always has to pay back the debt. Since the election of the ALP in 2007 the actual budget that they have delivered-not what they promised; not what they pledgedhas been a $27 billion deficit, a $54 billion deficit, a $47 billion deficit, a $43 billion deficit and a $19 billion deficit. And now we have projections of an $18 billion deficit, for the sixth budget, and a $10 billion deficit for the seventh budget. That is a history of failure. That is not about returning the budget to surplus on average over the cycle; that is a cycle of deficit. And it comes after a similar period of deficit under the previous ALP government. So what we see here are 12 major successive deficits on either side of a coalition which, through 12 budgets, delivered 10 surpluses. So, at its heart-at its core-this shows that there is a fundamental difference between two sides. The ALP answer is that the Liberals are just terribly lucky and the ALP are terribly unlucky. The say, 'For some reason they always govern in good times and we always govern in bad times.' The Labor Party inherited a more than $20 billion surplus. They inherited a more than $50 billion bank account in the black and they have sent our deficit to the bottom.",217,Bills
268,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (18:07,"The 2013-14 budget is the one that broke a nation's faith.They have created a national debt which will now head towards $190 billion in net terms alone. Gross debt is inevitably likely to exceed the $300 billion figure. These figures have consequences, because there is interest and repayment, and there is opportunity foregone. And who can say that there have been fabulous infrastructure programs which have delivered long-term permanent reductions in national bottlenecks? The money has just gone. I lived through the pink batts program and the green loans program. I saw the cash for clunkers announced and abolished. I saw the citizens' assembly announced and abolished. I saw nine consecutive changes in the carbon tax in its structural performance in just under a year. All of this money that has gone has not produced anything of great national significant. If it had been spent with a purpose-if it had achieved an outcome-it would have been irresponsible to have done this to the national balance sheet but at least we would have had something. Sadly, we have an absence of infrastructure and an absence of outcomes for this massive process of consecutive budget deficits on a grand scale, the likes of which we have never seen in Australia. These dollar deficits are the five highest deficits in Australian history. So, against that background we have this fiction of a surplus in 2015-16 at $0.8 billion-or $800 millionand then roughly $6 billion in 2016-17. Both of those figures are also deeply susceptible to any analysis. On the first grounds we have seen that the mining tax revenue is projected to soar one thousand per cent. Those figures cannot be trusted. Secondly, the arrival of boats are benchmarked against the Howard era rather than against the Rudd and Gillard era. We have gone from barely a couple of boats a year to 40,000 arrivals in four years. Those are two fundamental flaws, where the figures cannot be believed. But in my particular area we have seen a $6 billion black hole on the basis of a $2 billion revenue gap against projections in 2015-16, which would wipe away the surplus, and a $4 billion gap in 2016-17 which, on its own, would almost wipe away the surplus. What is the basis of this? The basis is very simple. The carbon tax revenue projections cannot be believed. The government knows it. The bureaucracy knows it. In the bureaucracy's defence, they have actually made it clear that these are not their real projections; these are what they were required, as policy statements, to put into budget paper no. 1. And the public knows that the government's carbon tax revenue projections cannot be believed. How can this be? Already in this year's budget for the year just passing, 2012-13, we have a $5 billion writedown. That is because the budget had relied on a $29 price for carbon in 2015-16. It now turns out that the European price for that period is just under $6 rather than the $29 that was projected. The EUAs, European Union forward allowances for 2015-16 for tendering on 30 June 2016, are currently trading at a figure well under A$6, in the mid-$5.50. That means that we have already seen a write-down in revenue of $5 million. But the government has only written it down to a projected price of $12.10 in 2015-16 and $18.60 in 2016-17. Then you ask how could they have a figure which is more than double what the market is projecting as the basis for the revenue they have calculated in the budget? How can you have a figure which is more than triple what the market is projecting for the second of those years, 201617? The answer is very simple. It is helpfully set out at page 2-48 of Budget Paper No. 1. In terms of the explanation under box 9 of updated carbon price estimates, what we see is that the bureaucracy has made it absolutely clear that these are not their figures; these are not their projections; these are what they were required to put in place. These advance auctions in the Budget forecast years are based upon average EU-ETS market futures prices for 2013-14 and 2014-15. However, carbon prices in the Budget projection years are not forecasts of carbon prices. It goes on to say: Projections for carbon prices for emissions liabilities for 2015-16 and 2016-17 incorporate the straightforward approach of a linear transition from market prices in 2014-15 to the modelled price of $38 in 2019-20 … It goes on: The longer-term modelled carbon prices from SGLP reflect the price levels required to meet long-term global environmental goals as well as the international commitment pledges for 2020 … In other words, these are not market projections of what the market price will be. These are working back from what the government requires in order to meet its emissions targets using the carbon tax. My point and our point is very clear: the budget is fundamentally broken. We said this last year and we were right. The revenue forecasts were wildly over inflated for the budget. There was not a collapse in revenue. Revenue came in at what people would reasonably have expected. The only failing was that the government, the ALP, predicted that they would win TattsLotto. They spent as if they would win TattsLotto and when they did not win TattsLotto they suddenly claimed that revenue had collapsed. It did not. They had six per cent growth in government receipts last year. They are projecting seven per cent growth in government receipts this year. Any business which had six and seven per cent growth year-on-year in gross revenue would see itself in a very good position. That then leads me to the final conclusion that not only have they failed in past projections but this year the government has failed to learn from their past failures. So the fact that we see a carbon price estimate in revenue, which is twice what the market had projects in 20 2015-16 and triple what the market projects in 2016-17, shows that there is no connection to reality. That means a $2-billion black hole in 2015-16 and $4-billion black hole in 2016-17. The figures cannot be believed. They were wrong last year. They are wrong this year. In the meantime, we have the highest electricity taxes in the world. The Australian government is driving up electricity prices with enormous damage to abattoirs. I met with the meat and livestock council today. These taxes are driving up the cost to aluminium smelters. They are driving up the cost to manufacturers and to car makers-to everybody involved in fabrication and manufacturing in this country. There is a massively high impact on them because of the electricity price rises-14½ per cent on average, according to the Australian Industry Group. After1 July 2015, if you believe this government, one of two things will happen: either electricity prices will continue to skyrocket or there will be a massive budget black hole. This all comes about from the folly of tying our national revenue and our national electricity prices to decisions taken in Brussels. I have no issue with the European Union, but I do have an issue with abandoning our sovereignty over our electricity prices and our national budget. For those reasons, whilst we will not stand in the way of supply because we do not wish the country to suffer from instability, we think this budget should be condemned on the basis that it is established and founded on forecasts which cannot be believed. We will repeal the carbon tax beginning on day one because, above all else, not only is it poor economics and poor for our competitiveness but it fails utterly to achieve the task of reducing emissions. It does not do the job economically; it does not do the job environmentally. Ultimately, we can reduce our emissions, achieve our outcomes, without a carbon tax by doing direct things which actually clean up the environment on a lowest cost basis rather than having the highest carbon tax in the world today and a collapse in budget revenue in 2015-16. of this chamber, we have experienced three large areas of debt-firstly under the Whitlam government, then under the Hawke-Keating government and now under this government. They tried to come up with all sorts of excuses that really resembled things like 'the dog ate my homework'. There is the excuse that the government has a revenue problem. In fact, revenue in 2013-14 is over $80 billion higher than it was in the last year of the coalition government, just six years ago; but spending is $120 billion higher. So revenue is $80 billion higher but spending is $120 billion higher. The government really has a spending problem, not a revenue problem, and so it cannot use that lame excuse with any credibility. The Australian people deserve better than the empty 'surplus' promise and spin. They work hard for their money and deserve a credible economic strategy. Australia cannot afford to keep running up record debts and deficits, and only a coalition government has the right people and experience to get this country back on track. To pay off the debt that we have already accumulated under this government, we, the taxpayers, are paying $35 million a day to pay the interest charges on that debt. In my electorate, I have 35 communities that would love to have $1 million to spend in their community, but we are using it to pay off our debtwell, it does not actually pay off the debt; it only pays the interest on the debt bill. When we look at this budget, we see that it does nothing to help Australian families with the rise in the cost of living. The budget will deliver more than $25 billion in higher taxes over the next four years, and 99 per cent of that will hit Australians after the next election. The coalition does have a plan to take the pressure off families, and it starts with abolishing the carbon tax. Abolishing the carbon tax will take pressure off electricity and gas prices, and that will provide much needed relief to household budgets. Families and pensioners will also benefit by fully retaining the income tax cuts and fortnightly pension and benefit increases associated with that carbon tax. This is a commitment that is fully funded and accounted for by equivalent reductions in government spending-something that this government does not seem to understand. The Productivity Commission will also be tasked with examining ways to make child care more flexible for people like shift workers, who cannot access the mainstream childcare system. The coalition do get it when it comes to family living costs and they understand how important it is to take the pressure off family living costs. But we know that it can only be done with the right economic plan. Only this Labor government could invent a mining tax that hardly raises any revenue but destroys confidence. The forecast revenues from the mining tax have collapsed from $22.5 billion to $3.3 billion over the first four years. Despite the failure of the mining tax to raise any meaningful revenue so far, Wayne Swan's 2016-17 surplus promise relies on mining tax",220,Bills
269,Mr Secker (Barker,"Opposition Whip) (18:22): As I was saying in the previous sittingrevenue increasing by more than 10 times its level this year. That is a big call. We will abolish the mining tax, and abolishing the mining tax means supporting investment and jobs. We will also help small businesses grow and create more jobs by cutting redand greentape costs by $1 billion every year. Under a carbon tax, small businesses are paying at least 10 per cent more for their electricity and nine per cent more for their gas. The coalition will abolish this carbon tax. The blow-out in the management of Australian borders is at least $4.7 billion since the last budget and is just getting worse. Overall, it has cost taxpayers more than $10 billion over budget, when in the last years of the Howard government it was costing virtually nothing. This budget also assumes that boat arrivals will phase down-that is the term used-over the next four years, despite arrivals now at a record and increasing level. We need to stop the boats. The coalition has the experience and the right plan to stop the boats-after all, we have done it before. We can do it again. Remember, John Howard inherited a problem and crafted a solution. The current government inherited a solution and created a problem. To stop the boats, we need rigorous offshore processing for illegal arrivals. We need to reintroduce temporary protection visas and we need to give the Navy the option of turning back the boats where it is safe to do so. Labor, unfortunately, has no interest in Australia's primary sector or in the regional communities dependent on agriculture. Labor has cut millions from the department's already strained resources and has cut millions from cooperative research centres, which means fewer CRCs are funded each year and, as most of the CRCs are agriculturally based, there will be less funding for agriculture. Labor has also reduced the exceptional circumstances budget by hundreds of millions of dollars and has refused to acknowledge the exceptional circumstances of the floods in many states. Labor has cut cargo-screening resources at ports and airports, resulting in 4.7 fewer aircargo consignments being inspected each year and 2,150 fewer vessels being boarded on arrival. That puts our security at risk. Labor has also cut $63 million from agriculture research within the CSIRO and closed CSIRO agricultural research sites in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. We all know that Labor's kneejerk reaction to suspend live exports to Indonesian abattoirs severely damaged our $1 million industry, weakened industry confidence and threatened jobs. The coalition will stop farmers, regional communities and the agricultural sector paying more for electricity and gas, by abolishing the carbon tax. It will also support the live export industry, as it has in the past. We believe that maintaining the live export trade will be the best way to improve animal welfare and to reward those abattoirs who do the right thing. The coalition in government will be able to restore confidence by reversing the damage that Labor has done-and they have done a lot of damage. The Labor Party are very good at announcing big-ticket items but hopeless at paying for them. Debt continues to rise. The gross debt is most likely to exceed the $300 billion limit within the forward estimates, and this government is wasting $7.8 billion a year on interest payments alone. The spending spree has to end, and the coalition has identified savings that will be implemented if the coalition is elected to government in September. We will rescind the increase in the humanitarian intake. We will reduce through natural attrition by at least 12,000 the size of the Commonwealth public sector, which is now 20,000 bureaucrats bigger than it was in 2007. We will scrap Labor's green loans scheme for a project that banks will not touch. (Time expired) get in there, don't we! I rise to talk about the bill before the chamber tonight-Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014-because it is part of probably one of the most important budgets that we are going to see in a long time. We have known for a while about the revenue writedowns. We have known about the GFC, which has had a very long tail and which affects a lot of people in a lot of ways. The Treasurer delivered a budget which seems foreign to those opposite because it is not full of election bribes and handouts. It is a sensible budget which puts us on track to make sure that this country continues in the position that it is in now. Those on the other side are running a scare campaign-the fairy tales about the economy being dead, the world going to pieces and the Australian economy going to pieces-but the facts on the table prove that the reality is completely otherwise. They prove that the only failure is the failure of the opposition to put forward a plan. They have come up with a magic pudding-'we're going to give everyone tax cuts; we're going to give everyone the world and not collect any money for it'-and then they have the audacity to come into this place and the other place and complain about what the Labor government is doing. They did have budget surpluses when they were in government, but they also cut the guts out of spending. They did not cut it to the bone; they cut right through it. That is why our hospitals are in such trouble. There was as much money spent on golf balls by former health minister Abbott as there was money spent on patient care. Compare this to what this government have done and to what we have had to do in such tough economic circumstances. We have invested money in health. We have delivered cancer centres right across the nation. Those opposite did not do that. We have delivered superclinics, which means that families do not have to drive for many miles, particularly in my electorate, to see a doctor or specialist when they need to. We have delivered right across the education portfolio with the Gonski reforms. The report by David Gonski looked at a better and fairer way to get education funding for our kids which would be based on their needs, not their postcodes. But the silver-spooners over there would like to see something different, and that is why they never invested money in schools. You only have to look at what is going on with state governments to see exactly what will happen if those opposite get their claws into the Australian economy. In Victoria, before the Liberal government was elected, every school was to be rebuilt over the period from 2012 to 2016. But that has been totally scrapped by the state Liberal government to the point where there are kids in learning facilities where you cannot even open a window or where you have to nail the windows shut because otherwise they would fall out. What has happened to Woodend Primary School in my electorate is an example of what will happen if the coalition is elected to federal government. The coalition in Victoria have totally stopped every bit of maintenance on Woodend Primary School. There is an example of what we will see if those opposite are elected. Let us look at the very fundamentals of our budget and Australia's position in the global economy. We have extremely low unemployment. We have low interest rates-a lot lower than what they were when those opposite were in government. We have contained inflation.",223,Bills
270,Mr Mitchell (Mcewen,"Government Whip) (18:30): Boy, we regret letting PatrickThese are pretty big fundamentals to have right and for the Australian people to look at on 14 September. The average person in McEwen has a home with a mortgage of about $300,000, and that is rising. Because of this government they are now more than $100 a week better off than they would have been, in exactly the same place, had we unfortunately kept a Howard or Costello, or whoever had the guts to stand up and do it, government under the coalition. That is direct money into people's pockets that they are using to spend and keep the economy going along. We hear those opposite constantly carp and whinge and complain about debt in this country. There are any number of studies and reports around the world showing just how strong our economy is. We are one of only eight countries that still hold a AAA credit rating by all three rating agencies. That is something those opposite can only aspire to, because they could never achieve it. Even through the glorious days of the Howard era, as they call it, they could not achieve a AAA credit rating from all three agencies. It has only been done by our government, by a Labor government, and we have done that because we stick to the fundamentals of what is right for the economy. We stick to what needs to be done to ensure that Australian families are better off. When we look back to the GFC we see the 200,000 jobs that would have been lost had they had their way and not supported the stimulus package that was put through by the Labor government. We did that because it needed to be done to keep the economy afloat. We are getting the benefits of that now, because we are not in double-digit unemployment, we are not in recession, we are actually going along quite strongly. Yes, it is a patchwork, it is up and down-that is a reality of the Australian economy. You only have to look to that great conservative icon Mr Howard, a man who it is fair to say none of us on this side admire too much but who put it well when he told a Sydney conference: When the current Prime Minister and the Treasurer and others tell you that the Australian economy is doing better than most-they are right. Those are pretty powerful words coming from the great leader of the conservatives; when he comes out and says our government, this Labor government, has got it right and that 'we are fortunate that we have an unemployment rate with five in front of it'. Even he did not think that was possible, and it is something that would not be possible if those opposite get their hands on the economy. We have also invested in DisabilityCare. This is something that strikes, I think, to the morals of your heart. This is about protecting and supporting people who are the most vulnerable, who are not able to actively participate in the workforce because of a range of issues, usually because they are not getting the support that they need. We have brought that in to ensure that people with disabilities can have a fair start to life and a fair opportunity to become participants in the workforce and do what they want to do, which is to be contributors to our society. The fundamentals of our budget are being stronger by supporting jobs and supporting growth. We have seen nearly a million jobs created under this government-something those opposite only wish they could do. We have seen investing in our classrooms to give kids the best possible opportunities, to skill them up for the future to make sure they can get job opportunities in the future. AgainI look to those opposite and say: let's look at your track record. The track record of the conservatives is to cut skills education, to cut TAFE, to cut the VET and VCAL programs in Victoria. We inherited a massive skill shortage when we came to government in 2007 because of the direct actions of those opposite in cutting the funding for training and support and for further education. We took the cap of university places. We have actually invested all this money for our future. If you look at the Victorian government, the Queensland government and the New South Wales government, there is a window to what will happen if those opposite win the 14 September election. We will see exactly the same thing: everything is cut to the bone. That is a term we do not use lightly, a term we do not like to use, but it is a clear fact that that will happen if they get in. You only have to look at what they have done in Victoria and New South Wales, where everywhere you go, right across those states, unemployment is going through the roof. It is going through the roof because they are doing what they do best, and that is sack people and take away wages and conditions. We have already seen the Leader of the Opposition talk about a tax review and about increasing the GST, and that is exactly what they will do. They will increase the GST. It is the first thing that came out on their Thursday night speech. Look at Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition's, carefully scripted and crafted words. He talked about how people's personal income tax will not be affected. But what it means over here is that they will be pushing to support a rise in the GST by at least 2.5 per cent. They have never been able to come out and deny it and they will not stand up and say absolutely categorically it will not happen-and I will resign if it does. They will not say that because they know they cannot. They have already had discussions with their state colleagues about the redistribution of GST. They have already gone through that. We have already seen that they are going to put in an impost on Australian families with a 1.6 per cent tax increase to businesses to pay for the paid parental leave scheme that is going to help people who are earning $150,000 a year more than it is going to help those that need the money the most, those on the lower end of the scale. We already know now that because of what they are doing, the banks are saying, 'We will just pass that onto people; we will pass that on to interest rates, credit card rates et cetera.' No one is going to wear what they have said, what they have done and what they are threatening to do without passing it on so it is going to be a cost to every single one of us. When I look at the budget and to some of the direct things that have been an absolute improvement to my community, I look at the Vietnam Veterans Commemorative Walk. What is really important to notice about this is there are two levels of government in Victoria that have funded this as well as the shire that gifted the land and did the work. The Victorian government funded it. The federal Labor government funded it. When I say the Victorian government, I mean both state governments, Labor and Liberal. The only people who have never ever committed one cent to supporting these veterans through this commemorative work is the federal Liberal Party. They have gone to two elections and have not committed a cent. In fact, one of the candidates actually said, 'Not a chance. We are not going to build something like that in Seymour,' which just goes to show how much contempt they show for regional areas. We are putting in a Huey helicopter and a Howitzer gun as well as lighting and pathways for the Vietnam Veterans Commemorative Walk. Out of the two parties, at state level both supported it but at the federal level only Labor supported it. I think it is a real blight on those opposite that they are not prepared to support our veterans. The commemorative walk is delivering many benefits. It not only recognises the people who worked on the volunteer committee but also what it is doing for local businesses and tourism, which is amazing. It is actually delivering people. Every single day or night when you get there people are going for this walk. They go back to look at their own names on the wall, their father's, their grandfather's, their mother's and their grandmother's. It is an exciting thing that is being done and an absolute credit to a bunch of blokes who sat round the table over a cup of coffee and said we should do this because it has never been done before. They should be absolutely congratulated for the work that they have done and for their dedication. The other thing I want to talk about is our NBN policy, which is being supported by my community. The opportunity to be part of the digital future is astronomical. You only have to look at things like business productivity, health and education. There are many things that can be done with NBN today and in the future that are actually going to save money for our health budgets, for education and it will also take cars off the congested roads that we have leading into the city. The things we talk about cannot be done with copper and that is why the opposition refused to say what their upload speed will be. They refuse because they know that what you have got today is what you will get for the future. You would have thought that those opposite would be supporting a national broadband network that actually meant that country areas can have the same access to medical treatment. Dr Stone interjectingsits there and laughs. Dr Stone interjectingNBN can be done straight away, and you think that is funny. Dr Stone interjectinglaughing. You even admitted you were laughing through interjection. I am glad you think that is funny, because it shows the calibre of person you are. The fact of the matter istitles.

It can only be hoped that it is the last act of chaotic, divided, dysfunctional government that has no plans for Australia's future. But we are not without hope. As my parliamentary colleague and leader of the coalition, Tony Abbott, said in his budget reply speech: While it is easy, and understandable, that you should be pessimistic about this government, everyone should be optimistic about our country. There is an end in sight to this very bad government. This is a government that gave us pink batts, overpriced school halls and cash for clunkers-all failed programs. As of tonight there are 109 days until a federal election, when the people of my electorate in Brisbane and the people of Australia have the opportunity of bringing this bad government to an end. There is no better way of highlighting the contrast between where we are now under Labor and where the coalition was when it delivered government and what we saw in the federal budget just a few weeks ago. What we saw was a clear contrast between Labor with its debt, deficit, broken promises, new taxes and no plan for Australia's future, and the coalition with its plan to build a strong, prosperous country, more jobs, higher wages and better services for all Australians. The budget papers reveal that Australia's gross debt will breach Labor's $300 billion debt ceiling within the forward estimates. In a space of less than two weeks, that $300 million ceiling is already forecast to beyond $400 billion. Since coming to office in 2007, the first five Labor budgets have resulted in $192 billion in deficits. There is one thing we can be certain of: Labor will never deliver a surplus. The Treasurer has now delivered Labor's 12th deficit from the last 12 budgets. Disturbingly, the last surplus delivered by a Labor government was in 1989-almost 2½ decades ago. Last year Treasurer Wayne Swan promised a surplus of $1.5 billion but instead he delivered a deficit more than 12 times as big at $19.4 billion. He did not just miss the target by a little tiny bit-this is really taking the adage 'If you miss by an inch you might as well miss by a mile' to a whole new depth. It must be remembered that this towering achievement of budgetary incompetence came after the government promised on more than 500 occasions that they were delivering a surplus for 2012-13, with the Prime Minister even boasting that the surplus had already been achieved. All of this from a bunch that have the audacity to call themselves fiscal conservatives. The delusion is truly spectacular. Fiscal conservative was one of the many meaningless Kevin Rudd slogans adopted by the Treasurer and then recycled by the Prime Minister. It must go down as one of the most cynical, political cons of all time-right up there with: 'There will not be a carbon tax under a government I lead.' Both unbelievable; both false. The electorate of Brisbane has to deal with significant cost-of-living pressures, and under Labor the price of essentials such as electricity, education, child care and health services",228,Bills
280,The Deputy Speaker,"Members, there is another place for this to be done. Please",229,Bills
281,Mr Mitchell,I withdraw.,229,Bills
282,The Deputy Speaker,"Your time has now expired.continues to go up and up. Labor's reckless policy making plays a significant part in these price rises. Labor cannot claim to care about the cost of living while imposing policies that add to those pressures. For example, increases in electricity prices are Labor's carbon tax at work and increases in medical and hospital services are in part because of Labor's chopping and changing of the private health insurance rebate. With child care, for example, on 1 July 2012 the government cut and capped the childcare rebate to a maximum of $7,500. If the childcare rebate was still being indexed parents in my electorate would be receiving $700 a year more in assistance. Since Julia Gillard became Prime Minister, childcare costs have increased by 26 per cent. In the 2013-14 budget, the government extended its freeze on the childcare rebate for another three years. The rebate was capped at $7,500 two years ago and will now remain capped until 30 June 2017. While the government has capped the rebate, it is also spending $8 million advertising what government assistance is available to families to help meet childcare costs, confirming that Labor is more about spin than they are about substance. With private health insurance the government imposed a means test on 1 July 2012. It placed a 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance. This will mean that some families in my electorate will be paying up to 43 per cent more for their insurance while everyone else will pay an additional 10 per cent on top of the existing cost of their policy. This measure will impact very hard on the electorate of Brisbane: 79 per cent of people in my electorate have private health insurance. In the 2012-13 MYEFO the government announced that from 1 July 2013 it would no longer provide a rebate for the lifetime health cover component of one's private health insurance premium. The lifetime health cover component is an additional two per cent charge on a person's premium for every year that they have not taken out private health insurance after turning 31 years of age. This represents a $386 million cut to private health insurance. In the 2012-13 MYEFO the government announced that from 1 April 2014 funding for private health insurance rebate would be linked to the CPI rather than keeping it linked to the average industry premium increase that is set each year at around four per cent. This represents a $700 million cut to the rebate over four years. In the 2013-14 budget the government has cut more $1.8 billion from Medicare rebates, the extended Medicare Safety Net and the Net Medical Expenses Tax Offset, while incredibly still managing to deliver more debt, more deficits and taxes. These cuts from the health budget, which follow years of waste and mismanagement across all areas of government, will hit the sickest and the most vulnerable the hardest. There will be no increase to the Medicare rebates between November 2012 and July 2014, despite continued growth in the cost of delivering health care. This means the costs are likely to be passed on to patients directly, particularly in general practice where there is a high volume of pensioners and concession cared holders. Deputy Speaker, as you can see, Labor cuts will force up out-of-pocket costs for families in my electorate as they are already struggling with the cost-of-living pressures and all of this on top of the increased costs that came in on 1 July 2012, when the dreaded carbon tax started. On the government's own figures, under a carbon tax there will be an immediate 10 per cent in electricity prices, a nine per cent increase in gas bills. The increase in electricity in the September quarter of 2012 was 15.3 per cent-the largest quarterly increase since ABS electronic records began. The rise since Labor came to power has been 94 per cent. In education, the Gonski numbers change from day-to-day. When the Prime Minister announced her school funding a few weeks ago she said it would result in an extra $14.5 billion over six years, with her government contributing $9.4 billion. This week the Prime Minister said it would be $16.2 billion and the Commonwealth would contribute $9.8 billion over six years, but the actual budget papers show that the Commonwealth has only put aside $2.8 billion over the next four years for school funding, leaving a shortfall of $7 billion to be delivered in just two years-that is, two elections from now. Labor is cutting more than $300 million out of school funding over the next four years. The forward estimates show that under this government funding for schools is going down, not up, and that is very bad news for schools, for parents and for students in my electorate. This government is not giving schools more money; it is giving schools less money and that is on top of cuts to university to pay for the so-called Gonski changes. Labor's funding continues with them ripping funds out of education and cutting the indexation at three per cent. Labor is fiddling the figures yet again. Thankfully, the coalition offers a clear choice which guarantees that no school will be worse off because we will keep the existing system at least until such time as we have a consensus on the need for change. One of the precious few pieces of good news in this budget relates to the announcement of a new headspace in Brisbane. As the federal member for Brisbane, for some time. I have been calling for a headspace facility to be based in central Brisbane. I am advised that one of the 15 centres being funded in 2013-14 will be based in Brisbane and headspace advise that the new facility will be up and running by January 2014. That is great news for Brisbane residents. My only reservation regarding this announcement relates to the need for the government to resist any temptation to hijack the original headspace charter set up under the Howard government, which ensured the locations of these facilities were determined on a needs basis and not as part of some desperate political pork barrelling campaign to try to save failed Labor MPs. I wish to turn to DisabilityCare and the funding in the budget for disability. In a parliament under this government which has been rife with incompetence, mismanagement, dysfunction and scandal, the NDIS maybe the best thing to come out of the 43rd parliament. As we know, both sides of politics support the NDIS. The Labor Party desperately wanted to use it as a political football. Labor's rhetoric was always designed to wedge the coalition on the NDIS. Then came the classic move, after sending the budget further into the red, with Labor's proposal to have an increase to the Medicare levy of 0.5 per cent to partially fund the NDIS. However the coalition will be supporting this increase, even though this government has completely and irresponsibly managed the budget. The increase in the Medicare levy should not have been necessary, had the budget been balanced. As elected representatives, we are always reluctant to increase taxes imposed on those we represent. However, as a LiberalI believe one of the core roles of government is to help those who cannot help themselves. There is no one in this House who would argue that those who suffer from a disability and their families have the same opportunity and freedom in life as those without a disability. We obviously still have a lot of detail to work through regarding DisabilityCare and how it will work but on behalf of those in my electorate with a disability, their friends and their families, I welcome the commitment by state and federal governments to a national disability insurance scheme. As federal members, on a daily basis we hear the heart breaking stories of those with disabilities. Hopefully, this will be one decision which we have made together as a parliament to provide them with some help and relief. When you look at the gross failures of this government to provide basic services, you have to ask yourself: Where has all the money gone? What did they spend it on? In consideration of these questions, a sobering and disturbing fact is that the cost to Australians of Labor's waste and budgetary mismanagement is a net interest bill of $7.8 billion a year. Add to that annual interest bill the cost of some items from the greatest hit list of Labor's waste such as the $10 billion blow-out in the immigration portfolio-thanks to Labor's failed border protection policies-and the $3.2 billion blow-out in the NBN rollout, and you get the picture. These policy failures alone add up to more than $13 billion and when you add that to the annual interest rate bill, you are looking at nearly $21 billion. This could have provided a lot of infrastructure. This is the cost of Labor's abysmal fiscal management-and an appalling waste on things that we did not need to have, like pink batts, and it has ensured that there is no money for things that we do need. We need 21st century infrastructure. Let us consider the amount of money that could have been spent on this wonderful infrastructure had this government not misspent. It could have been spent on projects that are sorely needed in the electorate of Brisbane and in the state of Queensland. It could have been spent on things like the Cross River Rail project and the upgrade of the Kingsford Smith Drive-all very worthwhile projects. been framed in an challenging economic environment. This budget seeks to chart the most appropriate course of action for the long-term prosperity of our nation. It is a budget aimed squarely at making Australia stronger, smarter and fairer through investment in infrastructure, schools and social reform. Having all but come through the biggest downturn our economy has confronted since the forties, this is the time for us to ease back on stimulus and to position the economy for the future. It is worth noting at the outset the impact that the current economic climate has had on revenue-$170 billion has been wiped off the revenue since the GFC. Global economic conditions now mean that companies cannot sustain their profits in the way that they once did, and this is having an impact on tax receipts. It is presenting a massive challenge for governments. It is why we had to find savings to the tune of $43 billion but to do so in a way that does not tear at the fabric of the community. As an MP heading into an election later this year, I know that all of us in this chamber would loved to be able to spruik for tax cuts or find other ways to inject government spending, but our balance sheet simply does not permit that and, frankly, it would represent the height of irresponsibility to do so. Instead, the government is showing fiscal restraint while keeping an eye on the things that will make Australia more productive and will grow our economy into the future. On both sides of this chamber, in a place where we focus on division, we should find areas that unite us. On both sides of the chamber, we can all be rightly proud that the budget has provided nearly $20 billion over the next seven years to fund DisabilityCare. In my electorate of Chifley, it could benefit as a many as 3,800 people. Delivering DisabilityCare is without",229,Bills
283,Mr Husic (Chifley) (19:01,"I rise to speak on the appropriation bills-bills that havedoubt the most fundamental social policy reform this government has seen since we introduced Medicare. For far too long, it has been reflected elsewhere that this sort of reform was considered too difficult, too hard. Now we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet the lifelong needs of people with a disability, their families and their carers. People with a disability have much to contribute to society, and with the choice and support that DisabilityCare will provide we can remove from many of them the barriers to their productive involvement and engagement in our society and in our workforce. I have had many opportunities to visit disability enterprises operating in the Chifley electorate and have seen for myself the effect that gainful employment has on the people who can work. There are great organisations like the Endeavour Foundation, Mount Druitt and most people will see that increasing the Medicare levy to help fund DisabilityCare is something that they believe is worthy of support. In fact, it was something that I spoke on in February this year. I outlined the challenges for both sides of politics in finding revenue in this climate to fund disability care, and I recognised that it simply was not there. Medicare has always provided a healthcare safety net for Australians. We are now stretching it a little bit further to provide support for the disabled, their families and their carers. It is a worthy way in which to fund DisabilityCare. Another initiative that I am very happy to see funded in this budget is our support of nearly $10 billion to fund schools over the next six years, to deliver our National Plan for School Improvement. It is an important delivery of the work by David Gonski. It is very much a plan to better resource every school on the base of need, improving teacher quality and supporting students to achieve their best. Our plan not only makes the distribution of funding fairer but also targets those schools facing the greatest disadvantage, some of which are located in the Chifley electorate. Schools in the Chifley electorate have all welcomed the commitment. I was delighted last week to join Cathy Anderson, the principal of Chifley College at Mount Druitt, and her staff in celebrating our deal with the New South Wales government, where both federal Labor and state Liberals joined as one to advance education in the state of New South Wales. This month's budget will also make a tangible difference to the lives of residents in Chifley and in the neighbouring seats of my colleagues the members for Greenway, Lindsay, McMahon and Parramatta, particularly through the funding of the WestConnex motorway. The Australian government has made an offer of $1.8 billion to the New South Wales government to extend the M4 motorway to the Sydney CBD and Port Botany. Improving traffic flow will mean shorter travel times to and from work, more time at home with family and reduced running costs for the daily commute. One of the biggest challenges facing Western Sydney for all levels of government is finding ways to free-up the movement of people in an area of the country where congestion is causing massive problems. Smart investment in infrastructure is important if we are to keep our economy amongst the strongest in the world and, importantly, our government has sought to put forward certain conditions on the funding. The first is that there are to be no new tolls on sections of the motorway already paid for. It makes no sense, if we have paid for the road, that we pay again through a new toll. The second condition is that the extension has to go all the way to the CBD and Port Botany so that motorists are able to travel to their desired destinations without unnecessarily clogging up roads around the motorway. This is something the New South Wales state government did not indicate previously, which is a shortcoming of its plan. We are seeking to fix it and work with them on it. Other measures in the budget to provide for the infrastructural needs of our community include nearly a quarter-of-a-million dollars to fix two identified traffic black spots in the electorate. This is to install, for instance, a partial median-enclosure at the intersection of the Great Western Highway and Mount Druitt Road and to install a single-lane roundabout at the intersection of Wolseley and Derby streets in Rooty Hill. On building and investment in the National Broadband Network in Western Sydney, the budget provided extra funding for each of the six Broadband for Seniors kiosks in Chifley, so they can purchase touch-screen monitors for teaching seniors about the next generation of computer interfaces. I was particularly delighted to see an additional $39.4 million provided on a separate initiative through the end of 2014 to extend the Active After-school Communities program. It currently has just over 1,200 children from Chifley participating in it. I got to see first-hand some of the activities of the AASC in our area, in conjunction with the Western Sydney Wanderers. With the delivery of any budget, it is important to contrast it with plans being offered by the other side. I note today the opposition's joint party room is committed to supporting and keeping all of Labor's promised budget savings. That is one of the best endorsements a budget can get. What else does the opposition intend to do that requires scrutiny? For instance, the Leader of the Opposition has recommitted to scrapping the price on carbon but intends to keep in place all of the household compensation associated with this pricing mechanism, without indicating how it will be funded. At the same time, he will commit to paying polluters to the tune of $5 billion under his so-called Direct Action Plan. This does not identify how that will be funded. The Leader of the Opposition is digging an even bigger budget blackhole for himself, and Australians should rightly know what cuts he will make to fill it. He has also recommitted to his overly generous paid parental leave scheme, which will hit the nation's top 3,000 companies with a tax in order to pay-as one pensioner in the Chifley electorate identified to me, three times the rate of that person's pension-up to $75,000 to the wealthiest of families. People in our area cannot understand how you would fund a scheme in that way. Inside his own party room, rightly so, there is a degree of disquiet about the affordability of such payments. I notice tonight there has been some reference to GST reform. It is interesting to see that the GST reform is being touted as responsible national economic reform, but when we attempt to do likewise that is the most heinous of all initiatives that could be taken. They characterise something, for instance, as a great big new tax, but when it comes to the GST then that is moderate economic reform. The way it is being characterised is interesting. The way the GST could be broadened to cover, for instance, food and other essentials will impact particularly on communities in my area. We are being softened up for a change-an increase in the GST-and ostensibly it is being driven by the states, but with the imprimatur of the federal level. Members would also have seen at another level the spat between the member for Sturt and the New South Wales education minister over our national school improvement plan. The member for Sturt has made it quite clear that this government's record investment in schools will be cut if they win the upcoming election. WhatI find interesting is the strident defence of state rights provided by the coalition when it comes, for instance, to the ownership of resources, but when it comes to deals done to provide greater support for the education of our next generation the coalition will tear up deals with the states and ram states' rights into a pulp for their own political imperative. WhatI find concerning about the caveat that the opposition leader has placed on future cuts to spending is that he needs to wait until the pre-election fiscal outlook before making any predictions about what will come down the track. Come 14 September Australians will have a choice between two discrete pathways to the future. They should have the opportunity to weigh up the merits of each pathway before casting a vote and should look in close detail at not only what the opposition says it will do but the track record of incoming Liberal governments in recent times. For instance, in Queensland the LNP government set about a slash and burn process with 14,000 public sector job cuts-not just high-level bureaucrats but front-line health workers, police and ambulance officers. They are investigating selling off community parks and sports grounds and working out which schools they can close-depriving communities of important local infrastructure. In my home state of New South Wales, the O'Farrell government implemented budget savings they conveniently overlooked reference to prior to the election. Did Mr O'Farrell, for example, tell voters that he intended to cut almost $2 billion from education? No. When he toured suburbs of Western Sydney and assured voters he would look after them, did he tell them he would cut funding to install lifts at Doonside, Rooty Hill or Toongabbie, as the member for Greenway has pointed out? No. He did say he would tackle the cost-of-living pressures on families, but he did not tell pensioners in public housing that he intended to take away their household compensation by jacking up housing commission rents. Did he tell us that he would close the cardiac unit at Mount Druitt hospital? No. He argued that he needed to rein in spending because of the state of the budget, but the Auditor-General in New South Wales found there was an extra $1 billion that the New South Wales Liberal treasurer had not accounted for and then refused to recommit it to support education. I would hope electors in Chifley and Greenway pay close attention to the record of the Liberal-independent council that came to office last year in Blacktown. Again, there was no warning whatsoever of the political agenda of the Liberal council-after an extraordinary record in which successive Labor-controlled councils were debt free and delivered some of the best community and recreational facilities in the state. The Liberals have begun undoing this legacy. They have indicated that they will close essential community services and facilities or at least privatise in some cases-for example, child care-to cut spending. The Liberals on council appear to have an ideology demanding that community facilities be profitable rather than be paid for at ratepayer expense. They have flagged the closing of childcare centres, reserves and they even announced the closure of the Mount Druitt swimming pool. The president of the Rooty Hill RSL youth swimming club believes they would be in dire straits when this pool closes and that schools would be left with few options for swimming carnivals. There is a great deal of anger amongst residents about the pool's closure. For many years it has provided the community with a venue for recreation, training and competition. Residents, particularly in the part of Blacktown I represent, rely enormously on the services and facilities council provides and if Blacktown Council were to continue with this agenda I can only see people being further disadvantaged and marginalised. Probably the biggest threat to local residents is the draft local environment plan, which will see council acquire homes to make way for recreational space. This has caused great concern in our area. None of these things were mentioned prior to the election. They tear at the fabric of our local community and undermine the investment in infrastructure. The federal government can point to investments of $140 million in 67 schools in Chifley. Trade training centres are opening. The NBN is being rolled out. Primary care infrastructure grants are changing the way that local GP clinics are operating. The opening of a clinician's school at Blacktown Hospital will ensure that we can train more GPs and that they will stay in Western Sydney. Contrast all this with the cuts to education by the state government-either to the cardiac ward at Mt Druitt Hospital and overtime in the Western Sydney health district-as well as the failure to provide for infrastructure at railway stations and council closures of community facilities such as swimming pools. All this has been done without providing support to our area. The contrast between the actions of the two governments should be concentrated upon in the lead up to 14 September. I thank the House. Dr STONE (Murray) (19:16): It is no wonder that the previous speaker representing the Labor government focused on state government issues, because it is just too painful to look at what the federal budget speech from the Treasurer, Mr Swan, delivered to us. We, of course, are aware of the parlous state of the economy in Australia. No-one who is living in this country thinks of the era that we are now in as anything but a budget emergency. Let us look at some of the incredible statistics. Total gross debt will breach the $300 billion debt ceiling within the forward estimates. We are now living with Labor's fifth record deficit in five years and at least two more deficits to come. We have record net debt of $192 billion, and there is no credible path back to surplusexcept, I suggest, having a change of government on 14 September. There have been so many broken promises, such as scrapped tax cuts and family payments. Most recently, we have been told that the baby bonus is gone. Very sadly, people who know how important it is to have private health insurance are finding it more and more unaffordable. There have been nonsense programs such as set-top boxes, pink batts, cash-for-clunkers and grocery watchthey go on and on. Some day someone is going to write a book about all of this and no one will believe it; they will think it is a comedy. But it is not a comedy. It is not funny when you look at what is happening on the ground and what is behind the statistics. I will give just one example of the impacts of the carbon tax, which this government imposed in a flight of fancy while imagining that somehow enough new tax can be put into the system to make the climate magically cease its evolution. For example, those doing the heavy lifting in the economy by employing people and trying to generate production for export and for the domestic market are faced with incredible increases in electricity and gas bills. I have in front of me a bill of 31 August 2012 for a two-month period from Mulcahy Pastoral, one of the biggest dairy producers in the northern Victorian region. This is just one of their electricity bills; they have a number of them depending on which part of their enterprise is being billed. Their electricity charge for two months was $7,069.97. On top of that came a carbon charge, which is itemised on their bill, of $1,142.48. So that is $7,000 plus another $1,000 for the carbon charge. Then, tragically, GST is levied on top of the combined charges. GST amounted to $821.24. Mulcahy Pastoral's bill therefore went from $7,000 to $9,000. There is no productivity advantage when the additional nearly $2,000, which went straight to the government as a carbon charge, is taken into account. Electricity bills such as this bring Mulcahy Pastoral ever closer to not being sustainable despite the incredible heavy lifting they do in employing scores of workers generating an excellent product benchmarked as world's best practice. Think if you were a contractor to SPC Ardmona and you had just been told that, due to the costs which are now imposed on food manufacture-in this case, preserved fruits and vegetables-the costs, combined with the high Australian dollar, renders them unable to compete with imported rubbish, often product which has not been properly scrutinised at the border because this government has slashed and burned quarantine checking. Biosecurity is now on its knees as an agency. We know that every day we are facing real threats with food safety, as Coles and Woolworths delightedly import some of the biggest volumes ever seen of imported preserved fruit and things like tomatoes. They fill their generic labels with these products. The labelling laws in Australia are such that the discerning shopper has great difficulty working out exactly the source of the product in cans or in plastic squeezy tubes, in glass jars or in plastic packs. Put all of that together and what did SPC Ardmona recently have to do? They had to tell the 114 orchardist suppliers that about half of them would have no contracts next year for supplying fruit and the other half would be able to supply only 50 per cent or less of the fruit they had previously been under contract to provide. This is stunning fruit-pears, apricots, peaches, all beautiful product. Some of the pear trees have been bearing for more than 70 years in the Goulburn Valley. In fact, the Goulburn Valley produces more than 85 per cent of Australia's pears. While SPC Ardmona in the Goulburn Valley said no to its fruit suppliers, there has also been a rebounding impact on the packers, pickers and pruners of that product, on the transport operators who once took all that product to market and on the workers in their factory. SPC Ardmona in the Goulburn Valley had 870 full-time equivalent staff. Their salaries and wages in one year alone were $63 million alone, which went into the local economy. They provided apprenticeships and training programs year after year, giving experience to young people, and they had graduate student programs. The multiplier effect is that more than 2,700 jobs in the Goulburn Valley region alone will be affected. More than 150,000 tonnes of fruit and vegetables worth more than $32 million each year was taken from local contracted growers. All of that now is history because this government has basically turned its back on the manufacturing sector in Australia and in particular on food manufacturing. Imagine what the SPC Ardmona and fruit-growing sector thought as they saw the federal government scrambling to put millions of dollars into the very tragic announcement that the Ford Motor Company would basically be shutting up shop in a couple of years time. We have not yet heard a squeak of support for the Goulburn Valley or the Murray Valley for this magnificent food industry, which is now on its knees. On 30 April, an application was made to this federal government for emergency safeguard action, which is completely lawful under the World Trade Organisation rules. This measure would have put a temporary, 200-day set of duties on the imported product-on tomatoes from Italy, on peaches from China and South Africa-and would have given this company and its growers and the growers' workers a 200-day, emergency breathing space, so that Coles and Woolworths were made to wake up, to look again at the prospects of having to buy local produce instead of cheap, junk imports. We suspect many of those imports are dumped. What has happened to that application for emergency WTO safeguard action in the 28 days since it was launched with this federal government? You tell me. We do not know what has happened to that action. It was moved on fairly promptly from Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. We understand he gave it his support, his prima facie approval, saying that it looks like a reasonable application. It is now sitting with the Minister for Trade. It has been sitting for 28 days going on 29 days tomorrow. I have to ask: is it because they are not an automotive industry based in Geelong and Broadmeadows? Is that the problem? Is it because this government just does not understand agriculture and food processing in particular and the enormous multiplier impact that food processing has on other jobs generated and on other value generated in both the domestic and export market? SPC Ardmona used to export 30 per cent of its product. Unfortunately, that is down to zero next year. Those export dollars used to circulate around the Australian economy and leaven so many other associated industries like packaging, marketing and promotional industries. Now they are simply staring down the barrel of being wiped out by cheap imports, and this government is sitting on its hands. There is also a biosecurity problem looming with the lack of action from the federal government, and, I have to say, also from the state government of Victoria at this time. There are 700 hectares of beautiful orchards that have to either be pushed over in the next few months or they need to be actively sprayed to make sure that they do not develop fruit fly, codling moth, a whole range of pest species and diseases, which the vigilance of local orchardists keep at bay. But if these trees no longer have any commercial fruit and the fruit they produce will be left on the ground then these orchardists do not have the resources to keep the trees sprayed. The cost of pushing those trees over is not insignificant-some $3,000 to $5,000 per hectare depending on the age and size of the trees. So we are begging the state and federal governments to support these orchardists in keeping the disease-free state of these orchards intact so that pest species do not spread to the fresh fruit market orchards, which of course are in the same region. It seems a very reasonable and sensible thing to do but, again, we are waiting for some response. There is just deafening silence on this critical matter. As we speak, SPC Ardmona is in the process of preparing an anti-dumping action in the first instance against the Italian tomato imports and then against South African peaches and preserved fruit and then against the Chinese preserved fruit. New Zealand has recently very successfully yet again rolled over its anti-dumping action against Chinese preserved peaches. It is the same product that is destroying the Australian market. So we should expect, if given a fair hearing, that those anti-dumping actions would be successful. The trouble is they need to happen quickly. They need to be brought into place before too many of these orchards are already bulldozed. I was so saddened as I drove around the Murray Valley a weekend ago and saw the huge mounds of pushed over what were magnificent fruit trees mounded up ready for burning. Those trees could have fed the world. They could have been used for some of our food aid. Our Australian food aid now is purchased from the cheapest supplier anyone can find anywhere. Speaking to representatives of some of the ethnic groups from the Myanmar or Burma just last night, I was deeply concerned to hear that they continue to be malnourished and in great need of food aid themselves. Yet Australia very proudly bought broken rice from Myanmar for its food aid to be sent somewhere else in the very recent past. I have been given the rice sacks with the big Australian kangaroo and with 'Gift from Australian AusAID' printed on them and then in slightly smaller print, not much smaller, 'This is broken rice from Myanmar.' How disgraceful, how shocking. Meanwhile there were hundreds in fact thousands of tonnes of fruit lying in the on the ground in the Goulburn Valley going to waste. I beg this government to look harder at how it supports the manufacturing industries that have been destroyed by its policies. Let me talk about the Labor failures in relation to agriculture. There has been $32.8 million taken from agriculture in recent times. They are under extremely strained resource deficits. Labor have reduced the funding for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, from $3.8 billion to $1.7 billion, driven, of course, by the Greens, who do not see any value in Australian agriculture. They see farmers as the enemy of the people, it would seem. Then we have $33.4 million taken and cut from the cooperative research centres, which means fewer CRCs are funded each year. As most of them are agriculturally based, there is less funding for agricultural research just at the time we have to look at alternative crops and we have to look at how to grow agricultural crops in places where climates are changing. We have cuts in cargo-screening resources at ports and airports by $58.1 million, resulting in 4.7 million fewer air cargo consignments being inspected each year and 2,150 fewer vessels being boarded on arrival. That is the food security and food safety concerns that I was expressing before. We have cuts of $63 million from agriculture research within the CSIRO. They have closed CSIRO agricultural research sites in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. Some of those sites had been in action for more than three or four decades. All that research is now lost. No other country in the world that pretends to be a food-producing nation would do this sort of thing. We just cannot wait until 14 September but let us hope that is not too late for some of our great agricultural industries. (Time expired) Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (19:31): I would like to begin tonight by congratulating the Treasurer on this, his sixth budget, because in this budget the Treasurer has successfully balanced the often competing priorities of fiscal responsibility at the same time as nationbuilding reform. We have put the focus on jobs, we have put the focus on growth and we have put the focus on fiscal responsibility at the same time as on education, disability reform and also major infrastructure reform to improve productivity. There are many aspects of the 2013 federal budget that are close to my heart and I am particularly proud of. TonightI am pleased to be able to talk about some of these as well as some particular aspects of this budget that will benefit by electorate of Canberra. Members would be aware of my great passion for education. In my maiden speech I said that my life had been transformed by education, that education was the great transformer and that I was living proof of that because through education I escaped the cycle of disadvantage and there are millions more like me. SoI am really proud of our Labor government's education reforms and the $9.8 billion commitment to increase school funding over six years under the National Plan for School Improvement. I do believe that these reforms will give more Australians, more Canberrans, the chance to have their lives transformed by education, like I had. At the same time. I also want to dwell a bit on the investment that we as a government have made in education, because we are the government committed to education. I would say the majority of us in caucus are living proof of the transformative qualities of education and have greatly benefited from it. So, as a result of that, it is a driving issue for us. It is very front and centre for us. In my electorate alone we have invested in the past $54 million to deliver more maths and science teachers. We have also delivered $131 million for 136 BER projects in Canberra benefiting 67 schools. That resulted in 17 new libraries, 23 multipurpose halls and 29 covered outdoor learning areas. We have also invested in 8½ thousand computers in 23 schools, which means that our children are now linked into modern technology and they can learn through education. I see schools like Narrabundah College, where they are doing a lot of remote learning as a result of having these fantastic computer labs. I was at St Bede's Primary School on Friday. They were celebrating their 50th anniversary. I was reminded again by the chair of the P&C-who made a really powerful speech when I actually opened their BER building, this beautiful multipurpose hall-of the fact that this would not have been possible if it had been left to the P&C to do their sausage sizzles, to do their lamington drives, to do their chocolate runs and to do their working bees to raise money. It would have never been possible to be able to come up with that significant sum of money to build the multipurpose hall. It was the stuff of dreams. AndI get this from other P&Cs and other parents and teachers I meet throughout the schools. I spend a lot of time in schools because I love schools. I love seeing what is going on in the Canberra education system, speaking to the children and how they are benefiting from the significant investment we have made in Canberra, as well as speaking to the teachers about the benefits of the significant investments we have made in their professionalisation, autonomy and empowerment. There is no doubt that one of the other cornerstones of this budget is our long-term commitment to DisabilityCare Australia, or the National Disability Insurance Scheme. For too long successive governments have shunned the opportunity to reform services for the profoundly disabled, neglecting the needs of people with significant and permanent disability, their carers and families. We have invested $14.3 billion over seven years to give people with disability, their families and carers the care and support they need over their lifetimes, and choice and control over the services they need. Most importantly, it focuses on the individual and defines the support that is needed for an individual over the course of their lifetime. Their needs can vary: during primary school they have specific needs, when they are teenagers they have different needs, when they are entering the workforce they have different needs and then as they age they have different needs. Mr Deputy Speaker you, like me and everyone in this House, have spoken to carers. I have this enduring image of being at Koomarri-I see this family every time. I go out to Koomarri to do a different event. The parents are a hard-working migrants and they have one daughter who is quite profoundly intellectually disabled. The parents are quite a bit older and every time. I saw them prior to this DisabilityCare being introduced they were in tears-both of them, mother and father-absolutely scared witless about what was going to happen to their daughter when they passed on. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, like so many in this chamber would have had similar experiences: petrified parents, living with fear night and day as a result of them having an intellectually or physically disabled child that they are absolutely worried about should they pass on. Tragically, I saw this family just recently at another event at Koomarri and they told me that the father has just been diagnosed with a brain tumour. So not only are they battling this issue of dealing with this profoundly intellectually disabled daughter but he also has his own health challenges. That is why DisabilityCare could not have come at a better time. It sends a very strong message to this family that their daughter will be looked after over the course of her lifetime. It will end the cruel lottery that currently exists where the care and support a person receives depends on where they live and how they acquired their disability. In the ACT around $175 million in funding will be provided for the full rollout of our DisabilityCare by 2019-20. This will provide life-changing support to more than 5,000 Canberrans, one of them being that family I have just mentioned. In the lead-up to this budget I spent a lot of time also talking to my constituents in Canberra and listening to their concerns-I am always talking to them and listening to their concerns. One area that was of particular concern was the issue of single parents. I am a child of a single mother: my father walked out on us when I was 11, and he walked out on us with $30 in the bank, so my early teen years were particularly hard. We were dining out every second night at family and friends because, basically, mum did not have any money. SoI am acutely aware of the challenges that single mothers face. I grew up with one who did not have much money. We did not go on school camps, because mum did not have any money, so I am acutely aware of the disappointment that some single parents have in the fact that they cannot actually give their children what their peers are getting. And so I am acutely aware of the potential impact of some of the policies that we were looking at in terms of single parents was having on the single mothers in my electorate. I spent a lot of time talking to them, and I spent a lot of time actually sitting down with them and going through their budgets. These women are extraordinary budgeters. Everything is budgeted to within an inch of its life. They have Excel spreadsheets. You name it. They really do have tight budgets, so they really need to keep an eye on their finances. At the same time, these women were also working part time, training part time and trying to look after their child on their own as well. Some of those conversations brought back a lot of really sad memories of what I went through as an early teen, which is why I had a lot of discussions with some of my colleagues and a number of ministers on what we could do on the single parents front. That is why I was particularly pleased with the income support that we outlined in the budget, where we are increasing the amount of income that Australians receiving income support can earn before their payments are affected. This will affect Australians and Canberrans receiving the parenting payment, Newstart allowance and widow, sickness or partner allowance. The income-free area will increase from $62 to $100 per fortnight. In practical terms, this means that people can take home $494 extra per year. In addition to this, the budget also outlines that from 1 July 2015, for the first time in Australia's history, the income-free area for Australians on income support will be indexed by the CPI. These reforms demonstrate that this Labor government is committed to supporting single parents and committed to upholding the principles of income support. We also introduced a scheme where people who are on a pension supplement get the pensioner education supplement, which I think is a significant reform-$32 a fortnight, from memory. It allows those women who are in my electorate to get some assistance with the training they are undertaking. These reforms will immediately benefit 458 people on income support currently earning over $62 a fortnight in my electorate, and they have the potential to benefit more than 2,000 more people should they move into work. The initiative in this budget that I was least heartened by was the introduction of paid parking in the Parliamentary Triangle next year. Members will have noticed that this issue dominated much of the local media in the days after the announcement. I am very proud of the Parliamentary Triangle. I know that there are a number of issues that confront the Parliamentary Triangle, particularly the fact that there are workers. It is a business district. It is a commercial district. We now have private enterprise there. We have public sector agencies there. We also have national institutions. So we are balancing a number of things. The Parliamentary Triangle is balancing a number of objectives and a number of missions. The challenge that we are currently faced with is the fact that workers are parking there-it is all free-and, as a result of that, a number of tourists particularly are not able to get to the national institutions. They are having to drive around and around and around because there is no car-parking space, which is not thrilling our fabulous national institutions-namely, the Library, Questacon, the Portrait Gallery, the National Gallery and the gorgeous old wedding cake of Old Parliament House-much. So it was decided to introduce paid parking to manage the parking in the Parliamentary Triangle. The thing is-and I have been clear on this since my preselection-that I only support paid parking if there is an amenity. That is something I have been very clear on for many, many years, because I have worked in the Parliamentary Triangle and I know the challenges that people face. There is nothing there apart from those fantastic national institutions and a few wonderful cafes. There is no post office there. There used to be a post office; it has gone. There are a few banks there but not many. There are no shops. There is no mini-mart. There are no convenience stores. There is no amenity for people working there like there is in any business district throughout the rest of Canberra and any business district throughout the rest of Australia. If people are to pay for parking, I believe that they should be provided with the facility, the amenity-shops, convenience stores and mini-marts-similar to what has happened over at Brindabella Business Park, where there are a range of services. That is an industrial park, a business district, a commercial precinct. I have initiated an inquiry into the level of amenity that is available in the Parliamentary Triangle. That inquiry will be conducted over the coming months through the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. I am particularly looking forward to getting in and seeing what amenity is required in that area, what amenity can be provided in that area and what we can do about improving the services to the people in the Parliamentary Triangle. Finally, my electorate also benefited from the budget's health and infrastructure investments, with $300,000 for the Cotter Road and Tuggeranong Parkway intersection and $5 million in funding for a dedicated emergency paediatric department at the Canberra Hospital. This is a fiscally responsible budget but it is also a budget that contains nation-building reforms and it is a budget that the people of Canberra can be assured will benefit them into the future. It is a budget that puts jobs first, growth first, education first, fairness first and productivity first. The budget provides a very clear choice for Canberrans. I commend the bills to the House. 2014 and the other appropriation bills. I want to confirm that this budget-another budget in deficit and in crisis-is really another Labor budget of more debt, more chaos and more spin. Nothing has been more pertinent in that regard than witnessing the Labor Party's backbench on the delivery of the budget. I have seen budgets over the five years since I was first elected to this parliament, and I have watched budgets over many more years. The complete and utter lack of enthusiasm for the budget from the individual Labor members is quite telling about what you find with this budget, and that is: it does not have a sense of life. When the former Treasurer Peter Costello delivered a budget, you got a sense of what he was on about. You got a strong message. You got a set of policies. You got a coherent narrative. And you got enthusiasm that flowed from the delivery of that budget. Since Treasurer Swan has been in place, we really have no coherent narrative. We do not have a set of policies that people can believe in and we have a very confused mix of settings. That confusion and chaos are adding to uncertainty in the economy. I want to speak about some of the sectors that are experiencing that confusion and chaos and the consequences that it is having. It is evident that the Labor Party had to dragoon a whole series of backbenchers into speaking on the budget. That is quite telling about how the lack of belief in what the Treasurer is doing has really come to a head. Perhaps the best feature of this budget that I have found is the fact that the government is saving $4.5 million by not proceeding with plans to filter the internet of objectionable material. As a long-term opponent of the government's mandatory internet-filtering proposal, I was very happy to see that the government was forced into a humiliating backdown on this proposal. That saving is entirely appropriate, considering that that overblown government policy would not have delivered any benefit to the Australian society and would have burdened us with overregulation in the internet space, one of the least regulated spaces that we have left. That is probably the best thing that I will mention about this budget. It does not really get much better from there. The Leader of the Opposition, in his budget in-reply speech, stated very clearly that, if the coalition is fortunate enough to be elected in September, he will ensure that there are days of deregulation in our parliament and days where legislation will simply be repealed, consolidated or redressed. The reaction of the Labor Party and the Labor Party's backbench was again very telling. They looked at each other in stunned awe, saying, 'Is such a thing possible?' or 'That's outrageous!' 'What a fool!' 'What an idiot!' 'How could you do that?' But, when I speak to the business sector-the small business sector in particular but also medium and large enterprises-in my electorate and all around Australia, business and industry are crying out for less regulation, for less interference from government, for a removal of the tens of thousands of regulations that are burdening them and stopping them from making investment decisions, from adding additional employees and from doing their job on a day-today basis. For the Labor Party to react in such an incredulous way to such a simple proposal",232,Bills
284,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (19:45,"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013highlights everything that is wrong with government today. What we did not see from the government was a program of delegislation or deregulation, of consolidating bad laws, of fixing things, of removing unnecessary law-a deregulation program that could kick-start our economy. Nowhere is this felt more than in the small business sector. It is telling to note that, according to questions on notice returned recently, the number of small enterprises structured as companies has dropped by 23,100 since 2006-07, the number of small enterprises that paid company tax has dropped by 19,400 since 2006-07 and the number of small enterprises with a turnover of under $2 million has dropped by 2,400 since 2006-07. Those statistics are important because they represent a diminishment of the small and medium enterprise sector because of the increase in red tape we have seen under the Labor Party, the increase in regulation and the increase in taxes and charges. Indeed, over the last four years we have seen 29 new and increased taxes, 21,000 new regulations and record government borrowing and deficits, which I will turn to in a moment. These new regulations and taxes hit hardest on the small business sector, on those businesses which have to generate the wealth and work so hard to risk their own capital and enterprise, to employ a few people and to add capacity to their business. This is where regulation and government intervention hurt the most. The big corporations have armies of lawyers and accountants and the ability to deal with change from government. Uncertainty and constant regulation by government hit the small and medium business sector hardest. Those statistics I have just read out for the benefit of the House are indeed very telling and troubling, given that we have around two million small businesses and that there has been such a reduction, and that they do most of the employing in Australia today. A government that ignores the small business sector, that does not have a program to provide relief and lift the burden on hard working family businesses and small and medium businesses in our nation, does not have a plan for the revival of our economy. So when we see a budget delivered that simply takes us further into debt and deficit and that does attempt to correct some of the errors of the past by cutting some expenditure but fails to do so adequately, that does not assist the small and medium business sector by deregulating or doing anything to relieve the burden they are facing-and that burden has become intolerable. In particular, I think all Australians will be most concerned about the issue of gross debt breaching the $300 billion ceiling for the first time. We have seen this Labor government increase the debt ceiling on two occasions now. When asked about this issue the Treasurer, instead of providing honesty and transparency for Australians in the House at question time, has failed to answer whether he will lift the debt cap above $300 billion, given that in all of the projections it is extremely likely that in the next few years that Australia will need to borrow more than $300 billion of gross debt. The dishonesty is amazing when you consider that it is there for everybody to see. We have also seen that the fifth record deficit in five years and two more deficits issued in this budget have led to a record net debt of about $192 billion. There is no credible path back to surplus in this budget. Indeed, we have seen the emergence of structural deficit, and structural deficits require structural solutions. Yet no structural solution has been found to the structural deficit crisis in the budget. If you do not address the structural deficit problem then you cannot hope to return to surplus. The claims that the government will bring the budget back to surplus in a reasonable time frame are completely unrealistic without the structural issues being addressed. It is simply not enough to cut some expenditure and say, 'Look, we're cutting expenditure.' You must address the structural settings when you have a structural deficit. The government has failed in that regard. At the same time they are raising more than $25 billion in higher taxes over the next five years and they are breaking their election commitments-although that is a regular, commonplace feature of this Labor government; it is hardly remarkable anymore when they break a promise-such as the scrapped family tax cuts and family payments and the other measures in the private health area. I think when you put all that into the blender you find a country that cannot get a sense of where this government is going. There is no doubt that economic confidence is the other missing feature in our economy at the moment. Not only are business conditions difficult; not only is the global financial crisis continuing to impact upon the operation of our economy and the confidence of businesses to invest; but the ongoing chaos and confusion from the federal government level is producing sovereign risk in relation to doing business in Australia and causing a crisis of confidence. There is no doubt that Australians are waiting for 14 September with bated breath so we can have a renewal of confidence in government in Australia, refresh the settings of confidence in our economy and renew people's willingness to spend, people's willingness to invest and people's willingness to employ. I do not think that should be underestimated when you consider the record of the government-and it does not matter what sector you go to. I cannot let an appropriation bill speech go by without mentioning that defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP is now at levels not seen since 1938. Not since 1938 have we seen defence expenditure so low. On the Labor Party's own website, it says that the first priority of government must be defence, protecting Australia. If that is the first priority of national government, and it is, why has $25 million been cut from the defence budget? The coalition believes that the purpose of a national government, the first priority of a national government, is defence of the nation. Under the Howard government, defence expenditure was cauterised from cuts. It was protected from savage cuts. Yet this government has sent our nation, with our proud Australian military tradition, to defence expenditure levels not seen since 1938. It raises serious sustainability questions for the operation of the Australian Defence Force, its ability to engage in overseas operations in the region and its ability to deploy when necessary to protect Australia's regional and national interests. Again, it does not matter what sector you go to; the low revenue and the problems that we have seen from the budgetary mismanagement over the last five years are having an impact on confidence. Certainly, it is the case that Labor has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. We have seen a lot made of the fact that revenues have fallen. From the overblown projections that we have seen, revenue has fallen. But revenue in 2013-14 from this budget is projected to be $80 billion higher than at the end of the Howard government. That sounds like a lot of money, but it is not as much money as the $120 billion more in expenditure than at the end of the Howard government, which highlights why we are in such deficit. It is not that we do not have more money than we did in 2007-we do have more revenue and more incomebut that we have expenditure on a scale that has seen six budget deficits and debt continuing to balloon out. Budgetary mismanagement has consequences for all Australians. It has consequences not just for small businesses and medium-sized enterprises but also for individual families. For households, 29 increased or new taxes and charges mean increased cost-of-living pressures. There is no greater issue in any metropolitan city-I come from an outer-metropolitan electorate myself-than cost-of-living pressures. We have heard today that evidence has been produced that electricity prices will soon be double what they were when this federal Labor government was elected. They will have doubled for households and doubled for businesses. Ms Rishworth interjectingan impact on households; they have an impact on businesses and on the cost of doing business in Australia. Access to cheap electricity is of course providing a resurgence in the American economy: cheap energy. Cheap energy is critical, which is why you would not introduce the world's biggest carbon tax at a time when electricity prices are already rising. Apart from the revenue implications, the other issue is that these are 'Treasury's figures'. The government have no responsibility for their own budget, according to the Treasurer-and according to the members opposite, including the member for Kingston. They have no responsibility for their own budget. But somebody is getting these figures wrong. And somebody is getting these figures wrong in terms of the carbon price, because I can tell the member for Kingston and other members present that the carbon price will not sit at $12 per tonne when the European carbon price is now collapsingMs Rishworth interjectingprice would not be set by Treasury and it would not be set by the government. The market must flow, and the market in Europe says that the price per tonne is very low. The market price is at rock bottom. So having an Australian carbon price of $12, or having an Australian carbon price which could reach up to $30, is not a market mechanism; it is an arbitrary mechanism. It is a failure of government to be imposing the price well above what you can get in all the other markets in the world today. It will not be good for Australia because you can buy emissions at $4 or $5 a tonne in Europe, whereas here we are mandating $12 in the budget. Of course, that is not the government's figure-the member for Kingston did not come up with that-that is some Treasury bureaucrat! Surely, it is the role of government to question the bureaucracy and ask, 'Where did that figure come from and why is it not in line with world expectations on carbon pricing?' It is yet another example of the dishonesty and deceit that is in this budget. If the government bases its budget on projections that are wrong, on forecasts which are unreasonable and on figures which will never come to fruition it is setting our nation up for failure. Australians, and all members of this House, are looking for a new start in a new parliament with a government that has a consistent and firm approach to budgetary matters. The coalition has a real solutions plan to restore hope, reward and opportunity for Australians. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston-Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (20:01): It was great to hear the member for Mitchell leave with the key lines that I am sure he gets sent home with every night to rehearse and practice.

286,Mr Hawke,"The member for Kingston does not understand the market, because theI am pleased to speak on the Appropriations Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 and cognate bills, and in particular the budget that was delivered by the Treasurer a couple of weeks ago. This is an important budget. It is a budget that sets this nation up for the future. What you see in this budget is an important focus on jobs and on making sure that we have an investment in the long term that will promote jobs. Our investment in infrastructureA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 20:02 to 20:16 Ms RISHWORTH: As I was saying before the division, this is an incredibly important budget because it sets Australia up for the future. It makes the strong investment in infrastructure that we need and also puts jobs at the heart of the economy. I am very proud to be part of a government which, over nearly six years, has created in excess of 900,000 jobsa significant and important thing for the economy. In addition, this is making the smart investments. I will talk about how many schools are going to benefit in the investment we are making in education and on a whole range of investments which will ensure we take up the opportunities of the 21st century and of the Asian century. Also, this is about a fairer Australia, in particular with DisabilityCare. As Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, I know there are many people with disabilities and their families and carers who are now celebrating the 2013-14 budget. Despite some mislaid comments in the media, this budget is about hope, especially the part that deals with DisabilityCare Australia. The budget has made the responsible decision to fully fund DisabilityCare Australia, the national disability insurance scheme, into the long term. This funding security will provide people with a significant and permanent disability, their families and carers, the certainty they deserve. As I have gone around previously in my electorate of Kingston but also in my role as parliamentary secretary, the one thing so many people are calling out for is certainty and long-term security. Indeed, in the Page electorate when I was talking with carers and their families, one of the questions which came up-and it has come up around the country-was: how are we to know that this funding is going to continue? Where is the security? This budget provides the long-term security which people have been waiting for. No longer will the carpet be pulled out from under people's feet when funding is cut or service organisations run out of places and can no longer accept people. This funding is a certainty. I am pleased that we are investing $14.3 billion over seven years to roll out DisabilityCare Australia across the country. It will give families, carers and people with a disability the support they need over a lifetime but also, importantly, the choice and control over the services they receive. We cannot underestimate the impact that this choice and control means to people. Importantly, it will also ensure that in the long term people's goals and aspirations are recognised and the care and support they need to achieve those goals will be met. This is critical. As I travel around, there is a lot of excitement about DisabilityCare Australia now that we have a secured agreement for the full rollout of the scheme with New South Wales, South Australia and the ACT-with agreements also being reached with Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory-with the full scheme in all these states and territories to be rolled out between July 2018 and July 2019. These agreements mean that 90 per cent of Australians will be covered by DisablityCare Australia, in the event that they are born with or acquire a disability. The government will continue to seek agreement with Western Australia for the full national rollout of DisabilityCare Australia. But it is important to recognise that through the modest increase in the Medicare levy-and through our savings measures-we provide that certainty in the long term, in the budget, for DisabilityCare Australia. It is the responsible thing to do. It is the fair thing to do. This does deliver and build on the government's $1 billion investment in the 2012-13 budget for the launch of DisabilityCare Australia, now in six locations across the country and in four of those locations launching from 1 July this year. This will see real action on the ground, with the beginning of the rollout. The 2013-14 federal budget also demonstrates the long standing and ongoing commitment by the Gillard government to improve the capacity of people with a disability to participate fully in the economic and social life of our nation. It continues a number of critically important payments, concessions, and support and care services. I will touch on a few of these payments and services that will continue to be provided by the federal Labor government because we truly understand how critical it is that people with a disability-as well as their families and carers-are well supported. We will continue to provide income support for those with a disability who are unable to support themselves financially through employment. We will continue to make regular payments and allowances to financially assist eligible carers and people with a disability. We will continue to provide supported employment and improve access to information and advocacy services, so Australians with a disability are able to reach their potential. We will continue to provide critical peer support, respite and information services for carers to help them effectively manage their carer responsibilities. And we will continue to provide access to early-intervention services through the popular Helping Children with Autism and the Better Start for Children with Disability initiatives. I said earlier and I will say again, I am truly proud to be part of a government that recognises the importance of supporting Australians with a disability, their families and carers. The 2013-14 federal budget reflects the Labor government's strong belief that a historic reform like DisabilityCare Australia needs a solid funding base well into the future, and the security and certainty that this provides. I believe this is fundamentally important. Not only is this an important thing for the nation but also it is a very important thing for my local electorate of Kingston. It is estimated that in my electorate 2,978 local people could be eligible for support under disability care. I know, from talking with many of these people in my local electorate and around the country, that this is something that would be very welcome. I am also proud to be part of a government that is working to improve the quality of environment and reduce pollution. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, I am pleased to say that in this budget we have seen the introduction of significant new incentives for the destruction of synthetic greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances. In the 2013-14 budget, the government has allocated $12 million over the forward estimates to directly encourage greater destruction of waste SGGs. The government has also provided $42 million over the forward estimates for a number of other measures to increase emission abatements for SGGs. These incentives deliver on the Gillard government's commitment to introduce a destruction program for waste synthetic greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances as part of the clean energy future plan. It is important that when synthetic greenhouse gases reach the end of their life they are destroyed rather than emitted into the atmosphere, where they can cause harm to our environment. Any reduction of emissions achieved through the destruction incentives will contribute to Australia's emissions abatement commitment under the Kyoto protocol. To achieve this, the government will increase the amount paid to refrigeration contractors by 50 per cent for waste gas reclaimed and provided to Refrigerant Reclaim Australia for destruction. We will also be introducing a further destruction incentive which will increase the amount paid for the destruction of synthetic greenhouse gases to 70 per cent of the equivalent carbon price where the gas species and quantity can be independently verified. By increasing incentives for the industry, we will encourage additional recovery of synthetic greenhouse gases where the gas is subject to the equivalent carbon price but not suitable for recycling or reuse. In a further step in reducing emissions from synthetic greenhouse gases, the government will examine the potential for the introduction of a complementary product stewardship scheme for domestic refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment with small gas charges, usually less than two kilograms, to reclaim waste gas, metals, plastic and hazardous materials for reuse or appropriate disposal. As part of this program, additional funding has also been provided through the budget to the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to increase compliance with and enforcement of domestic licensing requirements to prevent illegal emissions of gas. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 20:27 to 20:36 Ms RISHWORTH: As I was saying, as Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water and as a South Australian, I am proud that the Gillard government has locked in its commitment to the historic Murray-Darling Basin reform through this budget. I have spoken many times in this place on the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin reform process and the critical role that the basin plays in the lives of many Australians. Late last year, this Labor government ended a century-long argument about how best to manage our rivers and deliver a Murray-Darling Basin Plan that restores our rivers to health, supports strong regional communities and ensures sustainable food production. But we are determined to achieve greater environmental outcomes than could be achieved just through this plan. That is why we are providing $1.8 billion over 10 years from 2014-15 to relax key flow constraints and recover an additional 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. This budget maximises the environmental outcomes under the Basin Plan, and the plan will be achieved while avoiding adverse social and economic impacts on basin communities. As a South Australian, I am proud to support our government providing an enhanced Basin Plan with better environmental and social outcomes. This year, the Gillard government has made smart investments for Australia's future like improving the Murray-Darling. In the few minutes I have left, I would like to touch on my electorate of Kingston. For Kingston, this is a very important budget, especially in the area of education. In this budget, we have ensured that there is better resourcing for our schools, our classrooms and our teachers. The National Plan for School Improvement is critical to ensuring that every student-and the Prime Minister has said this many times before-gets a great education. On average, the plan will deliver an extra $14.5 billion for Australian schools over the next six years, which is an average of an additional $4,000 for every student and $1.5 million for every school. It is incredibly important for my electorate of Kingston, where schools have often told me they need better resources to use for specialist teachers, more SSOs, more support in the classroom and more professional development. So it is very important that this money is part of the budget. As I said at the beginning, infrastructure is very important in this budget and I am very pleased that there have been a number of infrastructure investments. I would like to highlight the black spot funding. The black spot funding will include improvements to the intersections of Dyson Road and O'Sullivan Beach Road; Dyson Road and Sherriffs Road; Bains Road and Piggott Range Road; South Road and Flaxmill Road; Old South Road and Reynell Road; and Grant Road at Old Reynella. Fixing these black spots it is really important. It is important infrastructure investment so that we can ensure safety on the roads in my electorate of Kingston. There have been other investments, but I will not be able to talk about all of them. I commend the appropriations and the budget to the House. (Time expired) describe the Gillard Labor government's budget, a budget that delivers more debt, more deficits, more taxes, more broken promises and more uncertainty from an incompetent government that just cannot be trusted. After six years of chaos, debt and spin, Australians are desperately seeking stable and competent economic management, but the Labor budget has once again failed to deliver. I would like to use the appropriations bill to talk a little bit about some budget items but will start with the Palmerston hospital. As I said in this place many times, I have always been committed to the Palmerston hospital. Palmerston is where I live. It was the previous Northern Territory Labor government that failed Territorians. They were the ones that put a fence around a block of land with no building and called it a hospital. There are no plans to relocate or downgrade services being offered at RDH at this time. I would like to share a transcript from the Northern Territory Minister for Health, Robyn Lambley, who said on Territory Talk: We've always been committed to a Palmerston hospital. We've never suggested in any way shape or form that there wouldn't be a Palmerston hospital but I guess coming into government we've realised that what Labor was putting forward was would be inadequate over the coming decades. That was fairly short sighted so we've committed to spending $5 million or less hopefully on the scoping study just to make sure we get it right. We think that it's absolutely essential that we do get it right not just that the people of Palmerston and the rural area but the whole of the greater Darwin area. She also said: We've committed to a two-hospital system in the greater Darwin area. There will always be a Royal Darwin Hospital and there will always be a hospital placed within that Palmerston area to service the future growth of the greater Darwin area but yes, the scoping study will be available for public scrutiny",246,Afford In Minchinbury In Reflecting On The Proposal To Increase The Medicare Levy I Think
287,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (20:39,"More debt, more chaos, more spin is the way toand inspection. We think that really the plans that Labor put forward really don't take into account the demographic forecast for the area satisfactorily. Does that sound like a government that is not committed to the Palmerston hospital? I do not think so. But as we know, Labor never fully explored the range of options available to ensure that the health needs of Darwin, Palmerston and the rural area were properly serviced into the future. That is why it is really important that the Giles government undertakes this scoping study, which the health minister said they are going to do. There is a lot of scaremongering that is going on in Palmerston from the Labor candidate saying that we are not committed to the Palmerston hospital. WellI put on the record that the Territory government is committed to the hospital. I am a member of the coalition and I have always been committed to the hospital. What we have got to remember is that the $70 million that was promised by the Gillard Labor government for a hospital is actually not enough money. You cannot build a hospital for $70 million and that is why the scoping study is absolutely important. As I said, I have always been committed to the Palmerston hospital because I live in Palmerston. I was at the very first community meeting when the idea of the hospital was first conceived. SoI want to assure people of Darwin and Palmerston that the hospital is not at risk despite the scaremongering that the Labor candidate is putting out into people's letterboxes. Please, do not be deceived by Labor's scaremongering. The Palmerston hospital is not at risk. I would like to move now to something that is at risk. My colleagues and the chief minister asked me to raise the road funding that the Northern Territory received from this Gillard Labor government's budget because the 2013 federal budget, particularly the Nation Building Program 2, was terrible for the Northern Territory in a number of ways. Firstly, the overall allocation was down by almost 50 per cent. This was evidenced by the NBP 2 being cut by almost 50 per cent from the Nation Building Program 1. Nation Building Program1 totalled $474 million for the period 2008-09 to 2012-13. The NBP 2 totalled $244 million, which equates to a cut of $230 million. This, as anyone would expect, is a massive blow to the Northern Territory's road infrastructure budget for civil construction and for the transport industry. This could also potentially lead to job losses because the Northern Territory simply cannot afford to carry the burden. The Australian government should carry its share of commitments. The second point I would like to make is that the NBP2 spend is pushed out into the later years of the program. The government are making out that they are spending all this money now, but $183.6 million, which is about 75 per cent of the spend, is not available until the 2016-17 financial year. This makes some of the key projects difficult, and one of them is in my electorate-the duplication of the Tiger Brennan Drive from Woolner to Berrimah Road. The regional roads productivity program is potentially impacted. But, despite that, the minister for infrastructure flew into Darwin with the Labor candidates-and it was like: 'We're spending all this money', as if it was going to happen tomorrow. But Territorians are smarter than that. They know that this government is leading them up the garden path and that this money is not going to be available until 2016-17. Unfortunately, the Giles government have to stump up their part of this expenditure now. They are suffering because the former Territory Labor government left them with $5.5 billion worth of debt. So, financially, it is quite difficult for the Territory government to stump up the money straight away. I am surprised that Minister Snowdon was not able to get Minister Albanese to fund some of these projects, because some of the projects that I want to talk about are in his electorate of Lingiari. There is no new capital expenditure for the Australian government road network, and this is despite the Northern Territory government submitting an infrastructure program worth around $522 million. These projects are largely in Minister Snowdon's electorate. There is $40 million for flood immunity for the Saddle, Mathieson and Sandy creeks on the Victoria Highway; $70 million for safety and fatigue management, including truck parking bays; intersections and safety treatment to the Katherine River bridge; upgrading of the Stuart Highway from Dixon to the MVR in Alice Springs, which is actually in Minister Snowdon's electorate; $125 million for strengthening and widening the National Highway for the Stuart, Barkly and Victoria highways; and $180 million for ongoing repairs and maintenance for the national network. So what did the Northern Territory get? Zip. Nothing. There was no money whatsoever for a capital expenditure upgrade. I am disappointed. I would have thought that Minister Snowdon would have been able to do something, but obviously he did not. But I can assure you that our candidate, Tina MacFarlane, will fight for Territorians. She knows what these roads are like. She is up and down and driving around on them. She is a pastoralist from Mataranka. She knows that these roads need work, and she will stand there and fight for Territorians. As I said, the NT did get some funding, but it will not be available until 2016-17. Also, as I said, we have had Minister Albanese and all the other ministers visit my electorate. You would be surprised, member for Durack, that they do not let us know that they are coming, yet they spruik all this money that they are going to spend. We have some other projects which the Northern Territory missed out on. They include: $40 million for the sealing of the Tanami Road; $80 million for local roads; $20 million for Gapuwiyak; $25 million for Ramingining; $10 million to seal the road from Ali Curung to the Stuart Highway; $25 million to seal the Kintore Road from Papunya to the Derwent river crossing; $20 million for upgrading the Galiwinku Highway from a Galiwinku to Gawa; $40 million to extend the seal on the Outback Way towards Harts Range and some other roads; and $10 million to commence sealing the Buntine Highway to Lajamanu. These are decent projects, and they are all in Minister Snowdon's electorate. I am not sure what has happened. It is also important to point out that there is no money to repair and maintain the Australian government highway network. The NT government asked for $128 million and received with $52.8 million. As I said, our candidate, Tina MacFarland, would put up a fight. I think Minister Snowdon has just let it go down. I know Senator Crossin would have been in there fighting. She is a good representative of the Territory, but unfortunately Labor are not listening to her and will let her go, which is very is disappointing. The Chief Minister also wanted me to point out that the $128 million is desperately needed to repair and maintain our road pavements due to growth, to adverse weather and to ageing. The concern is that less funding will lead to rapid deterioration in some sections of the national network and dollars will have to be diverted to high-priority areas to ensure accessibility and stability. That is the Northern Territory government's prerogative but it is disappointing that the Northern Territory government sought $128 million after good, wellcosted funding, but basically they have been ignored. This is not the first time this issue has been raised. I know my colleague Senator Scullion had similar concerns last budget, and now we are doing this again. This reduction in funding comes despite sections of the Stuart Highway from Darwin to Katherine being labelled 'high risk' and some of the worse road conditions in Australia by the AANT. It is alarming that the need for upgrading is being ignored. As I said, they are all in Minister Snowdon's electorate. Maybe they are going to use some of the money already put away, member for Durack, the $430-odd million that was stashed away in the budget on announcements that have not been made. Mr Haase: Secret announcements. risk mapping report indicates that the Darwin to Pine Creek section of the Sturt Highway is the highest risk section of the national highway on which to travel in Australia. That is nothing for the Gillard Labor government to be proud of. In addition, the AusRAP star ratings report also shows that over 50 per cent of the Northern Territory section of the Stuart Highway rates at only one and two stars. The Darwin to Pine Creek section of the Stuart Highway is a significant part of the substandard section. Urgent investment is needed to improve the Darwin to Pine Creek section of the Stuart Highway. This was submitted with submissions from the Northern Territory government, but the Gillard Labor government and Minister Snowdon have obviously ignored this information. As I said, I know that our candidate, Tina MacFarland, would fight for funding to ensure that roads in Lingiari are well serviced. Having substandard roads is not good, so I am appalled that the Gillard Labor government has chosen to ignore Territorians. They need to focus more attention on our roads. As I said, this is not the first time that expenditure for Northern Territory roads has been raised in this place. My colleague senator Scullion has raised many times in the other place, during his tenure as a senator, expenditure on road funding and how important it is to ensure that the national highway framework is maintained for safety. The Stuart Highway is the only way into the Northern Territory by road. If that highway is not maintained, it will be detrimental for Territorians. uncertainty in the world economy, where Eurozone countries have significant debt and double digit unemployment in some countries, with unemployment in some countries well above 15 per cent, with youth unemployment close to a quarter of some youth populations and the unemployment and uncertain outlook in the United States. When we look to some of our major trading partners where we have traditionally looked for growth opportunities, certainly there is significant uncertainty there as well. So there is a difficult global environment and a difficult domestic environment in which to frame a budget, with a drop-off in projected revenues of over $16 billion over the budget period. Within this very difficult environment to frame a budget and to ensure that we keep the Australian economy moving forward, I think the Treasurer has to be commended for the job that he has done. Australia stands alone in the developed world, with record low unemployment with a five in front of it, interest rates at a historic low and low inflation. The economy still continues to grow, but we know that the growth is both fragile and uneven. There are many areas throughout the nation that are not enjoying the benefits of the boom in",250,Afford In Minchinbury In Reflecting On The Proposal To Increase The Medicare Levy I Think
288,Mrs Griggs,"Yes, secret announcements. It is concerning that the most recent AusRAP",253,Afford In Minchinbury In Reflecting On The Proposal To Increase The Medicare Levy I Think
289,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (20:54,"This has been a difficult budget to frame with the resources sector, particularly in areas that have a higher than average exposure to trade and to the impacts of the record high Australian dollar. Within this context, the priority of this budget has been jobs, ensuring that Australians are kept in jobs and that businesses are keeping the doors open. If we had to make a choice between bringing the budget into surplus and ensuring that we had people in work and businesses open, we chose the latter, and we did that unashamedly. They are our priorities. They are Labor priorities. Our national outlook is positive and bright, but it does not mean that we can lose our focus on measures to ensure that economic participation is maximised and that those who need it are supported by a strong safety net of government services and social support. We are well situated to build on our record of resilience over the past five years. Over 950,000 jobs have been created under Labor. There are more people in work today than at any other time in our nation's history. We have a triple-A credit rating by all three major global agencies. We are one of only eight countries to achieve that with a stable outlook. Our economy is more than 13 per cent bigger than it was when we came into government. As I said, we have contained inflation. We have record low interest rates and strong public finances. With the 2013-14 budget, the government made a choice to keep our economy strong and to invest in the future. It is a budget that responds to the current economic circumstances and continues to support jobs and growth. For members like me, for Labor members, supporting the growth of employment is one of the principal reasons for being in this place and for advocating the policies of the government in my electorate. Jobs give our lives dignity and a way forward. A job gives us the ability to imagine a future with a family and a home of our own. Budgets are about choices. They involve choices about priorities and about what to spend and where to save, but they are much more than an aggregate of those decisions. At the core of this budget is a choice about our future. It brings together Labor values with the circumstances that we find ourselves in. So, while the economic circumstances before us are unlike any that any government before has faced, our approach to the budget remains embedded in those core principles. No government, as the Treasurer says, gets to choose the global economic circumstances in which the budget is framed, but we do get to choose our priorities as a nation. We have prioritised two Labor initiatives in this budget: firstly, the Gonski school education reforms, which are about ensuring that every child at every school has a quality education and every school has the resources to deliver that education; and, secondly, ensuring that the National Disability Insurance Scheme disability care is funded so that the lottery of life and how you acquire a disability do not determine whether you have the appropriate medical and other care to meet your needs throughout the course of your life. Those two priorities are very well supported in the community, prioritised in this budget and funded and accounted for in this budget. They are something that people will look upon in decades to come and say, 'Thank God that a government'-this Labor government-'had the courage and the foresight to instigate those reforms.' The challenge for government is to manage the process of economic transformation. These transitions are never seamless. Our economy does not exist in a vacuum. They are taking place against a backdrop of a global economy undergoing profound change. Nominal GDP growth has fallen below real GDP growth in through-the-year terms over the past three quarters. This is unprecedented in the 50-year history of our national accounts. It is largely due to the combination of the sustained high dollar in the face of lower terms of trade. This scenario makes it tougher for exporters, who receive less for what they sell and, in an attempt to keep their profits up, push back on suppliers, often paying less than they would in better times. Everyone is seeking to cut their costs. This has an impact on margins and on jobs. It is also hard on those domestic firms that compete with imports that have become cheaper, in some instances over 40 per cent cheaper, over the last two years. Nationally the task of Labor in government is to build a strong yet fair economy. Good economic management just does not grow the economy; it ensures the growth is enjoyed by the maximum number of people. In my electorate, in the Illawarra in the Southern Highlands, just like in other areas of Australia like Geelong and Broadmeadows, our economy is dealing with the impact of the high Australian dollar on manufacturing. In the Illawarra we feel the brunt of these economic circumstances. While our local economy is undergoing its own transformation from traditional manufacturing to a growth in service sector employment, manufacturing still strongly underpins our economy. One in 10 jobs remain within this sector. It is good news that the Australian government is strongly backing the Illawarra and highlands economy through this economic transformation. First and foremost, the Labor government is investigating $1 billion to support and grow jobs. This billion-dollar investment will significantly boost Australian manufacturing, including in the greater Illawarra and beyond. Our plan for Australian jobs has three core strategies: backing Australian firms to win more work at home, supporting Australian industry to increase exports and win business abroad, and helping Australian small and medium sized businesses to create and grow new jobs. In addition, the $30 million Illawarra Region Innovation and Investment Fund is helping to attract new industries to the region. This fund has leveraged $62 million in project investment, and there are some truly great success stories coming out of this investment. There is new investment in communication manufacturing equipment that is being used on the rollout of the National Broadband Network, and new investment in computer system and design. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesProceedings suspended from 21:02 to 21:17 Fund has led to significant new investment and investment in the pipeline, including new food manufacturing, innovative printing facilities and a new mental health facility, just to name a few. These are important investments to help an economy transition. Of course, it is added to by the fact that the National Broadband Network is being rolled out quicker and in greater density in the Illawarra and Southern Highlands region than in any other area in the country. This will be the game changer for the Illawarra. The Illawarra and Southern Highlands is laying the foundations we need to build a stronger economy now and for the future. And it will be based on six key assets. First is our skilled and talented local workforce, with expertise gained from over 100 years of experience in engineering manufacturing and mining. Second is the rollout of the National Broadband Network, as I have mentioned, which will connect our region to the markets of the world and enhance the development of new industries, and transform the way we live, work and play.",253,Afford In Minchinbury In Reflecting On The Proposal To Increase The Medicare Levy I Think
290,Mr Stephen Jones,"As I was saying, the Illawarra Region Innovation and InvestmentThird is the University of Wollongong, which serves the region and the country by producing world-class professionals in medicine, law, education, engineering and information technology. In fact, one quarter of all information and communication technology graduates in Australia come from the University of Wollongong. The government has put over $100 million investment into capital works at the university and there is more investment in the pipeline. Fourth, there is the Port Kembla harbour, which gives the potential to develop a freight transport and logistics hub for the region. The Australian government's $25.5 million investment in preconstruction work and engineering work on the Maldon-Dumbarton rail link is helping to make this potential a future reality. The Maldon-Dumbarton rail link would connect Port Kembla to the major mines and freight corridors of the Central-West and Western Sydney. It can also take pressure off the Sydney-Wollongong passenger line by removing some of the freight off that line. Fifth, we are blessed with a wonderful natural environment: our stunning beaches, rolling green hills and magnificent escarpments all provide an impressive backdrop to our daily lives in the Illawarra region. Not only that, but our cultural diversity and strong arts and sporting culture is a part of the foundation for future opportunities in tourism, sports and other economic development. Finally our services sector: the health and aged-care services are rapidly expanding. Indeed, the largest employer in the region is now community services and health. The Illawarra is an attractive and affordable destination for retirees and our potential to develop a seniors economy is significant. I have spoken before in this place about the need to ensure that our local manufacturers and local workers get a fair share of the enormous opportunities that are being generated by Australia's mining and resources boom. I welcome the fact that earlier today we had the opportunity to debate our plan for Australian jobs-and that passed through the House of Representatives. This is an important piece of legislation which will connect the manufacturers, the fabricators, the industries and workshops within my electorate and right around the country to the benefits of the mining boom, providing work and opportunities now and into the future. I would like to say something about the debate that is raging at the moment about the use of 457 visas. There has been some speculation about widespread rorts within the scheme. We do not need to do a forensic analysis of this to know that there is something wrong when I have got workers in my electorate who say they have applied for jobs in businesses and have been turned back only to know that overseas workers have been brought in on 457 visas to fill the jobs that they are ready, willing and able to do. I think it is wrong and I do this on the basis of an understanding that well over one quarter of the workforce of my electorate has come to the Illawarra and surrounding regions from another country. At another time they came to work in the steelworks, the mines and the services industry within the Illawarra so there is no objection to workers coming from overseas to work here. In fact, my electorate was founded on that. But you have something that is very wrong when you have workers who are ready, willing and able to stand up and take a job and they are being overlooked by employers, those very same employers who are coming to government and saying, 'We want the right to access to 457 visa workers to do these jobs.' Close to five or six years ago, the Leader of the Opposition referred to workers as job snobs if they would refuse employment with one business because they thought it was not good enough for them. Well, we run the risk of some employers being the new job snobs by the fact that they are overlooking local workers to hire workers from overseas-and that is simply not good enough. I have been pressing the immigration minister to introduce new measures to ensure a local work test is put in place for these workers. I am particularly concerned about workers who have been thrown out of lifelong employment and they are now in their 50s, seeking work and are willing to travel for work and they feel that they are being discriminated against in their search for work in this regard. I am hopeful that the minister of immigration will respond to this and ensure that a new test is put into place to ensure employers must test the local labour market and must offer available positions to local appropriately skilled workers before they turn to the government and ask the government to approve 457 visas in this regard. It is a good budget and it deserves our support in difficult times. (Time expired) Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (21:24): I am pleased to talk about Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014. Australia is now at a significant crossroads. Without sounding too pessimistic, I think we must seriously be at a point where we sink or swim. I have previously described the looming federal election as one of the most definitive of our time. I say this in light of the delivery of the Treasurer's sixth deficit budget, one which was promised to be in surplus-and we had heard that more than 600 times. I highlight the importance of this year's election not to be alarmist but to highlight that Australia has choice to make. The first choice is a Labor government that is obsessed with retaining power at any cost. It has no clear direction or plan to fix its mistakes. It has decimated the northern cattle industry. It is driving industry and jobs offshore. It has been hijacked by the extreme Left and is leading this nation down the path of economic ruin. The other choice is a coalition government, which I would be proud to be a part of, that stands ready to let business and industry do what they do best and to get out of their way. It will provide a stable environment for investments to create jobs. It will ease the cost of living by getting rid of the confidence-crushing taxes such as the carbon tax. It will end the border protection failures, get better communications to our regions sooner and make Australia strong again. The Treasurer's presentation of the budget during the last sitting period said it all. His delivery was flat, dejected and unenthusiastic. To me this suggests one thing: the government is out of ideas. The signs are there, and the Gillard government has been repeatedly warned by the people, the businesses and industry. Those signs are evident. Budget deficits are normal since Labor came to power in 2007. In 2008-09 we had a $27 billion deficit; in 2009-10, a $54.5 billion deficit; in 2010-11, a $47.5 billion deficit; in 2011-12, a $43.4 billion deficit; and in 2012-13, a $19.4 billion deficit, which was supposed to be a surplus. And we have projections for 2013-14 of an $18.8 billion deficit and for 2014-15 of an $11 billion deficit. Our gross debt is to sail past $300 billion in the forward estimates. The Treasurer has lost control of his spending and forecasts and now wants to pass the blame on to the Treasury. Both large and small businesses continue swimming in red and green tape. There are plenty of local examples of small businesses in Flynn that are struggling to survive. There is a twospeed economy in Central Queensland towns. Smaller employers who are not directly involved in the mining or gas industries are losing their workers to the higher paid mining and gas jobs. Chinese growth continues to plateau, affecting our commodity prices, and we do not know what is around the corner there. However, we hope that commodity prices will bounce back and I hope that we are a part of supplying China and other parts of Asia with these commodities. There has been $100 billion worth of resource projects shelved or scrapped. I refer to the project in your electorate, Deputy Speaker Scott, for Wandoan coal which was proposed by Xstrata. That involved not only the mine at Wandoan but several other coal projects which would have use the railway link line to Banana and then on to the Wiggins Island project at Gladstone. These plans have all been shelved. We face fierce competition from countries in Africa, from Indonesia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan, which is a rising commodity supplier, and also from Canada and countries in South America. The high Australian dollar has also affected most of our exports; however, in the last few days we have seen it starting to fall as the United States dollar picks up. The car industry, as we all know, is on the brink. The steel industry cannot compete with overseas prices; labour costs are too high for the productivity of the workforce. Trade tariffs are now working against us. For example, beef into Japan and Korea and dairy products into China have all been affected by the trade tariffs that are placed upon our products being exported into those Asian countries. This fact needs to be addressed ASAP. Our cement industry is fighting hard against imports. In fact, they cannot produce at the same price at which cement can be brought into Australia. The pig industry struggles to survive without subsidies while the countries from which we import our pig products subsidise their own products. So our pig farmers are behind the eight ball at the very start. The fishing industry is another industry of concern, since 70 per cent of the fish we eat is from overseas. This is a disgrace considering we are an island nation with water all around us. Coal, coal seam gas and iron ore companies are struggling to keep existing mines and plants open. The setting up of new greenfield sites in any of the industries I have just named is getting harder and less attractive by the day-and, of course, that is why $100 billion of projects have been scrapped or shelved. Deutsche Bank's analysts of BHP and Rio Tinto coal operations in Australia have highlighted that operating costs have gone up some 320 per cent since 2005. The mining tax and the dreaded carbon tax have stifled existing businesses and households in Australia and sent our cost of living through the roof. By world standards we are a high cost country to live in. The tourism industry is impacted by the inflated cost of living. Industrial relations legislation must become fairer and more flexible to help kick-start the economy. Those are some of the problems which, as I see it, we face as Australians. These are suggested solutions. No longer can this country afford a government which lacks direction and commitment to ensuring that we are well placed to deal with the challenges we face in a globalised economy. Everything is global these days. We are in the global export market. We must be competitive with other countries, but this is where we are falling behind. We need to refocus our attention on regional Australia and the valuable contribution which regional Australia makes and will continue to make in the future. We need a speedy resolution to trade agreements with South Korea and others in the Asia-Pacific basin to ensure that the cattle industry has every chance to become competitive in the global market. Our primary producers need their federal representatives to get off their backs and stop pandering to the extreme left. We need to unleash the potential of small, medium and big business by repealing thousands of regulations which have been imposed on them since 2007. This will give them the confidence to reinvest, encourage their children to carry on with the businesses and give them the confidence to employ. The current NBN, especially in rural areas throughout Flynn, is a rank failure by anyone's standard. At the current rate of the rollout, it will be 100 years before the job is done. If you look on the NBN website, you will see that Gladstone, which is a major industrial town in Queensland, and Emerald to the west are barely on the radar. How will they get NBN services? It is quite strange to think that an NBN fibre-optic cable goes past the doors of Emerald, Monto and Mundubbera. The NBN fibre-optic cable has been put in by a private company called Leighton yet sits there in the trenches unused. It is a strange one indeed, and I cannot get to the bottom of the intended future of this fibre-optic cable. By contrast, the coalition NBN will cost far less, provide a benchmark of 25 megabits per second and hit the regions first, which is good for my area. And all this will be done across Australia by 2016. The coalition can get rid of the carbon tax, which will ease the cost of living for families, take pressure off businesses and industry, and generate more confidence in the economy. We will also act responsibly and decisively to pay down the government debt. The $300 billion gross debt is costing us $20 million a day every day with interest. Seven days worth of interest would have paid for the Calliope Crossroads. For less than 20 days worth, the Yeppen flood plain upgrade would have been fully funded. One day's worth of interest could have paid for the high school at Calliope. We have to rein in debt to ensure that the essential overdue schemes like the NDIS are fully funded and achieve exactly what they need to achieve to fulfil our social obligations to people living with disability and their carers. This is just the tip of the iceberg. When it comes to a coalition government, we will further the cause of the Australian people, not just in the cities but in the regions, which are the backbone of the country. I hear it every day back home in Flynn: even those who do not support me believe that we need change and that something has to give. In Central Queensland, people simply want government to govern responsibly, to protect them and, for the most part, to stay out of their lives. Flynn is a diverse electorate, rich with a buffet of industries and environmental assets that are the envy of the rest of the country. The region has so much potential, but it has been overlooked and neglected time and time again. So many budget deficits in a row stand testament to a government that is not capable of handling the change that is taking place in Flynn right now. Most of all, we have a government, a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who will not listen to the people of Australia. They plough on regardless, unaware that our economy is not good and needs urgent, radical change. I will take the last minute or so to talk about the V457s, as were mentioned by the member for Throsby. It is a difficult situation, and I have this problem in my area, but I can tell the House that without V457s our meat works in Rockhampton and Biloela would not be able to survive, nor would some of our citrus farms along the Burnett or in the Emerald region. We also make sure that those companies who bring in 457s make sure that Australians are always offered the jobs first. That is what we all stand by: jobs for Australians first. But, if we cannot get those people to come out of the cities, cities like Bundaberg, then we must import labour; otherwise, the fruit will go rotten on the ground, the cattle will not be processed, and the whole economy could grind to a halt. Sitting suspended from 21:39 to 21:44 Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (21:44): The Labor government is making it more difficult for Australian labour to work. Just because the government is not working, either together or at all, should not mean that more ordinary Australians find themselves out of work. The budget, as handed down by Treasurer Swan, is a fairy tale. It makes assumptions so sanguine as to be wilfully and recklessly optimistic. On every measure of revenue forecasting presented before the House, time and again the Treasurer has been not just wrong but hopelessly wrong. Our country needs to get back to the sensible position of a Costello discount. Let's take the Treasury forecast and reduce the expected revenue by a certain amount and increase the outlays by a certain percentage, therefore building a more realistic margin for safety. Treasury may be wrong once-but six years in a row? And for Labor to countenance that exuberance is shameful. Where good governments like those of Howard and Hawke found a way, the Gillard government finds an excuse. It is indicative of the government more generally that today one reads of how 25,000 refugees will be taken in-an overshoot five times that of the initial estimate. Why budget for the most optimistic in the pricing of carbon, as is the case when pricing carbon at $25 a tonne, and compensate people for that amount? This is when the price for that same carbon in Europe-the only market where carbon is freely traded-is less than a quarter of the price that is banked on by the government. Moreover, it is doubly important to observe the carbon price in this market, because it is this market to which our futures are tied. Today the carbon price in Europe is, as I said, approximately one quarter that of what the government has estimated and has budgeted for-approximately 75 per cent out. That is a long way out! Revenue inflows to the Labor government in the year to May 2013 have actually increased by 7.6 per cent-twice the rate of CPI, twice the rate that most people would fairly award themselves. Yet in spite of this generous increase Labor cannot balance the books. The notorious MRRT has to date raised $126 million gross-some 90 per cent below projected figures. That tax is somehow, and quite miraculously, going to realise an 800 per cent increase in inflow in two years time. Perhaps this is overly optimistic, or perhaps the Treasurer knows something the rest of us do not, because for the majority of voters in my electorate the opinion is that these actions remind them of the actions of a troubled gambler-hoping that their luck will turn, and betting all on black. One of the most significant problems I have with this budget is that it does not make any attempt to rectify the overwhelming time bomb that is rapidly increasing structural deficit. Think of a jug with a hole. Our economy has holes and we are leaking value. It is time-not to create new and bigger holes, but to start to repair those holes. That is what is needed. And the coalition is the only party with the vision and the intestinal fortitude to commission such a systemic structural performance evaluation and, critically, see those findings implemented. When I speak of structural deficits I mean layers of spending and policy commitments that cannot be rolled back. And if they can be rolled back then they cannot be undone quickly. It is starting with negative numbers before the country even opens for business. I am deeply concerned because I see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to seize on unprecedented and unrepeatable economic advantages to lock in prosperity for our unborn generations. Instead of locking in prosperity on a sensible and sustained basis, this Labor government is spending everything, selling everything and borrowing to do it. The mantra of the rich, as is decoded from books such as Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad, is to buy assets, not liabilities. Yet this Labor government is bent only on buying liabilities and is selling our national strategic assets to do such. That is the case in regard to ports and geographic strategic defence installations. But so too it extends to food production and the sustainability of access to fresh produce. Unfunded commitments are myopic and immoral. They are in essence Labor, pure Labor. That is what will pay for Gillard's gold: your labour. Our people need and deserve a government that is willing and capable of implementing policy that has been benchmarked against the best in the world. Aspiration and ambition need to return to the heart of government following on such salutary examples as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund highlight pathways for secure and sustained development in the interests of all citizens. It is time. It is insulting and wrong that a government of the Australian people at this time in history tear up the rich tapestry of our national character, a fair go. Australia is by definition the place to have a go. This attack can be seen ever so clearly in the affairs of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship under Labor. How can one say it is fair or august or necessary that visa application fees increased by nearly 200 per cent in the space of 15 months? The obvious example being the much maligned 457 visa with the cost of applying having risen from $350 to $450 and now to $900 from 1 July-all in the space of 15 months. Labor is unwilling to do the heavy lifting for the good of the country. Labor in power is the very worse of politics-that is, serving personal interest over national interest. It is not in Labor's interest to discuss the need to broaden the taxation base vis-a-vis the GST and conduct a review including all aspects of taxation but it is in the national interest. It is not in Labor's interest to discuss the low unit productivity of employed labour in Australia but it is in the national interest. The difference between the coalition and Labor is that Labor seeks to rule and the coalition offers service. It is the difference between self-interest and the national interest. Labor prefers at all times to opt for good politics over good policy. Good policy and governance are about the right decision at the right time. But so is good governance marked by the ability to recognise better options and change as it is required. This is exactly the case when one thinks about the government's commitment to purchase up to 100 JSFs at a cost of $16 billion in this mega-spending environment where the cost and schedule of the JSF is out of control. All of this at a time when we are living in a budget emergency. Yes, it is an emergency. When the gross debt that Labor intends to reach means that the credit card for every man, woman and child in Australia is loaded up at over $15,000 each or more than $60,000 for a family of four then we have an emergency. This is when Labor started from a position left to them by the previous coalition government of money in the bank. When the Reserve Bank interest rate years after the GFC are down below levels that the Treasurer himself described as emergency levels then we have a budget emergency. When the Treasurer assured us that the deficit was temporary yet all that we have seen under Labor are deficits and if, God forbid, they won the next election all of their budgets in the next term would be budget deficits by their own reckoning then we have a budget emergency. When the bill for the interest on the national debt is over $8 billion per annum then it is an emergency. There is a bill on each Australian of $350 per year on interest alone. Putting it another way, it would be $1,400 per family of four just on interest. Think how much more productive that money would be to your family. To put this in perspective, $8 billion would pay for four Fiona Stanley hospitals. It would fully fund the entire cost of Gonski school improvements, with over $1.5 billion to spare. It would fund the blow-out in border protection for the last three years, with $2 billion to spare. In this budget, the Treasurer spoke a lot about jobs and growth, yet there was no real move to create jobs or maintain growth. The coalition is committed to lower taxes, less red tape and getting government out of your business. The world is a competitive place, and no-one owes us a living. Our place in the future is not secure. Labor wants to see Australia trundle along in the median line of the World Bank competitive index. Most shocking is our relative performance in terms of rates of rate of increase in spending, and the debt is astronomical. In fact, it is one of the highest in the world. The only way to describe this, apart from handicapping ourselves, is to describe it as antibusiness and antigrowth. Dumb policy and practice are hindering the efficacy of our public servants. Efficiency dividends are a good idea in principle, but it is difficult to see how compounding efficiency dividends can be achieved. Indeed, efficiency dividends only make sense if there are indeed improvements in efficiency-in other words, in productivity. Labor simply uses efficiency dividends without the efficiency improvement as a means to try to save some of the money that it has so flagrantly wasted. Having Labor's version of an efficiency dividend will affect the quality or delivery of services. Most importantly, its model is not sustainable or responsible. In conclusion, perhaps it is correct that the swan song budget from Labor is about jobs and growth. Getting rid of the Gillard government is good for growth and jobs: jobs in real business and the real growth of hope, reward and opportunity. Debate adjourned.
